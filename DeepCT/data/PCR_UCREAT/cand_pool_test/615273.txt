HEADNOTE Section of the Income Tax Act provides that if an Income Tax officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year he may assess or reassess such income Allowing the appeal HELD The opinion of the internal audit organization of the <ORG> on a point of law cannot be regarded as information within the meaning of of the Act Section under which an assessment may be reopened is a proceeding for assessing income which has escaped assessment The term is also defined as instruction or Knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particular or as to law relating to matter bearing on the assessment The term law is used in the sense of norms or guiding principles having legal effect and legal consequences The audit of income tax receipts having been entrusted to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India it is intended as an exercise in removing mistakes and errors in income tax records before they are submitted to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General a In every case the Income Tax officer must determine for himself what the effect and consequence of the law mentioned in the audit note are and whether in consequence of the law which has come to his notice he can reasonably believe that income had escaped assessment The error discovered by the Income Tax Officer on a reconsideration of the same material and nothing more does not give the Income Tax Officer the power to reopen the assessment What the section envisages is that the Income Tax officer must first have information in his possession and then in consequence of such information he must have reason to believe that income has escaped assessment The realisation that income has escaped assessment is covered by the words reason to believe and it follows from the information received by him The Judgement of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Can the view expressed by an internal audit party of <ORG> on a point of law be regarded as information for the purpose of initiating proceedings under section of the Income Tax Act opinion on the question has been divided among the High Courts and accordingly the present cases have been referred by <ORG> under of the Act <ORG> includes an internal audit organisation whose function it is to examine income tax records and check mistakes made therein with a view ultimately to improve the quality of assessments The Appellate Assistant Commissioner allowed the appeals filed by the assessee holding inter alia that in law it could not be said that the Income Tax officer had any information in his possession enabling him to take action under Following the view adopted by <ORG> the Tribunal held that the Income Tax officer had jurisdiction to proceed under The assessment may also be reopened under section of the Act It is a proceeding for assessing income which has escaped assessment If a the Income Tax officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return under section for any assessment year to the Income Tax officer or Lo disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year or notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in clause a on the part of the assessee the Income tax officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year he may subject to the provisions of sections to assess or reassess such income or recompute the loss or the depreciation allowance as the case may be for the assessment year concerned In so far as the word information means instruction or know ledge concerning facts or particulars there is little difficulty The internal audit organisation of <ORG> was set up primarily for imposing a check over the arithmetical accuracy of the computation of income and the determination of tax and now because of the audit of income tax receipts being entrusted to the A Comptroller and Auditor General of India from it is intended as an exercise in removing mistakes and errors in income tax records before they are submitted to the scrutiny of the Comptroller and Auditor General Audit does not consider it any part of its duty to pass in review the judgment exercised or the decision taken in individual cases by officers entrusted with those duties but it must be recognised that an examination of such cases may be an important factor in judging the effectiveness of assessment procedure The Income Tax Act does not contemplate such power in any internal audit organisation of <ORG> it recognises it in those authorities only which are specifically authorised to exercise adjudicatory functions But although an audit party does not possess the power to so pronounce on the law it nevertheless may draw the attention of the Income Tax officer to it In the present case an internal audit party of <ORG> expressed the view that the receipts from the occupation of the conference hall and rooms did not attract section of the Act and that the assessment should have been made under section In every case the Income Tax officer must determine for himself what is the effect and consequence of the law mentioned in the audit note and whether in consequence of the law which has now come to his notice he can reasonably believe that income has escaped assessment Reliance is placed on <ORG> where a Bench of two learned Judges of this Court observed that a case where income had escaped assessment due to the oversight inadvertence or mistake of the <ORG> officer must fall within section of the Indian <ORG> Act It appears to us with respect that the proposition is stated too widely and travels farther than the statute warrants in so far as it can be said to lay down that if on reappraising the material considered by him during the original assessment the <ORG> officer discovers that he has committed an error in consequence of which income has escaped assessment it is open to him to reopen the assessment That was the view taken by this Court in <ORG> supra <ORG> and Company supra and <ORG> and we do not believe that the law has since taken a different course Plainly the statutory provision envisages that the <ORG> officer must first have information in his possession and then in consequence of such information he must have reason to believe that income has escaped assessment The realisation that income has escaped assessment is covered by the words reason to believe Although the <ORG> did not enhance the valuation of the securities in the appellate proceeding because of the argument advanced by the appellant nonetheless its observations amounted to information as to the law On the considerations prevailing with us we are of opinion that the view taken by <ORG> and <ORG> in the aforementioned cases is wrong and we must with great respect hold that this <ORG> was in error in the conclusion reached by it is <ORG> merely followed its earlier judgment in Commissioner of Income Tax <NAME> supra and <ORG> was impressed by the same reasons substantially which persuaded <ORG> and <ORG> in the cases referred to above nature and scope of the functions of the internal audit organisation of <ORG> are co extensive with that of Receipt Audit or on the basis of the provisions specifically detailing its functions in the Internal Audit Manual we hold that the opinion of an internal audit party of <ORG> on a point of law cannot be regarded as information within the meaning of section of the Income Tax Act The question referred by <ORG> is answered in the negative in favour of the assessee and against the <ORG> The assessee is entitled to one set of costs in these appeals
