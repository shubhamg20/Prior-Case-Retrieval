For the first time <ORG> in exercise of powers conferred by provisions of Article of the Constitution of India framed the rules called Maharashtra Sales Tax Inspectors Recruitment Rules for short Rules which came into force September Appointment to the posts of Sales Tax Inspectors shall be made either a by promotion of suitable clerks in the Sales Tax Depart ment who have passed at least Part of the Departmental Ex amination prescribed for the Sales Tax Inspector or for the Higher Clerical staff in <ORG> or who have been exempted from passing the Departmental Examination prescribed for Sales Tax Inspectors or for the High Clerical Staff Provided that the Clerks who have passed Part I of the Departmental Examination for Sales Tax Inspector and who have been promoted to the posts of Sales Tax Inspectors are required to pass Part II of the Departmental Examination for Sales Tax Inspector also according to the rules made in that behalf failing which they shall be liable to be reverted The ratio shall not apply to temporary vacancies not exceeding one year which may be filled by promotion The said Rules were called Maharashtra Civil Services Regulation of Seniority Rules for short Rules Provided further that the service if any rendered by him as a result of a fortuitous appointment shall be excluded in computing the length of service and for the purposes of seniority he shall be deemed to have been appointed to the post in the cadre of service on the date on which his regular appointment is made in accordance with the provisions of the relevant recruitment rules Deemed date means the date assigned to a Government servant in accordance with the provisions of Rub Direct recruit means in relation to any post cadre or service a person appointed by nomination thereto fortuitous appointment means a temporary appointment made pending a regular appointment in accordance with the provisions of the relevant recruitment rules Promotee means In relation to any post cadre or service a Government servant appointed thereto by promotion from a lower post cadre or service The State of Maharashtra again in exercise of its powers conferred by Article of the Constitution of India carried out the amendments to the Rules We may reproduce the relevant amendments to Rules and which read as under in Rule of the Maharashtra Civil Services Regulation of Seniority Rules hereinafter referred to as the principle rules in sub rule in the second proviso after the words a fortuitous appointment the following shall be inserted namely except in a case where the competent authority certifies that it was not expedient possible or practicable to make a regular ap pointment strictly in accordance with the ratio of recruitment as prescribed in the relevant recruitment rules with the brief reason recorded therefor The contention raised on behalf of the promotees appellants is that the quota rule was broken down and as a result thereof the promotees were required to be appointed in view of the exigencies of service and if so appointed their promotions cannot be termed as for tuitous temporary ad hoc and that they will be entitled to earn the seniority and placement in the impugned seniority list from the date they were so promoted and working as STIs As against this the contention raised on behalf of the direct recruits was that the promotees who were promoted appointed in the vacancies falling in the quota of direct recruits such promotions of the promotees were fortuitous in excess of their quota and notwithstanding that they were so appointed and working as STIs in the vacancies reserved for direct recruits as per the quota rule they cannot get the seniority from the date of promotion or officiation and that they will get their placement in the seniority list in accordance with their quota i and until they are accommodated in their quota as regular promotees their date of promotion or officiation will not be counted for the purposes of fixing their seniority vis a vis direct recruits According to the State of Maharashtra the promotions given to the promotees in excess of quota were temporary ad hoc and or stop gap arrangement without reckoning the period of their officiation as STIs for the purposes of fixing their seniority The promotees strongly relied upon circular issued by the govern ment on nd September regarding the seniority of <ORG> with reference to the rules and principles of seniority between the promotees and direct recruits There is a dispute as regards the correct reading and inter pretation of this certificate dated st February The impugned judgment principally proceeded on the footing that the contentions raised by the appellants were barred by principle of res judicata in view of the earlier decision of the <ORG> <ORG> rendered on rd September whereunder the seniority list dated April came to be quashed The <ORG> gave the findings on merits in order to avoid the order of remand in the event the higher court comes to the conclusion that the contentions raised by the appellants in Before we deal with the rival contentions on merits it would be appropriate to set out relevant contentions and the findings recorded thereof by the <ORG> <ORG> in its judgment dated September as to whether the contentions raised in the present proceedings are barred by res judicata constructive res judicata The principle of res judicata is sought to be applied on the footing that the identical contentions were raised in Transfer Petition No of and therefore such contentions cannot be re agitated in the present QA To this A four more promotees got themselves impleaded as interveners and filed their counter affidavit opposing the said The contention raised on behalf of direct recruits was that the promo tions given to the promotees in excess of their quota as laid down in the Rules be treated as fortuitous beyond their prescribed quota The <ORG> while coining to the above conclusions noticed that there was no material on record to indicate that the quota rule was broken down and therefore the promotions given to the promotees in excess of quota rule will have to be treated as regular promotions and not being fortuitous ad hoc temporary stop gap arrangement We do not see any reason to so restrict the scope and meaning of the expression as far as practicable An equally unsustainable contention was raised on behalf of the appellant that the aforesaid finding is per incuriam and as such the prin ciple of res judicata will have no application It was then contended on behalf of the appellants that neither the recruitment rules of nor the seniority rules of provided for carrying forward the vacancies falling in either category Neither the contesting respondents nor the appellants ever raised this contention at any stage of the proceedings in Transfer Petition No of It was then contended on behalf of the appellants that in the year the Recruitment Rules were amended and as per the amended rules cases where appointments are not made strictly in accordance with the ratio of recruitment as prescribed in the Rules such appointments will not be fortuitous appointments if the competent authority certified that it was not expedient possible or practicable to make a regular appointment strictly in accordance with the ratio In support of this submission reliance was placed on the certificate dated st February issued by <ORG> in terms of the amended Rules It was contended by Mr <NAME> the learned Senior Counsel that the petitioners in Case No of sued the respondent Nos and in a representative capacity and therefore the law laid down by the <ORG> Bombay Bench in Transfer Petition No of must bind all the promotees who are similarly situated This contention raised on behalf of appellants was negatived by the <ORG> in its impugned judgment and held that the said Transfer Petition by the direct recruits was in the representative capacity We see no reason to doubt the findings of the <ORG> in this behalf which is supported by Mr <NAME> Lastly it was contended on behalf of the appellants that some of the appellants have put in more than years of service when few of the direct recruits were either schooling and or not born in the cadre Thus we concur with the findings recorded by the <ORG> on the issue of res judicata and consequently the A No A of will have to be dismissed on this ground alone for the reasons recorded herein above It is expressly made clear that this judgment is confined to the seniority list as on st December and no more In view of the aforesaid discussion we find no merit in this appeal and the same is dismissed This writ petition was filed by the first respondent <NAME> the Sales Tax Inspector for short STI on behalf of himself and other similarly situated STIs who were promoted to the posts of STIs prior to September The posts of STIs are filled up by promotion as well as nomination in equal ratio While determining the seniority of such absorbed employees vis a vis the employees in <ORG> working on the post of Senior Clerks the Govern ment of Maharashtra <ORG> by Resolution dated June determined the norms of fixation of the seniority and it reads thus So far as terms and conditions regarding fixation of seniority are concerned the seniority of the revenue staff in the post of absorp tion should be fixed from the date from which such persons are working regularly in the equated posts prior to their absorption for all purposes including promotions confirmation etc The said order also recites that the seniority of the <ORG> staff in the post of absorption will be separately fixed from the date from which such persons were working regularly in the equated posts prior to their absorption for all purposes including promotions confirmations etc From the material placed on record it is noticed that the employees who were initially working in <ORG> and were absorbed in <ORG> were making representations to <ORG> to reckon their seniority in the cadre of STIs by taking into account their service seniority in the cadre of Senior Clerk in their parent department The appellants herein and also the respondents to contested the claim of the first respondent on the ground that in view of the decision of the Government to absorb the Senior Clerks <NAME> <NAME> Entertainment Duty Inspectors etc In the result the appeal to stand dismissed with costs
