to an employee at the rate of fifteen days wages based on the rate of wages last drawn by the employee concerned provided that in the case of a piece rated employee daily wages shall be computed on the average of the total wages received by him for a period of three months Before <ORG> the <ORG> sought to defend the said provisions on the ground that the impugned provisions were made for the payment of extra wages It was stated further that considering objects and reasons of the Shops Act it was apparent that there was no conflict between the Payment of Gratuity Act and the Shops Act <ORG> thereafter noted that the unamended provisions of Sections and of the Act had been challenged earlier before <ORG> and the same were declared invalid under Article of the Constitution of India on the ground that while in factories which are large in size the workers in order to earn the gratuity would have to render long and meritorious service under a scheme of Payment of gratuity prior to enactment of the Payment of Gratuity Act however the employees working in the nearby office which is much smaller in its operations would be entitled to such gratuity on rendering a mere six months of unbroken service <ORG> then relying on the judgment of <ORG> Vs <ORG> reported in AIR SC held that to treat unequals equal would amount to discrimination and held that Section had that effect On the factual aspect <ORG> observed that in fact there were number of employees who had left the service and thereafter had not been heard for a few years and as such they could not be said to have rendered any work which would entitle them to receive gratuity or service compensation It is this judgment which has fallen for our consideration in the present appeal He pointed out that <ORG> had taken the overall effect of the provisions and had come to conclusion that the provisions were unreasonable and hence unconstitutional As regards the third contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the appellant <NAME> pointed out that the Court had not made any comparisons between two legislations by two different legislatures <NAME> further pointed out that the Court had given good reasons relying on the judgment of <ORG> Union of India cited supra and <ORG> judgment in <ORG> Vs <NAME> Magistrate Suryapet and <ORG> The Learned Senior Counsel pointed out that the finding of <ORG> was that there was no evidence placed before it regarding the material placed before the President for obtaining the consent We shall collectively consider the arguments This Court then referred to the case of Workmen employed under <ORG> Vs Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation reported in Lab A as also the observations made in the case of <ORG> reported in Lab and observed in paragraph to the following effect It will be noticed from the above that even in those cases where gratuity was awarded on the employee resignation from service it was granted only after the completion of years continuous service and not merely on a minimum of years service as in the present case The Court thereafter quoted a passage in relation to Journalists Working Conditions and their Moral Rights as also from the collective agreement between <ORG> and <ORG> and ultimately found in paragraph that such provision providing for a payment of gratuity even to an employee who voluntarily resigns from service after a period of only three years was certainly unreasonable imposing unreasonable restrictions on the right of the petitioner to carry on business and was therefore liable to be struck down as unconstitutional Article provides fundamental rights to all citizens to carry on any occupation trade or business Clause thereof empowers the <ORG> to make any law imposing in the interest of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the said rights When a law has imposed restrictions on the fundamental rights what the <ORG> has to examine is the substance of the legislation without being beguiled by the mere appearance of the legislation The object of the legislation is not conclusive as to the validity of the legislation The <ORG> must lift the veil of the form and appearance to discover the true character and the nature of the legislation and every endeavour should be made to have the efficacy of fundamental right maintained and the legislature is not invested with unbounded power We therefore cannot accept the argument of the appellant that the said provision under Section is made for a classification and therefore there is no discrimination as the classification has a nexus with the object of the Act The observations are in fact adverse to the case put up by the appellant The <ORG> then made observations that the minimum qualifying service for the entitlement to the gratuity or the rate at which it was to be paid and the maximum amount payable was determined on the basis of the aforementioned factors The <ORG> then went on to observe that there was no fixed concept of gratuity or of the method of its payment and like all other service conditions the gratuity schemes could differ from establishment to establishment depending upon various factors mentioned earlier that being entirely a payment made by the employer without there being a corresponding contribution from the employee the gratuity scheme should not be so liberal as would induce the employees to change employment after employment after putting in the minimum service qualifying them to earn it <ORG> also noted that the provision was declared ultra vires on the ground that the workmen working in the factory which would be large in size are eligible to be paid gratuity on rendering long and meritorious service under the scheme of Payment of Gratuity by industrial adjudication i prior to the enactment of Payment of Gratuity Act whereas the employees of a shop or an establishment which is smaller in its operations covered under the Act will be entitled to such gratuity on rendering of minimum qualifying period of only six months unbroken service Now merely because there is a remedy to the employer under Sections and to point out reasons for not being able to have complied with Section the Section does not become a valid Section particularly when the identical provision was found to be unconstitutional in case of <ORG> Vs <NAME> Magistrate <ORG> and <ORG> It was argued by the Learned Counsel for the appellant that there could not have been a comparison between the provisions of Payment of Gratuity Act and the present provisions while deciding the constitutionality The following observations in that case were relied upon Article does not authorize the striking down of a law of one <ORG> on the ground that in contrast with a law of another <ORG> on the same subject its provisions are discriminatory nor does it contemplate a law of the <ORG> or of the <ORG> dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two enactments The sources of authority for the two statutes being different Article can have no application It may immediately be clarified that though it is true that both the laws i the Shops Act and the Payment of Gratuity Act have been passed validly under Entry of List III of the VII Schedule it is incorrect to say that <ORG> has compared the two provisions <ORG> found that instead of remedying the defects pointed out in the judgment of <ORG> Vs <NAME> Magistrate Suryapet and Ors Learned Counsel relied on a decision in <NAME> Ors Learned Counsel also relied on another decision in <NAME> Vs <NAME> Ors We could not find anything in those paragraphs which supports the contention that a mere hardship cannot be a ground for striking down a provision This Court had only shown the presumption of constitutionality and has cautioned against the light treatment being given to the subject cited supra also it was specifically observed in paragraph that the <ORG> had the requisite jurisdiction to pass appropriate Legislation which would do justice to its employees The <ORG> went on to hold that if a balance is sought to be struck down by reason of the impugned Legislation it would not be permissible for the <ORG> to declare the legislation ultra vires only because it may cause some hardships to the petitioners It was found that the concept of the year of allotment was workable and it was within the powers of the <ORG> to recruit the officers from variety of sources It was also found that the seniority awarded was on the basis of a legal fiction which had to be given its full effect We therefore reject the argument raised by the appellant This takes us to the last contention raised by the Learned Counsel for the appellant regarding the question of Doctrine of occupied field The Payment of Gratuity Act covers the field It also referred to the decision in <NAME> of Village Jamalpur Vs <NAME> reported in SCC and relying on the observations made in that judgment came to the conclusion that the State could not take aid from the provisions of Article of the Constitution It was noted by <ORG> that if the provisions of Sections are held valid then such persons who had voluntarily abandoned the service would be taking the advantage of their own wrong particularly in relation to Section The appeal has no merits and it is dismissed but without any order as to the costs
