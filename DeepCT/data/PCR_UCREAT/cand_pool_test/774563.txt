Vs RESPONDENT <NAME> AND OTHERS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH ACT Industrial Dispute Go slow by workmen Application for permission to dismiss Domestic enquiry not Proper If <ORG> can take independent evidence for finding prima facie case Mala fides and victimisation Delay in making application Effect of Industrial Disputes Act After considerable delay it made an application under of the Industrial Disputes Act for permission to dismiss these workmen There was delay in holding the domestic enquiry and the management showed lamentable callousness in this matter Again there was delay in making the application for permission to dismiss The <ORG> made several recommendations including one that go slow by workers should be treated on a par with strike As to the fact that go slow was resorted to in the factory from the midnight of February up to the February could not be and was not disputed it becomes necessary to consider the evidence on the record to examine the conclusion reached by the <ORG> that there was no deliberate go slow by any of the present respondents The charge sheets which were served on the workmen accused them not only of actual participation in the go slow but also of instigating and intimidating other workmen to go slow We shall therefore confine our attention to the appellant case that these workmen actually participated in the go Flow A complaint was made on behalf of the respondents that the charges that were given to the workmen were vague We have no hesitation however in accepting the criticism by the learned counsel for the respondents that the enquiry made by the domestic tribunal of the appellant was far from a proper enquiry as the minimum requirements of natural justice were not satisfied The persons whose reports were thus considered were present at the enquiry but even so it does not appear that the workman was given an opportunity to examine them The workman thus had not only no proper chance of knowing what was being alleged against him and by whom but also no chance of testing the correctness of the allegations that were in fact made in the written report We see no force in this contention When an application for permission for dismissal is made on the allegation that the workman has been guilty of some misconduct for which the management considers dismissal the appropriate punishment the <ORG> has to satisfy itself that there is a prima facie case for such dismissal Where there has been a proper enquiry by the management itself the <ORG> it has been settled by a number of decisions of this <ORG> has to accept the findings arrived at in that enquiry unless it is perverse and should give the permission asked for unless it has reason to believe that the management is guilty of victimisation or has been guilty of unfair labour practice or is acting mala fide But the mere fact that no enquiry has been held or that the enquiry has not been properly conducted cannot absolve the <ORG> of its duty to decide whether the case that the workman has been guilty of the alleged misconduct has been made out <ORG> held that all the evidence which might have been taken in the enquiry by the management had been led before it and it was in full possession of the facts and no question of any prejudice to the workmen arose as it would be open to it on a review of the entire evidence before it to decide whether the application for permission to dismiss should be granted or not On a consideration of that evidence the <ORG> held as regards of the workmen concerned that there was no evidence that they had taken part in the alleged misconduct of go slow or instigation to go slow It is not without significance that even though the question whether in the absence of a proper prior enquiry by the management evidence can for the first time be placed before the <ORG> in support of the alleged misconduct had been discussed in <ORG> no objection to the taking of such evidence for the first time before the <ORG> was raised before this Court on behalf of the respondent in <NAME> Case The important effect of the omission to hold an enquiry is merely this that the tribunal would not have to consider only whether there was a prima facie case but would decide for itself on the evidence adduced whether the charges have really been made out Of the six witnesses examined on behalf of the management the important evidence as regards the participation in the go slow during the period February to February is given by <NAME> Chief Engineer Kanpur the chief Chemist and <NAME> a machine man We have no hesitation in believing as correct these statements made by the Chief Engineer in his report made on February As regards <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> we have to remember that it is not disputed that there was in fact a go slow in the different jobs on which these men were engaged In the first report he said that having received information at about A that <NAME> Evaporatorman was inciting persons who were doing periodical cleaning of the Evaporators that day that they should do the cleaning slowly as if the go slow had already started in their case he immediately went to the Evaporators and questioned <NAME> about his alleged conduct and that <NAME> ultimately admitted that it was true but that he had merely been saying what others had decided We can see no reason to doubt the truth of the statements made by the Chief Chemist In addition to these <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> must be held to have actually asked others to go slow and when this fact is taken with the admitted fact that go slow was actually practiced at the stages of production where these workmen were engaged there can be no escape from the conclusion that they were guilty of active participation in go slow As regards <NAME> and <NAME> we have apart from this evidence of the Chief Chemist that they were going round the factory saying that go slow must be continued the evidence of <NAME> that on February he found these two not operating the machine and sitting there on a gunny bag and sugar was falling down from the Pugmill From this evidence of <NAME> taken with the evidence of the Chief Chemist it appears clear beyond any reasonable doubt that these two workmen <NAME> and <NAME> did also actively participate in go slow The workmen suggestion which found favor with the <ORG> was that it was because of the <ORG> activities of these workmen that the management decided to take action against them and that the allegation that they had taken part in the go slow was merely a sham excuse It appears clear that several at least of the who had been taken back were also active members of the <ORG> There is no ground for saying therefore that the management discriminated against these workmen because of the fact that they were active members of the <ORG> Before an industrial adjudication can find an employer guilty of an intention to victimise there must be reason to think that the employer was intending to punish workmen for their <ORG> activities while purporting to take action ostensibly for some other activity The reasons for asking an adjournment of the meeting were clearly mentioned in the several telegrams sent by the management to the <ORG> Commissioner and there is nothing on the record to justify a conclusion that these reasons were not true or honestly given The present application was made as late as December after an application by the workmen themselves under section of the Industrial Disputes We have therefore come to the conclusion that the <ORG> order in refusing permission to dismiss these workmen viz As the two respondents <NAME> and <NAME> are dead there is no question of granting permission now to dismiss them even though on the evidence on the record the appellant might have been entitled to permission to dismiss these two with effect from this date if they were living We accordingly allow the appeal in part and set aside the order of <ORG> in respect of these workmen named above and order that the management is granted permission to dismiss them with effect from the date of this judgment Appeal allowed in part
