Since the covenant was an independent obligation which came into operation only after the agency was terminated and was wholly unconnected with it that part of the compensation attributable to the restrictive covenant was a capital receipt not assessable to tax The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <ORG> Madras the respon dent herein hereinafter called <ORG> is a private limited company carrying on business in innumerable lines By its letter dated March the Principal gave notice to <ORG> terminating its agency from April During the assessment year the first amount was brought to tax and the assessment had become final and nothing turns upon it in these appeals At the instance of the assessee the following question was referred by the <ORG> to <ORG> at Madras for its opinion under of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter called the Act Whether the aforesaid sum of Rs The <ORG> on obtaining the necessary certificate from the <ORG> has preferred the present two appeals to this Court Mr <NAME> learned counsel for <ORG> contended that the assessee had innumerable agencies that it was a normal incident in the course of its business to give up agencies and acquire new ones that the termination of the agency in question was a normal occurrence in the course of its business that it had no impact on the earning assets or the structure of the business that the alleged restrictive covenant was only an act of grace on the part of the agent in view of the long standing relationship between the parties and that it did not enter into the calculation of the compensation paid to the assessee These appeals raise the familiar question namely whether a particular income arising from the termination of one of the agencies of a multi agency concern is a capital receipt or a revenue receipt Under an unwritten agreement which was terminable at will the appellant acted as sole agents and distributors of explosives manufactured by <ORG> That agency was terminated and by way of compensation <ORG> paid for the first three years after the termination of the agency two fifths of the commission accrued on its sales in the territory of the appellant agency computed at the rates at which the appellant had formerly been paid and in addition in the third year full commission for the sales effected in that year at the same rates The question was whether the amounts received by the appellant for those three years were of the nature of capital or revenue But on the facts of that case it came to the conclusion that the compensation paid for the loss of agency was Whether the compensation received by an assessee for the loss of agency is a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depends upon the circumstances of each case There is no reason why the said doctrine is not applicable to income tax proceedings With this background let us scrutinize the evidence in the present case The assessee did not place any material before the <ORG> to establish the relative importance of the said agency in the framework of the earning apparatus of its business it did not adduce any evidence to prove that the said agency was a pivot of its structure and that it had closed any branch or part of the establishment in consequence of the said loss There is another fallacy in this line of reasoning What remains therefore is only the fact that the assessee had innumerable agencies in different lines and that it only gave up one of them and continued to do business without any apparent mishap Mr <NAME> next contention is that on a fair reading of the correspondence that passed between the parties it should be held that the compensation given to the assessee was only in lieu of a restrictive covenant and therefore it was a capital receipt It is with regret therefore that we have to intimate our intention of transferring your agency as from the above date to <ORG> Limited and would take this opportunity of expressing to you our sincere appreciation of the valuable services you have rendered to us over a period of many years As a result of the transfer of your agency to <ORG> we propose that compensation should be paid to you on the following basis For the first three post transfer years we shall pay you two fifths of the commission accruing on annual sales in the territory of your <ORG> taken over by <ORG> such commission to be computed at the commission rates formerly paid to you Payment will be made to you after the end of each year as soon as the amount is ascertained Mr <NAME> contended that for the past valuable services the Principal expressed only sincere appreciation and for the termination of the agency and thus putting an end to the assessee future benefits it proposed to give the assessee compensation measured by the sales effected by the new agent The scope of this document cannot be appreciated ignoring the circumstances under which it came into existence The letter dated April written by the Principal to <ORG> makes the position clear The letter written by the assessee to the Principal is not on the file Appeals allowed in part
