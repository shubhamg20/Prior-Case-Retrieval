There is a route known as Bhil wara Jahazpur via Bigod Kachola diversion via Paged Mandalgarh One of the existing operators on this route filed a petition being Civil Writ No of in this Court with the result that no non temporary stage carriage permit was granted by <ORG> against the one vacancy which had arisen by the decision of <ORG> The petitioner being aggrieved against the grant of a temporary permit to respondent filed a revision under Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act hereinafter to be called the Act Respondent however by the impugned order accepted the preliminary objection of the respondent that as the petitioner could have filed an appeal under Section of the Act and as he had failed to avail of that remedy revision under Section A was not maintainable Section A provides that <ORG> may either on its own motion or on application made to it call for the record of any case in which an order has been made by <ORG> or <ORG> and in which no appeal lies and if it appears to <ORG> that the order made by <ORG> is improper or illegal <ORG> may pass such order in relation to the case as it deem fit Of course before a person can exercise the right of appeal it is essential that he should have opposed the grant of a permit It was further his case that he went away from the meeting for some private work and when he came back after some time he was informed by other operators who were present at the meeting that <ORG> had granted a temporary permit to respondent No on the petitioner route The <ORG> accordingly came to the conclusion that the petitioner brother who had a power of attorney for him was present at the meeting in which the application of respondent was being considered and had thus opportunity to object to the grant of a temporary permit to respondent but as he failed to raise any objection to the grant of a temporary permit to respondent he by his own fault failed to lay the foundation of filing an appeal against the order and therefore he could not be given any indulgence by way of revision and consequently rejected the revision petition Now admittedly it is the petitioner own case that there were only two routes from Bhilwara to Jahazpur It will be thus seen that there was sufficient material before the <ORG> respondent to come to the conclusion that the peti titioner was aware of the grant of a permit to respondent and even knowing about it as he did not oppose the grant he had therefore disentitled himself to file an appeal and could not by that process he allowed to avail the remedy of revision It is to be seen that the notified route is Bhilwara to Bundi and only Bhilwara to Triveni Chauaraya which is a portion of the Bhilwara Jahazpur route overlaps the notified route and consequently there was no bar to respondent No in granting a temporary permit from Triveni Chauraya to Jahazpur I can understand a case where it is found that the petitioner did not oppose the grant of a permit because he had no opportunity to do so In that case of course revision will be maintainable because of the fact not simply because the petitioner had not opposed the grant of a permit but because he had no opportunity to oppose the grant and it would be inequitable if not having had an opportunity to oppose the grant of a permit he was to be deprived of the right not only of filing an appeal but also of revision But a person who by his own fault has disentitled himself from filing an appeal by not having opposed the grant of a permit when he had the full opportunity to do so cannot be allowed to avail the remedy of revision which only lies where no appeal lies No doubt that authority was dealing with a case of a grant of a non temporary permit But in my opinion these principles and equitable consideration will equally apply in the case of grant of temporary permit As held in <NAME> <ORG> it is for the revisional authority to see whether in any case it should exercise its revisionai jurisdiction of its own motion as the exercise of that jurisdiction is a matter of judicial discretion I am aware that in number of cases it has been held that if the order of <ORG> is without jurisdiction this <ORG> may interfere even without the party having availed of the alternative remedy by way of appeal or revision But I have no doubt that it is only in gravely exceptional cases that this court will entertain a writ petition direct and in normal course it will be a sound exercise of discretion to refuse to entertain it if a party has not availed of the remedy of appeal or revision more especially as the matters which are necessarily contentious can be examined more satisfactorily by the authorities constituted under the Act Moreover the present case where the petitioner did avail the remedy cf revision but ultimately it is found not to have been a proper remedy cannot be equated with a case where the petitioner chooses to invoke this <ORG> jurisdiction in the first instance So normally the petitioner would not be allowed to urge any grievance against the merits of the order of <ORG> but as I permitted Mr <NAME> to urge on merits I deem it only fair that I should deal with this contention on merits also In detailed consideration by <ORG> it was noted that according to the scope there was one vacancy and that previously because of the order from <ORG> there was a stay for grant of a non temporary permit It was specifically mentioned that on this portion there is lot of traffic and there is immediate and essential need to provide temporarily more buses and therefore the application of respondent for the grant of a temporary permit may be accepted as it was for the convenience of the travelling public Now the finding by <ORG> that there is large number of travelling public and that it was essential to provide for more vehicles for the benefit and convenience of the public is a finding of fact and a matter which is solely within the jurisdiction of <ORG> This Court cannot start reassessing the sufficiency of the material on which <ORG> has come to such a conclusion Mr <NAME> had sought to find fault with the order of <ORG> by urging that it had granted the temporary permit on the ground that there was a scope of one permit and urged that the mere existence of a vacancy was not sufficient to hold that there was a temporary need No doubt the existence of a permanent vacancy may not necessarily mean that there is a particular temporary need within the meaning of Section of the Act There is no reason why Section should be given any special or restricted meaning and that there is no antithesis between a particular temporary need and a permanent need and it is manifest that these two kinds of need may co exist on a particular route It therefore had the jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case to grant a temporary permit Though no doubt <ORG> noticed that there was a scope for one permit yet it decided to grant a temporary permit only after corning to a finding that the need of travelling public and because of requirement of traffic issue of a temporary permit was essential It was in that context that <ORG> said that as there was an absence of any purpose or reason for which temporary permits were asked for <ORG> should have dismissed the application in limine The case is obviously distinguishable because in the present case the purpose mentioned in the application is for the public convenience and there is a full discussion and finding by <ORG> that it was essential to give temporary permit to increase the vehicle for the benefit and the convenience of the travelling public <ORG> in that case inferred that as there were two vacancies temporary need could be assumed It will be seen that there was no finding by <ORG> that any temporary need existed in the sense of there being need for extra vehicles because of the traffic requirements It was also found by the learned Judge that the only circumstance taken into consideration by <ORG> for the grant of a temporary permit was the existence of a vacancy on the route to come to a conclusion that there was a temporary need The consideration by <ORG> showed that it granted the temporary permits only on the ground that as the matter for grant of a non temporary permit and filling vacancies were likely to take some time there was a particular temporary need Similarly in Civil Writ No of decided on <NAME> as his Lordship then was after stating that the mere existence of a vacancy on a route did not warrant a conclusion that the temporary need co existed with the permanent need however went on to observe at any rate there is nothing in the aforesaid order of <ORG> to show that it granted a temporary permit to respondent <NAME> for any of the reasons or in any of the circumstances stated in Clause of Sub section of Section of the Act One must look at these matters in a practical manner An application is filed by a person asking for the grant of a temporary permit and the purpose mentioned is public convenience for a temporary need Now whether he can substantiate that application will depend upon the various facts and circumstances which are placed for consideration before <ORG> when it considers the question of a grant of the permit In the present case there is a firm finding that the requirement of the travelling public requires the grant of a temporary permit This court under Article cannot sit as a court of appeal over these factual decisions given by <ORG> I may however also mention that it has been stated in the reply by respondent that he is a displaced operator from Bhilwara Ajmer route but his permit was cancelled because the said route became notified route with effect from and could not be renewed after August because of nationalisation in order to justify that there is a need for increase of vehicles on the route the respondent has stated that a scope of was fixed by <ORG> on Begun to Jahazpur route via Ladapur Mandalpur Triveni Chauraya but this was stayed by this <ORG> in a writ petition filed by one of the three existing operators on Bhilwara Jahazpur via Begun Triveni Chauraya route and since a portion of this route from Begun to Man dalgarh became a part of the notified route of the Scheme no permit at any time could be granted I am only mentioning these for the purpose of emphasising and that all these details are such which obviously <ORG> alone is in a proper position to know and evaluate and therefore unless it can be shown that respondent No has not applied its mind this <ORG> will be extremely slow to interfere with the discretion exercised by <ORG> in granting a temporary permit I am saying this because if <ORG> disposes of the matter in a laconic manner without really giving a finding that a temporary need exists it may lay itself open to the charge of having given a temporary permit without the existence of the conditions provided by Section and it may become difficult in that case for <ORG> to support its order when the reasons for it are not mentioned in its resolution granting or refusing the permit However as in the present case I have found that <ORG> has given a firm finding that it is necessary in the interest of traffic to give a temporary permit for the convenience of the travelling public no fault can be found with it and the argument of Mr <NAME> cannot therefore be accepted I think there is fallacy in the argument Mr <NAME> objected that if the permit to respondent No allows him to ply his vehicles only in rotation with the petitioner it is apparent that there is no temporary need because there can only be particular temporary need if the existing operators are not able to fulfil the need Mr <NAME> however pointed out that in the resolution of <ORG> there is no such restriction that respondent is to operate by rotation and the direction by the Secretary cannot therefore be invoked to hold that there is no temporary need when <ORG> had definitely so found that a temporary need exists Though the direction by the Secretary does seem a little at variance with the resolution of <ORG> but that is a matter which may be sorted out from the authorities but cannot help the petitioner in maintaining that this is sufficient to show that there was no particular temporary need on the route As a result I find no merit in the writ petition which fails and is dismissed with costs
