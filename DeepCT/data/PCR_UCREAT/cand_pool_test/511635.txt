With the lodgment of First Information Report the ball is set to roll and thenceforth the law takes its own course and the investigation ensues in accordance with the provisions of law In the event however the court on perusal of the complaint comes to a conclusion that the allegations levelled in the complaint or charge sheet on the face of it does not constitute or disclose any offence as alleged there ought not to be any hesitation to rise upto the expectation of the people and deal with the situation as is required under the law The Learned Single Judge while dealing with the matter came to a definite conclusion that the complaint does not disclose any offence having been committed by the accused petitioner and as such allowed the petition for quashing of the complaint At this meeting held on <ORG> and <ORG> agreed with the position stated by the Complainant and made representations that the supply of raw material by A particularly the critical raw material DL Amino Butanol would be kept up regularly to enable production of MTs of the finished product Cheating Whoever by deceiving any person fradulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property or intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body mind reputation or property is said to cheat Whoever cheats with the knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause wrongful loss to a person whose interest in the transaction to which the cheating relates he was bound either by law or by a legal contract to protect shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years or with fine or with both Whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the person deceived to deliver any property to any person or to make alter or destroy the whole or any part of a valuable security or anything which is signed or sealed and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine The ingredients require to constitute an offence under Section has been lucidly dealt with by this Court in the Case of Ram Jas State of SCC wherein this Court observed as below The ingredients required to constitute the offence of cheating are i there should be fraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving him ii a the person so deceived should be induced to deliver any property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property or the person so deceived should be intentionally induced to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived and ii in cases covered by ii the act or omission should be one which causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to the person induced in body mind reputation or property In order to attract the provisions of Sections and the guilty intent at the time of making the promise is a requirement and an essential ingredient thereto and subsequent failure to fulfil the promise by itself would not attract the provisions of Section or Needless to record however and it being a settled principle of law that to exercise powers under Section of the Code the complaint in its entirety shall have to be examined on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint and <ORG> at that stage has no authority or jurisdiction to go into the matter or examine its correctness Where the allegations made in the complaint or the statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the accused Where the allegations made in the complaint are patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused Where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in issuing process is capricious and arbitrary having been based either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly irrelevant or inadmissible and Where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal defects such as want of sanction or absence of a complaint by legally competent authority and the like The cases mentioned by us are purely illustrative and provide sufficient guidelines to indicate contingencies where <ORG> can quash proceedings We now come to the question as to whether or not a clear allegation of entrustment and misappropriation of properties was made by the appellant in her complaint and if so was <ORG> justified in quashing the complaint at that stage It is well settled by a long course of decisions that for the purpose of exercising its power under Section to quash a FIR or a complaint <ORG> would have to proceed entirely on the basis of the allegations made in the complaint or the documents accompanying the same per se It has no jurisdiction to examine the correctness or otherwise of the allegations In case no offence is committed on the allegation and the ingredients of Sections and IPC are not made out <ORG> would be justified in quashing the proceedings In the matter under consideration if we try to analyse the guidelines as specified in <NAME> case supra can it be said that the allegations in the complaint do not make out any case against the accused nor it discloses the ingredients of an offence alleged against the accused or the allegations are patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach to such a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused We therefore without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order of the High <ORG> and restore the complaint First was that the dispute is purely of a civil nature and hence no prosecution should have been permitted and the second was that the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Gandhidham has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint On the first count learned Single Judge pointed out that there was a specific clause in the Memorandum of Understanding arrived between the parties that disputes if any arising between them in respect of any transaction be resolved through arbitration We quote the following observations It may be that the facts narrated in the present complaint would as well reveal a commercial transaction or money transaction We are unable to appreciate the reasoning that the provision incorporated in the agreement for referring the disputes to arbitration is an effective substitute for a criminal prosecution when the disputed act is an offence We however hasten to add that whether or not the allegations in the complaint are otherwise correct has to be decided on the basis of the evidence to be led at the trial in the complaint case but simply because of the fact that there is a remedy provided for breach of contract that does not by itself clothe the <ORG> to come to a conclusion that civil remedy is the only remedy available to the appellant herein The object of criminal law is to punish an offender who commits an offence against a person property or the <ORG> for which the accused on proof of the offence is deprived of his liberty and in some cases even his life Mr <NAME> the learned Senior Advocate for the respondents herein being the accused persons strongly relied upon the decisions of this <ORG> in the case of Dr Sharma Nursing Home <ORG> SCC wherein this <ORG> observed that findings of Section has been rested only on the reception and did not go into the question whether the complainant and its accompanymen disclosed the essential ingredient of the offence under Section namely disclosed inducement The decision of this <ORG> in Dr <NAME> case supra thus does not lend any assistance to Mr <NAME> in support of quashing of the criminal complaint Considering the factual aspect of the matter we unhesitatingly state however that the issue involved in the matter under consideration is not a case in which the criminal trial should have been short circuited We thus without expressing any opinion on the merits of the case allow the Appeal and set aside the impugned order of the High <ORG> and restore the complaint
