He therefore secured some respectable persons to the place and in the presence of all the petitioners and another member of the crew got the deal wood planks covered at four places removed Being aggrieved by the judgment of the learned District Magistrate the petitioners and the pilot of the vessel who had also been convicted filed an appeal to the Sessions Judge South Kanara Division in Criminal Appeal No of challenging the correctness and legality of their convictions But the learned Sessions Judge was of the opinion that mens rea was not a necessary element in so far as the offence under Section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act read with Section of the said Act is concerned and that proof of the fact that the petitioness had brought gold into India without obtaining necessary permit from <ORG> was sufficient to make them liable to answer the said charge and confirmed the convictions of the petitioners of the said charge It was contended by <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioners that the learned Sessions Judge on the evidence on record having reached the conclusion that no offence was made out against any of the petitioners for an offence under Section of the Sea Customs Act was not justified in finding the petitioners guilty for an offence under Section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation <NAME> the learned Government Pleader contended that the conclusion of the learned Sessions Judge that mens rea was a necessary element for an offence under Section of the Sea Customs Act and that there was no evidence or material on re cord to point out that the petitioners had knowledge that the gold was being smuggled or had intention to bring the same into India it not based on proper appreciation of the facts established in the case and therefore there is no substance in the contention of the petitioners that they should have been acquitted for an offence under Section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act There is considerable force in the contention of the learned Government Pleader The learned Sessions Judge held that the statements made by the petitioners before the Customs Authorities viz to were inadmissible in evidence and that if that evidence is excluded there was no other evidence to prove the knowledge or intention of the petitioners There is therefore no substance in this contention of the petitioners It is further urged by <NAME> the learned counsel for the petitioners that <NAME> the Assistant Collector of Central Excise Customs Preventive who lodged the complaint had not been authorised by a competent authority to file the complaint and therefore the complaint itself is incompetent This argument is based on the fact that no notification has been issued by <ORG> or <ORG> after Sub sections and of Section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act were amended This section as it stands lays down that no <ORG> should take cognizance of any such offence except upon any complaint in writing made by the Director of Enforcement or any officer authorised in this he half by <ORG> or <ORG> by general or special order There is a fallacy in this argument The only change made in Sub section by the amendment is that the Director of Enforcement was added as one of the officers entitled to lodge a complaint This will be abundantly clear if we bear in mind that Act of was merely an unending Act and has not repealed the previous Act Section of the amended Act as it now stands empowers two authorities to lodge a complaint in writing in regard to the enforcement of the provisions of the Act one of them being the Director of Enforcement and the other authority is any officer authorised in that behalf by <ORG> or <ORG> by general or special order I am unable to accept the contention of <NAME> the learned counsel for the petitioners that in the absence of a notification issued subsequent to the amendment of the Act by Act of the old notification which empowered <NAME> and the other customs officers to lodge complaints became inoperative and that <NAME> was not competent to file the complaint There is therefore no substance in the second contention of the petitioners and it must fail The next contention urged by <NAME> the learned counsel for the petitioners is that the complaint lodged against the petitioners without affording an opportunity as contemplated in proviso under Sub section of Section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act to show cause whether they had a permit is invalid It may at once be stated that there is no substance in this contention They never took the stand that they had brought the gold with any authority or permission obtained from <ORG> or <ORG> or they kept the gold with a view to take it to any other country Proviso to section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act reads thus Provided that where any such offence is the contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or any rule direction or order made thereunder which prohibits the doing of an act without permission no such complaint shall be made unless the person accused of the offence has been given an opportunity of showing that he had such permission The evidence of Sri Parameshwara makes it abundantly clear that such an opportunity was given to the petitioners by the <ORG> authorities Exhibit is the copy of the notice served on each of the petitioners Exhibits to are the replies given by the petitioners It is clear from a perusal of these Exhibits that the petitioners were given an opportunity of showing cause whether they bad any permit or authority to bring the gold into India and all of them have uniformly stated that they had no permits with them It was next urged by the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners that there was absolutely no reliable and sufficient evidence placed on record by the prosecution to reach the conclusion that the petitioners intentionally brought the gold into India without any necessary permit in that behalf to which are the statements purported to have been made by the petitioners before the <ORG> authorities the petitioners had unequivocally admitted that they brought the gold without any permit from the Government of India or <ORG> to which are the statements made by the several petitioners before the <ORG> authorities during the enquiry under the <ORG> Regulation are hit by Section of the Evidence Act lince they amounted to statements made before the <ORG> is not sound in law It is urged that the view taken by the Calcutta and Sind <ORG> that an Assistant Inspector of Customs is a Police Officer and any statement made before him is hit by Section of the Evidence Act is untenable I am unable to accept the view of <ORG> that statement made to <ORG> Authorities by a person who may later on be accused of an offence under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act is hit by Section of the Evidence Act and is therefore inadmissible in evidence It is conceded by the learned counsel for the petitioners that if Exts to are held to be admissible in evidence there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the petitioners had knowledge of the fact that the gold was being smuggled from Muskat to India and that their convictions are perfectly justified As already indicated I have no doubt in my mind that Exts to are admissible in evidence and any statements made by the petitioners before <ORG> can be taken into consideration against the petitioners <NAME> the learned counsel for the petitioners that there is intrinsic evidence in the case to prove that those statements were not actually recorded in the very words of the petitioners und that the petitioners did not understand the implications of the statements made by them in these statements before they affixed their signatures and there are no value should be attached to them It was finally urged by <NAME> the learned counsel for the petitioners that since the prosecution had failed to examine some independent witnesses to establish that the gold was actually found in the ship secreted in the cavities in the ship and that there was no possibility of other persons gaining entrance to the said vessel during that period that the vessel was in the Port before the gold was seized by the <ORG> Authorities the charge against the petitioners had not been satisfactorily established <ORG> which had the opportunity to watch the demeanour of the witnesses examined by the prosecution has believed those witnesses and accented their version and based a conviction against the petitioners It is seen from the records that none of the witnesses were seriously cross examined by the petitioners on the material facts deposed by them The last contention urged by <NAME> the learned counsel for the petitioners was that the learned Sessions Judge was not justified in ton firming the composite sentence awarded by the learned trial judge in spite of the fact that he acquitted the petitioners of the offence under Section of the Sea Customs Act According to the learned counsel for the petitioners the sentences awarded to the petitioners should have been proportionately reduced There is no substance in this contention It cannot reasonably be urged that the sentences awarded to the petitioners are in any way severe I am of the opinion that the sentences awarded to any of the petitioners do not call for any interference
