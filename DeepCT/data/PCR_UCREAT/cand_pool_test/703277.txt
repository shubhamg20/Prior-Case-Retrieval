We also condone the delay in filing the applications for substitution and allow the applications for substitution These Civil Appeals are directed against the common judgment dated of the Division Bench of <ORG> in a batch of Writ Petitions in relation to acres and guntas of Inam land in Bangalore District which was allotted by the State Government to an association of teachers for construction of houses and for which <ORG> has sanctioned a lay out plan In the year however <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> the legal representatives of <NAME> filed No in <ORG> challenging the order dated of <ORG> granting the land in favour of the <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> then filed SLP No against the order dated passed by <ORG> before this Court and on this Court without issuing notice in the SLP and while disposing of the SLP made observations that if the proceedings pending before the Special Deputy Commissioner with regard to the claim of Inamdars have ended in favour of the petitioners who have filed the SLP it will be open to them to approach the State Government for modification of the order granting land to the <ORG> <ORG> for short the <ORG> which was impleaded as respondent No in SLP filed an application before this Court for recalling the order dated but this Court in its order dated in SLP observed that there was nothing adverse to respondent No Society and accordingly dismissed the application for recalling The owners of the sites filed Nos in <ORG> challenging the order dated of <ORG> and by an order dated the learned Single Judge of <ORG> allowed the Writ Petitions and remitted the matter to <ORG> with the direction to comply with the order dated of this Court after hearing the petitioners and the respondents in the writ petitions and any other person interested in the matter The vacant sites which were available as on the day of the inspection by the Special Deputy Commissioner Bangalore on would be transferred to the Inamdars or if the same was not available on date compensation in lieu of it from Sangha be paid to the Inamdars In the impugned judgment dated <ORG> has recorded the following findings and conclusions i The acres guntas of land in Survey Nos and of Jakkasandra village Bangalore South Taluk did not vest in the Government on because the applications of the Inamdars for registration as occupants in respect of the land under in Sections and of the Inam Abolition Act were pending before the Special Deputy Commissioner and therefore the State Government had no power to pass the order dated according sanction for grant of the land in favour of the <ORG> and the Minister Revenue <ORG> was justified in passing the order dated cancelling the grant in favour of the <ORG> and ordering resumption and restoration of house sites in favour of the Inamdars pursuant to the order dated of this Court ii The order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of the land in favour of the <ORG> for allotment of house sites to its members was void ab initio in law as Sections A and of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act provided for allotment of land only for agricultural purposes and the rights given under the provisions of the Act to Inamdars in respect of land in question could not be whittled down by <ORG> in exercise of its power under the Karnataka Land Grant Rules iv The orders passed by <ORG> in the earlier proceedings in No and A No do not operate as res judicata as the case of the <NAME> with reference to the provisions of the Inam Abolition Act and law laid down by this Court on various aspects were not considered in the earlier writ petitions and writ appeal and the decisions rendered by the Division Bench of <ORG> in A No was per incurium Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the legal representatives of the <ORG>s the appellants in Civil Appeal No of referred to sub Section of Section of the Inam Abolition Act which states the consequences of a notification under sub Section of Section in respect of any inam and submitted that the expression save as otherwise expressly provided in the Act in this provision saves the right of <ORG> under Section of the Act to be registered as an occupant in respect of the land from the consequences of vesting even after a notification was issued under sub section of Section of the Act He contended that clause a of sub Section of Section of the Inam Abolition Act further provides that no person shall be entitled to be registered as an occupant under Section unless the claimant makes an application to the <ORG> earlier the Special Deputy Commissioner within three years from the date of vesting of the inam concerned or whichever was later and clause of sub section of Section provides that where no application is made within a period specified in clause a the right of any person to be registered as an occupant shall stand extinguished and the land shall vest in the <ORG> absolutely and such land shall be disposed of in accordance with the rules relating to grant of land He submitted that the legislative intent of the Inam Abolition Act therefore was that so long as the application of <ORG> to be registered as an occupant has been filed within the period specified in clause a of sub section of Section of the Act and such application is pending before the <ORG> earlier the Special Deputy Commissioner the land in respect of the inam does not vest in the <ORG> and such land cannot be disposed of in accordance with the rules relating to grant of land He submitted that <ORG> was thus right in coming to the conclusion in the impugned order that the <ORG> Government had no power to pass the order dated according sanction for grant of land in favour of the <ORG> because on the application of the <ORG>s to be registered as occupants in respect of the land was still pending before the Special Deputy Commissioner Mr <NAME> submitted that a reading of the order dated of the <ORG> Government sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the <ORG> was subject to the pending proceedings of the <ORG>s for grant of occupancy rights and therefore once the <ORG> passed the order dated in favour of the <ORG>s confirming their occupancy rights the <ORG>s were entitled to become occupants of the land and the order dated of the <ORG> Government was liable to be cancelled Mr <NAME> also supported the conclusion of <ORG> in the impugned order that the orders passed by <ORG> in earlier proceedings in No and A No do not operate as res judicata He cited the decisions of this Court in <NAME> and Others He submitted that in any case the order dated passed by <ORG> of <ORG> in A No was challenged before this Court by the legal representatives of the Inamdars in SLP No and by an order dated passed in the SLP this Court permitted the legal representatives of the Inamdars to apply to <ORG> for modification of the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the <ORG> He argued that since there was a merger of the order passed by <ORG> of <ORG> in A No in the order dated passed by this Court in SLP the order passed by <ORG> of <ORG> cannot operate as res judicata Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for <ORG> the appellants in Civil Appeal Nos on the other hand submitted that Inamdars were only entitled to the occupancy price of Rs per acre amounting to Rs for the entire land measuring acres guntas which was given as grant by <ORG> to the <ORG> and they have in fact withdrawn the amount of Rs He submitted that after the suit of the Inamdars were dismissed as withdrawn the right to challenge the grant made in favour of the <ORG> by <ORG> by order dated did not survive and therefore the legal representatives of the Inamdars had no locus standi to approach the <ORG> again to challenge the grant of land made by <ORG> in favour of the <ORG> Mr <NAME> next submitted that by the order dated passed by this Court in <ORG> No no special leave to appeal against the order dated of <ORG> in A No was granted and therefore the order of <ORG> of <ORG> which was challenged by the <ORG> was not disturbed by the ex parte order dated of this Court He cited <NAME> by Rs <NAME> SCC in which this Court has taken a view that even where <ORG> is admitted and special leave is granted the appellant has to show special circumstances to justify this Court interference Mr <NAME> next submitted that the judgment dated of the Division Bench of <ORG> in A No had therefore become final and binding on the parties and the rights which had accrued in favour of the <ORG> and its members to occupy the land granted to its members by the <ORG> under the judgment dated could not be taken away by an executive order and yet the Minister Revenue Government of Karnataka passed orders on canceling the grant of land made in favour of the <ORG> and issuing directions for resumption and restoration of land to the extent of sites in favour of the legal representatives of the Inamdars Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the <ORG> the appellant in Civil Appeal No of submitted that after the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the <ORG> a private layout plan was submitted by the <ORG> in respect of the land and the <ORG> sanctioned the private layout plan subject to conditions inter alia that the roads civic amenity sites parks and all connections such as underground drainage water supply lines shall vest with the <ORG> free of cost He submitted that the road civic amenity sites parks in the Survey Nos and in Jakkasandra village had therefore become the property of the <ORG> and yet by the order dated passed by the Minister Revenue Government of Karnataka the vacant civic amenity sites to an extent of acres guntas of the layout plan were directed to be handed over to the Inamdars free of cost and the land utilized by the <ORG> for formation of the Ring Road as per the sanctioned layout plan was directed to be acquired by the <ORG> and compensation paid to the Inamdars as if such land was the private property of the Inamdars He submitted that the <ORG> therefore filed Writ Petition No before <ORG> challenging the order dated of the Minister Revenue Government of Karnataka directing handing over of the civic amenity sites to the Inamdars free of cost and directing acquisition of the land forming the Ring Road and payment of compensation to the Inamdars for such acquisition but these directions in the order dated of the Minister Revenue Government of Karnataka have not been set aside by the Division Bench of <ORG> in the impugned judgment He submitted that under Section of the Bangalore Development Authority Act the <ORG> has the power to give such directions to the authority as in its opinion are necessary or expedient for carrying out the purposes of the Act but in exercise of such power the State <ORG> cannot direct the <ORG> to hand over the properties of the <ORG> free of cost to the Inamdars or to acquire the roads which were already owned by the <ORG> and pay compensation to the Inamdars He submitted that Minister <ORG> Government of Karnataka has taken an equitable view of the entire matter and has not disturbed those members of <ORG> or <ORG> who have already utilized the house sites for construction of the houses and has directed resumption and restoration of only the vacant sites in the land in favour of the Inamdars and cancelled the earlier grant of land in respect of these sites in favour of the <ORG> in exercise of powers under Rule of the Karnataka Land Grants Rules The order dated of the State Government sanctioning the grant of acres guntas of land in favour of the Sangha was earlier challenged before <ORG> by the legal representatives of the Inamdars first before the learned Single Judge in No and on dismissal of the writ petition by learned Single Judge before <ORG> in A No and <ORG> dismissed the writ appeal of the legal representatives of the Inamdars by its judgment dated Hence the main question that we will have to decide is whether findings recorded by <ORG> in the judgment dated in Writ Appeal No had become final and binding on the parties namely the legal representatives of the Inamdars the State of Karnatka and <ORG> On a reading of the judgment dated of <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No it appears that contentions were raised on behalf of the legal representatives of the Inamdars that so long as the claim petition for registration of the occupancy rights under Sections and of the Inam Abolition Act was pending decision before the Special Deputy Commissioner <ORG> had no power to sanction grant of the land measuring acres guntas in Survey Nos and of Jakkasandra village in favour of the Sangha and that in any case the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the Sangha was subject to claim of the Inamdars to occupancy rights in respect of the inam land In the judgment dated <ORG> of <ORG> held In the order it is specifically mentioned that the land in question is required for public purpose and if there are claims they are eligible for occupancy certificate by price payable for the land Though the grant is subject to the order of the grant in favour of inamdars it is made clear that the grant order in favour of Respondent No that the Inamdars are entitled for the price of the land Thus <ORG> of <ORG> in the judgment dated in Writ Appeal No negatived the contention that the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the <ORG> was bad because the claim of the Inamdars for registration under Sections and of the Inam Abolition Act was pending before the Special Deputy Commissioner and instead held that in case the claims of the Inamdars to occupancy in respect of the inam land were upheld they would be entitled for the price payable for the land On a reading of the judgment dated of <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No we further find that it was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that the Inamdars have waived their occupancy rights in respect of the inam land by entering into the agreement dated and by receiving the amounts towards the land price apart from the compensation of Rs and <ORG> of <ORG> accepted the contentions raised on behalf of the <ORG> and recorded the following findings The above two paras in the Agreement make it clear that the Inamdars have agreed not to claim any right not to prosecute with any legal proceedings and the agreement further shows that they agreed that it is open to Respondent <ORG> Members to enjoy the lands as they like and it is also stated that the existing sheds can be removed by Respondent <ORG> itself for which they will co operate and they also agreed to withdraw the suit filed in No pending on the file of <ORG> Bangalore In pursuance of the agreement they have filed a petition to withdraw the suit and the suit came to be withdrawn as settled out of court by an order dated Thus the Inamdars have acted upon the agreement by withdrawing the suit voluntarily It is thus clear that <ORG> of <ORG> decided three issues in its judgment dated in Writ Appeal No first that the State Government had the power to sanction grant of the land in Survey Nos and in Jakkasandra village in favour of the <ORG> by the order dated notwithstanding the pendency of the claim of the Inamdars to be registered as occupants of the land before the Special Deputy Commissioner <NAME> and therefore the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the land in favour of the <ORG> cannot held to be bad second in the event the claim of the Inamdars to be registered as occupants of the land was subsequently allowed by the Special Deputy Commissioner or by the Tribunal the Inamdars were not entitled to restoration of the land from the Sanngha but were entitled for the price of the land third the Inamdars had waived their right of occupation of the land by the agreement dated and by withdrawing the suit No in which they challenged the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the <ORG> and by receiving Rs per acre and Rs in addition to the price of Rs per acre totaling to Rs The judgment dated of the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in Writ Appeal No was sought to be challenged by the legal representatives of the Inamdars before this Court in SLP No but this Court did not grant special leave to the legal representatives of the Inamdars to appeal and instead disposed of the SLP with the following order It appears from the order of grant made in favour of the respondent society that it was made condition upon the outcome of the dispute which was pending then before the Special Deputy Commissioner for Abolition of Inam If that is so it would be open to the petitioners to approach <ORG> for modification of the order granting land to the respondent society Thereafter an I A was filed by <ORG> which was the fifth respondent in the SLP and this Court dismissed the I A by order dated with the following order We do not find anything adverse to the fifth respondent society in the order of this Court dated so as to recall the same On interpreting the two orders dated and of this Court we have no doubt that the decisions on the three issues in the judgment dated of <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No were not disturbed by this Court in the <ORG> and therefore the decisions on the three issues of <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No became final and binding on the parties namely the legal representatives of the Inamdars <ORG> and the <ORG> and its members An order refusing special leave to appeal does not stand substituted in place of the order under challenge If the order refusing leave to appeal is a speaking order i gives reasons for refusing the grant of leave then the order has two implications Firstly the statement of law contained in the order is a declaration of law by <ORG> within the meaning of Article of the Constitution Hence an order refusing special leave to appeal does not stand substituted in place of order under challenge and all that it means is that this <ORG> was not inclined to exercise its discretion so as to allow the appeal being filed The aforesaid law laid down by this <ORG> however makes it clear that if the order refusing leave to appeal makes a statement of law such statement of law is declaration of law by this <ORG> within the meaning of Article of the Constitution of India and if the order records some finding other than the declaration of law such finding would bind the parties thereto and also the <ORG> <ORG> or Authority in any proceeding subsequent thereto by way of judicial discipline the Supreme <ORG> being the Apex <ORG> of the country of the Division Bench of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No which was challenged in SLP No before this Court does not stand substituted by the order dated of this Court in the SLP because this Court has not granted special leave to appeal against such judgment dated in Writ Appeal No of the Division Bench of <ORG> The order dated of this Court in SLP No however has taken note of the condition in the order of grant made in favour of the <ORG> that the grant was subject to the outcome of the dispute which was pending before the Special Deputy Commissioner <NAME> and has further taken note of the fact that the proceedings have resulted in favour of the legal representatives of the Inamdars and thereafter left it open to legal representatives of the Inamdars to approach <ORG> for modification of the order granting land to the <ORG> and directed <ORG> to dispose of such application made on behalf of the legal representatives of the Inamdars within a period of three months from the receipt of the application In the aforesaid order dated in SLP No this Court has therefore also not recorded any finding which would be binding on the legal representatives of the Inamdars <ORG> the <ORG> and its members but has only granted liberty to the legal representatives of the Inamdars to approach <ORG> for modification of the order granting land in favour of the <ORG> and has given further direction to <ORG> to dispose of such application within the period of three months from the receipt of the application of the legal representatives of the Inamdars Hence the contention raised on behalf of the legal representatives of the Inamdars before us that the judgment dated of the Division Bench of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No got merged in the order dated in SLP No and the findings on the three issues in the order dated in Writ Appeal No did not operate as res judicata and were not binding on the legal representatives of the Inamdars <ORG> <ORG> or the <ORG> and its members is misconceived In the common judgment impugned in the present appeals however <ORG> has taken a view that the orders passed by <ORG> in the earlier proceedings in No and A No do not operate as res judicata as the case of the <NAME> with reference to the provisions of the Inam Abolition Act and the law laid down by this Court on various aspects were not considered in the earlier writ petitions and writ appeal and the decisions rendered by the Division Bench of <ORG> in A No were per incurium We now come to the argument of Mr <NAME> that the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning grant of land in favour of <ORG> for house sites was void ab initio because of the prohibitions in Sections A and of the Land Reforms Act and that if the Court holds that the order dated was void ab initio on this ground the earlier decision dated of <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No would not operate as res judicata We find from a reading of the order dated of <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No that a contention was raised on behalf of the legal representatives of the Inamdars that there was no power to grant land for house sites under the Karnataka Land Grants Rules but <ORG> of <ORG> negatived the said contention and held that under Rule of the Karnatka Land Grants Rules <ORG> had the power to grant land to the <ORG> for house sites We do not find from the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No that any contention was raised on behalf of the legal representatives of the Inamdars that grant of land in Survey Nos and of Jakkasandra village could not be sanctioned in favour of the <ORG> for house sites because of the restrictions in Sections A and of the Land Reforms Act If this ground of attack had not been taken by the legal representatives of the Inamdars while challenging the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the <ORG> this contention could not be raised by them before <ORG> in a subsequent proceeding because of the principle of constructive res judicata underlying Explanation IV of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure which has been applied to writ petitions Nonetheless as the Division Bench of <ORG> had not decided this question in the judgment dated in Writ Appeal No and <ORG> has decided this question in the impugned common judgment dated we think it necessary to examine this question in these Civil Appeals against the impugned common judgment dated We find that Chapter of the Land Reforms Act is titled Restrictions on holding on transfer of agricultural lands and the language of Sections A and shows that these provisions apply to only agricultural lands We also find from the provisions of sub sections and of Section of the Karnataka Land Revenue Act for short the Land Revenue Act that the land held for agricultural purpose can be permitted to be diverted for other purposes on payment of fine In the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of the land in favour of the <ORG> it is clearly stipulated that the <ORG> shall pay such conversion fine to be levied as per the rules made under the Revenue Act a statute must be read as a whole as words are to be understood in their context Sections A and of the Land Reforms Act therefore have to be read together with Section of the Land Revenue Act as all these provisions deal the same subject matter namely agricultural lands The result of our aforesaid discussion is that the findings of <ORG> of <ORG> in the judgment dated in Writ Appeal No that the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the <ORG> was valid and that the Inamdars were only entitled to the price payable for the land when their claims for registration under Sections and of the Inam Abolition Act were allowed and that the Inamdars have waived their right of occupation in the land by entering into the agreement dated and by accepting the price of Rs per acre deposited by the <ORG> and the additional amount paid by the <ORG> were binding not only on the legal representatives of the Inamdars and the <ORG> but also on <ORG> While deciding the application of the legal representatives of the Inamdars for modification of the order dated sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the <ORG> therefore <ORG> could not ignore these findings of <ORG> of <ORG> in the judgment dated in Writ Appeal No In the order dated of this Court in SLP No there was no mandamus to <ORG> to modify or cancel the order dated of <ORG> sanctioning the grant of land in favour of the <ORG> but there was only a direction to <ORG> to consider the application of the legal representatives of the Inamdars for modification of the order dated of had delivered the judgment dated issuing a writ of mandamus directing <ORG> to pay annual cash bonus to Class III and Class IV employees for the year April to March along with their salary for the month of April Against the said judgment of learned Single Judge of <ORG> Letters Patent Appeal was filed but by the time Letters Patent Appeal came up for hearing <ORG> Modification of Settlement Act came into force and there was no provision in this Act absolving <ORG> from its obligation to carry out the writ of mandamus issued by the learned Single Judge of <ORG> <NAME> as he then was delivering the judgment on behalf of himself <NAME> and <NAME> JJ held that since <ORG> did not press the Letters Patent Appeal the judgment of the learned Single Judge of <ORG> granting the writ of mandamus became final and binding on the parties and in these circumstances <ORG> could not claim to be absolved from the obligation imposed by the judgment to carry out the writ of mandamus by relying on <ORG> Modification of Settlement Act <NAME> held If by reason of retrospective alteration of the factual or legal situation the judgment is rendered erroneous the remedy may be by way of appeal or review but so long as the judgment stands it cannot be disregarded or ignored and it must be obeyed by <ORG> The judgment dated of the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court in Writ Appeal No had held that on the occupancy rights of the Inamdars being confirmed the Inamdars would be entitled to only the price and that the Inamdars had waived their right to occupy the land by accepting the price and by accepting further additional amounts from the <ORG> and this judgment of the Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court had not been disturbed by this Court in SLP No and the Minister Revenue Government of Karnataka could not have taken a view that on the confirmation of the occupancy rights of the Inamdars the grant of the land made in favour of the <ORG> was liable to be cancelled Once we hold that the grant made in favour of the <ORG> was not liable to be cancelled the order of the Minister <ORG> <ORG> directing that the vacant sites have to be transferred to the <NAME> or compensation in lieu of the vacant sites were to be paid by the <ORG> to the <NAME> has to be set aside This is because the civic amenity sites measuring acres guntas and the ring road were part of the land measuring acres given on grant to the <ORG> The order dated of the Minister <ORG> <ORG> directing that the civic amenity sites be handed over to the <NAME> free of cost and directing that the <ORG> will acquire the land comprised in the ring road after paying compensation for the same was thus without the authority of law The impugned common judgment dated of <ORG> is also set aside and the writ petitions filed before <ORG> are allowed The appellant thereafter filed Miscellaneous First Appeal No of before <ORG> against the order dated of <ORG> but <ORG> by its order dated also dismissed the Miscellaneous First Appeal on the ground that the subject matter of the suit was also the subject matter of No of before this Court We have heard learned counsel for the parties Since we have decided the dispute pending before this Court we set aside the impugned order dated passed by <ORG> in Miscellaneous First Appeal No of and the order dated passed by <ORG> Bangalore in I A Nos and of and remand the matter to <ORG> Bangalore to hear the parties and decide the application for temporary injunction and the suit in accordance with our judgment delivered today in Civil Appeal Nos of and other connected Civil Appeals
