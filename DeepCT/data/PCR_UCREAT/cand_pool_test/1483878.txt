of the Constitution of India to show cause why he should not be demoted and compulsorily retired and the respondent submitted a written explanation setting out his defence and objecting to the procedure adopted at the inquiry Subsequently the respondent was given a copy of the report and again called upon to show cause why the proposed penalty of reduction in rank should not be imposed upon him and he once again submitted a written explanation The <ORG> finally by an order dated September inter alia reduced the rank of the respondent with effect from August and thereupon the respondent filed petitions under Art On appeal to <ORG> additional evidence was sought to be adduced on behalf of the appellant to show that as a matter of fact <ORG> was consulted even after the submission of the respondent explanation in answer to the second show cause notice but it was found that there was sufficient opportunity for the appellant to place all the relevant materials before <ORG> itself Held that the additional evidence ought not to be admitted and that the finding of <ORG> that there was no consultation with the <ORG> after the respondent had submitted his explanation in answer to the second show cause notice must stand He was found to have shown favours in the selection of books on approved list in respect of certain books said to have been written by a nephew of his aged only years and by another relation of his as also to a firm of publishers who had advanced certain sums of money to him on interest In September the same year the Director of Education issued orders framing charges against the respondent and calling upon him to submit his written statement of defence and giving him an opportunity to call evidence in support of it The Director of Education after a thorough inquiry into the charges framed against the respondent submitted a report to the effect that the charges framed against him had been substantially proved In pursuance of the sbow cause notice served upon the respondent on November he put in a long written explanation on November on the same lines as his written statement of defence submitted earlier as aforesaid bearing on the merits of the findings as also objecting to the procedure adopted at the inquiry On February the respondent filed the first petition Writ Petition No of challenging the validity of the order of the <ORG> suspending him and calling upon him to show cause why he should not be reduced in rank with effect from the date of suspension and also compulsorily retired In that petition he also challenged the legality of the entire proceedings and prayed for a writ of mandamus directing the <ORG> to pay his full salary during the period of suspension until he attained the age of superannuation as aforesaid After considering the opinion of the Commis sion the inquiry report and the several explanations sub mitted by the respondent the State <ORG> passed its final order dated September reducing the respond ent in rank from the <ORG> Junior Scale to Subordinate <ORG> with effect from August and compulsorily retiring him During the pend ency of the first writ petition and after it had been heard by <ORG> in part the respondent filed the second writ application being Writ Petition No of on September practically covering the same grounds and praying for the same reliefs as aforesaid Before dealing with the merits of the controversy raised in these appeals it is necessary to state that Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the appellant proposed to place before this <ORG> at the time of the argument the original records and certain affidavits to show that that as a matter of fact all the relevant facts relating to consulta tion between <ORG> and the <ORG> had not been placed before the High <ORG> and that if the additional evidence were taken at this stage he would satisf this <ORG> that the <ORG> was consulted even after the submission of the respondent explanation in answer to the second show cause notice Without looking into the addi tional evidence proposed to be placed before us we indicat ed that we would not permit additional evidence to be placed at this stage when there was sufficient opportunity for <ORG> to place all the relevant matters before the High <ORG> itself We could not see any special reasons why additional In this case there fore we have proceeded on the assumption that though the <ORG> was consulted as to the guilt or otherwise of the respondent and the action proposed to be taken aginst him after he had submitted his explanation in answer to the first show cause notice there was no consultation with the <ORG> after the respondent had submitted his more elaborate explanation in answer to the second show cause notice <ORG> was further of the opinion that it may be that if that explanation had been placed before the <ORG> its advice to <ORG> may not have been in the same terms in which it actually gave its advice and after considering which along with other relevant matters <ORG> passed the order now in question We shall assume for the purposes of this case that there was an irregularity in though not complete absence of consultation with the <ORG> At no stage of the controversy has it been suggested that so far as the appellant was concerned the respondent had not a reasona ble opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him that is to say it is now beyond question that the proceedings taken by the appellant including the departmental inquiry against the respondent ending with his reduction in rank satisfied the mandatory provisions of Chapter I of Part XIV of the Constitution with particular reference to Art His complaint was that the <ORG> should have been consulted after he had moved the <ORG> for reviewing its previous order and this Court ruled that it was not incumbent on the <ORG> to consult the <ORG> as many times as he might choose to move the <ORG> by way of review Hence it may be taken that we have to determine this controversy for the first time though according to the strict construction of the words of Art Articles and begin with the words It shall be the duty and then proceed to prescribe the various duties and functions of the <ORG> or <ORG> such as to conduct examinations for appointments to assist in framing and operating schemes of joint recruitment and of being consulted on all matters relating to methods of re cruitment or principles in making appointments to <ORG> and on all disciplinary matters affecting a civil servant were manda tory but in our opinion there are several cogent reasons for holding to the contrary Once relevant regulations have been made they are meant to be followed in letter and in spirit and it goes without saying that consultation with the Com mission on all disciplinary matters affecting a public servant has been specifically provided for in order first to give an assurance to the <ORG> that a wholly independ ent body not directly concerned with the making of orders adversely affecting public servants has considered the action proposed to be taken against a particular public servant with an open mind and secondly to afford the <ORG> unbiassed advice and opinion on matters vitally affecting the morale of public services It is therefore incumbent upon the Executive <ORG> when it proposes to take any disciplinary action against a public servant to consult the <ORG> as to whether the action proposed to be taken was justified and was not in excess of the requirements of the situation This aspect of the relevant provisions of Part XIV of the Constitution has a direct bearing on the question whether Art The question whether a certain provision in a statute imposing a duty on a public body or authority was mandatory or only directory arose before their Lordships of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <NAME> I When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty and at the same time would not promote the main object of the <ORG> it has been the practice to hold such provisions to be directory only the neglect of them though punishable not affecting the validity of the acts done The principle laid down in this case was adopted by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> would adversely affect the person so appointed to a public service without any fault on his part and without his having any say in the matter Hence the use of the word shall in a statute though generally taken in a mandatory sense does not necessarily mean that in every case it shall have that effect that is to say that unless the words of the statute are punctiliously followed the proceeding or the outcome of the proceeding would be invalid The meaning and intention of the legislature must govern and these are to be ascertained not only from the phraseology of the provision but also by considering its nature its design and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other have been complied with in this case and it has not been contended at any stage that they had not been complied with he has no remedy against any irregularity that the <ORG> Government may have committed in the sense of affording a cause of action to a public servant against whom some action has been taken by his employer of the Constitution we direct that each party bear its own costs throughout
