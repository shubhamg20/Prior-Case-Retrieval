He was removed to the civil prison and he served out the sentence In the appeal by special leave it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the proceedings of the <ORG> Martial were vitiated i by a non affording of an opportunity to challenge the constitution of the Summary <ORG> Martial under section ii by bias on the part of the respondent No who participated in and dominated the proceedings iii by awarding a punishment so disproportionate to the offence as to amount in itself to conclusive evidence of bias and vindictiveness and iv by ignoring that as the appellant was then serving out an earlier sentence he could not be need to be in active service so as to be amenable to disciplinary jurisdiction and that the appellant refusal while already serving a sentence to accept food did not amount to disobedience under section of any lawful command of a Superior officer I Non compliance with the mandate of section is an infirmity which goes to the root of jurisdiction and without more vitiates the proceedings The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATACHALIAH This appeal by special leave preferred against the order dated July of <ORG> of <ORG> in No of raises a substantial question as to the scope and content of the procedural safe guards in Section of the Indian Army Act Act in the conduct of the Courts Martial He was also dismissed from service with the added disqualification of being declared unfit for any future civil employment We have heard learned counsel on both sides The matter was adjourned on two earlier occasions on the submission of the learned Additional Solicitor General that the question whether a lesser punishment was warranted was engaging the attention of the appropriate authorities Chapter VI of the Act comprising of sections to specify and define the various offences under the Act Rules to of the Army Rules prescribe the procedure of and before the Summary Court Martial The oft quoted words of <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> are again worth re calling if dismissal from employment is based on a defined procedure even though generous beyond the requirements that bind such agency that procedure must be scrupulously observed This judicially evolved rule of administrative law is now firmly established and if I may add rightly so He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with that sword We are afraid the non compliance of the mandate of section is an infirmity which goes to the root of the jurisdiction and without more vitiates the proceedings The provision conferring a right on the accused to object to a member of <ORG> sitting as a member and participating in the trial ensures that a charge of bias can be made and investigated against individual members composing <ORG> What emerges therefore is that in the present case there is a non compliance with the mandate of section with the attendant consequence that the proceedings of the Summary Court Martial are rendered infirm in law The Court cannot inquire into that In the administration of justice whether by a recognised legal court or by persons who although not a legal public court are acting in a similar capacity public policy requires that in order that there should be no doubt about the purity of the administration any person who is to A take part in it should not be in such a position that he might be suspected of being biased in considering whether there was a real likelihood of bias the court does not look at the mind of the justice himself or at the mind of the chairman of the tribunal or whoever it may be who sits in a judicial capacity It does not look to see if there was a real likelihood that he would or did in fact favour one side at the expense of the other The court looks at the impression which would be given to other people Even if he was as impartial as could be never theless if right minded persons would think that in the circumstances there was a real likelihood of bias on his part then he should not sit <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> US at said The judicial process demands that a judge move within the frame work of relevant legal rules and the court covenanted modes of thought for ascertaining them There is a good deal of shallow talk that the judicial robe does not change the man within it The fact is that on the whole judges do lay aside private views in discharging their judicial functions But it is also true that reason cannot control the subconscious influence of feelings of which it is unaware When there is ground for believing that such unconscious feelings may operate in the ultimate judgment or may not unfairly lead others to believe they are operating judges refuse themselves They do not sit in judgment I have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle of proportionality which is recognised in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of <ORG> In <NAME> State of Himachal Pradesh A I SC this Court held It is equally true that the penalty imposed must be commensurate with the gravity of the misconduct and that any penalty disproportionate to the gravity of the misconduct would be violative of Article of the Constitution In the result for the foregoing reasons the appeal is allowed the order of <ORG> set aside the writ petition preferred in <ORG> allowed and the impugned proceedings of the Summary Court Martial dated March and the consequent order and sentence are quashed
