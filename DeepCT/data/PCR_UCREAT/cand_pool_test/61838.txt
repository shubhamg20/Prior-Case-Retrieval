This is an appeal by the plaintiffs in the suit against a judgment and two decrees of <ORG> dated October which reversed the decree of the Subordinate Judge dated January as amended by his order dated March i The learned Subordinate Judge who tried the suit made a decree in the plaintiffs favour this decree was subsequently amended on an application for review and it was thereby directed that the plaintiffs should got from defendant No i <NAME> a ths share first out of the sum of Rs The result was that the plaintiffs suit was dismissed <ORG> directing that the parties should bear their own costs in both Courts By the said agreement all matters in dispute were referred to two arbitrators and an umpire who were named in the said agreement They decided That the properties acquired by the deceased in the name of his wife <NAME> defendant No belonged to her as her separate properties and that she was entitled to those properties that the properties acquired by the deceased in the name of <NAME> defendant No wore his separate properties and that he was entitled to them that the factory known as the Victor Ice and Flour Mills situate at Bagh Sherjang City Luoknow was given to <NAME> by the deceased during his lifetime and the same belonged to him and that the remaining properties should be distributed among the several heirs according to their legal shares under the Mahomedan law The suit was instituted on October just within three years from the date on which plaintiff No attained his majority No question arises in this appeal with respect to these properties It must therefore be taken for the purposes of this appeal that the said factory was part of the estate of <NAME> at the date of his death and that subject to the question hereinafter to be considered the plaintiffs as two of his heirs are entitled to their respective shares in the said factory There is no dispute as to the shares to which the plaintiffs are entitled in the properties of their father viz The Subordinate Judge decided this issue in favour of the plaintiffs on the ground that <NAME> the mother of the plaintiffs had no authority to refer so as to bind the plaintiffs The learned Judges of <ORG> agreed with the conclusion of the Subordinate Judge on this issue and held that the agreement to refer to arbitration executed by <NAME> on behalf of her minor children could not be considered binding on them and that the award if looked at from that point of view must be held to be an inoperative document But the plaintiffs on the death of their father became entitled to their respective shares in his estate and in view of the findings of both Courts in India it must now be taken that the above mentioned <ORG> was part of the immoveable property of <NAME> in which the plaintiffs were entitled to share and yet by the award it was allotted to <NAME> as being his own property The learned Judges held that <NAME> although she was at the time of the agreement the de facto guardian of the plaintiffs who were then minors had no power to deal with their property and consequently that she had no authority to enter on their behalf into the agreement to refer the disputes to arbitration which if acted upon would necessarily affect the immoveable property of the infant plaintiffs It has already been stated that <NAME> was not appointed guardian of the person and property of the minor children by <NAME> and that at the date of the agreement of reference she had not been appointed guardian by the <ORG> No one else has any right or power to intermeddle with the property of a minor except for certain specified purposes the nature of which is clearly defined the head note of which is as follows The mother as the de facto guardian of minors is not competent under the Mahomedan Law to enter on their behalf into an agreement to refer to arbitration any dispute even where there is no dejure guardian of the minors such agreement being one which will necessarily if acted upon involve dealings with the immovable properties of the minors There is however no evidence that the District Judge was made aware of the said arrangement It appears that certain mortgage deeds had been executed in favour of <NAME> and these were included in the shares awarded to the plaintiff and his brothers A suit on the mortgages was instituted on October by <NAME> after attaining majority and his three brothers of whom <NAME> was one as minors under the guardianship of their mother A preliminary decree was obtained on October and an application was made for a decree absolute on September and the decree was made absolute on November <NAME> was of age when the application for decree absolute was mada and signed it as a major Proceedings in the mortgage suit had been begun when he was a minor and when the tune came for application for a decree absolute the mother had no longer any authority to act for him as he had attained majority and <NAME> being a party to the suit his signature to the application was necessary to bring the proceedings to a conclusion in the interest of all concerned For the above mentioned reasons their Lordships are of opinion that the appeal must be allowed the decrees of <ORG> dated October must be set aside and the decree of the Subordinate Judge dated January as amended by the order of March be restored but that the sum of Rs The respondents the heirs of the deceased respondent <NAME> must pay the costs of the plaintiffs of this appeal and of the appeals to <ORG> Their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly
