HEADNOTE Section of the Punjab Village Common Lands Regulation Act conferred jurisdiction on the Collector to decide cases of persons claiming right title or interest in any land vested or deemed to have been vested in a <ORG> or claiming that any land has not so vested in a <ORG> and against such order an appeal was provided to the Commissioner Section of the Act provided that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain or adjudicate upon any question whether any property or any right to or interest in any property is or is not shamlat deh vested or deemed to have been vested in a <ORG> under the Act The petitioners instituted a civil suit under of the Code of Civil Procedure for a declaration that they were the owners in possession of the suit land that the Gram <ORG> had no sort of right in the suit land that the suit land had been wrongly shown as belonging to the <ORG> by entries made in the revenue records which were not binding on the plaintiffs and for an injunction restraining the <ORG> from interfering with their possession The respondent <ORG> contended in its written statement that the civil court had no jurisdiction to try the suit by virtue of the provisions of of the Act The trial court however held that since the question involved in the suit was simply one of title to the suit land and it was not necessary to decide whether the suit land was shamlat deh or not and whether the land had validly vested in the <ORG> or not being shamlat deh it had jurisdiction to try the suit They cannot by drawing their plaint cleverly be not claiming a declaration that the land in question was not shamlat deh confer jurisdiction on the civil court when by virtue of the Act the jurisdiction of civil court to try such suits had been taken away The suit had been filed against the <ORG> and the <ORG> had raised the plea that the suit land was a part of the shamlat deh and that the plaintiffs had no right or title to it They instituted a suit in a representative capacity under Order rule of the Code of Civil Procedure in <ORG> Judge <NAME> for a declaration that they were the owners in posses sion of the suit land along with some others that <ORG> Mehal Kalan Tehsil Barnala District Sangrur in the State of Punjab hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> had no sort of right in the suit land and that the suit land had been wrongly shown as belonging to the <ORG> by the entries made in the revenue records which were not binding on the plaintiffs and for an injunction restraining the <ORG> from interfering their possession The <ORG> in the course of its written statement inter alia pleaded that the <ORG> before which the suit had been instituted had no jurisdiction to try it by virtue of the provisions of section of the Punjab Village Common Lands Regulation Act Punjab Act No of hereinafter referred to as the Act It held that since the question involved in the suit was simply one of title to the suit land and it was not necessary to decide whether the suit land was shamlat deh or not and whether the land had validly vested in the <ORG> or not being shamlat deh it had jurisdiction to try the suit The learned Judge who heard the Revision petition came to the conclusion that the issues involved in the suit were not triable by a civil court by virtue of section read with section of the Act and accordingly he held that the suit was not maintainable before the civil court Section of the Act defines the expression Shamlat deh as under shamlat deh includes lands described in the revenue records as shamlat deh excluding abadi deh shamlat tikkas lands described in the revenue records as shamlat tarafs patties pannas and tholas and used according to revenue records for the benefit of the village community or a part

of the total area of the village does not exist in the village The Act was amended by the Punjab Village Common Lands Regulation Amendment Act Section of the above Amending Act substituted the original sections and of the Act by new sections Any person claiming right title or interest in any land vested or deemed to have been vested in a <ORG> under this Act or claiming that any land has not so vested in a <ORG> may submit to the Collector within such time as may be prescribed a statement of his claim in writing and signed and verified in the prescribed manner and the Collector shall have jurisdiction to decide such claim in such manner as may be prescribed Any person or a <ORG> aggrieved by an order of the Collector made under sub section may within sixty days from the date of the order prefer an appeal to the Commissioner in such form and manner as may be prescribed and the Commissioner may after hearing the appeal confirm very or reverse the order appealed from and may pass such order as he deems fit Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act every order made by the Collector or the Commissioner shall be final and shall not be called in question in any court by way of appeal or revision or in any original suit application or execution proceedings No civil court shall have jurisdiction a to entertain or adjudicate upon any question whether any property or any right to or interest in any property or is not shamlat deh vested or deemed to have been vested in a <ORG> under this Act or to question the legality of any action taken by the Commissioner or the Collector or the Panchayat under this Act or in respect of any matter which the Commissioner or the Collector is empowered by or under this Act to determine Section of the Act provides that any person claiming right title or interest in any land vested or deemed to have been vested in a <ORG> under the Act or claiming that any land has not so vested in a <ORG> may submit to the Collector within such time as may be prescribed a statement of his claim in writing and signed and verified in the prescribed manner and that the Collector shall have jurisdiction to decide such claim in such manner as may be prescribed Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Collector is entitled to prefer an appeal to the <ORG>er Under section of the Act every order made by the Collector or by the <ORG>er as the case may be is final save as otherwise expressly provided in the Act and such order cannot be called in question in any court by way of appeal or revision or in any original suit application or execution proceedings Section of the Act provides that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain or adjudicate upon any question whether any property or any right to or any interest in any property is or is not shamlat deh vested or deemed to have been vested in a <ORG> under the Act or to question the legality of any action taken by the <ORG>er or the Collector or the <ORG> under the Act or in respect of any matter which the <ORG> or the Collector is empowered by or under the Act to determine The plaintiffs cannot by drawing their plaint cleverly by not claiming a declaration that the land in question was not shamlat deh confer jurisdiction on the civil court when by virtue of section of the Act the jurisdiction of civil courts to try such suits had been taken away It will not be possible in the circumstances for the civil court to make a declaration in favour of the plaintiffs without deciding the question whether the property in question was shamlat deh or not and whether it belonged to the <ORG> or not <ORG> found that plaintiff in that case had only stated in the plaint that the land in question was Gali Sheh re aam or a throughfare belonging to the Gram <ORG> which was being used by the plaintiff as an approach to his house for about years and had prayed for an injunction restraining the defendant from interfering with his right <ORG> held in the circumstances of that suit that the jurisdiction of the civil court had not been taken away by virtue of section read with sections A and of the Act which had been inserted by <ORG> into the Act We are of the view that the above decision is clearly distinguishable from the present case since in this case the <ORG> which had been impleaded as a defendant had raised the plea that the suit land was a part of shamlat deh and that the plaintiffs had no right or title in it We do not therefore find any ground to interfere with the judgment of <ORG> against which this petition is filed
