On th May the respondent filed an application under section of the Industrial Disputes Act claiming a total sum of Rs on account of salary from Ist January to th April The appellant objected on the ground that the respondent was not a workman On th November there was an order dismissing the respondent from service On nd January the respondent filed an application under section A of the Rajasthan Shops and Commercial Establishments Act which was dismissed on st July on the ground of limitation There was also a reference under section of the Industrial Disputes Act on th August arising out of the dismissal of the respondent The appellant filed a writ petition challenging this order A There is no controversy in the instant case that the respondent is not employed in any managerial or administrative capacity Where there is a power of assigning duties and distribution of work there is supervision He was undoubtedly checking up on behalf of the employer but he had no independent right or authority to take decision and his decision did not bind the company In this case there is a good deal of justification to hold that these laws the Industrial Disputes Act and the Rajasthan Shops and Commercial Establishments Act tread on the same field and both laws deal with the rights of a dismissed workman or employee The application under section A of the Rajasthan Act was dismissed not on merits but on limitation There is a period of limitation provided under the Rajasthan Act and it may be extended for reasonable cause But there is no period of limitation as such provided under the Industrial Disputes Act In no way the Rajasthan Act could be construed to curtail the rights of the workman to seek any relief or to go in for adjudication in case of the termination of the employment There is therefore no conflict between the Industrial Disputes Act and Rajasthan Shops and Commercial Establishments Act and there is no question of repugnancy The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> After hearing parties and after considering the relevant documents additional as well as original we grant leave to appeal in these matters The respondent on th of May filed an application under section of the Industrial Disputes Act hereinafter called the Act claiming the total sum of Rs on account of salary from Ist of January to th of April at the rate of Rs per month On or about th of November there was an order dismissing the respondent from service The respondent thereafter on nd of January filed an application under section A of the Rajasthan Shops Establishments Act hereinafter called the Rajasthan Act The said application was dismissed on st of July on the ground of limitation The appellant filed Writ Petition No of in <ORG> against the order of <ORG> allowing the said salary The respondent also filed another writ petition being writ petition No of for declaration that he was entitled to receive Rs as salary from to There was thereafter a reference under section of the Act on arising out of the dismissal of the respondent The appellant filed another writ petition being Writ Petition No of challenging the order of reference Aggrieved by the aforesaid orders the appellant has come up in these appeals before this Court The main question which requires consideration in these appeals is whether the respondent was a workman or not For the determination of this question it is necessary to refer to section of the Act which defines workman and states that it means any person emp loyed in any industry to do any manual unskilled skilled technical operational clerical or supervisory work for hire or reward whether the terms of employment be express or implied and includes any such person who has been dismissed discharged or retrenched in connection with or as a consequence of any dispute There is no controversy that the said respondent is not employed in any managerial or administrative capacity The learned Judge further observed that a supervisor need not be a manager or an administrator and a supervisor can be a workman so long as he did not exceed the monetary limitation indicated in the section and a supervisor irrespective of his salary is not a workman who has to discharge functions mainly of managerial nature by reasons of the duties attached to his office or of the powers vested in him In that case the learned Judge further held that a person in charge of a <ORG> could not ordinarily be a clerk even though he may not have power to take disciplinary action or even though he may have another superior officer above him At page of the report <NAME> <NAME> as the learned Chief Justice then was observed that the work in a <ORG> involved layer upon layer of checkers and checking is hardly supervision but where there is a power of assigning duties and distribution of work there is supervision emphasis supplied At page Supervisor has been described inter alia as follows In a broad sense one having authority over others to superintend and direct There it was found that he had no power to appoint Reference may be made to pages to and of the Paper Book which indicate the nature of duties performed by the respondent No herein He was undoubtedly checking up on behalf of the employer but he had no independent right or authority to take decision and his decision did not bind the company In that view of the matter keeping the correct principle of law in mind <ORG> has come to the conclusion taking into consideration the evidence recorded before <ORG> that the respondent is a workman and not a supervisor Our attention was however drawn by the counsel for the respondent to certain correspondence for instance the letter at page of the paper book bearing the date th of May where the respondent reported that certain materials were lying in stores deptt Similarly our attention was drawn to several other letters and we have perused these letters The next question that arises in this case is whether Act would apply or the Rajasthan Act would apply It enjoins that no employer shall dismiss or discharge from his employment any employee who has been in such employment continuously for a period of not less than months except for a reasonable cause and after giving such employee at least one month prior notice or on paying him one month wages in lieu of such notice Sub section of section A gives every employee so dismissed or discharged right to make a complaint in writing in the prescribed manner to a prescribed authority within days of the receipt of the order of dismissal or discharge Sub section of section A provides that the prescribed authority shall cause a notice to be served on the employer relating to the said complaint record briefly the evidence produced by the parties hear them and make such enquiry as it might consider necessary and thereafter pass orders in writing giving reasons therefor Nothing in this Act shall affect any rights or privileges which an employee in any establishment is entitled to on the date this Act comes into force under any other law contract custom or usage applicable to such establishment or any award settlement or agreement binding on the employer and the employee in such establishment if such rights or privileges are more favourable to him than those to which he would be entitled under this Act It has to be borne in mind that section A of the Act was amended to permit individual workman to ask for a reference in the case of individual dispute Under Article of the Constitution if there was any law by the State which had been reserved for the assent of the President and has received the assent of the President the State law would prevail in that State even if there is an earlier law by the <ORG> on a subject in the Concurrent List It appears that both of these Acts tread the same field and if there was any conflict with each other then section A of Rajasthan Act would apply being a later law We find however that there is no conflict The Division Bench of <ORG> in the instant appeal relying on the said decision held that there was no scope for any repugnancy Both these Acts deal with the rights of the workman or employee to get redressal and damages in case of dismissal or discharge but there is no repugnancy because there is no conflict between these two Acts in pith and substance There is no inconsistency between these two acts In our opinion in this case there is a good deal of justification to hold that these laws the Industrial Disputes Act and the Rajasthan Act tread on the same field and both laws deal with the rights of dismissed workman or employee Learned counsel on behalf of the appellant however contended that in this case there had been an application as indicated above under section A of the Rajasthan Act and which was dismissed on ground of limitation We are unable to accept this position because the application under Section A of the Rajasthan Act was dismissed not on merit but on limitation There is a period of limitation provided under the Rajasthan Act of six months and it may be extended for reasonable cause But there is no period of limitation provided under the Industrial Disputes Act Therefore in no way the Rajasthan Act could be construed to curtail the rights of the workman to seek any relief or to go in for an adjudication in case of the termination of the employment In the premises there is no conflict between the two Acts and there is no question of repugnancy
