and after making the other necessary calculations the net market value of the estate of the deceased was assessed at Rs He proceeded to say towards the concluding portion of his order However I find that there is some force in the argument advanced by the appellant representative against any enhancement being made by the <ORG> in appeal proceedings The new Section for the first time gave power to the Controller of Estate Duty to assess or reassess property escaping assessment The Assistant Controller issued a notice on August to the trustees in exercise of the powers conferred by the new Section of the Act In that notice it was stated that he had reasons to believe that property chargeable under the Act to estate duty had escaped assessment by reason of under valuation and therefore a statement of account was called for in respect of the market value of the securities of Rs On September the present respondents filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging the validity and legality of the notice issued under Section of the Act and praying that it be quashed Secondly the conditions laid down in Section had not been fulfilled It had not been stated what information had been received or was in the possession of the Assistant Controller in consequence of which he had reason to believe that property had been undervalued The present appellant in the return filed to the writ petition in <ORG> claimed that Section as introduced by the Amendment Act was applicable and that <ORG> had expressed the opinion that the correct value of the securities should be of the face value as against as adopted in the assessment order and the appellate order had been received on August and therefore the appellant was fully justified in issuing the notice as he had reason to believe by virtue of information which had come into his possession that the securities had been undervalued The appellant preferred an appeal under Clause of the Letters Patent which was disposed of by <ORG> on July According to him any matter of fact or law which may come to the notice of the appellant after the making of assessment including a finding by a higher authority would be information for the purpose and within the meaning of Section It is then contended that Sections and confer ample powers on the specified authorities to revise the If the word information in its plain grammatical meaning includes information as to facts as well as information as to the state of the law it would be unreasonable to limit to information as to the facts on the extraneous consideration that some cases of assessment which need to be revised or rectified on the ground of mistake of law may conceivably be covered by Sections and it was said that the expression information in the context of Section of the Income tax Act must mean instruction or knowledge derived from extraneous sources concerning facts or particulars or as to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment The learned counsel for the respondents in the presence of the above state of law as settled by this court sought to contend that the question of valuation of the securities was neither purely one of fact nor of law and was a mixed question of law and fact and therefore it could not fall within the rule laid down in the aforesaid decisions When the expression information is understood in the sense of instruction or knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particulars or as to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment it is difficult to see how determination of valuation for the purpose of assessment of estate duty would not squarely fall within the meaning of the expression information in the context in which it occurs in Section of the Act The appeal is allowed and the order of <ORG> is set aside The case is remanded to <ORG> for disposal in accordance with law
