Although the Act contained provisions for the taking over of other secondary schools yet so far as the minority secondary schools are concerned the Act does not provide for any compulsory acquisition or taking over of the management and control of such schools The respondent urged inter alia that the Government has no intention to interfere with fundamental rights of the minority community to establish schools of its choice the provisions of the impugned Act are directed to ensure academic excellence and good management the management of the minority institutions had been given free hand in managing their institutions but in order to maintain education excellence and discipline regulatory provisions have been made in section of the Act the purpose of which is to ensure that the minority schools are managed by the properly constituted managing committees security of the services of the staff is ensured and in the matter of taking disciplinary action the managing committees should conform to the principles of natural justice etc Dismissing the writ petitions the <ORG> HELD By the various decisions of this <ORG> it is now well settled that the minorities based on religion or language have fundamental freedom to establish and manage educational institutions of their own choice but the <ORG> has the right to provide regulatory provisions for ensuring educational excellence conditions of employment of the teachers ensuring health hygiene and discipline and allied matters Such regulatory provisions do not interfere with the minorities fundamental right of administering their educational institutions instead they seek to ensure that such institutions are administered efficiently and that students who come out of the minority institutions after completion of their studies are well equipped with knowledge and training so as to stand at par in their avocation in life without any handicap If the minority institution seeks affiliation or recognition from the <ORG> or <ORG> the <ORG> has the right to prescribe syllabi and terms and conditions for giving such affiliation or recognition or extending the grants in aid These principles have to be borne in mind in considering the question of the validity of the statutory provisions relating to the minority educational institutions The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of sections and of the Act on the ground of interfering with their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article of the Constitution Section provides inter alia for the compulsory taking over of the management and control of the recognised non government secondary schools After elaborately going through the provisions of the said two sections dealing with the various aspects of the management administration and working of a minority institution the conclusion was that the two sections were not violative of Article of the Constitution and do not encroach upon the fundamental rights of a minority institution guaranteed under Article i of the Constitution The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> These petitions under Article of the Constitution of India challenge the constitutional validity of the Bihar Non Government Secondary Schools taking over of Management and Control Act Bihar Act No of on the ground that the provisions of the Act are violative of Article of the Constitution The petitioners aver that they have fundamental right under Article of the Constitution to administer the institutions established by them according to their choice and no interference in the administration of the educational institution is permissible under the Constitution They have challenged constitutional validity of the provisions of the Act and particularly the provisions contained in Section and Section of the Act which according to them interfere with their fundamental right guaranteed by Article of the Constitution Sub section provides that <ORG> may by notification in the official gazette from a specified date take over the management and control of a recognised minority secondary school if the managing committee of the secondary school voluntarily makes an unconditional offer to hand over the school with all moveable or immovable assets and properties owned or possessed by the school The management of every secondary school shall be under a committee constituted in accordance with the provisions of Section of the Act Section provides for the establishment of <ORG> a corporate body having perpetual succession and common seal Section creates <ORG> Section provides that the fund shall be used for payment of salary and allowances to the Headmaster teachers and other employees of schools including the minority secondary schools and grants for other expenditure of schools Section provides for the constitution of <ORG> for making recommendation to <ORG> on the questions relating to the taking over of management of the secondary schools their improvement and upgradation Section confers power on <ORG> to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act Every rule made under this provision is required to be laid before both the Houses of <ORG> The managing committee is required to appoint teachers with the concurrence of <ORG> The managing committee shall prescribe rules regarding the service condition of teachers based on natural justice and prevailing law and it shall have powers to remove dismiss terminate or discharge a teacher from service with the approval of <ORG> After the take over the management and control of the secondary schools shall be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Act by a managing committee constituted in accordance with the provisions of the Act Prior to the take over under this Act it appears that there were five classes of secondary schools functioning in the State of Bihar they were i <ORG> schools maintained and established and administered by private individuals and societies ii secondary schools established and managed by minorities community and recognised as minority schools by <ORG> iii proprietory secondary schools established and maintained entirely by trusts associations or a corporate bodies declared as proprietory schools by <ORG> iv centrally sponsored secondary schools established or managed by <ORG> or an undertaking owned or controlled by <ORG> or by any department of <ORG> Government and recognised by the Education Department of <ORG> and Iv autonomous secondary schools residential schools recognised by <ORG> imparting education in accordance with curriculum prescribed for secondary schools and under the Rules approved by <ORG> Although the Act contains provisions for taking over of other secondary schools if and when circumstances as contemplated by the Act are found to exist but so far as minority secondary schools are concerned the Act does not provide for any compulsory acquisition or taking over of the management and control of such schools The management and control of non government secondary schools taken over by the <ORG> under Section of the Act are required to be carried on in accordance with the provisions contained in Section to of the Act Right of minorities establish and administer educational institutions All minorities whether based on religion or language shall have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice A In making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority referred to in clause the <ORG> shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause In plain terms Article protect the right of the minorities whether based on religion or language to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The Article confers a fundamental right on the minorities to protect their interest Clause A provides that the <ORG> while making law for compulsory acquisition of property of any minority educational institution shall ensure that the amount of compensation paid for the acquisition of property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under Clause of Article It does not say that minorities based on religion should establish educational institutions for teaching religion only or that linguistic minorities should have the right to establish educational institutions for teaching their language only What the Article says and means is that the religious and the linguistic minorities should have the right to establish educational institutions of their choice Pages The next thing to note is that the Article in terms gives all minorities whether based on religion or language two rights namely the right to establish and the right to administer educational institutions of their choice Considering the extent of <ORG> power to regulate educational standards service conditions and discipline in the minority institutions the <ORG> observed We have already observed that Article gives two rights to the minorities i to establish and ii to administer educational institutions of their choice The right to administer cannot obviously include the right to maladministration The minority cannot surely ask for aid or recognition for an educational institution run by them in unhealthy surroundings without any competent teachers possessing any semblance of qualification and which does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which teaches matters sub versive of the welfare of the scholars It stands to reason then that the constitutional right to administer an educational institution of their choice does not necessarily militate against the claim of the <ORG> to insist that in order to grant aid the <ORG> may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the institutions to be aided <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed There is however an exception to this and it is that the standards of education are not a part of management as such Therefore if universities establish syllabi for examinations they must be followed subject however to special subjects which the institutions may seek to teach and to a certain extent the <ORG> may also regulate the conditions of employment of teachers and the health and hygiene of students Yet the right of the <ORG> to regulate education educational standards and allied matters cannot be denied Ray Observed thus The minority institutions have the right to administer institutions The best compliment that can be paid to a minority institution is that it does not rest on or proclaim its minority character The right of a minority to administer its educational institution involves as part of it a correlative duty of good administration Measures which are directed at other forms of activities but which have a secondary or direct or incidental effect upon the right do not generally abridge a right unless the content of the right is regulated If an educational institution established by a religious minority seeks no recognition affiliation or aid the state may have no right to prescribe the curriculum syllabi or the qualification of the teachers In view of these decisions it is now well settled that minorities based on religion or language have fundamental freedom to establish and manage educational institutions of their own choice but the State has right to provide regulatory provisions for ensuring educational excellence conditions of employment of teachers ensuring health hygiene and discipline and allied matters Such regulatory provisions do not interfere with the minorities fundamental right of administering their educational institutions instead they seek to ensure that such institution is administered efficiently and that students who come out of minority institution after completion of their studies are well equipped with knowledge and training so as to stand at par in their avocation in life without any handicap If the minority institution seeks affiliation or recognition from the <ORG> or <ORG> the <ORG> has the right to prescribe syllabi and terms and conditions for giving such affiliation or recognition or extending grants in aid Minority institutions may be categorised in three classes i educational institutions which neither seek aid nor recognition from the <ORG> ii institutions that seek aid from the <ORG> and iii educational institutions which seek recognition but not aid Minority institutions which fall in the first category are free to administer their institution in the manner they like the <ORG> has no power under the Constitution to place any restriction on their right of administration This does not mean that an unaided minority institution is immune from operation of general laws of the land A minority institution cannot claim immunity from contract law tax measures economic regulations social welfare legislation labour and industrial laws and similar other measures which are intended to meet the need of the society But institutions falling within the second and third categories are subject to regulatory provisions which the <ORG> may impose It is open to the <ORG> to prescribe conditions for granting recognition or disbursing aid While the <ORG> has every right to prescribe conditions for granting recognition or disbursing aid it cannot under the guise of that power prescribe onerous conditions compelling the minority institution to surrender their rights of administration to the Government These principles have to be borne in mind in considering the question of validity of statutory provisions relating to minority educational institutions Since the petitioners challenge the Constitutional validity of Sections and of the Act we consider it necessary to reproduce the same The State Government may by notification in the official gazette take over the management and control of such schools and on such terms and conditions as the government may deem proper which have already received permission of establishment from <ORG> or of such schools imparting Secondary Education which have applied for permission of establish ment to the said Board immediately before the date of promulgation of this Act and the utility of such school is proved in the eye of the government and which fulfil within years of the promulgation of the ordinance the conditions lay down by <ORG> with regard to land building furniture equipments and enrollment The State Government may by notification recognise as a minority secondary school such secondary school which has been established by a minority community on the basis of religion or language for the purposes of meeting the educational requirement and for the protection of culture of their section and which fulfils the prescribed condition of recognition Provided that while considering the question of giving approval to appointment of any teacher under this sub section the board shall only scrutinise as to whether the proposed appointment is in accordance with the rules laying down the qualification and the manner of making appointment framed by <ORG> has been followed or not and no more <ORG> with the approval of <ORG> shall have powers to remove a teacher to terminate his services to dismiss and to discharge him from service i It shall be their duty to obey instructions regarding admission and transfer of the students discipline and punishment records and accounts curricular and co curricular activity rules regarding health and cleanliness issued or made by the State Government The State Government shall have powers to issue instructions not inconsistent with the provisions of Articles and of the Constitution for efficient management and for improving and standard of teaching and it shall be obligatory for the recognised minority schools to comply with them Section of the impugned Act provides for compulsory acquisition or taking over of the administration or assets of <ORG> schools There were five categories of secondary schools functioning in the <ORG> of Bihar and out of them the management and control of only non government secondary schools have been taken over by the <ORG> As regards Section it confers power on <ORG> to take over the management and control of recognised minority schools proprietary or autonomous secondary schools by issuing a notification in the official <ORG> provided the managing committee trust association or the corporate body which may have been maintaining such schools makes an unconditional offer to <ORG> to make over the school with all assets and properties If <ORG> accepts the offer and considers it necessary to take over the management of such a school it may lay down terms and conditions for the take over of the management and control of the school Section does not confer any power on the <ORG> to compulsorily acquire or take over the management of a minority school instead the management is free to maintain and carry on the administration of its school and the <ORG> has no power to interfere with its administration There is however no compulsion on the management of a minority school to make over the school to the Government There is therefore no question of Section infringing the rights of minority institutions Section confers power on <ORG> to take over the management and control of the secondary schools which may not have been recognised on the date of the enforcement of the ordinance of the Act It provides that <ORG> may take over the management and control of such schools on terms and conditions which the Government may deem proper This brings us to the question as to whether the provisions of Section violate Article Section lays down conditions under which a recognised minority secondary school shall be managed and controlled The <ORG> or any other authority has no power or authority to impose any terms or conditions for the constitution of the managing committee This clause is in the interest of the minority institution itself as no outsider is imposed as a member of <ORG> there is no interference with the minorities right to administer its school Clause provides for two things firstly it requires the managing committee of a minority school to appoint teachers possessing requisite qualifications as prescribed by the <ORG> Government for appointment of teachers of other nationalised schools secondly the managing committee is required to make appointment of a teacher with the concurrence of <ORG> constituted under Section of the Act The proviso makes it clear that <ORG> has no further power to interfere with the right of managing committee of a minority school in the appointment of a teacher Object and purpose underlying clause is to ensure that the teachers appointed in a minority school should possess requisite qualifications and they are appointed in accordance with the procedure prescribed and the appointments are made for the sanctioned strength The selection and appointment of teachers is left to the management of the minority school there is no interference with the managerial rights of the institution Clause requires a minority school to frame rules regulating conditions of service of its teachers such rules should be consistent with principles of natural justice and the prevailing law This clause in substance lays down that the management of a recognised minority school shall frame Rules regulating conditions of service of teachers and such rules shall conform to principles of natural justice and prevailing law In a civilised society the observance of principles of natural justice is an accepted rule these principles contain basic rules of fair play and justice and it is too late in the day to contend that while administering a minority school the management should have right to act in contravention of the princi ples of natural justice Clause is regulatory in nature which requires the managing committee to frame rules of employment consistent with principles of natural justice and the prevailing law There is therefore no element of interference with the management right to administer a minority school Learned counsel for the petitioner took serious objection to the provisions contained in clause of Section which lays down that the managing committee of a minority institution shall have power to remove terminate dismiss or discharge a teacher with the approval of <ORG> It was urged that <ORG> has been imposed as a higher authority over the management if the <ORG> refused to grant approval to the disciplinary action taken by the management against a teacher the management right of administration would be affected adversely We do not find any substance in the submissions Indisputably power to remove dismiss terminate or discharge a teacher from service is an essential attribute of management right but clause does not invest that power on any outside agency The power to take disciplinary action vests in the managing committee of the minority school it is required to exercise that power in accordance with the rules framed by it The <ORG> is not invested with any veto or blanket power without any guidance on the other hand it has limited power and guidelines are prescribed for the exercise of such powers Clause of Section expressly provides that while considering the question of granting approval to the disciplinary action taken by the management of a minority institution <ORG> shall scrutinise whether disciplinary proceedings had been taken in accordance with the rules and no more Regulatory provisions requiring approval of disciplinary action taken by the management of a minority institution have been upheld by this <ORG> in a number of cases In Re Kerala Education Bill case this Court upheld the validity of clauses and of the Bill In the latter case this Court observed that while the right of the minority to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice cannot be interfered with restrictions by way of regulations for the purpose of ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof can validly be prescribed The Court further held that ordinance conferred a right of veto in disciplinary matters of minority institution it did not lay down any guidelines instead it conferred an uncanalised and unguided power on the appellate authority this Court held that Section and of the Andhra Pradesh Recognised Private Educational Institution Control Act could not be applied to a minority institution as the provisions contained therein encroached upon the fundamental right of minorities guaranteed to them under Article of the Constitution Section conferred appellate power on an outside authority to interfere with the disciplinary action taken by the managing committee of an educational institution This Court majority held that the unqualified power conferred on an outside authority which was made a judge of both facts and law the exercise of which was made to depend purely on subjective considerations constituted an infringement of the right guaranteed by Article of the Constitution As already discussed clauses and of Section of the Act are regulatory in nature to ensure the educational standard of security of employment of teachers and no unguided uncanalised blanket power in the nature of veto or appellate power has been conferred on any outside agency against the disciplinary action taken by the management of a minority institution <ORG> is vested with limited power to see that the person proposed to be appointed possesses the requisite qualifications prescribed and that the prescribed method of selection was followed by the management Similarly in disciplinary matters also the managing committee of a minority school has full power to remove terminate or discharge a teacher but it has to obtain the approval of <ORG> here again <ORG> has a limited power to ascertain whether the disciplinary proceedings have been taken in accordance with the rules framed by the management itself <ORG> has no Other power in the matter If mentally and physically incapacitated person are appointed to a minority institution it will serve no useful purpose instead the institution will suffer therefore appointment of disabled persons will not be In the <ORG> of Bihar the age of superannuation is fixed at years for its employees Clause provides that only such fees shall be charged from the students as prescribed by the <ORG> Government and the management is not permitted to charge higher fees except with prior approval of the <ORG> Government In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> it has been stated that education upto matriculation is free in the <ORG> and therefore no fees is charged from the students it may place the necessary facts and circumstances before <ORG> and in that event <ORG> shall consider the question of granting permission Clause i of Section provides that it shall be the duty of the minority institution to obey instructions regarding admission and transfer of the students discipline and punishment records and accounts curricular and co curricular activities rules regarding health and cleanliness issued or made by the <ORG> No instructions or rules as contemplated by clause i of Section were placed before us by the petitioners which may have tendency to interfere with the minorities right of administration of their institutions It must be borne in mind that as the aided minority institutions receive money from public revenues the <ORG> <ORG> is entitled to issue instructions or frame rules for the maintenance of records and accounts and such instructions or rules would not interfere with the minorities right under Article of the Constitution Clauses and of Section confer power on <ORG> to issue instructions consistent with the provisions of Articles and of the Constitution for efficient management and for improving the standard of teaching and a minority school is required to comply with those instructions <ORG> has power to make regulatory provisions for achieving efficiency in the management and improving the standard of education in the minority schools it may therefore issue instructions for securing that purpose If instructions are issued for the better management of the minority schools no grievance to their validity can be raised as now it is well settled by a number of authorities of this Court that a minority institution has right to administer its educational institution but it has no right to maladministration This Court answered the question in affirmative The Court held that the labour legislation was applicable to the management of a minority educational institution and it observed thus These rights which are enforced through the several pieces of labour legislation in India have got to be applied to every workman irrespective of the character of the management Implementation of these rights involves the obedience to several labour laws including the Act which is under consideration in this case which are brought into force in the country If such laws are made inapplicable to minority educational institutions there is every likelihood of such institutions being subjected to mal administration If a creditor of a minority educational institution or a contractor who has built the building of such institution is permitted to file a suit for recovery of the money or damages as the case may be to him against such institution and to bring the properties of such institution to sale to realise the decretal amount due under the decree passed in such suit is Article violated Certainly not Similarly the right guaranteed under Article of the Constitution is not violated if a minority school is ordered to be closed when an epidemic breaks out in the neighbourhood if a minority school building is ordered to be pulled down when it is constructed contrary to town planning law or if a decree for possession is passed in favour of the true owner of the land when a school is built on a land which is not owned by the management of a minority school
