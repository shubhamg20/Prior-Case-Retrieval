It is now contended in second appeal that the application of the th August ought to be regarded as a continuation of the application filed on the th June and that the suit instituted by the decree holder on the nd March and the appeal presented to <ORG> ought to be regarded as being in the nature of applications to take some step in aid of the execution of the decree and that the decree holders ought to be allowed to reckon their time either from the nd July or from the th March That this was the reason for the rule laid down in those cases will appear from the observations of <NAME> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> In that case the learned Judge observes Whatever may be the form of the last application dated the th December in substance it was an application to the <ORG> for the continuation of the former proceedings on the ground that the bar that was set up by reason of the adverse order under Section had been removed by the decision in the subsequent regular suit Their present application is for the sale of that third share of the property there was no bar then to their enforcing the execution of the decree and there has been no subsequent removal of that bar Proper <ORG> again as defined by Explanation II of that article means the <ORG> whose duty it is whether under Section or Section of the Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise to execute the decree or order Therefore evidently the provision of law just referred to contemplates an application made in the course of execution to the <ORG> whose duty it was to execute the decree and cannot be taken to include a suit to have an order in a claim case set aside We therefore think that <ORG> was right and that this appeal must be dismissed with costs
