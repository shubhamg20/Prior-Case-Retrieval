If there was no income there was no question of applying a rate to the total income and no income tax or super tax could possibly result The word additional in the expression additional income tax implied that there was a tax before The expressions charge on the total income and profits liable to tax in paragraph contemplated only those cases where there was income and not cases where there was loss Consequently the expression dividends payable out of such profits could only apply when there were profits and not when there were no profits There were no words in this proviso making the excess dividend into income or subjecting it to tax independently of the charge to tax on the total income Appeal from the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> in Income tax Reference No of We are concerned with the Finance Act and Paragraph of the First Schedule reads In the case of every company Rate Surcharge On the whole of Four annas one twentieth total income in the of the rate rupee specified in the preceding column Provided that in the case of a company which in respect of its profits liable to tax under the Income tax Act for the year ending on the st day of March has made the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment within the territory of India excluding the State of Jammu and Kashmir of the dividends payable out of such profits and has deducted super tax from the dividends in accordance with the provisions of subsection or of section of the Act i Where the total income as reduced by seven annas in the rupee and by the amount if any exempt from income tax exceeds the amount of any dividends including dividends payable at a fixed rate declared in respect of the whole or part of the previous year for the assessment for the year ending on the st day of March and no order has been made under sub section of section A of the Income tax Act a rebate shall be allowed at the rate of one anna per rupee on the amount of such excess ii Where the amount of dividends referred to in clause above exceeds the total income as reduced by seven annas in the rupee and by the amount if any exempt from income tax there shall be charged on the total income an additional income tax equal to the sum if any by which the aggregate amount of income tax actually borne by such excess hereinafter referred to as the excess dividend falls short of the amount calculated at the rate of five annas per rupee on the excess dividend For the purposes of clause ii of the above proviso the aggregate amount of income tax actually borne by the excess dividend shall be determined as We follows i the excess dividend shall be deemed to be out of the whole or such portion of the undistributed profits of one or more years immediately preceding the previous year as would be just sufficient to cover the amount of the excess dividend and as have not likewise been taken into account to cover an excess dividend of a preceding year ii such portion of the excess dividend as is deemed to be out of the undistributed profits of each of the said years shall be deemed to have borne tax a if an order has been made under sub section of section A of the Income tax Act in respect of the undistributed profits of that year at the rate of five annas in the rupee and in respect of any other year at the rate applicable to the total income of the company for that year reduced by the rate at which rebate if any was allowed on the undistributed profits The <ORG> interpreted the Paragraph to cover even a case where there was a loss holding that even a loss may be a total income because if total income had to be computed in the manner laid down in the Indian Income tax Act the total income might be a negative figure Section of the Finance Act prescribes the rates of income tax by its First Schedule and by the seventh subsection of that section provides For the purposes of this section and of the rates of tax imposed thereby the expression total income means total income as determined for the purposes of income tax or super tax as the case may be in accordance with the provisions of the Income tax Act It is thus clear from this that if there is no income there is no question of applying a rate to the total income and no income tax or super tax can possibly result If only nine annas in the rupee from the income were paid as dividend there were no consequences in law There was however a provision for enhanced tax hereinafter referred to as the excess dividend falls short of the amount calculated at the rate of five annas per rupee on the excess dividend In simpler language there was a rebate of one anna on anything saved from th of the total income and there was an extra payment of one anna on the amount paid in excess of it Where there is a total income and there is a payment of dividend either more or less than the limit fixed one can easily find the figures by which the total income as reduced exceeds or falls short of the dividends and the additional tax that has to be paid In that case however there were determinative words helping construction The words if it had been a county court action which were read as implicit in the section were necessary to give a sensible meaning consistent with the intention expressed by other clear words This Court laid down that a construction which leads to such a result must if that is possible be avoided Section of the English Finance Act contained a reference to Paragraph a of the proviso to sub of of the Incometax Act and the section went on to say of that Paragraph parenthetically which relates to the deductions allowable in computing the actual income from all sources of an investment company in relation to which a direction is in force under sub section I of I In fact the proviso merely deals with the deductions to be allowed in computing actual income But the words in brackets in Section refer to deductions in computing actual income of a company in relation to which a direction is in force under Section It would seem that these words have crept in because the draftsman assumed that a direction would always be given automatically in the case of an investment company and did not realise that a computation must first be made to determine whether the company has in fact any actual income The learned counsel for the respondent on the other hand relies upon the observations of <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> to the effect that in a taxing measure one can only look at the language since there is no room for an intendment It cannot even be urged that unless this meaning is given to the Section it can have no operation There is no doubt that if the words of a taxing statute fail then so must the tax The words charge on the total income are not appropriate to describe a case in which there is no income or there is loss The last expression dividends payable out of such profits can only apply when there are profits and not when there are no profits It is clear that the legislature had in mind the case of persons paying dividends beyond a reasonable portion of their income income tax is conditioned by the existence of income and profits to the total of which income the rate is made applicable where Lord Simonds observed at Upon this proviso interpreted in the light of Paragraph of the Schedule as amended the <ORG> makes a very simple case upon the undisputed figures the gross relevant distributions were pound and the profits including franked investment income were nil I may interpolate that the reference to abatement may throughout be disregarded therefore the net relevant distribution must be the excess of pound over nil i pound nothing has to be brought in under a of the proviso for there were no profits Reliance was also placed upon the observations at ibid where it was observed The learned Dean of Faculty on behalf of the Respondents urged in support of the construction that he invited your Lordships to adopt that it was really meaningless to speak of a nil profit or of adding something to it and this plea found favour with the Lord President As I understood it this was only relevant if the view was accepted that there were two separate operations and not a single I computation These passages were used in the other case decided today in which there were no profits of the previous years There is however this difficulty that there the tax was laid on the net relevant distribution and it was conceded that no charge could be imposed if the proviso was inapplicable see There are no words here making the excess dividend into income or subjecting it to tax independently of the charge to tax on the total income It remains to consider two other arguments which were addressed to us on behalf of the Commissioner The learned Chief Justice observes There seems to be no logic there seems to be no reason nor principle why a distinction should be made between the cases of two such companies We do not accept both the arguments and agree with <ORG> in the answer given to the first question
