On receipt of information the petitioner filed his objections and in spite of repeated requests pointing out the urgency for the disposal of the goods the petitioner did not get any reply from the authority but came to know that his commission agent at Kodikonda received a notice that the jaggery would be sold on th October Before the order of confiscation could be passed the petitioner filed this application challenging the action of the Commercial Tax Officer on two grounds firstly that Section of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act in so far as it provides for confiscation of goods is ultra vires of the <ORG> and secondly that in any event the said power of confiscation is invalid as it violates the fundamental right of the petitioner guaranteed to him under Article of the Constitution of India being an unreasonable restriction on the holding of property This is an application under Article of the Constitution of India for the issue of an order in the nature of mandamus directing the Assistant Commercial Tax Officer <NAME> to return the goods confiscated by him from the petitioner under the following circumstances The petitioner is a firm of merchants doing business in various commodities including fertilizers Without filing an appeal against the order of confiscation the petitioner filed the present writ petition to this Court raising two questions firstly that Section of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act is ultra vires of <ORG> and secondly that in any event the said provision of law offends Articles and and of the Constitution of India We would have been extremely reluctant to entertain these writ petitions at the instance of the parties who have failed to pursue the remedies provided under the Act except for the fact that the cases were posted before <ORG> by a learned Judge of this Court on the ground that they raised questions challenging the vires of the statute and also questions of constitutional validity Sub section confers the power to enter and search at all reasonable times any office shop godown vessel vehicle or any other place of business or any building or place where such officer has reason to believe that the dealer has been keeping the goods accounts etc Sub section gives the power to the officer to break open any box in which any accounts or documents are kept or to break open the door of any premises where such documents may be kept Sub section of Section which is impugned before us runs as follows Any such officer shall have power to seize and confiscate any goods which are found in any office shop godown vehicle vessel or any other place of business or any building or place of the dealer but not accounted for by the dealer in his accounts registers and other documents maintained in the course of his business Provided that before taking action for the confiscation of goods under this sub section the officer shall give the person affected an opportunity of being heard and make an inquiry in the prescribed manner Section lays down the procedure for the establishment of check post or barrier and for inspection of goods while in transit Sub section of Section provides for the setting up of a check post or a barrier at a place to be notified with a view to prevent or check the evasion of tax under the Act Sub section which prescribes for confiscation reads as follows The officer in charge of the check post or barrier or the officer empowered as aforesaid shall have power to seize and confiscate any goods which are under transport by a goods vehicle or a boat and are not covered by a way bill issued by the person who consigns the goods in such form and containing such particulars as may be prescribed Provided that before taking action for the confiscation of the goods under this sub section the officer shall give the person affected an opportunity of being heard and make an inquiry in the manner prescribed Rule of the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Rules of prescribes an elaborate procedure as to how dealers liable to pay tax under the Act should maintain accounts vouchers registers etc If the officer is satisfied that there has been no evasion of tax he may for reasons to be recorded in writing order the release of the confiscated goods Rule runs as follows If any officer authorised under Section of the Act finds any goods in any office shop godown vehicle vessel or any other place of business or any other building or place of a dealer which have not been accounted for in his accounts registers or other documents maintained in the course of his business he may seize and confiscate such goods after following the procedure prescribed in Rule As already stated the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that the power to confiscate the goods does not fall within the ambit and scope of the legislative power conferred on the <ORG> under Entry of List II of Schedule VII appended to the Constitution of India It is now well settled by more than one decision of <ORG> that the power to levy a tax includes all incidental powers to prevent the evasion of such tax Even so there is a limit to such incidental or ancillary power flowing from the legislative entries in the various lists in the Seventh Schedule These incidental and ancillary powers have to be exercised in aid of the main topic of legislation which in the present case is a tax on sale or purchase of goods All powers necessary for the levy and collection of the tax concerned and for seeing that the tax is not evaded are comprised within the ambit of the legislative entry as ancillary or incidental It was held in the above decision of <ORG> i that the power to legislate on a topic of legislation carries with it the power to legislate on an ancillary matter which can be said to be reasonably included in the power given and that the power to provide for the taking of steps to prevent evasion of tax is reasonably related to the legislative power itself of imposing such tax ii that persons who are not directly liable to pay the tax may also have their activities reasonably restricted with a view to prevent the principal persons liable to tax from evading payment of tax iii that Section A of the Mysore Sales Tax Act does not purport to levy any tax and therefore there is no possibility of either exempted goods or inter State transactions being exposed to levy of tax not lawfully exigible and iv that the section does not say that the payment demanded by it though not a tax shall be paid as if it were a tax and that what it does is to make certain provisions with a view to prevent evasion of tax and to impose penalty for contravention of those provisions Referring to Sub section of Section A of the Mysore Sales Tax Act which provides for confiscation or payment of certain sum of money in lieu thereof the learned Judges observed that the said amount or the confiscation is not intended to be collected as a tax but obviously it is in the nature of a punishment for contravention of the section rendering the goods liable for confiscation What it does is to make certain provisions with a view to prevent evasion of tax and to impose penalty for contravention of those provisions We will refer to this point at the appropriate stage It was observed as follows referring to the above <ORG> decision Though there is no analogy to the present context the principle of this decision is clear that what has been properly a subject within the ambit of a legislative head of power including ancillary and incidental powers flowing therefrom cannot be indirectly legislated upon under the guise of making a law which might otherwise be within the limits of legislative head of power It was further observed that the power of confiscation cannot be ancillary or incidental to the power to tax a sale or a purchase even from the standpoint of checking evasion or making evasion unprofitable that the Act is not a law on goods and that no such law can be made in the guise of Entry Sub clause of that section provided that every person who has collected any amount by way of tax otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of that Act shall pay over to the <ORG> the amount so collected by him and in default the amount shall be recovered as if it were arrears of land revenue In other words the State <ORG> has no power to collect money which is not a tax as if it were a tax In this connection we are inclined to agree with the view of the learned Judges of <ORG> that the power to seize and confiscate the goods is only by way of punishment or penalty which is intended to operate as the most effective deterrent against tax evaders and that it is therefore ancillary in the sense that it seeks to achieve the object of preventing evasion of tax It is contended by <NAME> the learned counsel for the petitioner that though confiscation of goods may be one of the modes of checking evasion of tax it is not an ancillary power because it may not be necessary to impose such a drastic step and that a mere inspection of the accounts or the goods and documents etc are unreasonable and not saved by Article of the Constitution of India <ORG> observed as follows The basis of this argument was that there is no procedure laid down in the provisions for levying penalties nor any provision made for notice or taking of evidence and power of confiscation was given to persons who could not be termed unbiassed If the tribunal is to act judicially it must conform to the principles of natural justice of audi alterant partem and there is no dispute that in the instant case there was no breach of this rule It would be apparent that this is in line with the great principle underlying the structure of the rights guaranteed by Article viz a balancing of the need for individual liberty in the matter inter alia of the right to hold property or of the right to carry on trade with the need for social control in order that the freedoms guaranteed to the individual subserve the larger needs moral social economic and polictical of the community and thus ensure orderly progress towards the goal indicated by the preamble Referring to the argument under Article of the Constitution it was again observed in the said ruling as follows No doubt there are situations when the points regarding a violation of Article and an objection that a restriction is not reasonable so as to conform to the requirements of Article or may converge and appear merely as presenting the same question viewed from different angles Such for instance are cases when the denial of equality before the law is based on the ground that the power vested say in an administrative authority to affect rights guaranteed to a citizen is arbitrary being ungraded or uncanalised The vesting of such a power would also amount to the imposition of an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of the guaranteed right to trade or carry on a business etc As already pointed out the rules lay down an elaborate procedure and contemplate various stages before the order of confiscation is passed We cannot assume that the officers entrusted with the said duties are bound to be arbitrary and not amenable to reason It was further argued by the learned Advocate for the petitioners that the moment goods are seized there is no more opportunity for the party to state his case At this stage the party is given an opportunity to show cause why the goods should not be confiscated It is only when the explanation is found unsatisfactory that the officer has to pass the order of confiscation and until he passes such order of confiscation he merely retains the goods in his custody Hence it cannot be said that confiscation of the goods provided for under the Act is not preceded by any enquiry giving opportunity to the party to show cause against the same In the view we have taken above it is not necessary to deal with the alternative argument advanced by Sri <NAME> on behalf of the <ORG> that even if the provisions of Sections and of the Act do not fall within the scope and ambit of Entry relating to taxation of sale or purchase of goods it may be brought in under Entry of List II which relates to trade and commerce If the said statement is correct an order of confiscation has to be passed in which case the petitioner will have a right of appeal to show cause against the same The writ petition is therefore allowed in part but there will be no order as to costs
