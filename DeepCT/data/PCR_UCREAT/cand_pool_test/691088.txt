There was another company known as <ORG> and Mr <NAME> was director of both these companies No application for shares was made on behalf of the assesee company and no share was acquired The judgment of the Court was delivered by HIDAYATULLAH The assessee <ORG> Alleppey claimed a deduction of Rs There was another private limited company known as <ORG> Pondicherry and its directors were No application for shares was made on behalf of the assessee company and the shares were not acquired He held that the advance was made for the purpose of purchasing shares of the new company then in formation and it was thus made for the acquisition of a capital asset which was either the control of the new company or to gain its good will likely to result in the grant of agency rights to the assessee company can be claimed by the assessee as a bad debt written off under the provisions of Section xi of the Act ii Whether on the facts and in the circums tances of the case the assessee can claim the sum of Rs These questions show that the deduction was claimed i as a loss in the doing of the business under ii as a bad debt actually written off under xi and iii as an expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business under xv of the Income tax Act The assessee company should have requested <ORG> at some stage to frame a question that there was no material for the <ORG> to reach the conclusion that this was not a business transaction but a case of an advance out of personal motives But this was not the same thing as saying that the <ORG> had no material before it on which it could reach the conclusion that this was not an advance in the ordinary course of business by the assessee company No doubt <ORG> in its order calling for a statement of the case has observed that there was no dispute at any earlier stage that this was not in the ordinary course of business but that conclusion of <ORG> in the order it made under can have no relevance or binding force It was open to <ORG> to frame a question whether there was any material to support the finding of the <ORG> and to ask the <ORG> to state a case thereon Clauses xi and xv of read as follows Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely a xi when the assessee accounts in respect of any part of his business profession or vocation are not kept on the cash basis such sum in respect of bad and doubtful debts due to the assessee in respect of that part of his business profession or vocation and in the case of an assessee carrying on a banking or money lending business such sum in respect of loans made in the ordinary course of such business as the Income tax Officer may estimate to be irrecoverable but not exceeding the amount actually written off as irrecoverable in the books of the assessee Proviso omitted xv any expenditure not being an allowance of the nature described in any of the clauses i to xiv inclusive and not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business profession or vocations In support of its case the assessee company stated that as there was no dispute about the facts that this was an advance in the ordinary course of business it should be treated as a trading loss or alternatively as a bad debt or an expenditure claimable under xv <ORG> also referred to these accounts and they have been construed as showing that there was an attempt by the assessee company to acquire a capital asset are shown as amounts paid to you by <ORG> Madras towards purchase of shares In this connection we were referred to the Memorandum of Association to show that it was one of the objects of the assessee company to promote other companies and this amount was paid to <ORG> to promote <ORG> There is no doubt that the objects mentioned in the Memorandum of Association of the assessee company include the promotion and financing of other companies Here the different versions given in the books of account of the assessee company belie the assertion that this was an amount paid to promote <ORG> Even though this money was available on December and the subscription list for the shares remained open from January to no application for a single share was made on behalf of the assessee company that the High Court was wrong in saying that before the assessee could claim the deduction under xi it must prove that it had in the past purchased and sold agencies that the object of the assessee company was to apply for shares but as it did not apply for shares the transaction between it and <ORG> remained an advance in the ordinary course of business and <ORG> having failed to give back the money the assessee company was within its rights to write off this bad and doubtful debt Now a question under xi can only arise if there is a bad or doubtful debt It means something which is related to business or results from it One part deals with an assessee who carries on the business of a banker or money lender In the result the appeal must fail and it is dismissed
