In this reference under Sub section of Section of the I Act for the assessment year the following questions have been referred to this court for answer The assessee company under an agreement dated August had taken a loan from <ORG> for making payment in the United States of America of the price of capital plant and machinery purchased for the new project viz This is an important fact which is to be borne in mind On June there was devaluation of the Indian rupee and therefore the liability of the assessee company for repayment of loan to <ORG> in dollars increased in terms of rupees to Rs The <ORG> relying on some other point upheld the findings of the <ORG> on these two aspects We have considered the rival submissions It follows therefore that if there was any profit or loss on account of devaluation in respect of this liability it was on capital account This could not therefore be allowed as a deduction in computing the business profit and was rightly disallowed by the revenue authorities We will now deal with the alternative issue raised by the assessee company that even if the loss on devaluation was considered to be capital loss development rebate should have been allowed on the increased liability arising out of devaluation attributable to plant and machinery installed during the previous year amounting to Rs Here again it is not under dispute that out of the loan taken from <ORG> payments were made to suppliers of capital plant and machinery in the USA and the plant and machinery which were installed during the previous year were those items of plant and machinery in respect of which payments had already been made by the assessee company before the date of devaluation As mentioned hereinbefore a large number of decisions were cited and we shall note the decisions before we come to our conclusion Reliance was placed on behalf of the revenue in aid of the submission that borrowed money after borrowing would become the assessee money and if the principle of law was that the assessee money if utilised for capital purposes and in respect of the same there was any increased liability due to devolution then such increased liability was on capital account and not on revenue account Under Section of the I Act the <ORG> was only authorised it was held to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act It was further held by the full court that interest paid by the assessee was business expenditure and was allowable as a deduction under Section xv If the outgoing or an expenditure was so related to the carrying on or conduct of the business that it might be regarded as an integral part of the profit earning process and not for acquisition of an asset or a right of a permanent character the possession of which was a condition to the carrying on of the business the expenditure might be regarded as revenue expenditure But mainly reliance was placed on behalf of the assessee on a decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <ORG> CIT ITR CIT ITR <ORG> further noted that Justice <NAME> after referring to a number of cases felt that the raising of capital by issue of debentures was a recognised mode of raising capital and he further held that the decided cases had laid down the proposition that borrowing money by the issue of debentures was an acquisition of capital asset and that any commission or expenditure incurred in respect thereof was of a capital nature and not to be considered as in the nature of revenue It has however to be emphasised in view of the several subsequent decisions of <ORG> that there <ORG> was not concerned actually with any interest to be paid on account of borrowed money There it has to be emphasised the court was considering the question of expenditure incurred in obtaining the loan In that context reference was made to the observations of <ORG> that the ratio of the aforesaid decision of <ORG> was that the loan was a liability and the loan obtained had to be repaid though the period of repayment might be either long or short It was held by <ORG> that the Act of retaining the monies in the A for capital purposes after obtaining the sanction of <ORG> was not a trading transaction in the business of manufacture of locomotive boilers and locomotives It was clearly a transaction of accumulating dollars to pay for capital goods the first step in the acquisition of capital goods There what had happened was that the assessee company was a British company carrying on the business of sale and distribution of petroleum products in China and it employed a number of Chinese agents to whom petroleum products were consigned for which the payments were not made beforehand There was then a depreciation of the Chinese dollars with respect to sterling and the amounts required to repay the deposits of the agents in Chinese dollars were much less than the amounts held by the company to meet their claims <NAME> held that the question was whether it was a trading profit or a merely capital profit was a question of fact on which there was evidence to support the conclusion of the Special Commissioners arid that he was therefore not entitled to interfere with their finding <ORG> was of the view that the question whether the Special Commissioners were right in holding that the exchange profit was a capital profit not subject to income tax was properly framed by them as a question of law and that it was open to the court to go into that question It further held and it is important for us that it was not a trading profit but it was simply the equivalent of an appreciation in a capital asset not forming part of the assets employed as a circulating capital in the trade and it was therefore not assessable to tax Now in this case strong reliance was placed by the learned advocate for the assessee on the observations of Lord Justice <NAME> of <ORG> at page of the report where he had set out the relevant facts and thereupon observed as follows As regards the law to be applied there is a considerable measure of agreement between the parties There is the case of <ORG> <NAME> TC KB which is a decision of my brother <NAME> as a judge of first instance There the appellants who carried on business as fur and skin merchants and as agents were appointed sole commission agents of a company for the sale in Britain and elsewhere of furs exported from Russia on the terms inter alia that they should advance to the company a part of the value of each consignment The decision was that the exchange profits arose directly in the course of the appellants business with the company and formed part of the appellants trading receipts for the purpose of computing their profits assessable to income tax under Case I of Schedule My brother <NAME> on page of the report cited the case of <ORG> TC KB to which I will refer in a moment and then made this comment upon it I pause there to say that in my view the profit which arises in the present case is a profit arising directly from the business which had to be done because as is found in paragraph of the case the business was conducted on a dollar basis and the appellants had therefore to buy dollars in order to make the advances against the goods as prescribed by the agreements The profit accrued in this case because they had to do that thereafter as a trading concern in this country re transferring or re exchanging into sterling It is to be available during the period of the agency for making good the agent defaults in the event of any default by him but otherwise it remains as I see it simply as a loan owing by the company to the agent and repayable on the termination of the agency and I do not see how the fact that the purpose for which it is given is to provide a security against any possible default by the agent can invest it with the character of a trading receipt It seems to me that it would be an abuse of language to describe one of these agents after he had made a deposit as a trade creditor of the company he is a creditor of the company in respect of the deposit not on account of any goods supplied or services rendered by him in the course of its trade but simply by virtue of the fact that he has been appointed an agent of the company with a view to his trading on its behalf and as a condition of his appointment has deposited with or in other words lent to the company the amount of his stipulated deposit After paying the best attention I can to the arguments for the <ORG> and those for the respondent company I find nothing in the facts of this case to divest those deposits of the character which it seems to me they originally bore that is to say the character of loans by the agents to the company given no doubt to provide the company with a security but nevertheless loans As loans it seems to me they must prima facie be loans on capital not revenue account which perhaps is only another way of saying that they must prima facie be considered as part of the company fixed and not of its circulating capital As appears from what I have said above the evidence does not show that there was anything in the company mode of dealing with the deposits when received to displace this prima facie conclusion That being so it was a profit of the nature not properly taxable under Schedule and the Special Commissioners in my view came to a right conclusion which was rightly affirmed by the learned judge and I would therefore dismiss the appeal Here also though as I have said before subsequent decisions had dealt with this case the actual distinction is sought to be urged before us whether the user of the assessee own money or user of the borrowed money of the assessee was for capital or for revenue purpose made any difference does not seem to have been stressed As we have mentioned before that was a case where the question was about the expenditure for securing overdraft facilities for the purpose of its business and in that connection it had incurred an expenditure There the assessee company had been carrying on a business as distiller of country liquor and sold the produce of its distillery to licensed wholesalers The question was whether the assessee could be assessed to tax on the balance of the amounts of these additional sums left after the refunds made If on the other hand the fund was not utilised for a business operation or for the purposes of trade but for a common business operation like payment of income tax in the foreign country there was no profit and the difference in exchange could not be assessed to income tax Next reliance was placed on a <ORG> decision in the case of <ORG> CIT ITR There the <ORG> observed that where profit or loss arises to an assessee on account of appreciation or depreciation in the value of foreign currency held by him on conversion into another currency such profit or loss would ordinarily be trading profit or loss if the foreign currency is held by the assessee on revenue account or as a trading asset or as part of circulating capital embarked in the business But if on the other hand the foreign currency is held as a capital asset or as fixed capital such profit or loss would be of a capital nature During the financial year ending st March relevant to the assessment year the assessee had made large profits amounting to Indian Rs There Mr Justice <NAME> while delivering the judgment of the court at page of the report had discussed the relevant authorities and then at page of ITR observed as follows The law may therefore now be taken to be well settled that where profit or loss arises to an assessee on account of appreciation or depreciation in the value of foreign currency held by it on conversion into another currency such profit or loss would ordinarily be trading profit or loss if the foreign currency is held by the assessee on revenue account or as a trading asset or as part of circulating capital embarked in the business But if on the other hand the foreign currency is held as a capital asset or as fixed capital such profit or loss would be of a capital nature If these two amounts were employed in the business in West Pakistan and formed part of the circulating capital of that business the loss of Rs resulting to the assessee on remission of those two amounts to India on account of alteration in the rate of exchange would be a trading loss but if instead these two amounts were held on capital account and were part of fixed capital the loss would plainly be a capital loss The question whether the loss suffered by the assessee was a trading loss or a capital loss cannot therefore be answered unless it is first determined whether these two amounts were held by the assessee on capital account or on revenue account or to put it differently as part of fixed capital or of circulating capital We would have ordinarily in these circumstances called for a supplementary statement of case from the <ORG> giving its finding on this question but both the parties agreed before us that their attention was not directed to this aspect of the matter when the case was heard before the revenue authorities and the <ORG> and hence it would be desirable that the matter should go back to the <ORG> with a direction to the <ORG> either to take additional evidence itself or to direct the ITO to take additional evidence and make a report to it on the question whether the sums of Rs The <ORG> will on the basis of this additional evidence and in the light of the law laid down by us in this judgment determine whether the loss suffered by the assessee on remittance of the two sums of Rs The aforesaid passage was emphasised on behalf of the revenue representing the settled law that when profit or loss arises to an assessee on account of appreciation or depreciation in the value of foreign currency held by it such profit or loss would ordinarily be trading profit or loss if the foreign currency is held by the assessee on revenue account or as a trading asset or as part of circulating capital embarked in the business But if on the other hand the foreign currency is held as a capital asset or as fixed capital such profit or loss would be of capital nature The learned advocate for the assessee also emphasized that there <ORG> was dealing essentially with the assessee own money Therefore according to him <ORG> had no occasion to advert to this aspect of the matter where in a case the assessee was dealing with borrowed money On further appeal to the <ORG> the assessee contended that the amount should be allowed as business expenditure under Section of the I Act as a loss incidental to the business that although the loan had not been repaid during the relevant year as the assessee accounts were kept on the mercantile system the liability having arisen in the relevant year by reason of the devaluation it was in the nature of an expenditure incurred by the assessee and allowable under Section that the expenditure for the purpose of business included the payment of the assessee statutory dues and taxes and that the loan had been taken by the assessee for the purpose of its business and the loss occasioned by devaluation was suffered in the business It was held by this court that the contention of the revenue that notionally the expenditure if any incurred by any loss accruing to the assessee by reason of the devaluation did not arise in the year of assessment could not be accepted The assessee maintained its accounts on mercantile basis However the extra expenditure deemed or otherwise or the loss was inextricably connected with the assessee indebtedness and did not arise de liors the indebtedness Therefore the extra amount which the assessee had to provide for as a result of devaluation cannot be considered as extra expenditure to be incurred for meeting the debt like postal expenses or bank charges or as extra expenditure resulting in a business loss of a revenue nature If there was a devaluation in favour of the rupee as a result of which the assessee had to pay less to its creditors the surplus arising would have been of capital nature and could not have been assessed in the hands of the assessee as a business profit In that case it was not the contention of the assessee that it had incurred the extra expenditure in order to secure the loan It was at the point of repayment that the assessee had to provide an extra amount in rupees by reason of the devaluation This brings us to the consideration of the second question that is to say whether the <ORG> was justified in holding that the alternative claim of the assessee company for development rebate under Section of the I Act on Rs In this connection reference may be made to the provisions of Section of the I Act which deals with development rebate and provides that In respect of a new ship or new machinery or plant other than office appliances or road transport vehicles which is owned by the assessee and is wholly used for the purposes of the business carried on by him there shall in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section and of Section be allowed a deduction in respect of the previous year in which the ship was acquired or the machinery or plant was installed or if the ship machinery or plant is first put to use in the immediately succeeding previous year then in respect of the previous year a sum by way of development rebate as specified in Clause We may also incidentally refer to Section of the I Act which deals with the depreciation also to Section which defines actual cost and also to Sub section of Section which provides the written down value Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act where an assessee has acquired any asset from a country outside India for the purposes of his business or profession and in consequence of a change in the rate of exchange at any time after the acquisition of such asset there is an increase or reduction in the liability of the assessee as expressed in Indian currency for making payment towards the whole or a part of the cost of the asset or for repayment of the whole or a part of the moneys borrowed by him from any person directly or indirectly in any foreign currency specifically for the purpose of acquiring the asset being in either case the liability existing immediately before the date on which the change in the rate of exchange takes effect the amount by which the liability aforesaid is so increased or reduced during the previous year shall be added to or as the case may be deducted from the actual cost of the asset as defined in Clause of Section or the amount of expenditure of a capital nature referred to in Clause iv of Sub section of Section or in Section A or in Clause ix of Sub section of Section or in the case of a capital asset not being a capital asset referred to in Section the cost of acquisition thereof for the purposes of Section and the amount arrived at after such addition or deduction shall be taken to be the actual cost of the asset or the amount of expenditure of a capital nature or as the case may be the cost of acquisition of the capital asset as aforesaid The provisions of Sub section shall not be taken into account in computing the actual cost of an asset for the purpose of the deduction on account of development rebate under Section Bill which introduced Section A Clause of the Notes on Clauses sought to explain the purpose of such insertion which reads as follows ITR St Clause seeks to insert a new section A in the Income tax Act The proposed Section A in substance secures that where an assessee had acquired any capital asset from a country outside India for the purposes of his business or profession on deferred payment terms or against a foreign loan before the date of devaluation of the rupee the additional rupee liability incurred by him in meeting the instalments of the cost of the asset or of the foreign loan as the case may be falling due for payment after the date of devaluation will be allowed to be added to the original actual cost of the asset for the purpose of calculating the allowance on account of depreciation in computing the profits for the assessment year and subsequent assessment years Similar increase in the original actual cost will be allowed to be made in respect of the capital assets acquired by the assessee to be used in scientific research related to the class of business carried on by him or patent rights or copyrights acquired from abroad or any capital asset acquired by a company for the purpose of promoting family planning amongst its employees Further in computing the capital gains arising to the assessee on the sale or transfer of a capital asset acquired by him from abroad on deferred payment terms or against a foreign loan the additional rupee liability incurred by him in repaying the instalments of the cost or the foreign loan as the case may be after the date of devaluation of the rupee will be added to the original actual cost of the asset The proposed section also secures that where there is a decrease in the rupee liability of the assessee in respect of assets acquired by him from abroad due to a change in the exchange value of the rupee the original actual cost of the asset will be correspondingly reduced The additional rupee liability incurred on imported capital assets or as the case may be any decrease in such liability in the circumstances stated in the earlier paragraph will not however be taken into account in computing the actual cost of the asset for the purpose of deduction on account of development rebate Therefore any appreciation or depreciation in value of assets as a result of devaluation in profit or loss arising therefrom must be governed by the special provisions of Section A A special provision has been made that this is the only provision to guide the matter Before we deal with that aspect of the matter we must refer to Section a which uses a non obstante clause of STC That apart even if Article continues the pre Constitution laws of taxation that provision is expressly made subject to the other provisions of the Constitution The expression subject to conveys the idea of a provision yielding place to another provision or other provisions to which it is made subject Further Article opens out with a non obstante clause While Article is subject to Article Article operates in its own sphere in spite of Article The result is that Article overrides Article that is to say notwithstanding the fact that a pre Constitution taxation law continues in force under Article the <ORG> and the State Governments can enter into an agreement in terms of Article in respect of Part States depriving the State law of its efficacy In one view Article excludes the operation of Article and in the other view an agreement in terms of Article overrides Article In either view the result is the same namely that at any rate during the period covered by the agreement the States ceased to have any power to impose the tax in respect of works contracts It states in essence that in spite of what is contained previously this clause would be operative Another significant fact has to be borne in mind that Sub section of Section A deals with the expression acquisition which deals with the situation where there is a change in the valuation of foreign currency after acquisition But in the case of development rebate it has to be emphasized that acquisition is not relevant on the material date but the date of installation is the most material date There <ORG> had observed that interest paid before the commencement of production on amounts borrowed by the assessee for the acquisition and installation of plant and machinery forms part of the actual cost of the assets to the assessee within the meaning of the expression in Section of the Indian I Act and the assessee will be entitled to depreciation allowance and development rebate with reference to such interest also As the expression actual cost had not been defined it should be construed in the sense which no commercial man would misunderstand There <ORG> had observed that for determining the cost of expenditure question of depreciation would be taken into the written down value and the question was again considered from different aspects by <ORG> in the case of Addl Ltd The ITO had found that on account of the devaluation of Indian currency there was an increase of Rs He negatived the claim for development rebate on the increase in cost due to change in rate of exchange as in his view Section A of the I Act excluded such changes in actual cost for the purpose of granting development rebate under Section On a reference to <ORG> at the instance of the department <ORG> held that as the effect of Sub section of Section A of the I Act was only to exclude the applicability of Sub section thereof to the computation of the actual cost for determining the development rebate allowable under Section in computing the actual cost of an asset for the purpose of development rebate the only statutory provision relevant was Section denning actual cost which admittedly included the sum of Rs Therefore the assessee was entitled to development rebate on the amount of Rs In the instant case before us the contract stipulated repayment in dollars Therefore the actual cost of the assessee must be computed on the dollar value Therefore anything which went into that repayment that is to say any cost which actually went in repaying the debt must be in our opinion on the principle of computation of the actual cost which irrespective of Section A would be entitled to development rebate under Section A and inasmuch as Sub section of Section A only excludes the portion of Sub section of Section A in our opinion this position would not be inadmissible that the assessee would be entitled to obtain the development rebate In the instant case we are concerned with the question whether Section was at all meant for dealing with the case where there is no question of installation involved but only acquisition was the relevant fact Besides the price of machinery or plant cost took in many other items of expenditure such as for instance freight warehouse or insurance charges legal expenses etc The assessee entered into an agreement with <ORG> on June where under the latter agreed to lend moneys to the assessee in foreign currencies to pay the price of the imported machinery and the assessee agreed to pay back the moneys in the same currencies in which they were borrowed Even if <ORG> exercised the option to accept payment in rupees in lieu of foreign currencies the rupee sum was to be determined by actual cost to <ORG> of purchasing with rupees the respective amounts of the foreign currencies becoming due and payable Now in that case on behalf of the revenue it was conceded that the contract was for payment in the foreign currency and it was further stipulated that in determining the valuation it must be paid for by the buyer Even though there was no specific clause signifying the payment of difference the payment of the money had to be made according to the facts found by the <ORG> in terms of dollars In aid of the submission the counsel for the revenue drew our attention to Schedule the form of balance sheet of the Companies Act where Expln There the assessee entered into an agreement on August with a foreign ship building yard for the construction and supply of two ships The agreement provided for payment of of the cost of the ships on the signing of the agreement and the balance of in equal half yearly instalments the first of them to commence six months after the delivery of the ships In accordance with this clause in the agreement a loan agreement was entered into between the assessee and the consortium of West German banks with whom the ship building yard had entered into an agreement and the consortium disbursed the to the ship building yard <ORG> held that in view of the specific provisions contained in Sub section of Section A which specifically provided that variations in the cost of acquisition of an asset arising out of devaluation of the rupee should not be taken into consideration for the purpose of grant of development rebate under Section the general principle that the additional liability arising out of the devaluation of the Indian rupee would become part of the cost of the ships cannot be applied for purpose of granting development rebate under Section In so far as the decision took the view that in respect of all devaluation cases irrespective of whether the stipulated payment in the matter of foreign currency should be made under Section A alone with great respect we are unable to agree and we prefer to adhere to the former view of <ORG> and the other view of <ORG> as mentioned hereinbefore On behalf of the assessee it was contended that Section A has been introduced to meet with the situation of computing depreciation year after year where the price in terms of Indian rupee fluctuates on account of change in the rate of exchange But since no such situation arises in the cases of development rebate which is granted once and for all the said provision has not been made applicable to the computation of development rebate The development rebate continues to be computed on the basis of the provisions of Section as before It was linked with the actual cost of the machinery or plant to the assessee Therefore on the relevant date when the contract was entered into it was entered into with the direction to pay back in dollars and whatever was necessary to pay back must be treated as actual cost to the assessee In that view of the matter we are of the opinion that the assessee was entitled to development rebate in accordance with Section of the Act on the sum of Rs
