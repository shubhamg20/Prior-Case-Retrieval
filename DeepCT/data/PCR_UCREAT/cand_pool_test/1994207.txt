HEADNOTE The first respondent filed a writ petition in the <ORG> challenging the grant of a mining lease to the appellant on the ground of a direct infringement of his right to be granted a mining lease over an area for which he applied for a mining lease and which according to him formed part of the area for which the appellant was given the lease The <ORG> allowed the petition in the view that there was a violation of of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act and rr Respondent filed a writ petition on September challenging the lease on the ground that he had earlier on March applied for a mining lease over an area of acres in certain villages of Singhbhum District which was included in the lease granted to the appellant but as no orders were passed by <ORG> within the statutory period the application was deemed to have been rejected Further in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act <ORG> hereby authorise <ORG> to grant mining lease to Dr <NAME> over the area in question which does not form a compact block <ORG> also in exercise of the powers conferred by proviso to section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act authorise <ORG> to grant mining lease for apatite over the areas to Dr <NAME> in excess of the limit of square miles prescribed in section and of the said Act Immediately on getting to know of the approval given by <ORG> to the grant of the mining lease to the appellant the first respondent moved <ORG> for a stay and though that application was rejected he made several other attempts but without any success At this stage we may point out that in the writ petition filed by the first respondent though the appellant was a party it seems he did not appear and the proceeding was ex parte No doubt the State of Bihar and <ORG> had opposed the petition but the High <ORG> came to the conclusion that the conditions required for relaxation of the Rules in special cases under of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act hereinafter termed the Act read with rr Before us it is contended by the appellant learned advocate that the appellant did not have an opportunity of urging before the <ORG> that the writ petition filed by the first respondent was not maintain able because he is not a person aggrieved as the area for which the first respondent had made an application for the grant of mining lease was not included in the area granted to the appellant There is according to him no infringement of the provisions of of the Act read with rr The learned Solicitor General on behalf of <ORG> supports the grant of the mining lease to the appellant on the ground that of the Rules is not applicable to the facts of this case inasmuch as the rd respondent had not taken any firm decision to reserve the area granted to the appellant which is a necessary condition of the applicability of that rule There is no doubt as <ORG> has pointed out that where by relaxing the Rules <ORG> intends to authorise in any case the grant renewal or transfer of any prospecting licence or mining lease or the working of any mine for the purpose of searching for or winning any mineral on terms and conditions different from those laid down in the Rules made under of the Act it can do so for reasons to be recorded in writing As already pointed out it is admitted by respondents and that the application made by the first respondent was not in respect of the area which is granted to the appellant and consequently the first respondent had no interest in the subject matter of the lease must ordinarily be the right of the petitioner himself who complains of infraction of such right and approaches the <ORG> for relief <NAME> as he then was observed in that case Article confers a very wide power on <ORG> to issue directions and writs of the nature mentioned therein for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose That apart in exceptional cases as the expression ordinary indicates a person who has been prejudicially affected by an act or omission of an authority can file a writ even though he has no proprietary or even fiduciary interest in the subject matter thereof On this aspect there is no clear enunciation of principles on which the <ORG> will exercise its jurisdiction In England also the <ORG> have taken the view that when the application is made by a party or by a person aggrieved the <ORG> will intervene ex debito justitias in justice to the applicant and when it is made by a stranger the <ORG> considers whether the public interest demands its intervention In this case however the first respondent has not challenged the grant of the lease on the ground of ex debito justitiae but has done so on the ground of a direct infringement of his right to be granted a mining lease over acres for which the appellant was given a lease along with other area On this short ground this appeal will be allowed and the writ petition filed by the first respondent in <ORG> dismissed The appellant will have his costs only against the State of Bihar
