Interpretation of statutes Reading words in a statute When permissible Harmonious construction Purposive approach to be adopted by Courts HEADNOTE The Delhi Rent Control Act was amended by Act of which introduced Sections to to the Act carving out thereby classified landlords from the general class of landlords with specified rights to recover immediate possession of the premises let out by them if these are required for their own residence The released or retired persons from armed forces or the dependents of the member of armed forces killed in action are covered by Section the retired employees of <ORG> and of <ORG> are covered by Section and the landlords who are widows are covered by Section These classified landlords are also given the benefit of summary trial under Chapter IIIA by introducing Sections to in Sub section of Section but there are no corresponding amendments to sub sections to of Section They also challenged the validity of Section of the Act before <ORG> by means of two separate writ petitions under Article of the Constitution It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the tenant right to contest the application for eviction on the grounds specified in Section cannot be denied even as against the classified landlords falling under Sections to It was also contended that sub sections and of Section are a composite scheme and since that scheme has been left untouched the tenant right thereunder cannot be denied Section is a special provision made by the legislature conferring certain rights to persons belonging to Armed Forces to recover from their tenants immediate possession of the premises for their occupation The Tenant cannot claim right to contest an application for eviction on the grounds specified in Section against the classified landlords falling under Sections to The argument that the absence of amendments to sub sections and of Section preserves the tenant right to contest the application of even a classified landlord on the grounds specified under Section is not sustainable The form specified in the Third Schedule refers only to application filed under Section or Section A Therefore when an application is filed under Section a copy of the application should be sent to the tenant by making necessary amendment to the prescribed form and omitting the other references which are not relevant and the summons should state that the application is filed under Section and not under Section or A The fact that there is no reference to the word bona fide requirement in Sections to do not absolve the landlord from proving that the requirement is bona fide or the tenant from showing that it is not bona fide There is also enough indication in support of this construction from the title of section which states special procedure for the disposal of applications for eviction on the ground of bonafide requirement It is always left to the Controller who is a quasi judicial authority to exercise his discretion having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case and grant a reasonable time to the tenant The Controller power to give leave to contest the application filed under Section or Section A is cribbed by the condition that the affidavit filed by the tenant discloses such facts as would disentitle the landlord from obtaining an order for the recovery of possession of the premises on the ground specified in the respective sections Therefore if an application is filed under Section or or the tenant right to contest the application is narrowed down and is restricted to the parameters of the respective Sections The contention that the concerned landlord has taken voluntary retirement long earlier and has become a part of the <ORG> just like any other landlord and Section was not intended to confer such landlord the special right to recover immediate possession of the premises is not maintainable because Section states that the persons who have already retired may within one year from the date of their release or retirement from such Armed Forces or within a period of one year from the date of introduction of Section whichever is later apply to the controller for recovering the immediate possession of their premises These appeals from the decision of <ORG> raise the question with regard to landlord right to evict the tenant under Section of the Delhi Rent Control Act The Act and the corresponding right of the tenant to resist the eviction proceedings Section is a special provision made by the <ORG> conferring certain rights to persons belonging to Armed Forces to recover from their tenants immediate possession of the premises for their occupation In the case of <NAME> the Rent Controller made an order dated September inter alia observing that the landlord is living in a rented house that he is paying rent of Rs and that he requires the premises for himself and the members of his family Against the judgment of <ORG> dismissing the writ petition the tenant has preferred SLP No of Section provides that notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or contract no decree or order for the recovery of possession of any premises shall be passed by any <ORG> or Controller in favour of the landlord against a tenant Sub section imposes a restriction on the landlord who has acquired any premises by transfer not to evict the tenant under Section within the period of five years from the date of acquisition Sub section imposes an obligation on the <ORG> where an order for eviction is made on the ground specified in Section to give the tenant the minimum period of six months for delivery of possession to the landlord If he is required to vacate such residential accommodation on the ground that he owns in the Union Territory of Delhi a house in his name or in the name of his spouse or dependent children he could recover immediate possession of his premises let out by him notwithstanding anything contained elsewhere in the Act or any other law for the time being in force They could recover immediate possession of the premises let out by them if they are required for their own residence The retired employees of <ORG> and of <ORG> are covered by Section They could recover immediate possession of the premises let out by them if they are needed for their own residence The landlords who are widows are covered by Section with similar right to recover immediate possession of the premises let out by them or by their husband The sub section of Section as it stands provides that every application by a landlord for recovery of possession of any premises on the ground specified in clause of the proviso to sub section of Section or under Section A or under Section or under Section or under Section shall be dealt with in accordance with the procedure specified in this Section There are however no corresponding amendments to sub sections to of Section Omission to make corresponding amendments particularly to sub sections of Section has given rise to the arguments for the petitioners that the tenant right to contest the application for eviction on the grounds specified in Section cannot be denied even as against the classified landlords falling under Sections to It was also argued that the classified landlords may prove the facts stated in their respective provisions but the tenant is entitled to contest the application by disclosing such facts as would disentitle the landlords from obtaining an order of eviction on the grounds specified under Section Indeed it would render the whole exercise of creating special classes of landlords with specified rights to recover immediate possession of the premises let out by them nugatory The Controller shall give the tenant leave to contest the applications if the tenant in his affidavit discloses such facts as would disentitle the landlords from obtaining an order for recovery of possession of the premises on the grounds specified under Section For a proper understanding we may set out Section side by side with Section Where a landlord has acquired any premises transfer no application for the recovery of possession of such premises shall lie under sub section on the ground specified in clause of the proviso thereto unless a period of five years has elapsed from the date of the acquisition Where an order for recovery of possession of any premises is made on the ground specified in clause of the proviso to sub section the landlord shall not be entitled to obtain possession thereof before the expiration of a period of six months from the date of the order This is a complete code governing the disposal of application filed under Section Secondly Section uses the expression the premises let out by him unlike the expression used in Section the premises let out for residential purposes Section also provides the period of limitation for claiming possession of such premises but no such limitation is provided under Section Sub section of Section imposes further restriction on the landlord who is having more than one premises Here again we find that there is no such restriction to a landlord covered under Section provided the requirement of the landlord is bona fide and he has no other reasonably suitable residential accommodation It was also contended that sub sections of Section are a composite scheme and since that scheme has been left untouched the tenant right thereunder cannot be denied Sub section of Section provides that every application for the recovery of possession of any premises belonging to persons referred to in sub section of Section shall be dealt with in accordance with the procedure prescribed in this Section meaning thereby entire Section Mr <NAME> counsel for <ORG> however argued that the procedure contemplated under sub section of Section need not be followed by the Controller with regard to applications filed under Sections to According to counsel when the tenant is duly served of the application filed under Sections or he has no right to contest the application unless he files an affidavit stating the grounds on which he seeks to contest the application for eviction and obtains leave from the Controller The argument that the absence of amendments to sub sections and of Section preserves the tenant right to contest the application of even a classified landlord on the grounds specified under section would be basically faulty There is also no corresponding amendment to the summons to be issued under subsection and the form specified in the Third Schedule after the introduction of Section to Third Schedule is in these terms The Third Schedule Form of Summons in a case where recovery of possession of Premises is Prayed for on the ground of bona fide requirement or under Section A To Name description and place of residence of the tenant Whereas <NAME> has filed an application a copy of which is annexed for your eviction from here insert the particulars of the premises on the ground specified in clause of the proviso to sub section of Section or under Section A You are hereby summoned to appear before the Controller within fifteen days of the service hereof and to obtain the leave of the Controller to contest the application for eviction on the ground aforesaid in default whereof the applicant will be entitled at any time after the expiry of the said period of fifteen days to obtain an order for your eviction from the said premises Leave to appear and contest the application may be obtained or an application to the Controller supported by an affidavit as if referred to in sub section of Section This day of Controller This form specified in the Third Schedule refers only to applications filed under Section or under Section Does it mean that the unamended form should be used to issue notice to the tenant even in case where application for eviction is not made under Section or A Is the tenant entitled to claim that he must receive the notice in the unamended form only since there is no corresponding amendment to the form after introduction of Sections to A wooden reading may furnish him positive answers but it would be ridiculous When an application is filed under Section a copy of the application should be sent to the tenant by making necessary amendment to the prescribed form and omitting the other references which are not relevant If the application is filed under Section the summons should state that the application is filed under Section and not under Section or A The fact that there is no reference to the word bona fide requirement in sections to does not absolve the landlord from proving that his requirement is bona fide or the tenant from showing that it is not bona fide There is also enough indication in support of this construction from the title of Section which states special procedure for the disposal of applications for eviction on the ground of bona fide requirement Equally sub section of Section has no application to eviction under Sections to Nor the amended provisions under Section would be attracted since it applies exclusively to tenants of the landlords covered under Section A it is always left to the Controller who is a quasi judicial authority to exercise his discretion having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case There is one other aspect which requires elucidation The Controller power to give leave to contest the application filed under Section or Section A is cribbed by the condition that the affidavit filed by the tenant discloses such facts as would disentitle the landlord from obtaining an order for the recovery of possession of the premises on the ground specified in the respective sections Needless to state therefore if an application is filed under Section or or the tenant right to contest the application is narrowed down and is restricted to the parameters of the respective sections We therefore reiterate the views expressed in <ORG> case We concur with the view taken by the Controller as affirmed by <ORG> Before parting with the case we have to deal with one other contention which has been specifically raised by Mr <NAME> The counsel argued that the concerned landlord has taken voluntary retirement long earlier and he has become a part of the society just like any other landlord and Section was not intended to confer such landlord the special right to recover immediate possession of the premises Obvious answer to this contention is found in Section which states that the persons who have already retired may within one year from the date of their release or retirement from such Armed Forces or within a period of one year from the date of introduction of Section whichever is later apply to the Controller for recovering the immediate possession of their premises
