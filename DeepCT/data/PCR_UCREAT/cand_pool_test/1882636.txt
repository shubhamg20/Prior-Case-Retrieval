The limited question that arises in this application preferred by the <ORG> Under Section of the Madras General Sales tax Act is whether the arecanuts sold by the respondent in the assessment year constituted agricultural or horticultural produce grown by the assessee himself or grown on any land which he had an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise within the meaning of the proviso to Section of the Act The assessee took the matter up on further appeal to <ORG> The <ORG> however accepted the contentions of the assessee that what the assessee sold was horticultural produce within the meaning of the proviso to Section i of the Act and that the assessee had an interest in the land in which that produce was grown within the meaning of Section i of the Act It was not disputed at any stage that there was no market for the arecanuts as gathered from the tree The correctness of that finding was not challenged and the argument before us proceeded on the assumption that the arecanut sold by the assessee was horticultural produce within the meaning of Section i of the Act We have had to set out all this only to show that the reasons for the view taken by the <ORG> that what was sold was horticultural produce will have to be sought not in its judgment in the What the proviso to Section i of the Act excludes from the turnover of a dealer is the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which he has an interest If the principle of that test can be applied in deciding whether what was sold by the assessee was still horticultural produce it should be obvious that the question at issue should be answered in favour of the assessee As we have pointed out it was common ground that there is no market in Coimbatore or elsewhere for arecanuts as they are when plucked from the trees and it should be remembered they are gathered when they are still unripe The proviso to Section i of the Act is obviously conceived in the interests of agriculturists It excludes from any tax liability under the Act sale of agricultural and horticultural produce the primary condition to be satisfied being that it must be produce of the land which either belongs to the seller or of the land in which he has an interest as specified by Section i To restrict that concession to sale of areca nuts for instance only if those arecanuts are sold in the state in which they are immediately on being gathered from the trees would render the statutory exclusion meaningless Under the Act tax liability is imposed only on sales by a dealer and the agriculturist who sold his agricultural produce has to satisfy the statutory requirements of the definition of a dealer before any question of tax liability or exclusion therefrom could arise
