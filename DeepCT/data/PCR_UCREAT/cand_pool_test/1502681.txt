HEADNOTE Respondent <NAME> filed a private complaint against the appellant alleging that the appellant has as a public servant committed certain offences under ss A and A of the Prevention of Corruption Act Act II of and section of the Indian Penal Code before the learned Special Judge Shri <NAME> The Special Judge took cognizance of the said offences and adjourned the case to October on which date the appellants counsel moved an application questioning the jurisdiction of the court on two specific counts i that the <ORG> of special Judge act up under of the Criminal Law Amendment Act Act for short cannot take cognizance of any of the offences enumerated in a upon a private complaint of facts constituting the offence and ii that where there are more special Judges than one for any area in the absence of a specification by the State Government in this behalf specifying the local area over which each special Judge would have jurisdiction the special Judge Mr <NAME> had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offences and try the case Punishment of the offender in the interest of the society being one of the objects behind penal statutes enacted for larger good of the society right to initiate proceedings cannot be whittled down circumscribed or fettered by putting it into a straight jacket formula of locus standi unknown to criminal jurisprudence save and except specific statutory exception A It is no answer to this fairly well established legal position that for the last years no case has come to the notice of the court in which cognizance was taken by a special Judge in a private complaint for offences punishable under the Act Section of the Act which confers power on the special Judge to take cognizance of offences set out in a does not directly or indirectly expressly or by necessary implication indicate that the only method of taking cognizance is the police report under of the Code of Criminal Procedure submitted by a police officer of the designated rank or permissible rank as set out in A of the Prevention of Corruption Act In the absence of a specific provision made in the statute indicating that offences will have to be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to that statute the same will have to be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the Code of Criminal Procedure If <ORG> of special Judge is a criminal court which atleast was not disputed and jurisdiction is conferred upon the presiding officer of the <ORG> of special Judge to take cognizance of offences simultaneously excluding one out of the four recognised modes of taking cognizance namely upon commitment of by a Magistrate as set out in the only other method by which the <ORG> of special Judge can take cognizance of an offence for the trial of which it was set up is any one of the remaining three other methods known to law by which a criminal court would take cognizance of an offence not as an idle formality but with a view to initiating proceedings and ultimately to try the accused If the language employed in is read in this light and in the background that a special Judge may take cognizance of offence without the accused being committed to him for trial it necessarily implies that the <ORG> of special Judge is armed with power to take cognizance without commitment by the Magistrate It positively conferred power on special Judge to take cognizance of offences and it negatively removed any concept of commitment This has no hearing either directly or indirectly with the mode and method of taking cognizance or trial by the special Judge Therefore an investigation under A is not a condition precedent before cognizance can be taken of offences triable by a special Judge who acquires power under to take cognizance of offences enumerated in a and of the Prevention of Corruption Act with this limitation alone that it shall not be upon commitment to him by the Magistrate Once A is out of the way in the matter of taking cognizance of offences committed by public servants by a special Judge the power of the special Judge to take cognizance of such offences conferred by with only one limitation in any one of the known methods of taking cognizance of offences by courts of original jurisdiction remains undented One such statutorily recognised well known method of taking cognizance of offences by a court competent to take cognizance is upon receiving a comp laint of facts which constitutes the offence And says that the special Judges has the power to take cognizance of offences enumerated in a and the only mode of taking cognizance excluded by the provision is upon commitment It therefore follows that the special Judge can take cognizance of offences committed by public servants upon receiving a complaint of facts constituting such offences There is no warrant for an approach that on receipt of the complaint the special Judge must direct an investigation under A In order to give full effect to the only thing to do is to read special Judge in to wherever the expression Magistrate occurs Similarly where the question of taking cognizance arises it is futile to go in search of the fact whether for purposes of which conferred power on the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence special Judge is a Magistrate What is to be done is that one has to read the expression special in place of Magistrate and the whole thing becomes crystal clear The <ORG> wherever it found the grey area clarified it by making specific provision such as the one in sub of and to leave no one in doubt further provided in sub that all the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act apply to the proceedings before a special Judge Therefore it conferred power taking cognizance of offences prescribed procedure trial of warrant cases by a Magistrate indicated authority to tender pardon The net outcome of this position is that a new court of original jurisdiction was set up and whenever a question arose as to what are its powers in respect of specific questions brought before it as court of original criminal Jurisdiction it had to refer to the Code of Criminal Procedure undaunted by any designation clap trap The power to take cognizance without holding inquiry or directing investigation is implicit in of the Code Therefore there is no merit in the contention that by entertaining a private complaint the purpose of speedy trial would be thwarted or that a pre process safeguard would be denied Further when cognizance is taken on a private complaint or to be precise otherwise than on a police report the special Judge has to try the case according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases instituted otherwise than on police report by a Magistrate ss Prior to the procedure for trial of warrant cases instituted on a police report and otherwise than on police report was the same and the Act of set up the court of special Judge to try cases under the Act and the trial was to be held according to the procedure prescribed for trial of a warrant case It necessarily follows that between to the <ORG> of special Judge would have followed the same procedure for trial of a case instituted upon a police report or otherwise than on a police report As a court of original criminal jurisdiction in order to make it functionally oriented some powers were conferred by the statute setting up the court The <ORG> of a special Judge once created by an independent statute has been brought as a court of original criminal jurisdiction under <ORG> because confers on <ORG> all the powers conferred by Chapter XXXI and XXXIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure on a High <ORG> as if the court of Special Judge were a <ORG> of Sessions trying cases without a jury within the local limit of the jurisdiction of <ORG> On that day learned counsel appearing for the appellant in the trial court moved an application questioning the jurisdiction of the court on two specific counts i that <ORG> set up under Sec a and upon a private complaint of facts constituting the offence and ii that where there are more special Judges than one for any area in the absence of a specification by <ORG> in this behalf specifying the local area over which each special Judge would have jurisdiction the special Judge Mr <NAME> had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the offences and try the case The learned Judges also held that by the time the matter was heard by them the Government of Maharashtra had issued a notification dated January under sub of Sec On behalf of the respondent complainant it was urged that it is one of the fundamental postulates of the administration of criminal justice that anyone can set the criminal law into motion unless the statute enacting the offence makes a special provision to the contrary both with regard to the locus standi of the complainant the manner and method of investigation and the person competent to investigate the offence and the court competent to take cognizance which specifically confers power on the special Judge to take cognizance of an offence without commitment of the case to it there is nothing which would preclude a complainant from filing a private complaint or which would deny jurisdiction of the special Judge to take cognizance of the offences on such a private complaint A denies the power to the special Judge to take cognizance of offences enumerated in Sec An incidental submission was that the <ORG> clearly expresses itself when it requires a certain qualification for filing the complaint and to specify a certain court competent to take cognizance and the method and manner of taking cognizance of those specified offences Punishment of the offender in the interest of the society being one of the objects behind penal statutes enacted for larger good of the society right to initiate proceedings cannot be whittled down circumscribed or fettered by putting it into a straight jacket formula of locus standi unknown to criminal jurisprudence save and except specific statutory exception the <ORG> while conferring power to take cognizance had three opportunities to unambiguously state its mind whether the cognizance can be taken on a private complaint or not While providing for investigation by designated police officers of superior rank the <ORG> did not fetter the power of special Judge to take cognizance in a manner otherwise than on police report The disinclination of the <ORG> to so provide points to the contrary and no canon of construction permits the court to go in search of a hidden or implied limitation on the power of the special Judge to take cognizance unfettered by such requirement of its being done on a police report alone In our opinion it is no answer to this fairly well established legal position that for the last years no case has come to the notice of the court in which cognizance was taken by a special Judge in a private complaint for offences punishable under the Act A was first introduced in the Act in the year of the Act which made the offences under Secs There was an identical provision in sub of Sec Chapter XII of the Code of Criminal Procedure bears the heading Information to the police and their powers to investigate It casts a duty on the officer in charge of a police station to reduce to writing every information relating to commission of a cognizable offence given to him and the same will be read over to the informant and the same shall be signed by the informant and a copy thereof shall be given to him If information given to an officer in charge of a Police Station disclosed a non cognizable offence he has to enter the substance of the information in a book to be kept by such officer in such form as <ORG> may prescribe in this behalf and to refer the informant to the Magistrate Sec Sub puts an embargo on the power of the police officer in charge of the police station to investigate a non cognizable offence without the order of a Magistrate having power to try the case or commit the case for trial It says that no proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under the section to investigated Sub confers power on the Magistrate empowered under Sec may take cognizance of any offence a upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence upon a police report of such facts and upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge that such offence has been committed obliges the Magistrate when he takes cognizance of an offence under clause of sub sec provides that except as otherwise expressly provided in the Code or by any other law for the time being in force no court of Session shall take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction unless the case has been committed to it by a Magistrate under the Code Cognizable offence has been defined in Sec to mean any allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action under the Code that some person whether known or unknown has committed an offence but does not include a police report There is an explanation appended to the section which has some relevance A report made by a police officer in a case which disclosed after investigation the commission of a non cognizable offence shall be deemed to be a complaint and the police officer by whom such report is made shall be deemed to be the complainant defines non cognizable offence to mean an offence for which and non cognizable case means a case in which a police officer has no authority to arrest without warrant While investigating a cognizable offence the investigating officer who is an officer in charge of a police station has a right to arrest the accused without a warrant In larger public interest non availability of such higher officers was catered to by conferring power on the Magistrate of the first class to grant permission to an officer of the rank lower than the designated officer to investigate such offences A of Act incorporates such a safeguard in favour of the accused that upon its true interpretation it is not open to the special Judge to take cognizance of an offence except upon a police report that may be submitted by officers of the designated rank or officers authorised by the Presidency Magistrate or the Magistrate of the first class or the Inspector of Police authorised by the State Government by a general or special order and therefore a fortiori it must exclude cognizance being taken by the special Judge upon a private complaint because that would completely render illusory the safeguard prescribed in Sec shall be tried by the special Judge for the area within which it was committed or where there are more special Judges than one for such area by such one of them as may be specified in this behalf by <ORG> Where there are more than one special Judge for the same area <ORG> is under an obligation to specify the local jurisdiction of each special Judge it may be case wise it may be area wise It reads as under A special Judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused persons shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates Save as provided in sub section or sub section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not consistent with this Act apply to the proceedings before a special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases with out a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecution before a special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor A In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in sub section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as may be apply to the proceedings before a special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions a special Judge shall be deemed to be a Magistrate which confers power on the special Judge to take cognizance of offences set out in Sec It merely says A special Judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused person shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates The court has to take cognizance of the offence before initiation of the proceeding can be contemplated The court called upon to take cognizance of the offence must apply its mind to the facts placed before it either upon a police report or upon a complaint or in some other manner the court came to know about it and in the case of <ORG> upon commitment of the case by the Magistrate The Code made detailed provision for powers of police officers entitled to investigate offences procedure of investigation powers of various courts to take cognizance of offences which that particular court is entitled to try under the Code But then there is another court of original jurisdiction namely <ORG> also being set up under Sec In other words <ORG> can take cognizance of an offence only upon an order of commitment made by the Magistrate and in no other manner Column in the First Schedule annexed to the Code of Criminal Procedure specifies which court can try a particular offence under the Indian Penal Code If the Magistrate took cognizance of an offence upon a complaint which appears to be exclusively triable by <ORG> he has to proceed according to Sections and caters to a situation where the case was instituted before the Magistrate on a police report or otherwise In both the cases if it appears to him that the offence which is alleged against the accused is exclusively triable by <ORG> there is no option but to commit the case to <ORG> And any other mode of taking cognizance is specifically barred under Sec All offences under any other law shall be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigating inquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences provides for offences under other law which may be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner or place of investigation inquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences In the absence of a specific provision made in the statute indicating that offences will have to be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to that statute the same will have to be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the Code of Criminal Procedure There is no other known or recognised mode of taking cognizance of an offence by a criminal court Now if <ORG> is a criminal court which atleast was not disputed and jurisdiction is conferred upon the presiding officer of the <ORG> to take cognizance of offences simultaneously excluding one of the four recognised modes of taking cognizance namely upon commitment by a Magistrate as set out in Sec the only other method by which the <ORG> can take cognizance of an offence for the trial of which it was set up is any one of the remaining three other methods known to law by which a criminal court would take cognizance of an offence not as an idle formality but with a view to initiating proceedings and ultimately to try the accused is read in this light and in this background that a special Judge may take cognizance of offence without the accused being committed to him for trial it necessarily implies that the <ORG> is armed with power to take cognizance of offences but that it is denied the power to take cognizance on commitment by the Magistrate This excludes the mode of taking cognizance under Sec It must take cognizance of offences with a view to trying the same but it shall not take it on commitment of the accused to the court With regard to the last of the modes of taking cognizance it was urged that there is inherent evidence to show that Sec It positively conferred power on special Judge to take cognizance of offences and it negatively removed any concept of commitment What is the effect of this illegality on the outcome of a concluded trial does not arise for our consideration but there are certain observations which were relied upon to urge that a prior investigation under Sec We must frankly say that we find nothing in this judgment even remotely to bear out the submission In this connection at page the <ORG> has observed as under The underlying policy in making these offences by public servants non cognizable appears to be that public servants who have to discharge their functions often enough in difficult circumstances should not be exposed to the harassment of investigation against them on information levelled possibly by persons affected by their official acts unless a Magistrate is satisfied that an investigation is called for and on such satisfaction authorises the same When therefore the <ORG> thought fit to remove the protection from the public servants in so far as it relates to the investigation of the offences of corruption comprised in the Act by making then cognizable it was considered necessary to provide a substituted safeguard from undue harassment by requiring that the investigation is to be conducted normally by a police officer of a designated higher rank When in the case of a cognizable offence a police officer on receipt of information of an offence proceeds under Chapter XII he starts with investigation and then submits his report called the police report upon which cognizance is taken and then follows the trial Having minutely read this judgment on which firm reliance was placed on behalf of the appellant we find nothing in it to come to the conclusion that an investigation under Sec A is a condition precedent before cognizance can be taken of offences triable by special Judge A of the Act without the order of a Presidency Magistrate and no court shall take cognizance of offences hereinabove enumerated except with the previous sanction of the appropriate <ORG> The <ORG> further observed that the <ORG> was prepared to believe an officer of an assured status implicity and it prescribed an additional guarantee that in the case of police officers below the rank the previous order of a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class as the case may be this <ORG> held that the order of the Magistrate giving permission to <NAME> to investigate the case did not give any reasons and there was thus a violation of Sec Yet this illegality committed in the course of an investigation does not affect the competence and jurisdiction of the court for trial and where cognizance of the case has in fact been taken and the case has proceeded to termination the invalidity of the preceding investigation does not vitiate the result unless the miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby and in reaching this conclusion reliance was placed on the case of Rishbud In Sirajuddin etc It has nothing to do directly or indirectly with the mode and method of taking cognizance of offences by the court of special Judge It also follows as a necessary corollary that provision of Sec A is out of the way in the matter of taking cognizance of offences committed by public servants by a special Judge the power of the special Judge to take cognizance of such offences conferred by Sec One such statutorily recognised well known method of taking cognizance of offences by a court competent to take cognizance is upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitutes the offence says that the special Judge has the power to take cognizance of offences enumerated in Sec a and and the only mode of taking cognizance excluded by the provision is upon commitment There is no warrant for such an approach Myopic as this is it would topsy turvy the fundamental belief that to a person accused of an offence there is no better safeguard than a court that upon arrest by police the arrested person must be produced before the nearest Magistrate within twenty four hours of the arrest It was urged that there is inherent evidence in other provisions of the Act and the Code of Criminal Procedure which would buttress the submission that the special Judge cannot take cognizance upon a private complaint confers specific powers of taking cognizance of offences without the necessity of the accused being committed for trial and prescribes the procedure for trial of warrant cases by Magistrates to be adopted by a special Judge it is necessary to determine with accuracy whether a special Judge is a Magistrate or a Sessions Judge the provisions of the Code of Criminal procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act apply to the proceedings before a special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions the Court of a special Judge shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecution before a special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor it was urged that for the purpose of procedure to be followed by a special Judge in the trial of the case before him he is a Magistrate as provided in Sec but not a Sessions Judge because <ORG> can take cognizance of offences without commitment while a special Judge has to take cognizance of offences without accused being committed to him for trial yet the provisions of sub Secs because it confers power on Magistrate to take cognizance of any offence in any one of the three modes therein prescribed which confers power of taking cognizance does not show any preference The Prevention of Corruption Act was enacted for more effective prevention of bribery and corruption The Statement of objects and Reasons accompanying the Bill refers to the recommendations of the <ORG> chaired by Dr <NAME> appointed to review the working of <ORG> and to make recommendations for improvement of laws relating to bribery and corruption To take the cases of corruption out of the maze of cases handled by Magistrates it was decided to set up special courts of the Code of Criminal Procedure which provides for constitution of criminal courts it would become clear that a new court with a new designation was being set up and that it has to be under the administrative and judicial superintendence of the High <ORG> As already pointed out there were four types of criminal courts functioning under the High <ORG> After prescribing the qualification the <ORG> proceeded to confer power upon a special Judge to take cognizance of offences for the trial of which a special court with exclusive jurisdiction was being set up Chapter XX prescribes the procedure for trial of summons cases by Magistrates and Chapter XXI prescribes the procedure for summary trial by bringing it on level more or less comparable to the <ORG> of Sessions but in order to avoid any confusion arising out of comparison by level it was made explicit in Sec A and trial of cases instituted otherwise than on police report Sec to and to leave no one in doubt further provided in sub that all the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with the Act apply to the proceedings before a special Judge Therefore it conferred power taking cognizance of offences prescribed procedure trial of warrant cases by a Magistrate indicated authority to tender pardon Sec and then after declaring is status as comparable to <ORG> proceeded to pres cribe that all provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure will apply in so far as they are not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act The net outcome of this position is that a new court of original jurisdiction was set up and whenever a question arose as to what are its powers in respect of specific questions brought before it as court of original criminal jurisdiction it had to refer to the Code of Criminal Procedure undaunted by any designation claptrap As a court of original criminal jurisdiction in order to make it functionally oriented some powers were conferred by the statute setting up the court Once court of a special Judge is a court of original criminal jurisdiction it became necessary to provide whether it is subordinate to <ORG> whether appeal and revision against its judgments and orders would lie to <ORG> and whether <ORG> would have general superintendence over a Court of special Judge as it has over all criminal courts as enumerated in Sec Once the position and power of <ORG> a special Judge in the hierarchy of criminal courts under <ORG> is clearly and unambiguously established it is unnecessary to roam into an enquiry examining large number of decisions laying down in the context of each case that <ORG> a special Judge is <ORG> and the contrary view taken in some other decisions It was submitted that there is further internal evidence pointing in the direction that a private complaint cannot be entertained by a special Judge His duty is to fairly analyse the evidence for and against the accused and that he should not withheld any evidence which has a bearing on the issues before the court If the Judge proceeds to hold the inquiry himself he is obliged to take evidence on oath but it was said that if <ORG> is <ORG> the case would be governed by proviso to sub of Sec This would certainly thwart a speedy trial was the apprehension disclosed and therefore it was said that there is internal contra indication that a private complaint is not maintainable We find no merit in the submissions When it is said that court issues process it means the court has taken cognizance of the offence and has decided to initiate the proceeding and as a visible manifestation of taking cognizance process is issued which means that the accused is called upon to appear before the court A But it must be made distinctly clear that it is neither obligatory to hold the inquiry before issuing process to direct the investigation of the offence by police Viewed from either angle there is no merit in this submission The power to take cognizance without holding inquiry or directing investigation is implicit in Sec when it says that the Magistrate may if he thinks fit postpone the issue of process against the accused and either inquire into the case himself or direct an investigation to be made by a police officer Therefore there is no merit in the contention that by entertaining a private complaint the purpose of speedy trial would be towarted or that a pre process safeguard would be denied Further when cognizance is taken on a private complaint or to be precise otherwise than on a police report the special Judge has to try the case according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases instituted otherwise than on police report by a Magistrate Sec requires that when accused is brought before a court the court shall proceed to hear the complainant and take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution Accused has a right to cross examine complainant and his witnesses If upon considering the evidence so produced the court finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if undebutted would warrant his conviction the court shall discharge the accused Sec If on the other hand the court is of the opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which the court is competent to try a charge shall be framed in writing against the accused Sec Prosecution may examine additional witnesses whom the accused would be entitled to cross examine A which prescribed procedure for trial of warrant cases instituted upon a police report while no corresponding amendment was made in any of the provisions contained in the same Chapter which prescribed procedure for warrant cases instituted otherwise than on police report and that this wold show that a private complainant which will be required to be tried according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases instituted otherwise than on a police report was not within the contemplation of the <ORG> of the Code of Criminal Procedure and that this glaring omission would clearly indicate that the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases otherwise than on police report was not within the contemplation for the trial of offences under the Act Prior thereto there was uniform procedure for trial of warrant cases by Magistrate irrespective of whether the case was instituted on a police report or otherwise than on a police report A in respect of cases instituted on a police report and ii Sec It should not be forgotten that prior to the procedure for trial of warrant cases instituted on a police report and otherwise than on police report was the same and the Act of set up <ORG> to try cases under the Act and the trial was to be held according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant case It necessarily follows that between to <ORG> would have followed the same procedure for trial of a case instituted upon a police report or otherwise than on a police report The learned Judges composing <ORG> of <ORG> by their separate judgments negatived the contention of the appellant holding that for the purpose of taking cognizance of an offence under the Act special Judge was a Magistrate and can take cognizance as provided by Sec of the Code of Criminal Procedure There is the third decision in this context which may be briefly referred to here This was treated as so obvious by the court that there is no discussion in support of the conclusion
