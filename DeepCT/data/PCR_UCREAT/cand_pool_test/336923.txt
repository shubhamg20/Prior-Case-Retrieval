HELD Every sovereign government has a right to abolish a post ill government service in the interest and necessity of internal Administration The protection afforded by Art Every termination of service cannot amount to dismissal or removal A reduction in rank would be a punishment if it carried penal consequences with it Where a person has a substantive appointment to a permanent post he has a right to hold the post until under the rules he attains the age of superannuation or is compulsorily retired after having put in the prescribed number of years service or the post is abolished and his service cannot be terminated except by way of punishment for misconduct negligence inefficiency or any other dis qualification found against him on enquiry after due notice to him An appointment to a temporary post for a certain specified period gives the servant a right to hold the post for the entire period of his tenure and his tenure cannot be put an end to during that period unless he is by way of punishment dismissed or removed from the service The opportunity of showing cause against the proposed penalty of dismissal or removal does not therefore arise in the case of the aboli tion of a post Whether after abolition of the post the government servant who was holding the post would or could be offered any employment under the <ORG> the abolition of a post does not confer on the person holding the abolished post any right to hold the post The observations in <NAME>a case that a person who substantively holds a permanent post has a right to continue in service subject to the rules of superannuation and compulsory retirement and that if for any other reason that right is invaded and he is asked to leave his service the termination of his service must inevitably mean the defeat of his right to continue in service and as such it is in the nature of a penalty and amounts to removal are not authority for the proposition that abolition of a post in good faith amounts to removal The earlier observation in the judgment that a permanent servant would normally acquire a right to hold the post until under the rules he attained the age of superannuation or was compulsorily retired or the post was abolished shows that the exception of termination as a result of the abolition of a post was not being considered when the observation was made Article authorises a provision in such contract for the payment of compensation to the government servant if before expiry of that period the post is abolished or he is required to vacate the post for reasons not connected with any misconduct The courts exclude the operation of the doctrine of estoppel when it is found that the authority against whom estoppel is pleaded has owed a duty to the public The right to hold a post comes to an end on the abolition of the post which a government servant holds and therefore he cannot complain of a violation of Arts till he attained the age of years whichever was earlier There was an agreement dated December between tile appellant <NAME> and <ORG> The order further stated that the <ORG> having considered all aspects of the matter came to the conclusion that there was no need to have a Vigilance <ORG>er Third the appellant entered into an agreement with the <ORG> and by accepting the offer changed his position and the <ORG> was precluded from altering the terms of agreement on the principle of estoppel <ORG> held that the termination of service resulting from the abolition of the post would not attract the provisions of Article of the Constitution the incumbent holding the post from service The ratio of <ORG> judgment is that there cannot be an estoppel in respect of statutory provisions of the governance of the <ORG> Which are made for the benefit of some one other than the person against whom the estoppel is asserted There were bickerings among the Members of the <ORG> Consequent upon the abolition of the <ORG> there existed no post on which the appellants could claim appointment Fourth the order of the <ORG> was made without giving an opportunity to the appellant and thereby violated the principles of natural justice Fifth the principle of estoppel applies to the case that it was not lawful for the <ORG> to terminate the services of the appellant These statutory rights constitute property within the meaning of Article and of the Constitution The abolition of a post is a mere executive decision and it cannot terminate the statutory tenure of service nor can it affect fundamental rights without the support of a valid law After amendment of Article a permanent <ORG> servant holds office during good behaviour and the doctrine of pleasure stands negatived except to the extent saved expressly by Article The first question which falls for determination is whether the <ORG> has a right to abolish a post in the service There are however observations on this aspect in three decisions of this Court enacted that no person as mentioned in Article shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Further where it is Proposed after such enquiry to impose on him any such penalty of dismissal removal or reduction in rank he has to be riven an opportunity of making repre sentation to the penalty proposed Article provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution Acts of the appropriate <ORG> may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or of any <ORG> The proviso to Article makes it competent to the President or such person as he may direct in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> and for the Governor of a <ORG> or such person as he may direct in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> to make rules regulating the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to such services and posts under the <ORG> and the <ORG> Article provides that such office is held during the pleasure of the President if the post is under the <ORG> or during the pleasure of the Governor if the post is under the <ORG> Such a contract may provide for the payment to him of compensation if before the expiration of an agreed period that post is abolished or he is for reasons not connected with any misconduct on his part required to vacate that post Therefore the other provisions in the Constitution which impinge on Article have the effect of making Article to be subject to those Articles When Article states that no person shall be dismissed removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him it affords a protection and security of <ORG> service Article applies to all <ORG> servants holding permanent temporary or officiating post The protection afforded by Article is however limited to the imposition of three major penalties The words dismissed removed and reduced in rank are technical words Merely sending back a servant to his substantive post has been held not to be a reduction in rank as a punishment since he had no legal right to continue in officiating post In <NAME> case supra it has been said that whether a servant is punished by way of reduction in rank is to be found by applying one of the two following tests whether the servant has a right to the post or the rank or whether evil consequences such as forfeiture of pay or allowances loss of seniority in his substantive rank stoppage or postponement of future chances of promotion follow as a result of the order Any and every termination of service cannot amount to dismissal or removal A termination of service brought about by the exercise of contractual right is not by itself dismissal or removal Again termination of service by compulsory retirement in terms of a specific rule regulating the conditions of service is not tantamount to infliction of a punishment and does not attract Article In these cases the termination of service does not carry with it he penal consequences of loss of pay or allowances The ruling in Dhingra case supra is that the protection of Article is afforded to permanent as well as temporary posts or officiating in any of them Where a person has a substantive appointment to a permanent post he has a right to hold the post until under the rules he attains the age of superannuation or is compulsorily retired after having put in the prescribed number of years service or the post is abolished and his service cannot be terminated except by way of punishment for misconduct negligence inefficiency or any other disqualification found against him on enquiry after due notice to him An appointment to a temporary post for a certain specified period gives the servant a right to hold the post for the entire period of his tenure and his tenure cannot be put an end to during that period unless he is by way of punishment dismissed or removed from the service Except in these two cases the appointment to a post permanent or temporary on probation or on an officiating basis or a substantive appointment to a temporary post gives to the servant so appointed no right to the post and his service may be terminated unless his service had ripened into what is in the service rules called a quasi permanent service A person who substantively holds a permanent post has a right to continue in service subject of course to the rule of superannuation and the rule as to compulsory retirement to leave his service the termination of his service must inevitably mean the defeat of his right to continue in service and as such it is in the nature of a penalty and amounts to removal Earlier in the judgment in <NAME> case supra it is said that a permanent servant would normally acquire a right to hold the post until under the rules he attained the age of superannuation or was compulsorily retired or the post was abolished The same view is taken in Champaklal case supra In <NAME> case supra it was said that the statement of law in <NAME> case supra in the absence of a contract express or implied or service rule the permanent servant cannot be turned out would permit the authority to terminate the service of a permanent servant under terms of contract or service rules without taking the case under Article though such termination might amount to removal or compulsory retirement That is why these two clauses it was pointed out in <NAME> case would have no relevance or application to permanent servants In other words it was said that the two tests laid down in <NAME> case supra first whether the servant had a right to hold the post and whether he had been visited with evil consequences of the kind referred to therein were not cumulative but were alternative The statement of law in <NAME> case supra that in the absence of a contract express or implied or a service rule a permanent servant cannot be turned out of his post unless the post is abolished or unless he is guilty of misconduct was examined In <NAME> case In <NAME> case supra it has been said that in regard to temporary servants or servants on probation the terms of contract or service rules may provide for the termination of the service on notice of a specified period or on payment of salary for the said period and if in exercise of the power thus conferred the services of a temporary or probationary servant are terminated it may not necessarily amount to removal In <NAME> case supra it was held that neither of the two rules contemplated an enquiry and in none of the actual cases there the procedure prescribed by Article was followed Argument was advanced in <NAME> case supra that Article and Article are to be construed in such manner that the pleasure contemplated by Article does not become illusory Once it is shown that a permanent civil servant is removed from service Article would apply and Article cannot be invoked independently with the object of justifying the contravention of the provisions of Article Where it was said in <NAME> Supra that the order of termination could be effective after complying with Article it was presumed that the provisions of Article viz It has been made subject to Article Article authorises payment of compensation to a government servant if before the expiration of that period the post is abolished or he for reasons not connected with any misconduct is required to vacate the post It is therefore argued on behalf of the appellants that there was no unconditional right in the <ORG> or the legislature to abolish the post The opportunity of showing cause against the proposed penalty of dismissal or removal does not therefore arise in the case of abolition of post the Government servant who was holding the post would or could be offered any employment under the <ORG> would therefore be a matter of policy decision of the Government because the abolition of post does not confer on the person holding the abolished post any right to hold the post Therefore as a general rule the doctrine of estoppel will not be applied against the state in its governmental public or sovereign capacity <ORG> rightly held that the courts exclude the operation of the doctrine of estoppel when it is found that the authority against whom estoppel is pleaded has owed a duty to the public against whom the estoppel cannot fairly operate <ORG> was correct that there was no reason to hold that there was colourable exercise of power by the <ORG> The right to hold a post comes to an end on the abolition of the post which a <ORG> servant holds The appellant in A No of was appointed to the ad hoc post of the Vigilance Commissioner
