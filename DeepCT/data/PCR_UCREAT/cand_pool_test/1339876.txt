In March the second plaintiff in this case <NAME> who is not a certified share broker and who describes himself as the sub broker of the first plaintiff <NAME> who is a certified share broker sold on <ORG> to first defendant <NAME> one hundred and twenty nine shares of a company called <ORG> for delivery on April Neither of the two plaintiffs was the registered holder of any such shares In order to make good the delivery the first plaintiff acquired the requisite number of shares in the market from various brokers and took from these brokers blank transfers signed by the registered holders along with the corresponding certificates The cheque was never honoured and the first defendant absconded The present action is brought by the first and second plaintiffs against all the three defendants asking for re turn of the certificates and blank transfers or otherwise for damages The ratio of this judgment is to be found in the following passage <ORG> was only an ostensible owner and the plaintiffs who were the unpaid vendors had equity in them and they could have stopped <ORG> from getting these shares transferred in his name in the books of the <ORG> but if <ORG> had passed on these shares either by way of sale or by way of pledge to any third person who acted bona fide and without notice then I certainly think that such a person would have a better title to these shares than the plaintiffs Section applies to this case unless there is possession there is no lion But farther there seems to their lordships a good deal of confusion arising from the prominence given to the fact that the full property in shares in a company is only in the registered holder The company is entitled to deal with the shareholder who is on the register and only a person who is on the register is in the full sense of the word owner of the share But the title to get on the register consists in the possession of a certificate together with a transfer signed by the registered holder He had the certificates and blank transfers signed by the registered holders It would be an upset of all <ORG> transactions if it were sug gestad that a broker who soil shares by general description did not implement his bargain by supplying the buyer with certificates and blank transfers signed by the registered holders of the shares described He could sell no more He sold what in England would have been choses in action and he delivered choses in action By the definition of goods as every kind of move able property it is clear that not only registered shares but also this class of choses in action are goods Hence equitable considerations not applicable to goods do not apply to shares in India So soon therefore as <NAME> acting for <ORG> handed <ORG> the certificates and transfers and <ORG> accepted them and gave the cheque the goods became ascertained goods the sale was complete and the property passed From that time onward <ORG> and <NAME> could only sue <ORG> on the cheque or for the price of the shares unpaid in respect that the cheque had not been honoured That brings in Rule of <ORG> change which is as follows If the cheque given for the monies of the shares will not be honoured at the bank on the day following the day when the cheque is given the shares shall have to be returned immediately be the person selling them and the person purchasing them shall have to take away those shares having paid the rupees in cash before two clock on that very day Their lordships will accordingly humbly advise His Majesty to dismiss the appeal with costs
