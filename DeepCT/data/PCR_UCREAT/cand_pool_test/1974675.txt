<NAME> and Co the first defendant in No of and Application No of on the file of this Court against the Judgment and Decree of <NAME> declaring that the plaintiffs <NAME> and <ORG> represented by him as governing director were entitled to have their names which stood registered in the books of the appellant company as holders and owners cancelled and omitted in respect of partly paid up snares of Rs Till the beginning of May he admittedly held partly paid up shares of Rs the money paid by him to the plaintiffs less Rs He however managed to sell more shares out of the shares purchased from the plaintiff to the third defendant <NAME> another Director of the bank who was carrying on business in Princess Street <ORG> In Exhibit a letter written by the Director of <ORG> to the third defendant it is stated that the remittance of Rs According to him though technically the purchaser of the shares under Exhibit was the second defendant <NAME> he treated him as the mouth piece and nominee of the other directors and as acting on behalf of the other Directors and considered all the three Directors defendants to to be acting in concert and to be jointly purchasing the shares under Exhibit though the third defendant was absent at the transactio and only defendants and were present and defendant purported to pay the price only on behalf of the second defendant and there was no privity of contract between him and the plaintiffs regarding the purchase of any of the shares under Exhibit The first plaintiff added as that after he had sold all the shares and resigned his chairmanship managing directorship and directorship he phoned to the bank and told the Secretary or the Assistant Secretary or some other officer of the bank he was not sure who received the phone call that he had sold away all his interest in the bank to the Directors and that he phoned like that at the request of defendants and According to him his belief that the names of the plaintiffs had been removed from the books of the bank and the names of the purchasers substituted was reinforced by the fact that no notice of meetings and no dividend notice or dividend warrants were sent to him by the bank after Exhibit The second defendant then by registered post sent a reply Exhibit dated th November stating that he did not appear to have received the letter dated nd September and requesting for a copy thereof to be sent to him On th December on not receiving any satisfactory reply from the bank the first plaintiff sent another letter Exhibit to the Secretary of the bank once again repudiating the liability of the plaintiffs for the call of Rs In August a petition for winding up the appellant bank was filed in this Court as its affairs were said to be in bankrupt condition The cause of action according to the plaintiffs arose on the th May when the plaintiffs sold the shares as part of the shares to the defendants on the th October when the call on the shares was made on the plaintiffs by the first defendant on the nth February when the plaintiffs applied to the first defendant for transfer of the shares and on the th April when their names were put back again in the register of shareholders of the bank by the order of <ORG> Several other defences were also raised by the bank namely that the power of the <ORG> to rectify the register under Section would not extend to a case like this where the default lay only with the plaintiffs and defendant and the alleged fraud only with defendant and there was no default or unnecessary delay or fraud on the part of the bank and the names of the plaintiffs were continued in the register of shareholders for excellent reasons and not with out sufficient cause as contemplated under Section The defence was also raised that the moment the winding up petition was filed and resulted in a winding up order the winding up order thus passed would under the insolvency law take effect from the date of the filing of the winding up petition and take away the powers of the <ORG> to rectify the register of shareholders as and from the date of the winding up petition since the effect of a winding up order would be to make the company cease to exist and to give rights to innocent third parties like the creditors of the erstwhile company against the shareholders The first defendant said that the shares out of the shares covered by Exhibit were transferred to the name of the third defendant and another shares out of the shares covered by Exhibit were transferred to the name of the fourth defendant as properly stamped transfer forms signed by the transferor and transferee were presented to the bank and the directors had allowed the transfers and deleted the names of the plaintiffs regarding those shares and substituted the names of defendants and since no such transfer forms were presented regarding the remaining shares there was no occasion to the bank directors to consider any transfer applications except when the first plaintiff after becoming the managing director once more had at an invalid meeting of the directors got the shares transferred to the third defendant without any proper transfer forms and without producing the shares and so that act was challenged by the third defendant who filed a rectification petition allowed by the order of <ORG> bringing back the names of the plaintiffs to the register once more in respect of these shares Defendants and not only adopted the above contentions of defendant I but urged that there was no privity of contract between them and the plaintiffs regarding the sale of the shares under Exhibit The second defendant has filed a written statement contending that he had never agreed to purchase from the plaintiffs the shares under Exhibit as urged by the plaintiffs but was only acting as an intermediary in respect of these shares in other words that he had only promised to find purchasers for those shares if possible and that he was not liable for getting the names of the plaintiffs deleted and those of the purchasers substituted in respect of these shares as no purchasers had bought them and it was the duty of the plaintiffs to have applied to the first defendant bank by filing properly stamped transfer forms duly signed by the transferor and transferee after he had ascertained the names of the purchasers So all the defendants prayed that the suit and petition should be dismissed with their costs <NAME> held that though no properly stamped instrument of transfer excuted by the transferor and transferee had been delivered to the bank along with the share certificates in respect of these shares and the necessary formalities required by Section of the Companies Act and under Article of the Bank Articles of Association had not been complied with and there was no fraud or default or negligence by the bank in not effecting transfers as there was no application for transfer regarding these shares either by the transferor or transferee as required by Section and by both under Article still the terms of Section were wide enough to give him power to rectify the register in the circumstances of the case as the fraud of the second defendant on the plaintiffs was enough to sustain the claim of the plaintiffs for rectification and if the second defendant had acted honestly as per his representation made to the first plaintiff the plaintiffs names would not have continued in the register of sharesholders of the bank regarding these shares and so the Court had the right and indeed the duty to remove the plaintiff names regarding these shares in the bank register of shareholders and substitute the second defendant name especially as the second defendant had the full benefit of the shares and had raised money on their security from the third defemdant and had made the third defendant send those scrips and blank transfer ferns to <ORG> Bombay of which he was the Chairman of <ORG> selling the shares to the <ORG> and paying the sale proceeds to the third defendant towards the mortgage amount He observed that mere knowledge of the sale of the shares by the plaintiffs on the part of the officers of the bank because of the telephone conversation referred to by would not be enough to satisfy the requirements of Section of the Companies Act or Article of the Articles of Association though it might be taken into account regarding the plea of estoppel raised by the plaintiffs In the end therefore he gave the plaintiffs a decree granting them the declarations and injunction as prayed for regarding the shares and directing the bank to rectify its register of shareholders regarding these shares by deleting the names of the plaintiffs as holders or owners thereof and substituting the name of the second defendant as the purchaser of those shares overruling the contention that the bank had an absolute discretion under Section and Article to decline to transfer the shares He directed the second defendant who remained absent after filing his written statement though keeping his advocate Mr <NAME> to watch the case to pay the costs of the plaintiffs with subsequent interest thereon at six per cent per annum from the date of taxation till date of payment and directed all the defendants to bear their own costs in the suit but allowed the official liquidators of the first defendant bank to recover their costs including an advocate fee of Rs Mr <NAME> urged various grounds for holding the judgment and decree of <NAME> to be unsound and unsustainable Mr <NAME> first contention was that no petition under Section of the Companies Act will lie after a petition for winding up resulting eventually in a winding up order has been filed as in this case since under the Insolvency Law an order of winding up like an adjudication will take effect from the filing of the petition itself and the company must be deemed to have ceased to exist from the dale of the petition as the rights of the innocent third parties would have intervened on the winding up order The following on servations in the judgment of <ORG> at page are relevant The assumption is that while the company is a going concern no creditor has any specific right to retain the individual liability of any particular shareholder He would have a right to transfer his shares without reference to creditors The same principle cannot without undue extension be applied to a case where a petition for rectification is filed after the winding up petition but before the winding up order as the company is still a going concern carrying on its business a suit for specific performance and rectification of register filed four days before the petition for winding up was presented was rejected as the company was in a state of bankruptcy and as the jurisdiction given to a <ORG> in such cases for rectifying a register though not limited to cases in which there had been error mistake or default on the part of the company and was a wide jurisdiction such jurisdiction ought to be confined to cases where the register is incorrect through the default of the company when it was rushing towards bankruptcy and as in the present case there had been no delay or default on the part of the company the <ORG> should not use its discretion and rectify the register it was held that an application for rectification would not lie after the winding up order was passed and the rights of innocent third parties the creditors arose Lord <NAME> held that a petitioner cannot be relieved from his liability for shares in a company upon the ground of misrepresentation in the prospectus on a bill filed after the presentation of a petition for winding up the company on which an order for winding up was subsequently passed though the petitioner might have his remedy against any of the defendants except the company Thus it is obvious that even without any mistake default or fraud of the company a man name may be entered in the register of shareholders in substitution of an existing shareholder name by the directors approving of a transfer of the shares in the name of the transferee either on the transferee cleverly forging the transfer deed in order to make an unlawful gain or on the transferors forging it in order to pass on his liability and cause unlawful loss to another and yet a <ORG> can and ought to rectify the register if a petition is filed before the winding up and the fraud or forgery is proved There are several English rulings rectifying the register in such cases Upon the best consideration I have been able to give to the subject I am inclined to think that the jurisdiction is general and not limited as suggested The intention of the section as I understand it is to provide a summary means of dealing with cases which the <ORG> in its discretion should think might be so dealt with A large and wide discretion ought I think to be exercised by the <ORG> in determining whether it will exercise the power given to it by the section and it is I think too narrow a construction to hold that the section applies only where there is error mistake or default on the part of the company In other words there is jurisdiction in the <ORG> to rectify the register even in the absence of error or mistake or default on the part of the company though the <ORG> will not usually exercise its discretion and rectify the register when there is no mistake or error or default on the part of the company In that case the <ORG> refused to exercise its jurisdiction and order rectification on the ground that there was no mistake or delay or default on the part of the company In Ex parte Shaw the <ORG> of Appeal held that it was not necessary to give jurisdiction to a <ORG> for rectifying a register of shareholders in a company that there should be mistake or delay or default on the part of the company but that it is a matter of discretion whether the <ORG> will exercise that jurisdiction and that in a complicated or doubtful case the jurisdiction ought not to be exercised but that in a clear case it ought to be exercised and rectification made The last and strongest ground urged by Mr <NAME> was that in the absence of the presentation of a duly stamped transfer deed signed by the transferor and transferee to the bank along with the scrips in respect of these shares and the admitted fact that the transfer forms in respect of these shares are still blank without any transferees signing therein the bank had no authority to transfer the shares to the name of the second or third or fourth defendant as prayed for by the plaintiffs and that the bank was certainly not bound to do so in view of Section of the Companies Act and Article of the Articles of Association and that <NAME> went grievously wrong in directing the second defendant name to be substituted for the name of the plaintiffs overriding the absolute discretion of the bank given under Section of the Companies Act and Article of the Articles of Association to refuse to register any transfer without giving any reason whatever Section of the Companies Act says that an application for the registration of the transfer of shares in a company may be made either by the transferor or the transferee provided that where such application is made by the transferor no registration shall in the case of partly paid up shaes like these shares be effected unless the company gives notice of the application to the transferee and that the company can unless objection is taken by the transferee within two weeks from the date of receipt of the notice enter in its register the name of the transferee in the place of the transferor Section says Nothing in this section shall prejudice any power of the company Under its articles to refuse to register the transfer of any shares Cases it has been held that where the Articles of Association of a Company require the transfer of shares to be executed by both parties the <ORG> has no power to rectify the register by removing the name of the transferor unless the transfer deed has been executed by the transferee also It will be contrary to justice equity and good conscience and indeed sense and commonsense alike for the <ORG> to override these terms agreed to by the parties in all solemnity and no <ORG> is given power to do so a Bench of this Court consisting of Kumaraswami Sastri and <NAME> JJ It was observed there at page It is argued by Mr <NAME> that when there is a <ORG> sale and a purchase under it there is no discretion left for the directors and that they are bound to transfer the shares It is argued by Mr <NAME> for the other side that there is nothing in the Companies Act or the Articles of Association to make any difference between private sales and sales in execution of decrees the necessity for the sanction of the directors being to prevent undesirable persons or debtors of the company from getting transfers of shares that there is still a discretion in the directors to recognise or not purchasers in execution of decrees The view of this Bench regarding the discretion of the directors to allow or refuse to register the transfer represents in our opinion the correct state of the law as it is based on several English Rulings like <NAME> Case Eq the company was not a party to the litigation and the observation of the learned Judge that there was a discretion in the directors to recognise or not purchasers in execution of decree was only obiter will have no relevancy regarding this matter Gentle held that in the absence of an instrument of transfer signed by the transferor and transferee and duly stamped and presented to the company for registration of the transfer when so required by Articles of Association there was no power in the company to register the transfer and the registration was set aside as ultra vires of Section of the Compames Act just as <ORG> in Application No of set aside the registration of these very shares in the third defendant name by this bank after the first plaintiff became again its managing director and chairman by his order dated th April for the same reason among others that before a shareholder claims his name should be entered on the register of the company as a shareholder he has to submit the share scrip and a properly executed and duly stamped transfer deed sign ed by the transferor and transferee and that where an instrument of transfer pronerly stamped has not been given it cannot be said that the transferee name was omitted without any sufficient cause Mr <NAME> urged that the absolute discretion given to the company to accept or reject an application for registration or a transfer under an Article in the Articles of Association recognised by the rulings cited above and by Section of the Companies Act cannot be held to be valid as it is arbitrary and un reasonable and affects the citizen rights of property The discretion given to the company under the Articles of Association is in our opinion perfectly justifiable as that is necessary for the well being of companies and was the basis of the contract between the company and the shareholders to fully paid up shares and justify in the interests of the public the discretion given to the company under the Articles of Association and under Section to refuse to register the transfers in the names of the undesirable persons There was no estoppel in law by such conduct It must be remembered that even when the bank illegally ordered the transfer of these shares in the name of the third defendant not second defendant after the first plaintiff again became the Managing Director and Chairman for a short spell there were no duly completed stamped transfer deeds and an application for registering the transfer before the bank In the end therefore we set aside the judgment and decree of <NAME> in No of and Application No of and direct the name of the second defendant to be removed from the list of shareholders in the register of shareholders kept by the bank in respect of these shares and direct the names of the plaintiffs to be put back in the register as shareholders now contributories
