and gave notice on September to the effect that all employees on the <ORG> rolls of the <ORG> on August and who wish to report for duty must resume work on September A third notice gave extension of time to the workmen to resume work The question was whether the notice dated August terminated the services of the respondents by discharging them with effect from August and the notice dated September merely gave them an opportunity of re employment at the pleasure of the company on fulfilment of certain conditions The powers of <ORG> to interfere in cases of dismissal of workmen by the company are not unlimited and the <ORG> does not act as a court of appeal and substitute its own judgment for that of the management It will interfere when there is want of good faith when there is victimisation or unfair labour practice when the management has been guilty of a basic error or violation of a principle of natural justice or when on the materials the finding is completely baseless or perverse The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> four appeals by special leave arise out of certain labour disputes between the employer Messrs Originally the case out of which Civil Appeals and have arisen was known as the case of workmen and the other case out of which Civil Appeals and have arisen was known as the case of workmen It was alleged on behalf of the <ORG> that on September a procedure was established for an amicable settlement of such disputes as might arise between the <ORG> and its employees This adversely affected the production of the <ORG> and it addressed a letter to the Secretary of the <ORG> on January drawing the attention of the <ORG> to the illegal stoppage of work and slow down tactics the letter further stated that if there was no improvement in the attitude of the workers the <ORG> would be compelled to take such action as it considered necessary to bring about resumption of normal work With regard to the demands made by the workers of the <ORG> section they were informed that joint petitions without reference to the <ORG> or <ORG> would not be accepted and so long as normal work was not resumed no consideration could be given to the demands made It appears that the <ORG> also informed the <ORG> that the workers concerned had made no representation to the <ORG> and the <ORG> did not support their activities The impasse continued and in March there was a tripartite conference between the Labour Commissioner of <ORG> the General Manager of the <ORG> and the President of the <ORG> The workers committee protested against the closing of two shifts and the trouble continued till April when the <ORG> issued a notice to the workmen that unless they voluntarily recorded their willingness to do normal work they would be considered as no longer employed by the <ORG> from on April slow strike and the unsatisfactory working of the <ORG> and in consequence of the illegal strike which took place on This notice stated inter alia All employees on the <ORG> rolls of the <ORG> on the rd August and who wish to report for duty must resume work between a on Friday the th September and on Saturday the th September on their regular shift On September the Company issued a third notice which quoted a request received from the President of <ORG> for extension of the time given to the workmen to resume work and then concluded as follows The Company is pleased to accede to this request to the extent of one week extension and its notice No GM CS dated may be considered amended accordingly i the extension will be until Friday the nd October Of the workmen with whom we are now concerned workmen reported for duty on October reported for duty on October and one on October The appeal on behalf of the <ORG> was mainly against the order directing that the employees who had turned up on or before October must be taken back in employment and the appeal on behalf of the workmen raised the question that full compensation should be given to the work <ORG> dismissed both appeals the appeal of the <ORG> on merits and the appeal of the workmen on the ground that it did not involve any substantial question of law In Civil Appeal No Mr <NAME> Attorney General has appeared for the <ORG> and has argued that both the <ORG> below went wrong on principle in construing the notices dated August and September respectively It is worthy of note that the first notice states inter alia that in consequence of the illegal strikes which took place on several previous dates the Management has no option but to declare a look out of the entire Works except some special shifts with effect from Monday August then in the concluding portion the notice states The services of all other workers shall be deemed to be discharged with effect from Monday August then it states that all employees on the Works rolls of the <ORG> on August and who wish to report for duty must resume work between a on Friday September and on Saturday September The learned Attorney General has referred us to some oral and documentary evidence to show that the workmen themselves understood the notice dated August as a notice of discharge He has referred particularly to the letter dated September written by <ORG> to the General Manager of the <ORG> in which the notice dated August was referred to as an illegal and unconstitutional notice of discharge On the other side Mr <NAME> appearing for the respondent workmen has referred us to the evidence given by some of the <ORG> servants which showed that no formal order of discharge was recorded in the service book of the employees as required by the rules nor any notice of one month given for discharging the workmen but on the contrary the workmen were given continuity of service for the entire period of their absence What happened at the interview was stated by <NAME> witness for the <ORG> who said Question Why these men were not taken Answer These men were interviewed but they could not give satisfactory explanation for not reporting for duty within the time given On the contrary the <ORG> found that the <ORG> scrutinised the conduct of the workmen to find out how far they were associated with <ORG> how far they took part in the meetings etc For these reasons we do not think that the appellant <ORG> in Civil Appeal has made out any case for our interference with the decision appealed from There was some argument before us as to the illegal nature of the strike declared by the workmen and also as to the legality of the lock out declared by the <ORG> It has been somewhat faintly suggested that if the notice dated August terminated the services of the workmen and the second notice dated September operated as a conditional revocation of the earlier notice then there was no consideration for the condition imposed and the <ORG> could change its mind and ignore the condition In the view which we have taken of the three notices it becomes unnecessary also to examine this submission The Labour Appellate <ORG> dismissed both the appeals We now proceed to consider the cases of the workmen in Civil Appeal What happened in the case of these men is that on diverse dates between July and July they were taken in custody by the police and remained in custody for some time they applied for leave when in custody but leave was refused The same principle should apply in the present case This may be unfortunate for them but it would be unjust to hold that in such circumstances the <ORG> must always give leave when an application for leave is made workman means any person employed including an apprentice in any industry to do any skilled or unskilled manual or clerical work for hire or reward and includes for the purposes of any proceedings under this Act in relation to an industrial dispute a workman discharged during that dispute but does not include any person employed in the naval military or air service of the <ORG> We see no reason to hold that the finding of the two <ORG> on this point is erroneous On merits the case against <NAME> was that as a result of a regular and proper enquiry he was found guilty of unauthorised absence and insubordination etc On the th July he went on leave I find absolutely no reason why this man should be dismissed So I set aside the order of dismissal passed against him and order his reinstatement This brings us to the case of <NAME> where also the same principles apply She made some comments to <NAME> with regard to a pass which had been issued to <NAME> and the comments innocuous in themselves were magnified into a charge of intimidation Undoubtedly the management of a concern has power to direct its own internal administration and discipline but the power is not unlimited and when a dispute arises Industrial <ORG>s have been given the power to see whether the termination of service of a workman is justified and to give appropriate relief It will interfere i when there is a want of good faith ii when there is victimisation or unfair labour practice iii when the management has been guilty of a basic error or violation of a principle of natural justice and iv when on the materials the finding is completely baseless or perverse On March he was charged that he took an active part in the slow down strike in the Hot Mills section and he initiated such action and instigated others to do the same On March he submitted his explanation There was an enquiry Against <NAME> there was a charge for slow down tactics later he was charged with assaulting the <ORG> driver In the peculiar circumstances of this case the parties will bear their own costs here
