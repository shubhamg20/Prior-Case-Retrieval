HEADNOTE In exercise of the power conferred by A of the Sales Tax Act which enabled <ORG> by notification to fix the rate of the tax to be levied on the sales of goods specified in the section not exceeding nine pies per rupee the Government issued at notification dated June imposing a tax of six pies in the rupee on sales of jute of the Constitution of India calling in question its validity and <ORG> held that there was no power in the <ORG> to issue the notification under A on March as that section was itself to come into force only on April The petitioner who was carrying on business in the manufacture and sale of jute goods filed an application under Art that the power of a legislature to enact a law with re ference to a topic entrusted to it is unqualified and that in the exercise of such a power it will be competent for the legislature to enact a law which is either prospective or retrospective The fact that the seller is not in a position to pass the sales tax on to the consumer does not affect the competence of the legislature to enact a law imposing a sales tax retrospectively as that is a matter of policy The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The petitioner is a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act its registered office being at Kanpur in the State of Uttar Pradesh and it is carrying on business in the manufacture and sale of jute goods That is the Sales Tax Act No XV of and that came into force on April There were subsequent amendments to it in and but they are not material for the present discussion If <ORG> makes a declaration under sub section of this section it may further declare that the turnover of the dealer who is liable to pay tax on the sale of such goods shall in respect of such sales be taxed at such rate as may be specified not exceeding one anna per rupee if the sale relates to goods specified below i Motor vehicles including motor cars motor taxi cabs motor cycles and cycle combinations motor scooters motorettes motor omnibuses motor vans and motor lorries It was under this provision that <ORG> had issued a notification on June imposing a tax of six pies in the rupee on the sale of jute In exercise of the power conferred by Art In exercise of the power conferred by section A of the Sales Tax Act as amended from time to time and in supersession of all previous notifications on the subject the Governor of Uttar Pradesh is hereby pleased to declare that the turnover in respect of the goods specified in the List below shall not with effect from April be liable to tax except a in the case of goods imported from outside Uttar Pradesh at the point of sale by importer and in the case of goods manufactured in Uttar Pradesh at the point of sale by the manufacturer and the Governor is further pleased to declare that such turnover shall with effect from the said date be taxed at the rate of one anna per rupee Jute goods In due course the Sales Tax Ordinance No IX of was replaced by the Sales Tax Amendment Act XIX of and that came into force on May dated March is valid there is no question that the petitioner would be liable to pay sales tax for the period in question at the rate of one anna per rupee on the sale proceeds That Act received the assent of the President on August and was published on September It runs so far as is material as follows For sub section of Section I of the Sales Tax Amendment Act the following shall be and be deemed to have always been substituted This Section so much of Section as relates to the substitution of the second proviso to sub section of Section of the Sales Tax Act hereinafter called the principal Act and section shall have effect on and from the st day of March If the <ORG> thought that this legislation would give a quietus to the controversy they were sadly mistaken After the Amendment Act of came into force another dealer who was sought to be assessed pursuant to the notification dated March filed a petition under Art This decision set the legislature again on the move and that brings us to what may be said to be the final round in the game It received the assent of the President on May and was published in <ORG> on May Act XV of and any action taken in pursuance thereof Section of the Act which deals with the present matter runs as follows Validation of certain notifications and action taken in pursuance thereof Notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court the notifications specified in Part A Part and Part of the Schedule shall be deemed to have been issued in exercise of the powers conferred respectively by section section A and section of the Sales Tax Act as if the said sections were in force on the date on which the notifications were issued in the form in which they were in force immediately before the commencement of this Act and all the said notifications shall be valid and shall be deemed always to have been valid and shall continue in force until amended varied or rescinded by any notification issued under any of the said section Anything done or any action taken including any order made proceeding taken direction issued jurisdiction exercised assessment made or tax levied or collected purporting to have been done or taken in pursuance of any of the notifications specified in the Schedule shall be deemed to be and to have been validly and lawfully done or taken In Part are set out the notifications issued in exercise of the powers conferred by A of the Sales Tax Act and one of them is the impugned notification No ST A construction which will lead to such a result must if that is possible be avoided But then the words in the form can have no reference to the impugned notification because it had never changed form whereas they were quite appropriate to A because it had been amended We now proceed to examine the second contention of the petitioner that the validation Act is itself invalid as being ultra vires the powers of the State legislature under the Constitution The State legislature derives its authority to enact a law with respect to tax on the sale of goods under entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution In the present case the sales sought to be taxed took place between April and July whereas the Validation Act by force of which the tax becomes payable came into force in That could be done only if the tax was levied before the sale took place It is accordingly contended that whether we have regard to the true features of the sales tax legislation or the provisions of the Sales Tax Act the Validation Act could not be held to be one with respect to sales tax that it is therefore not within entry and as there is no other entry in List II or List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution under which the legislation could be justified it must be held to be ultra vires That entry confers on the States authority to enact a law with respect to tax on sales of goods a tax on the supply of materials in a contract for the construction of works simpliciter on the footing of a sale was held to be outside the entry and the legislation which imposed such a tax was struck down as ultra vires But where the transaction is one of sale of goods as known to law the power of the State to impose a tax thereon is plenary and unrestricted subject only to any limitation which the Constitution might impose and in the exercise of that power it will be competent to the legislature to impose a tax on sales which had taken place prior to the enactment of the legislation Plainly a tax levied on the first sale must in the nature of things be a tax on the sale by the manu facturer or producer but it is levied upon him qua seller and not qua manufacturer or producer In the context the words on the occasion of the sale have reference to the character of the transaction and not to the point of time at which the duty becomes leviable and they have no bearing on the question as to when such a tax could be imposed And then it is argued that a sales tax being an indirect tax the seller who pays that tax has the right to pass it on to the consumer that a law which imposes a sales tax long after the sales had taken place deprives him of that right that retrospective operation is in consequence an incident inconsistent with the true character of a sales tax law and that the Validation Act is therefore not a law in respect of tax on the We see no force in this contention But it is not an essential characteristic of a sales tax that the seller must have the right to pass it on to the consumer nor is the power of the legislature to impose a tax on sales conditional on its making a provision for sellers to collect the tax from the purchasers The following observations of <NAME> bearing on this question might be quoted Under the Act the primary liability to pay the sales tax so far as the State is concerned is on the seller This is further made clear by the fact that the registered dealer need not if he so pleases or chooses collect the tax from the purchaser and some times by reason of competition with other registered dealers he may find it profitable to sell his goods The power of a legislature to enact a law with reference to a topic entrusted to it is as already stated unqualified subject only to any limitation imposed by the Constitution In the exercise of such a power it will be competent for the legislature to enact a law which is either prospective or retrospective It places no restrictions on the nature of the law to be passed by <ORG> What is material to observe is that the power conferred on <ORG> under Art is a legislative power and such a power conferred on <ORG> carries with it authority to enact a law either prospectively or retrospectively unless there can be found in the Constitution itself a limitation on that power That has to be determined solely on the construction of entry in List II in the Seventh Schedule and any other provisions of the Constitution bearing on the question Even assuming that the provisions of the Sales Tax Act XV of contemplate a levy of tax in future that does not affect the power of the legislature under entry to enact a law with retrospective operation That the States will have to frame rules for realising the tax which becomes now payable is not a ground for holding that there is in fact no imposition of tax This petition must therefore be dismissed with costs
