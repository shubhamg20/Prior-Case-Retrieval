Against these assessments appeals were taken to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner it being contended that section of the Act did not authorise the assessment at the maximum rate that the notices were invalid inasmuch as they did not contain the necessary particulars required to be stated therein and further that the provision of the Indian Income tax Act imposing the liability to tax on a non resident at the maximum rate was unconstitutional as offending article of the Constitution of India Under section of the Act the assessees moved the <ORG> to refer certain questions of law for the consideration of this court and the questions of law so referred ar Whether the provision of the Income tax Act for the levy of maximum rate is not a denial of equality before the law within the meaning of article of the Constitution of India and void under article and the present assessment as a non resident at the maximum rate is not therefore void Whether the aforesaid reassessments under section for all the assessment years to in the case of <NAME> and assessment years to in the case <NAME> are valid We shall deal with the second question first What is contended in this regard is that in the copy of the notice issued by the Income tax Officer the Income tax Officer stated that he had reason to believe that the assessees income assessable to income tax for the relevant assessment year had a escaped assessment been under assessed been assessed at too low a rate been subject to excessive relief and been the subject of computation of the excessive loss or depreciation allowance Since the assessees had failed to disclose their status as non residents but had in their original returns indicated that they were residents of Panruti and failed also to furnish particulars of their incomes derived outside the taxable territories the tax had been levied at a rate relevant to the income disclosed in those returns income that accrued or arose within the taxable territories only The relevant requirements in so far as they are material to the present case are that the Income tax Officer should have reason to believe that by reason of the failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year the income profits or gains chargeable to income tax had escaped assessment for that year or been under assessed or been assessed at too low a rate If he has such reason he is required to serve on the assessee a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of section It is clear therefore that when the Income tax Officer honestly believes that the income profits or gains have been assessed at too low a rate by reason of the failure of the assessee to disclose all material facts necessary for his assessment the only notice that he is called upon to issue to the assessee is a notice of the description referred to in section sub section It does not even appear from the section that the Income tax Officer should expressly state it to be a notice under section of the Act Even otherwise if the assessee had not submitted his return and the assessment year had elapsed even a notice issued for the first time by the Income tax Officer under section is one which comes within the scope of section for it would be a case where there had been a failure of the assessee to make a return of his income and the income profits or gains chargeable to income tax had escaped assessment for that year It may also be specifically noticed that the requirements of a notice purporting to be the precursor of the reopening of the assessment is not in any way different from the requirements of a notice required to be issued under section of the Act It would suffice in our opinion if the notice merely stated that the Income tax Officer believed that the case of the assessee required reopening of the assessment under section of the Act and to indicate that he had complied with the requirements of the provision by obtaining the prior approval of the Commissioner of Income tax and in terms of the section called upon the assessee to submit a return containing such particulars as section sub section requires The conditions for reopening of the assessment are not the same as the contents of the notice to be issued to the assessee The conditions requisite are merely that the Income tax Officer should have reason to believe that one or the other of the grounds necessitating the revision of the assessment existed in the case It may be that when the Income tax Officer commences the proceedings under section he might have had reason to believe that a particular item of income had escaped to be included in the assessable income of the assessee We are unable to gather anything from this decision which supports the contention at present raised with regard to the requirements of the notice The argument was that the Income tax Officer was bound to begin proceedings again as regards assessment and proceed as if there was an enquiry in respect not only of the portion which had escaped assessment but of all other items also But before issuing the notice the proviso requires that the officer should record his reasons for initiating action under section and obtain the sanction of the Commissioner who must be satisfied that the action under section was justified There is no requirement in any of the provisions of the Act or any section laying down as a condition for initiation of the proceedings that the reasons which induced the Commissioner to accord sanction to proceed under section must also be communicated to the assessee It is not intended by the proviso that the reasons should be communicated to the assessee The learned judges also observed that it was unnecessary for the notice to state whether the Income tax Officer was limiting the assessment for the period of eight years or four years that is to say whether it was a case which the Income tax Officer thought came within the scope of a or It is true that when answering a notice issued under the section the assessee may take a plea of limitation and for purposes of such a plea it may be necessary for him to know whether his case is being treated as one under clause a or as one under clause It appears to me however that whether the case is treated as coming under one clause or the other will transpire in the course of the assessment proceedings and it is neither required of the Income tax Officer not is it necessary that he should specify the clause in the notice itself So also it is claimed the power to reopen an assessment should be deemed to be exhausted when resort to that provision has been had once The learned judge observed that within the time limit specified in section of the Indian Income tax Act there is no restriction as to the number of proceedings that can be taken to reopen the assessment by way of assessment or reassessment computation or re computation We agree with this view of the learned judge There can be no restriction as to the number of proceedings that can be taken to reopen the assessment where it is found that any income of the assessee has for one reason or another escaped assessment There is no doubt therefore that the assessee was fully aware of the reasons that led to the reopening of the assessment We have next to consider whether the present case would fall within sub clause a or of section That would lead us to a consideration of the question whether the disclosure of the status of the assessee as a resident or non resident is not a material fact necessary for his assessment In the particular case of a non resident who has income accruing or arising both within and without the taxable territories the income arising without the taxable territories is brought to tax but at a rate dependent upon his total world income It is undoubtedly a material fact necessary for the assessment and it is indisputable that in the present case the assessee had failed to disclose this material fact in his return for the relevant assessment years It is argued by Mr <NAME> in this regard that there has been no failure on the part of the assessee to disclose this material fact and that at the best it can only be regarded that in consequence of information which the Income tax Officer came to possess the assessment had been made at too low a rate There has undoubtedly been a failure on the part of the assessee to disclose the material fact It is next contended that the provision in the Income tax Act levying tax at the maximum rate on a non resident is violative of article of the Constitution It is urged also that the legislature is not competent to tax the other income that is to say income which does not arise or accrue within the taxable territories in the case of a non resident and that being so it must equally follow that there can be no lawful authority for the levy of tax on a non resident at a higher rate dependent upon the extra territorial income We are only dealing with the question whether a rate of tax dependent upon the classification of the assessee as resident or non resident has a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation The assessee will pay the costs of the department
