A and and according to the prosecution these leaflets were distributed with a view to exciting disaffection towards the Government established by law in India and also in order to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between Manipuri and non Manipuri citizens of the Indian Republic residing in Manipur On the appellants moved a transfer application No of in this Court and the case was transferred from the Court of the District Magistrate Manipur to the Court of some other competent Magistrate on and so the former got the Sub Divisional Officer <NAME> invested with powers to try cases Under Section A IPC and then this case was transferred to that Court It has been contended on behalf of the appellants that the present proceedings were void because no prosecution Under Section A or Section A IPC could be taken cognisance of by any Court unless a complaint with regard to these allegations had been made by an order or under authority from <ORG> or some officers empowered by <ORG> in this behalf Section Criminal clearly lays down No Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under Chapter VI or IX A of the Indian Penal Code except Section or punishable Under Section A or Section A cr Section A for Section A or Section of the same Code unless upon complaint made by order of or under authority from <ORG> or some officer empowered by <ORG> in this behalf It has been held in Barjndra Kumaj Emperor Cal at that absence of sanction Under Section Criminal vitiates the whole proceedings The object of sanction Under Section Criminal is to ensure prosecution only when after due consideration the appropriate sanctioning authority is satisfied that there is a proper case to put the party on trial and also to save time of the criminal Court being wasted by needless prosecution without conviction vide Tuck Saw Hain Kee Low Bur Rul In re Parameswara Nambudri AIR Mad I The learned Government Advocate has urged that it was held on by this Court in State <NAME> that in Manipur obtaining of previous sanction under Section Criminal from <ORG> was not necessary and so no sanction was obtained in this case The word corresponding has been given a meaning in the Universal English Dictionary by <NAME> as standing in a similar relation agreeing with being equivalent to <ORG> does not lay down detailed provisions regarding procedure in criminal cases and so practically all the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure are applied here in criminal cases except when there is a special provision in the <ORG> which goes clearly against some provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure on any particular subject I have already pointed out above that there is only one provision in the <ORG> in connection with the trial of cases under A IPC and it is with regard to the filing of appeal in <ORG> instead of in the Court of the Sessions Judge and as no special provision has been made in the <ORG> regarding sanction it becomes clear that the provision of Section Criminal should govern cases like the present Criminal the appellants were seriously prejudiced as their case was not examined by the appropriate sanctioning authority and it was not held to be a fit case for being sent to any Court for trial The result must be unfortunate for the prosecution but it is essential that the rules of procedure designed to secure to ensure justice should be scrupulously followed and all <ORG> should be jealous in seeing that there is no breach The next contention put forward by the learned Counsel for the appellants is that the prosecution Under Section A is void and ultra vires Section A runs as follows Whoever by words either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representation or otherwise brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards Government established by law in British India shall be punished with transportation for life or any shorter term to which fine may be added or with imprisonment which may extend to years to which fine may be added or with fine Explanation The expression disaffection includes disloyalty and all feelings of enmity Explanation Comments expressing disapprobation of the measures of the <ORG> with a view to obtain their alteration by lawful means without exciting or attempting to excite hatred contempt or disaffection do not constitute an offence under this section Article of the Constitution runs as follows All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form associations or unions to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business Nothing in Sub clause a of Clause shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the <ORG> from making any law in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause in the interest of the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of Court defamation or incitement to an offence The present Clause is substituted by Constitution First Amendment Act of Section a The said clause is to be deemed always to have been enacted in the form given above and therefore its substitution the clause was as follows Nothing in Sub clause a of Clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to or prevent the State from making any law relating to libel as well as defamation contempt of <ORG> or any matter which offends against decency or morality or to undermine security or tends to overthrow the State In the former Clause the <ORG> could make any law relating to any matter which undermines the security or tends to overthrow the <ORG> the <ORG> can make any law imposing reasonable restriction on the exercise of right conferred by Clause Sub clause a of Article of the Constitution in the interest of the security of the <ORG> public order incitement to an offence The words used in the amendment are no doubt wider in scope but it will have to be seen whether Section A Penal Code would be operative and binding in view of the amendment Under Clause of Article of the Constitution reasonable restriction may be imposed by law in the interest of the security of the <ORG> friendly relation with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of Court defamation or incitement to an offence A careful perusal of Article of the Constitution makes it clear that reasonable restriction on freedom of speech and expression can be imposed in the interest of the security of the State and so it is to be considered whether if by mere spoken or written words or signs or visible representation or otherwise disaffection towards the Government is brought about or attempted to be brought about any restriction can be placed under Clause of Article of the Constitution But so far as the question of imposing restriction on speeches or other representations which tend to bring the <ORG> into hatred or contempt as distinct from mere criticism or even ridicule the position appears to be different Section A runs as follows Whoever by words either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise promotes or attempts to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens of India shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to two years or with fine or with both Explanation It does not amount to an offence within the meanings of this section to point out without malicious intention and with an honest view to their removal matters which are producing or have a tendency to produce feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of India The Judicial Commissioner after examing holding that the evidence produced by the prosecution did not go to establish that the appellants committed any offence Under Sections A and A Penal Code proceeds to state Now the question remains whether the three leaflets Exs I have been taken through these pamphlets at the time of arguments and various translations have been given of these pamphlets and the main controversy centres round the word Mayang On behalf of the prosecution it has been urged that the word Mayang means non Manipuri and so by using this word in the context referred to above the appellants sought to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of citizens of India As such it has been contended that the word Mayang does not form any class and simply because the appellants felt that Manipuris should have a hand in the Government of their State it cannot be inferred that the present appellants intended to excite feelings as between Manipuris and non Manipuris It has been laid down in Jang I Azad Lahore in the matter of AIR Lah SB that a general criticism of certain officer or officers cannot be deemed to be a criticism of Government established by law and order in British India and as it has not been shown to me by the prosecution conclusively that the word Mayang defines any particular class of people I think the present appellants cannot be deemed to be guilty Under Sections A and A IPC simply because they used the word Mayang in the leaflets Exs Rule Defence of India Rules and Clause of Section Press Emergency Powers Act shows that the offence of sedition described in the Penal Code has for its ingredients the same elements which constitute a prejudicial act within the meaning of the Rule Defence of India Rules and these ingredients are also common to the mischief envisaged by Clause of Section of the Press Act Along with this <ORG> is strongly demanded to immediately replace non Manipuri officers holding the key posts of heads of Departments by the local talents The prosecution should have proved in the present case specifically which particular appellant committed offence Under Sections A and A by laying stress on particular passages or words but this also had not been done In view of my findings above the charges Under Sections A and A IPC were not established against the present appellants beyond all reasonable doubts and so I allow this appeal and I set aside the conviction of the appellants and as well as the sentences which have been imposed ou them under these sections
