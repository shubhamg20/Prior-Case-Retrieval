with effect from October by Act of and it has now become an unlimited liability under Section a of the Motor Vehicles Act which has come into force with effect from July In this appeal it is contended on behalf of the insurance company by Sri <NAME> that the view taken in Titanhamani case ACJ is no longer good law in view of the two decisions of <ORG> referred to above and that the defences enumerated in Section are not relevant for the purpose of this case According to him the defences that may be taken by the insurance company are limited only if the company wants to avoid the policy totally but if the insurance company wants to claim that its liability is restricted to the statutory limits mentioned in Section such a defence is not prohibited by the provisions of Section of the Act under Section ii of the Act as it stood on November when the accident occurred the said liability has become an unlimited liability in view of the provisions of Section a of the Motor Vehicles Act which has come into force on July His submission also is that inasmuch as the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act have come into force during the pendency of this appeal which was filed in the provisions of the new Motor Vehicles Act have to be applied in view of the provisions in Section of the Motor Vehicles Act and that under Section it will be for the insurance company in its turn to recover the excess amount over and above its statutory limits prescribed by Section ii by way of a separate proceeding by the company against the insured On the basis of the above contentions the following points arise for consideration Whether under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act the insurance company is not entitled to take a defence that its liability is to be limited to the statutory liability mentioned in Section and whether <NAME> case ACJ is not correctly decided Whether the provisions relating to the unlimited liability of the insurance company specified in Section a of the Motor Vehicles Act which came into force with effect from July are retrospective and apply to pending cases and even to an accident which has occurred on November and to a claim which has been filed on April Whether in view of Section of the Motor Vehicles Act the insurance company is bound to discharge any liability incurred by the vehicle owner and whether the insurance company is bound to recover the excess amount over and above the statutory liability under Section from the insured by way of proceedings to be taken out by the insurance company against the insured in view of Section Before doing so we shall refer to the facts in <NAME> case ACJ The two persons filed two separate suits In one suit the plaintiff claimed Rs while in the other suit the plaintiff claimed Rs According to <ORG> a defence based on the limits specified in Section is not one of the defences enumerated in Section of the Act <ORG> pointed out that the principle laid down by <ORG> in Captain <NAME> case Comp Cas Ins applies only to a case where the insurance company intends to avoid the policy in toto on the basis of the defence mentioned in Section The word avoid used in Section is referrable to a case of total avoidance of the insurance policy see Section extracted under point No Captain <NAME> case Comp Cas Ins therefore is not a bar to the insurance company raising a contention that it is not liable for more than the limits prescribed in Section Of course there was no occasion to lay down the principle in the clear terms in which it was laid down in <NAME> case Comp Cas but the fact remains that the decision conforms to the principle laid down in that case The contention raised is that the insurance company liability is now unlimited in view of the provisions of Section a of the Motor Vehicles Act which has come into force on July which came into force on July the said liability of the insurance company has been made unlimited Subject to the proviso to Sub section a policy of insurance referred to in Sub section shall cover any liability incurred in respect of any accident up to the following limits namely a save as provided in Clause the amount of liability incurred in respect of damage to any property of a third party a limit of rupees six thousand Provided that any policy of insurance issued with any limited liability and in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue to be effective for a period of four months after such commencement or till the date of expiry of such policy whichever is earlier Section a to contain various provisions as to savings and a reading of those saving provisions shows that they do not specifically deal with the question of the statutory liability or compulsory insurance It is therefore clear that the provisions of Section of the General Clauses Act are attracted and under that Act the court must first find whether the new Act shows any intention to apply its provisions with retrospective effect nor was it in force on July when the Act came into force The said amendment came into force on March The contention for the claimants was that inasmuch as the amendment came into force during the currency of the policy the said amendment applied Since the liability of the insurer to pay a claim under a motor accident policy arises on the occurrence of the accident and not until then one must necessarily have regard to the state of the law obtaining at the time of the accident for determining the extent of the insurer liability under a statutory policy The provisions of Act came into force on July and there can be absolutely no doubt that the same cannot be applied to an accident which occured on November It is then contended that inasmuch as this appeal is pending when the new Act came into force the new Act should be applied It was pointed out by this court that merely because a statute came into force during the pendency of a case it did not automatically follow that the said statute had to be applied We do not find anything in the new Act of which seeks to alter the liability of the insurance company as it stood on the date of the accident i on November It may be true that there are beneficial provisions in the new Act but even where beneficial provisions are introduced it does not automatically lead to the inference that such provisions are retrospective in nature As we have considered the said question exhaustively in the above said <ORG> judgment we do not propose to deal with the same once again They cannot be applied to the case of an accident which took place on November even though the claim raised in connection with such an accident is pending in appeal by the date of commencement of the new Act The contention is that inasmuch as the owner of the passenger vehicle has been made liable for the total sum of Rs under Section and that it will be for the insurance company to resort to Section to seek to recover any amount paid to the claimants in excess of the statutory liability upon the insurance company under Section Duty of insurers to satisfy judgments against persons insured in respect of third party rishs If after a certificate of insurance has been issued under Sub section of Section in favour of the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under Clause of Sub section of Section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy is obtained against any person insured by the policy then notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy the insurer shall subject to the provisions of this section pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if he were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments No sum shall be payable by an insurer under Sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceeding is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds namely a that the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein before the accident giving rise to the liability and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that the person to whom the certificate was issued has made an affidavit stating that the certificate has been lost or destroyed or that either before or not later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provisions of Section or that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy being one of the following conditions namely i a condition excluding the use of the vehicle a for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward for organised racing and speed testing or for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a transport vehicle or without side car being attached where the vehicle is a motor cycle or ii a condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or iii a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war riot or civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular Where a certificate of insurance has been issued under subsection of Section to the person by whom a policy has been effected so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the person insured thereby by reference to any conditions other than those in Clause of Sub section shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under Clause of Sub section of Section be of no effect Provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability of any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of this sub section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this Section to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the provisions of this Section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person In this Section the expressions material fact and material particulars mean respectively a fact or particular of such a nature as to influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in determining whether he will take the risk and if so at what premium and on what conditions and the expression liability covered by the terms of the policy means a liability which is covered by the policy or which would be so covered but for the fact that the insurer is entitled to avoid or cancel or has avoided or cancelled the policy No insurer to whom the notice referred to in Sub section or Sub section A has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in Sub section or Sub section A otherwise than in the manner provided for in Sub section or in the corresponding law of the reciprocating country as the case may be The contention here is that under Section whenever a judgment is given in respect of a liability incurred by a policy holder under Section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy then the insurance company shall pay to the persons entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if the insurer were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with any amount of costs and interest It is the further contention that under Section inasmuch as the word exceeds is used the insurance company shall first discharge the liability incurred by the insured in toto whatever be such liability and then after deducting the amount covered by the statutory liability of the insurance company under Section the company has to recover the excess amount from the insured by way of a separate action In any case the injured person had no right whatsoever to call upon the insurance company or on the moneys which were payable under the policies Section of that Act corresponds to Section of the Motor Vehicles Act while Section thereof corresponds to our Section and Section corresponds to Section of our Act That applied to cases where the driver or the owner of the car became insolvent even bankrupt or the company went into liquidation It made the insurance company pay directly to the third parties even though such parties are not parties to the insurance contract The provisions of Section of the Act correspond to Section of the Motor Vehicles Act If after a certificate of insurance has been delivered under Sub section of Section of the principal Act Road Traffic Act to the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under para of Sub section of Section of the principal Act being a liability covered by the terms of the policy is obtained against any person insured by the policy then notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy the insurer shall subject to the provisions of this section pay to the persons entitled to the benefit of the judgment any sum payable thereunder in respect of the liability including the amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments No sum shall be payable by an insurer under the foregoing provisions of this section a in respect of any judgment unless before or within seven days after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment was given the insurer had notice of the bringing of the proceedings No sum shall be payable by an insurer under the foregoing provisions of this section if in an action commenced before or within three months after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment was given he has obtained a declaration that apart from any provision contained in the policy he is entitled to avoid it on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular or if he has avoided the policy on that ground that he was entitled so to do apart from any provision contained in it Provided that an insurer who has obtained such a declaration as aforesaid in an action shall not thereby become entitled to the benefit of this sub section as respects any judgment obtained in proceedings commenced before the commencement of that action unless before or within seven days after the commencement of that action he has given notice thereof to the person who is the plaintiff in the said proceedings specifying the non disclosure or false representation on which he proposes to rely and any person to whom notice of such an action is so given shall be entitled if he thinks fit to be made a party thereto If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this Section to pay in respect of a liability of a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which he would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability he shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person The material clauses of Sections and of the said Ordinance read thus Subject to the provisions of this ordinance no person shall use or cause or permit any other person to use a motor vehicle on a public road unless there is in force in relation to the user of the motor vehicle by that person or that other person as the case may be such a policy of insurance or such a security in respect of third party risks as complies with the requirements of this Ordinance In order to comply with the requirements of this Ordinance a policy of insurance must be a policy which a is issued by a person who is an insurer and insures such person persons or classes of persons as may be specified in the policy in respect of any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle on a public road Provided that such a policy shall not be required to cover i liability in respect of the death arising out of and in the course of his employment of a person in the employment of a person insured by the policy or of bodily injury sustained by such a person arising out of and in the course of his employment or ii except in the case of a motor vehicle in which passengers are being carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment liability in respect of the death of or bodily injury to persons being carried in or upon or entering or getting on to or alighting from the motor vehicle at the time of the occurrence of the event out of which the claim arises iii any contractual liability iv liability in respect of the first twenty four dollars of any claim by any one person liability in respect of any sum in excess of four thousand dollars arising out of any one claim by any one person vi liability in respect of any sum in excess of eight thousand dollars arising out of the total claims for any one accident for each vehicle concerned If after a certificate of insurance has been issued under Sub Section of Section to the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under paragraph of Sub section of Section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy is obtained against any person insured by the policy then notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy the insurer shall subject to the provisions of this section pay to the persons entitled to the benefit of the judgment any sum payable thereunder in respect of the liability including any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this Section to pay in respect of a liability of a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which he would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability he shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person It will be noticed that Section of the ordinance corresponds to Section Section to Section and Section while Section corresponds to Section and Section corresponds to Section of the Motor Vehicles Act on a construction of Section Sub clause that the insurers were liable only in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under Section The majority held that the word liability which occurred in the last three provisos to Section had the same meaning which it bore in the three provisos and there was no reason why the <ORG> should not have provided either for total exemption of liability or for partial limited exemption liability above a stated figure Lord <NAME> pointed out that Section of the Honduras Ordinance which was in line with Section of the Road Traffic Act required the policy of insurance to insure such person persons or classes of persons as may be specified in the policy in respect of any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle on a public road This provision corresponds to Section i of the Motor Vehicles Act The learned judge then pointed out that thereafter there are six provisos to in the Honduras Act while the corresponding English provisions contain three provisos The learned judge then referred to the argument of the plaintiff as follows The argument was that the judgment had been obtained in respect of such liability as is required to be covered by Section being a liability covered by the policy and therefore the insurance company must pay to the plaintiff as the person entitled to the benefit of the judgment any sum payable thereunder in respect of that liability namely dollars The insurance company contended that the only relevant liability required to be covered by Section is the liability up to dollars and that alone was the sum payable thereunder in respect of the liability If insurers by virtue of the provisions relating to payments on judgments become liable to pay to a third party a sum in excess of what under the policy they would be liable to pay to their assured in respect of the relevant accident they are entitled to recover the excess from the assured So far as England was concerned an insured apart from his remedy against the insurance company had a separate right against <ORG> to recover the balance amount of the award to the extent it was not covered by the statutory liability Even so the policy of the <ORG> in Central America appeared to be the same as in the Carribean <ORG>s where a similar view had been taken in <ORG> <NAME> WIR limiting the liability of the insurance company to the statutory liability only and rejecting the contention that the insurance company should pay the full amount covered by the judgment and recover the balance over the statutory liability from the insured The word liability in Section of the Honduras Ordinance had the same meaning as the liability mentioned in the prviso to Section corresponding to Section of the Motor Vehicles Act In effect they held that there was nothing unusual if there was some difference between the position in England as compared to other countries in the sense that in England the entire liability of the insured or even in the case of non insurance would be cleared by <ORG> apart from what was covered by the insurance company while in certain other countries the compulsory insurance provisions in the statute could limit the questions of liability of the insurance company Their Lordships agreed with the majority of <ORG> that the words in Section liability as is required to be covered by a policy under paragraph of Sub section of Section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy are referable not only to the basic liability but also to the statutory quantum mentioned therein After referring to Section and Section of the British Honduras Ordinance already set out Lord <NAME> posed the question In a sentence the question of construction is Is liability in respect of any sum in excess of four thousand dollars arising out of any one claim by any one person which by proviso to Sub section of Section a policy is not required to cover nevertheless included in such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under paragraph of Sub section of Section where that expression is used in Section and explained by the following crucial words This sub section was in my view intended to cover inter alia cases where the insurer was entitled to avoid or cancel the policy but even if in the absence of the words if any after the word amount where it appears for the second time in the sub section the verb exceeds is not the most apt to express an excess over nil there are instances of which costs and interest on the judgment are examples where the insurer would be liable in the direct action for sums in excess of the permissible monetary limits upon the cover afforded by the policy The provisions of Section of the Motor Car Ordinance of Ceylon corresponds to Section while Section corresponds to Section and Section to Section Section of the Ordinance corresponds to Section The respondent was injured by the negligent driving of Mr <NAME> The respondent claimed damages for personal injuries against Mr <NAME> for and costs by consent The respondent claimant wanted that the entire sum be paid by the insurer appellant even though by virtue of the provision of the Act of the statutory liability was restricted to The proviso to Section corresponds to Section limiting the liability of the insurance cmpany to and to other amounts in various situations Again Section of the Act corresponds to Section while Section corresponds to Section Their Lordships followed the decision in <NAME> case Lloyd Rep and <NAME> case AC PC The contention that <NAME> case Lloyd Rep was wrongly decided and that the view of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> in <NAME> case Lloyd Rep was correct was rejected A further point was also argued that the policy there covered while the statutory liability of the insurance company was only and the award was for and that <NAME> case Lloyd Rep was distinguishable such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under paragraph of Sub section of Section It is in their Lordships opinion nothing to the point so far as the construction of Section is concerned that the insurers might under the terms of the policy be bound to indemnify the insured in respect of any excess over the statutory minimum for which an injured third party might have obtained judgment against the insured The effect of Section is to limit the amount which the injured third party can recover directly from the insurers It is not necessary for us to go into this further question for it is not contended here that the policy covers any amount in excess of the compulsory liability under the Act No doubt the above observations would show that even if the policy was for a higher amount than the statutory limit the claimants would be entitled as against the insurance company only to the amount compulsorily required to be covered under Section and the balance had to be recovered from the insured Applying the above case law the following principles can be summarised The provisions of Section are unambiguous and clear that where a judgment in respect of the liability referred to in Section being a liability covered by the policy then the insurance company shall pay to the claimants decree holders any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if the insurer was the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments In other words the insurer is not under Section liable to the claimants for the entire amount covered by the judgment but only up to the extent covered by Section read with Section No doubt Section enables the insurer to recover the excess from the insured But this does not refer to a situation where the insurer pays the entire amount covered by the judgment to the claimants and to its recovering the excess over the statutory liability from the insured This is because the basic liability of the insurer is only to the statutory liability covered by Section read with Section They have a meaning and are meant to cover at least one of two different situations In a case where the entire policy is avoided under Section by the insurer on grounds mentioned in Section as against the insured the insurer may after paying to the claimants the amount covered up to its statutory liability under Section read with Section recover whatever it has so paid to the claimants from the insured There can also be a second situation where after paying to the claimants the amount covered by the statutory liability under Section read with Section together with interest and costs the insurer could recover the excess amount over and above the specific statutory figure governing its liability under Section read with Section and obviously the word excess would then mean that the insurer could recover the costs and interest from the insured Of course there is no practice in our country for the general insurance companies to proceed to recover the interest and costs from the insured nor are we to be understood as permitting such a course by laying down a new convention That would in effect mean that in case the insurance policy is totally avoided by the insurance companies on the ground of misrepresentation or otherwise then the entire amount paid or payable to the claimants becomes excess and can be recovered from the insured There is however no claim generally by any insurance company against the insured for the interest and costs and we should not be understood as permitting such a course Thus the liability of the insurance company could only be to the statutory limits and there is no question of recovering the entire amount from the insurance company nor is it necessary to make the company recover the excess from the vehicle owner We hold point No accordingly
