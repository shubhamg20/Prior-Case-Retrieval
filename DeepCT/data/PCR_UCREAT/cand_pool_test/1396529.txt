In <ORG> the respondents contended that the said proviso had no application The words any question of law arising out of such order in of the Indian Income tax Act do not in the context mean any question of law arising out of the findings in the order of the <ORG> but only such questions as were raised before or decided by the <ORG> The power <ORG> has under Of the Act to direct a reference can make no difference since such power is subject to the same limitations as that of the <ORG> under i of the Act The jurisdiction of <ORG> in deciding a reference under is co extensive with the right of the litigant to ask for a reference and the power of the court to make one Therefore <ORG> has jurisdiction in a reference to decide questions of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> that is question of law raised and decided by the <ORG> or question of law raised before the <ORG> but not decided by it or question of law decided by <ORG> though not raised before it but not questions not raised or decided by the <ORG> even though it may arise from its findings The section does riot specifically impose such a restriction nor is it implied Equally it is not disputed by the appellant that apart from this proviso the amount in question could only be regarded as capital receipt not liable to be taxed Before the income tax authorities the respondents sought to avoid the application of this proviso on the ground that on representations made by them with reference to this very matter <ORG> had directed that for the purpose of Rule Schedule II of the Excess Profits Tax Act the amount payable as compensation both the initial advance as well as any further payment that may be made should be taken into account as though it had actually been received within thirty days of the date of the loss of the ship and that in consequence the amount should be deemed to have been received on April The respondent then filed an application before the <ORG> under of the Act requiring certain questions to be referred to the court and one of them was as follows Whether in view of the fact that the th proviso to section vii of the Indian Income tax Act did not apply to the assessment for the Assessment year and under the law in force as applicable to that assessment year the sum of Rs which accrued in the previous year relevant to that Assessment year was not taxable at all and the fact that having regard to the Assessee method of accounting the said sum should not be assessed in any other year the Assessment in respect of the said sum in the subsequent Assessment year was valid in law The reference came up for hearing before a Bench of <ORG> consisting of Chagla and <NAME> and then the respondents raised the contention that the proviso to vii under which the charge was made could not be taken into account in making the present assessment as the same had been introduced by the Income tax Amendment Act VIII of which came into force on May whereas the liability of the company to be taxed fell to be determined as on April when the Finance Act came into force The appellant raised a preliminary objection to this question being raised for the first time before the court on the ground that it did not arise out of <ORG> having been neither raised before it nor dealt with by it and that further it had not been referred to the court The main contention urged before us by the appellant is that it was not open to <ORG> in the present reference to go into the question as to the applicability of the proviso to vii as it was neither raised before the <ORG> nor considered by it and could not therefore be said to be a question arising out of the order of the <ORG> which alone could be referred for the decision of the court under The court had no jurisdiction it is argued to allow a question to be raised before it which could not be referred to it under the section The contention of the respondents is that all questions of law which arise on the findings given by the <ORG> in its order can properly be said to arise out of its order and that in making a reference under the <ORG> is not limited to those questions only which were raised before it and dealt with in its order nor even to those questions which were raised in the application for reference under It is further contended that in the present case the question as framed and refer red was wide enough to take in the contention as to the applicability of the proviso and that <ORG> was in consequence within its power in entertaining it and deciding the reference on it We may now refer to the provisions of law bearing on the question Section of the Act confers on the assessee and the Commissioner a right to apply to the <ORG> in the prescribed form to refer any question of law arising out of its order for the decision of <ORG> But if it considers that no question of law arises on its order and dismisses the application under then the assessee or the Commissioner as the case may be has a right to move the court under and if the court is not satisfied about the correctness of the decision of the <ORG> it can require it to state the case and refer it to its decision Under <ORG> is to decide the question of law raised in the case and send a copy of its judgment to the <ORG> and the latter is to pass appropriate orders for giving effect to it Section of the Act confers on <ORG> power to make rules for carrying out the purpose of the Act and under sub section the rules made thereunder shall on publication in the official gazette have effect as if enacted under the Act Rule A framed under this section provides that An application under sub section of section requiring the <ORG> to refer to <ORG> any question Of law shall be in the following form that the facts which are admitted and or found by the <ORG> and which are necessary for drawing up a statement of the case are stated in the enclosure for ready reference On these provisions the question that arises for decision is whether in a reference under <ORG> can consider a question which had not been raised before the <ORG> and or dealt with by it in its order even though it be one of law On the answer to be given to it there has been a difference of opinion among <ORG>s and that turns on the meaning to be given to the words any question of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> There is no pronouncement of this <ORG> which concludes this ques tion though there are decisions which afford guidance in the determination thereof The <ORG> was of the opinion that the order in question could be made in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction and referred the question of its legality to the court under <ORG> declined to answer it on the ground that as the order was not one passed in an appeal the reference under was incompetent as under that provision the power of the <ORG> to refer was limited to questions of law arising out of an order passed in an appeal This is an authority for the position that the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to make and of <ORG> to hear a reference must be strictly sought within the four corners of An objection was put forward to this contention being raised on the ground that it was not argued before the <ORG> or decided by it and that therefore it did not arise out of its order as required by But this Court hold that as the question as framed and referred was of sufficient amplitude to cover the new point urged and as no contention was raised that the question had not There was accordingly no decision on the point now under consideration This Court held that the scope of a reference under was coextensive with that of one under of the Act that therefore the court had no power under to travel beyond the ambit of that under both these provisions it is only a question of law arising out of the order that could be referred that the object of was to enable the court to obtain additional statements only for the purpose of deciding questions referred under and and that accordingly no investigation could be ordered in respect of new questions which were not and could not be the subject matter of a reference under and Here again there was no decision on the meaning of the words any question of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> In agreeing with this contention this Court observed Section of the Income tax Act which confers jurisdiction upon <ORG> only permits a reference of a question of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> This Court held following that decision that the jurisdiction to call for supplemental statement was confined a to the facts on record and or found by the <ORG> and to the question which would arise from the <ORG> order and that further it could be exercised with reference to a new question if it was an integral or even incidental part of the question which had been referred There being thus no direct decision of this <ORG> on the precise meaning of the words any question of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> we must examine the decision of the High <ORG>s on the question and as already stated they are in a state of conflict There discussing the question with reference to the language of and and Rule A the court observed as follows The provisions of Section and Section do not confer upon <ORG> a general jurisdiction to correct or to decide a question of law that may possibly arise out of the income tax assessment The section on the contrary confers a special and limited jurisdiction upon <ORG> to decide any specific question of law which I Rang The question having been brought up before the court under <NAME> held that under it was only a question that arose out of the <ORG> order that could be referred and that that must be some question which was actually raised before the <ORG> and dealt with by it and that under the words no question of law arises could only mean that the question of which reference had been asked for by the applicant did not arise and that <ORG> could not require the <ORG> to refer some question which was not proposed before it Therein Kapur as he then was held on an examination of the section and on a review of the authorities that under it is only questions which had been raised before and dealt with by the <ORG> that could be referred to <ORG> that the power of <ORG> under to direct a reference is limited to questions which could be referred under and which the applicant required it to refer that the <ORG> has no power to raise a question suo motu and likewise <ORG> cannot raise any question which had not been referred to it either under or but when once a question is properly raised and referred to <ORG> <ORG> is bound to answer that question We must now consider the decisions which have taken a somewhat different view again proceeds on the view that it is only a question raised before and dealt with by the <ORG> I Its advice must be confined to questions referred by the <ORG> to this court and those questions must be questions of law which must arise out of the order made by the <ORG> Now looking at the plain language of the section apart from any authority I should have stated that a question of law arose out of the order of the <ORG> if such a question was apparent on the order itself or it could be raised on the facts found by the I I see no reason to confine the jurisdiction of this court to such questions of law as have been argued before the <ORG> or are dealt with by the <ORG> The section does not say so and there is no reason why we should construe the expression arising out of such order in a manner unwarranted by the ordinary grammatical construction of that expression This court has no jurisdiction to decide ques tions which have not been referred by the <ORG> It is true that the court has jurisdiction to resettle questions of law so as to bring out the real issue between the parties but it is not open to the court to raise new questions which have not been referred to it by the <ORG> An assessee may raise a question and argue it before the <ORG> but if the <ORG> thought fit to ignore that argument and not to refer to that point of law in its order then the court would have no jurisdiction to call upon the <ORG> to refer that question of law to <ORG> It is true that the Income tax Act is a very technical statute but I see no reason why when the plain grammatical construction of the section does not make it necessary to come to that conclusion it is necessary to do so and arrive at such an anomalous result It will be seen from the foregoing review of the decisions that all <ORG>s are agreed that creates a special jurisdiction that the power of the <ORG> to make a reference and the right of the litigant to require it must be sought within the four corners of that the jurisdiction of <ORG> to hear references is limited to questions which are properly referred to it under and that such jurisdiction is purely advisory and extends only to deciding questions referred to it The narrow ground over which <ORG>s differ is as regards the question whether it is competent to the <ORG> to refer or <ORG> to decide a question of law which was not either raised before the <ORG> or decided by it where it arises on the facts found by it In support of this contention <NAME> learned Counsel for the respondents argued that it was a fundamental principle of jurisprudence that the duty of the litigants was only to state the facts and that it was for the court to apply the appropriate law to the facts found arid he relied on the observations of <NAME> in Attorney General <NAME> Co that the court was not limited to particular questions raised by the Commissioners in the form of questions on the case and that if the point of law or the erroneous nature of the determination of the point of law was apparent on the case as stated and there were no further facts to be found the court could give effect to it He also maintained that the position under the Indian law was the same as under the British statute because under of the Act the <ORG> has to refer not only questions of law arising out of its order but also a statement of the case that under the court can likewise require the <ORG> to state the case and refer it and that under the court has to decide the question of law raised by the case The British statute does not cast as does of the Act a duty on the assessee to put in an application stating the questions of law which he desires the Commissioners to refer to the court and requiring them to refer the questions which arise out of that order Arunachalam Chettiar this Court has decided that the requirements of are matters affecting the jurisdiction to make a reference under that section There is nothing in it which calls for a decision by the court The statement of the case is material only as furnishing the facts for the purpose of enabling the court to decide the question referred But the main contention still remains that the language of is wide enough to admit of questions of law which arise on the facts found by the <ORG> and that there is no justification for cutting There is considerable force in this argument But then there are certain features which distinguish the jurisdiction under and they have to be taken into consideration in ascertaining the true import of the words any question of law arising out of such order It acts purely in an advisory capacity on a reference which properly comes before it under and It gives the <ORG>s advice but ultimately it is for them to give effect to that advice If the true scope of the jurisdiction of <ORG> is to give advice when it is sought by the <ORG> it stands to reason that the <ORG> should have had an occasion to consider the question so that it may decide whether it should refer it for the decision of the court How can it be said that the <ORG> should seek for advice on a question which it was not called upon to consider and in respect of which it had no opportunity of deciding whether the decision of the court should be sought It was argued for the respondents that in view of the fact that the court could compel the <ORG> to refer a question of law under for its decision not much significance could be attached to the advisory character of its jurisdiction It is not conceivable it was said that any authority should have a right to compel another authority to take its advice We see no force in this contention <NAME> confers on the court a power to direct a reference only where the <ORG> was under a duty to refer under and it is therefore subject to the same limitations as Moreover the power of the court to issue direction to the <ORG> under is as has often been pointed out in the nature of a mandamus and it is well settled that no mandamus will be issued unless the applicant had made a distinct demand on the appropriate authorities for the very reliefs which he seeks to enforce by mandamus and that had been refused Thus the power of the court to direct a reference under is subject to two limitations the question must be one which the <ORG> was bound to refer under and the applicant must have required the <ORG> to refer it Now if we are to hold that the court can allow a new question to be raised on the reference that would in effect give the applicant a right which is denied to him under and and enlarge the jurisdiction of the court so as to assimilate it to that of an ordinary civil court of appeal It is again to be noted that whereas as it stood prior to the amendment of conferred on the Commissioner a power to refer a question of law to the court suo motu that power has been taken away under the present section and it has accordingly been held that under as it now stands there is no power in the <ORG> to refer a question of law suo motu for the decision of the court The correct view to take in our opinion is that the right of the litigant to ask for a reference the power of the <ORG> to make one and the jurisdiction of the court to decide it are all co extensive and therefore a question of law which the applicant cannot require the <ORG> to refer and one which the <ORG> is not competent to refer to the court cannot be entertained by the court under In such a case it was said the applicant would be deprived for no fault of his of a valuable right which the legislature had intended to give him There was also some argument as to the position under when the <ORG> decides an appeal on a question of law not raised before it But the appellant contends that while before the income tax authorities the respondents disputed their liability on the ground that the amount in question had been received in the year previous to the year of account the contention urged by them before the court was that even on the footing that the income had been received in the year of account the proviso to vii had no application and that it was a new question which they were not entitled to raise We do not agree with this contention Now a question of law might be a simple one having its impact at one point or it may be a complex one trenching over an area with approaches leading to different points therein All that requires is that the question of law which is referred to the court for decision and which the court is to decide must be the question which was in issue before the <ORG> Where the question itself was under issue there is no further limitation imposed by the section that the reference should be limited to those aspects of the question which had been argued before the <ORG> It is argued for the appellant that this view would have the effect of doing away with limitations which the legislature has advisedly imposed on the right of a litigant to require references under as the question might be framed in such general manner as to admit of new questions not argued being raised He sought to contend that the proviso though it came into force on May was really intended to operate from April and he referred us to certain other enactments as supporting that inference In the result this appeal is dismissed with costs SHAH The Income tax Appellate Tribunal Bombay Bench A referred the following question to <ORG> at Bombay under of the Indian Income tax Act Whether the sum of Rs It was not in force on April the day on which the liability to pay tax for the year of assessment crystallized This would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal but counsel for the revenue submits that as it was never urged before the tribunal by the assessees that the amending Act of which made the compensation received by the assessees taxable as income was brought into operation after the commencement of the year of assessment and the tribunal never directed its attention to that plea it had no jurisdiction to refer that question to <ORG> arid <ORG> was not competent to answer that question even if on the facts found the question clearly arose out of the order of the tribunal We have heard elaborate arguments on the true meaning of the expression any question of law arising out of such order and the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by <ORG> under of the Income tax Act There is wide divergence of opinion oil the true import of this clause <NAME> Within sixty days of the date upon which he is served with notice of an order under sub of the assessee or the Commissioner may by application in the prescribed form require <ORG> to refer to <ORG> any question of law arising out of such order and <ORG> shall draw up a statement of the case and refer it to <ORG> Provided If on any application being made under sub <ORG> refuses to state a case on the ground that no question of law arises the assessee or the Commissioner as the case may be may apply to <ORG> and <ORG> may if it is not satisfied of the correctness of the decision of <ORG> require <ORG> to state a case and to refer it and on receipt of any such requisition <ORG> shall state the ease and refer it accordingly decision is founded and shall send a copy of such judgment to <ORG> which shall pass such orders as are necessary to dispose of the case conformably to such Judgment If the tribunal is not called upon to refer a question <ORG> cannot arrogate to itself the power to call upon the tribunal to refer questions which arise out of the findings recorded by the tribunal but which the tribunal was not called upon to refer But there is in my judgment no warrant for the view that the question which the tribunal may refer or which <ORG> on the refusal of the tribunal may call upon the tribunal to refer must be a question which was raised and argued before the tribunal at the hearing under It may very well happen and frequently cases arise in which the question of law arises for the first time out of the order of the tribunal The tribunal may wrongly apply the law may call in aid a statutory provision which has no application may even misconceive the question to be decided or ignore a statutory provision which expressly applies to the facts found It is the duty of the tribunal to draw up a statement of the case and to frame questions that duty can only be performed adequately if specific questions relating directly to the dispute between the parties are raised If the import of the question is unduly large <ORG> has and is indeed bound in dealing with it to restrict it to its true content in the light of the findings recorded by the tribunal The court has jurisdiction to decide questions which arise out of the order of the tribunal not merely those which were raised and argued before the tribunal I see no reason to confine the jurisdiction of this <ORG> to such questions of law as have been argued before the <ORG> or are dealt with by the <ORG> he section does not say so and there is no reason why we should construe the expression arising out of such order in a manner unwarranted by the I
