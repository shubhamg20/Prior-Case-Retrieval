In on an application to execute that decree possession was delivered to these respondents On that application an order to amend was made by the lower <ORG> in but that order was set aside on appeal to this <ORG> in on the ground that the decree in question being a decree by this <ORG> this <ORG> was the only <ORG> which could amend it On the th of May the application to execute the decree out of which this appeal has arisen was filed The Subordinate Judge made an order for the execution of the decree It has been contended here on behalf of the appellant the judgment debtor that Article of Schedule II of the Indian Limitation Act applies and that even if the proceedings taken by these respondents on and prior to the th of March might be regarded as applications to take steps in aid of the execution of the decree yet that this application is time barred as not having been made within three years of the th of March It was also contended on behalf of the appellant that an application to amend a decree is not an application to take a step in aid of the execution of the decree and that although the decree was amended as late as the th of May the date of the decree mentioned in Article is the date which the Code of Civil Procedure enacts shall be the date of the decree namely the date of the judgment which is that of the original judgment where there has been no review of judgment On the one hand we have Article which is the only article which apparently expressly relates to the period of limitation for applications for execution of decrees On the other hand there are undoubtedly cases of applications to execute decrees to which Article could not possibly apply It appears to us that the first paragraph of the third column of Article must necessarily apply only where there is a decree or order which can at its date be executed In our opinion so long as there was at the date of the decree a decree capable of execution the first paragraph of the third column of Article would apply That decision is binding on us and for present purposes we must assume that the decree passed in appeal in affirming the decree of the lower <ORG> of was by reason of an infirmity in drawing it up incapable of execution Consequently it appears to us that until the th of May there was no decree in the suit between these parties which was capable of being executed Article applies not only to an application to execute an original decree but it applies where there has been an appeal from that decree and it applies also to a case in which there has been a review of judgment after decree There is no provision in Article to meet a case in which at the date of the decree the decree through the fault of a <ORG> or the fault of an office in drawing it up or passing it is incapable of execution Under Article the respondents application now under consideration is within time for it was made although on the last day of limitation within three years from the time when the right to apply to execute the decree accrued on the amendment of the decree We dismiss this appeal with costs
