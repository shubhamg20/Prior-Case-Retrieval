The only question raised in this second appeal is whether a female heir is disqualified from succeeding to the office of archaka and receiving the emoluments attached to the office in cases where such office is hereditary in her family runs counter to ideas which have been commonly accepted by parties concerned and given effect to by <ORG> for many years and we think that the present case is one where <ORG> should apply the doctrine of stare decisis and not declare to be illegal a practice which has been followed for many years with so far as we are aware no serious evil consequences and which has been the foundation of many titles The hereditary right to succeed to a religious office is itself the creature of custom and the fact that females have been allowed without question to enjoy the emoluments of the office and to get the duties performed by proxy and that <ORG> have for a series of years given effect to such right justifies us in holding that female succession is not excluded Justices <NAME> and <NAME> held that there was no basis for the assumption that females are as such disqualified from succeeding to a religious office attached to a temple and that the onus would be on the dhamakartas to prove any such disqualification services in temples are often performed by proxies They were dealing with a case where the service to be performed was the reciting of Vedas in a temple and we can see little difference between such a service and the service performed by archakas which was a case relating to an office in the Kalighat temple similar to that of archakas in this Presidency Justice <NAME> after an elaborate review of several authorities was of opinion that the custom whereby females not only succeeded to the office but also alienated the same was not invalid as opposed to public policy It is unnecessary for us in the present case to decide how far the right of alienation extends though there is authority for holding that a female heir can alienate the office to one next in succession So far as the authorities go we do not think that there is any ground for refusing to recognise the custom of female succession to hereditary religious offices on the ground of such a custom being opposed either to the express text of Hindu Law or to public policy The respondents will pay appellants costs in this Court and the costs will abide and follow the result
