<ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> had also offered to collaborate with <ORG> for the purpose of improving the quality and yield of <ORG> and to achieve the full installed capacity Soon thereafter these three appellants filed writ petitions in <ORG> questioning the validity of the said MoU It is submitted that <ORG> being a government owned corporation is an authority within the meaning of Article and that it was bound to consider all the offers received in a fair and impartial manner giving an equal opportunity to all competitors to give their bids and select the most suitable among them With the liberalization policy there was an apprehension of import of <ORG> being placed on the Open General Licence in which case the <ORG> would have been driven out of market because the cost of <ORG> produced by it is double the price of imported <ORG> A tieup with such market leader is bound to prove beneficial to <ORG> Over the last several years several Indian companies including the <ORG> have been trying to obtain technology from <ORG> but they failed It is stated further by the respondents that while <ORG> offered the technology of <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> offered the technology of <ORG> of Slovakia Because of their inferior technology they will not be in a position to compete with the proposed <ORG> and this is the real reason why they are out to scuttle the MoU between <ORG> and <ORG> In particular it is stated that in the case of <ORG> it did not even disclose the name of its foreign collaborator in the first instance and only much later did it indicate that its foreign collaborator was <ORG> of Slovakia Before we deal with the contentions urged by the appellants it would be appropriate to examine the relevant facts and to note how the offers of the appellants and the offer of were dealt with and processed by <ORG> He explained the salient features of the draft <ORG> proposed to be entered into with <ORG> He stated that the technology to be obtained from <ORG> would be the best in the world and that it is a lifetime opportunity for <ORG> to get this technology At its meeting held on th March the <ORG> was informed that <ORG> and <ORG> whose proposals were rejected by the <ORG> have represented to <ORG> that they should be given a further opportunity of explaining their proposals whereupon the Government has directed the <ORG> to give a further opportunity to the said two companies The <ORG><ORG> Committee stated <ORG> As a result of the evaluation of the <ORG> production efficiencies <ORG> is firmly of the view that there is tremendous scope for improvements and higher level of efficiency and cost reduction in the pencillin production operations of <ORG> even with the existing technology<ORG> It came as a surprise to the <ORG> that <ORG> which is the largest pencillin producer in the country what to talk of comparing internationally does not compare favourable with <ORG> pencillin production operation insofar as raw material land utility costs are concerned<ORG> A draft on latest cost price study report for the year on pencillin first crystals production as prepared by <ORG> a copy of which could be had by st April contain the actuals for the ye <ORG> In respect of raw materials costs per capital of pencilling production <ORG> has been Rs<ORG> which is Rs<ORG> higher than Rs<ORG> spent by <ORG><ORG> For the utilities <ORG> spends Rs<ORG> which is Rs<ORG> higher Om Rs<ORG> spent by the <ORG><ORG> Even if <ORG> cost of raw materials and utilities in the short term cannot be brought to the level of <ORG> in the year when the production of <ORG> is expected to be II MMU it should be possible for <ORG> to attain improvements and cost reduction to achieve profit of Rs<ORG> per Bu as examined above which should give the profit of Rs<ORG> <ORG> crores at current sale price for <ORG><ORG>G first crystal at a production level of II MMU for <ORG><ORG> <NAME> is stated to have opined that the best technology for <ORG> in the world was with <ORG> and that it was in the interest of <ORG> as well as in the interest of the country to acquire that technology The directive is container in the letter dated June addressed to <NAME> Managing Director <ORG> It directs <ORG> to enter into a MoU at the ear<NAME>st with the <ORG> for establishing a <ORG> The letter reads as follows Sir I am directed to refer to your letter No MD IV IO dated the rd May At this meeting the Managing Director brought to the notice of the <ORG> the letter written by him to the Secretary <ORG> It would be noticed that there is no reference to <ORG> in any of the Board Resolutions or in the Sub Committee report <ORG> says that it addressed a letter on April to <ORG> expressing their interest in upgrading the technology of <ORG> and in improving the production by investing Rs crores It is stated that their offer was rejected by <ORG> on May and that thereafter its representatives met the Minister of <ORG> on June and represented their case Finally when <ORG> decided on April that the lease amount payable by the proposed <ORG> to be formed by <ORG> and <ORG> with share holding each should not be less than Rs crores per annum and instructed him accordingly Sri <NAME> wrote a letter directly to the Secretary to <ORG> <ORG> setting out in detail why the <ORG> resolution was not appropriate and why it is not realistic to accept lease amount at that level In other words there was unfortunately not much of a choice There is yet another fact Next question is whether there was no fair consideration of the offers made by the appellants Secondly its technology was as yet unproven at commercial production level which meant that there was an element of risk involved in adopting that <ORG> technology Above all the <ORG> of Directors of <ORG> were satisfied that the technology of <NAME> was no superior to the one being employed by <ORG> <NAME> of Slovakia is also not one of the world seven leading manufacturers of <ORG> and therefore the <ORG> thought that there was no point in pursuing the proposals of <ORG> It cannot be said that it was not a fair decision nor can it be insisted that before rejecting the proposals of <ORG> and <ORG> the <ORG> of Directors ought to have obtained technical opinion or the opinion of an expert committee in the cir<ORG> cumstances and that is why it gave the directive to him to enter into a MoU with <ORG> at the earliest for establishing the proposed joint venture It should be remembered that <ORG> of <ORG> had also decided to have a technological collaboration with <ORG> It would have been a different matter if <ORG> had agreed with the recommendation of the <ORG><ORG>Com<ORG> mittee that there is tremendous scope of improving and achieving higher level of efficiency and cost reduction in the operations of <ORG> itself with the existing tech<ORG> nology and without obtaining any foreign technology and that the <ORG> should first try that course In reply to this it is pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondents that Sri <NAME> did write to <ORG> on May as directed by the <ORG> but that the <ORG> did not agree to the figure stipulated by the <ORG> vide <ORG> letter dated May and that both these letters were placed before the <ORG> Not only giving of directive was an internal matter between <ORG> and <ORG> there was no point in giving notice to <ORG> and <ORG> whose offers were already rejected by the <ORG> once and again after re evaluation directed by the <ORG>
