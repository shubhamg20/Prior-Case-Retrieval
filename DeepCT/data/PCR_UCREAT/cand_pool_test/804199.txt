<ORG> the <ORG> by its order dated answered the question in the affirmative and held that the transfers were made in anticipation of and with a view to avoiding or defeating the objects of the Act The Land Reforms Appellate <ORG> the Appellate <ORG> however by its order dated reversed the findings of the <ORG> and held as under Therefore in these cases we hold that the declarant had given a reasonable explanation for the sale of the lands and there was no intention to avoid the provisions of the Land Ceiling Act Accordingly we hold on point that all the sales effected by the appellant his wife and his son are true genuine and supported by consideration and they were effected for the expansion of their industry and actually the amounts were invested for such expansion of the sugar factory and it cannot be said that they were intended to defeat or avoid the provisions of the Land Ceiling Act Where on or after th January but before the notified date any person has transferred whether by way of sale gift usufructuary mortgage exchange settlement surrender or in any other manner whatsoever any land held by him or created a trust of any land held by him then the burden of proving that such transfer or creation of trust has not been effected in anticipation of and with a view to avoiding or defeating the objects of any law relating to a reduction in the ceiling on agricultural holdings shall be on such person and where he has not so proved such transfer or creation of trust shall be disregarded for the purpose of the computation of the ceiling area of such person An application for revision from any party aggrieved including the <ORG> shall lie to <ORG> within the prescribed period from any order passed on appeal by <ORG> on any of the following grounds namely a that it exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law or that it failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested or that it acted in the exercise of its jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity Section of the Act provides that any transfer of land made during the period from to which was made in anticipation of and with a view to avoiding or defeating the objects of any law relating to reduction in the ceiling of agricultural holdings shall be disregarded for the purpose of the computation of the ceiling area under the Act The <ORG> on appreciation of the evidence before it and taking into consideration the relevant material on the record came to the following conclusions That the recitals in the sale deeds did not mention that the purpose for the sale of lands was to invest the proceeds in the expansion of sugar industry rather it was mentioned that the lands were not convenient for personal cultivation and reasonable price was offered by the purchasers That in respect of all the sales only initial payments were accepted and pronotes were got executed in favour of the respondents for the major portion of the sale amounts That the purchasers were employees or relatives of the respondents That the lands were sold at the rate of Rs to Rs which according to the Tribunal was not the market price of the lanka lands That more than acres of lands were transferred on five different dates during the period from to and That the disposal of large chunks of lands in December goes to show that the same might not have been sold but for the impending legislation on the land ceiling They have been selling the lands to raise funds for setting up of industries and the transfers in dispute were effected to raise money to meet the expenses for the expansion of the sugar industry Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the respondents has vehemently contended that there is no justification whatsoever in reversing the finding of <ORG> to the effect that the sales in dispute were made to meet the expenses to be incurred for the expansion of sugar industry Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the State of Andhra Pradesh on the other hand contended that the proposal for the expansion of the sugar industry was mooted sometime in June but it was two years thereafter in April that the application for licence to expand the industry was made and the licence in fact was granted on According to the learned counsel in December when the lands were sold there was no question of spending any money on expansion of the industry because even the application for licence was made on and the licence was granted as late as It was forcefully contended by Mr <NAME> that the only urgency to sell the land in December was to defeat the provisions of the Act which was on its way and came to be enforced on There is plausibility in the argument of Mr <NAME> but we proceed on the assumption that the sales in dispute were made with a view to meet the expenses to be incurred on the proposed expansion of the sugar industry The burden of proving that a case falls within clause of the proviso shall rest with the party claiming its benefit Under the Act where it is proved to the satisfaction of the prescribed authority that the transfer of land in a given case is in good faith and satisfies other conditions laid down in clause of the proviso to sub section of Section the transfer is valid and cannot be ignored while determining the ceiling area of the landowner We are of the view that Section of the Act not only requires the transfer to be valid and genuine but also makes it obligatory for the transferor to prove that there was some compelling reason to sell the land at that point of time It was not the SCC SCR Supp SCC AIR SC Supp SCC para AIR SC case of the appellant that there was any pressure on the estate for the discharge of debts or that the alienations were in fact made for discharge of or meeting any binding debts or for meeting the marriage or educational expenses of any member of the family In the present case the respondents might be wanting to raise money for the expansion of the sugar industry but there is nothing on the record to show as to why they chose December when the Act was in the legislative process to sell more than acres of land They applied for the licence sometime in and the licence was in fact granted to them in November There was no question of making any expansion till the time the licence was granted The only logical conclusion which can be drawn is that they sold huge chunks of lands in December in anticipation of and with a view to avoid and defeat the provisions of the Act which came into force on The respondents shall pay the cost of the proceedings which we quantify at Rs
