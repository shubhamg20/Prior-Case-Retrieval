But it is settled that establishing and administering of an educational institution for imparting knowledge to the students is an occupation protected by Article and additionally by Article a if there is no element of profit generation Until <ORG> there were four oft quoted leading cases holding the field of education All these cases amongst others came up for the consideration of this Court in <ORG> What is meant by the expression religion in Article Can the followers of a sect or denomination of a particular religion claim protection under Article on the basis that they constitute a minority in the State even though the followers of that religion are in majority in that State A This question need not be answered by this Bench it will be dealt with by a regular Bench It has to be left to authorities to prescribe a reasonable percentage having regard to the type of institution population and educational needs of minorities except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right and the scheme framed thereunder require reconsideration modification and if yes what A The scheme framed by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and the direction to impose the same except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right is unconstitutional The right to establish and administer educational institutions is guaranteed under the Constitution to all citizens under Articles and and to minorities specifically under Article All citizens have a right to establish and administer educational institutions under Articles and but this right is subject to the provisions of Articles and a Questions such as i what is religion ii what is the indicia for determining if an educational institution is a minority institution iii whether a minority institution can operate extra territorially extending its activities into such states where the minority establishing and administering the institution does not enjoy minority status iv the content and contour of minority by reference to territories were not answered in <ORG> and were left to be determined by the regular Benches in individual cases to be heard after the decision in <ORG> The parties agreed that there were certain anomalies and doubts calling for clarification The relevant factors which would go into determining the reasonability of a fee structure in the opinion of majority are i the infrastructure and facilities available ii the investments made iii salaries paid to the teachers and staff iv future plans for expansion and betterment of the institution etc The majority opinion called it a special right given under Article It is clear that as between minority and non minority educational institutions the distinction made by Article in the fundamental rights conferred by Article has been termed by the majority as special right while in the opinion of <NAME> it is not a right but an additional protection At some places observations have been made regarding institutions divided into groups only by reference to aid that is whether they are aided or unaided educational institutions without regard to the fact whether they were minority or non minority institutions He also agreed that one single standard for all the institutions was necessary to achieve the object of selection being made on merit by maintaining uniformity of standard which could not be left to any individual institution in the matter of professional courses of study Before we part with the task of summing up the answers given to the four questions in <ORG> we would like to make a few observations of ours in this regard We would therefore hasten to add that in order to fully appreciate the ratio of the two opinions they have to be read in detail and our attempt at finding out and placing in a few chosen words the ratio decidendi of the two separately recorded opinions is subject to this limitation However we shall make a reference to relevant passages from the two opinions as and when it becomes necessary III Issues herein A Few Preliminary observations Before we embark upon dealing with the issues posed before us for resolution we would like to make a few preliminary observations as a preface to our judgment inasmuch as that would outline the scope of the controversy with which we are actually dealing here At the very outset we may state that our task is not to pronounce our own independent opinion on the several issues which arose for consideration in <ORG> we direct that in order to give effect to the judgment in <NAME> case the respective State Governments concerned authority shall set up in each State a committee headed by a retired <ORG> Judge who shall be nominated by the Chief Justice of that State The <ORG> shall have powers to oversee the tests to be conducted by the association The <ORG> shall have the powers to permit an institution which has been established and which has been permitted to adopt its own admission procedure for the last at least years to adopt its own admission procedure and if the <ORG> feels that the needs of such an institute are genuine to admit students of their community in excess of the quota allotted to them by <ORG> It is also clarified that no institute which has not been established and which has not followed its own admission procedure for the last at least years shall be permitted to apply for or be granted exemption from admitting students in the manner set out hereinabove Nevertheless he made a reference to these <ORG> in his opinion and thus impliedly recorded his concurrence with the constitution of these <ORG> The issues arising for decision before us are only three i the fixation of quota of admissions students in respect of unaided professional institutions ii the holding of examinations for admissions to such colleges that is who will hold the entrance tests and iii the fee structure The questions spelled out by Orders of Reference In the light of the two orders of reference referred to hereinabove we propose to confine our discussion to the questions set out hereunder which according to us arise for decision To what extent the <ORG> can regulate the admissions made by unaided minority or non minority educational institutions Can the <ORG> enforce its policy of reservation and or appropriate to itself any quota in admissions to such institutions Whether unaided minority and non minority educational institutions are free to devise their own admission procedure or whether direction made in <ORG> for compulsorily holding entrance test by the <ORG> or association of institutions and to choose therefrom the students entitled to admission in such institutions can be sustained in light of the law laid down in <ORG> Whether <ORG> could have issued guidelines in the matter of regulating the fee payable by the students to the educational institutions Can the admission procedure and fee structure be regulated or taken over by the Committees ordered to be constituted by <ORG> The issues posed before us are referable to headings and out of five headings formulated by <NAME> CJ in <ORG> So also speaking by reference to the questions framed in <ORG> the questions and answers relevant for us would be referable to question Nos a and We propose to place on record as briefly as we can the principal submissions made confined to the issues arising for decision before us It is argued that in the judgment of the eleven judges in <ORG> which deals with several diverse issues of considerable complexity every observation has to be understood in its context Such restriction is virtual negation of the constitutional protection of autonomy to minorities in running educational institutions of their choice as provided in Article of the Constitution Article permits <ORG> to make regulations and place reasonable restrictions in public interest upon the rights enjoyed by citizens under Article of the Constitution Reference is made to paragraph of the judgment in <ORG> It is submitted that the <ORG> can prescribe minimum qualifications and may prescribe systems of computing equivalence in ascertaining merit however the right of rational selection which would necessarily involve the right to decide upon the method by which a particular institution computes such equivalence is protected by Article and infringement of this right constitutes an unreasonable encroachment upon the constitutionally guaranteed autonomy of such institutions It is further argued that where <ORG> take over the right of the institution to grant admission and or to fix the fees it constitutes nationalization of educational institutions Such nationalization of education is an unreasonable restriction on the right conferred under Article Reliance is placed on paragraph of the judgment in <ORG> Reference is made to paragraph of the judgment in <ORG> It is submitted that the directions to set up committees for regulation of admission and fee structure in <ORG> virtually do the same exercise as was done in <NAME> and disapproved in the larger Bench decision in <ORG> This has been the constitutional interpretation of Article not because Article admits no exception like Article but because the right conferred under Article does not extend to these areas So far as unaided minority educational institutions are concerned the submission made is that government has no right or power much less duty to decide as to which method of selection of students is to be adopted by minority institutions No doubt the <ORG> is under a duty to prevent mal administration that is to control charging of capitation fees for the seats regardless of merit and commercializing education resulting in exploitation of students but to prevent mal administration of the above nature or on the ground that there is likelihood of such mal administration the <ORG> cannot take over the administration of the institutions themselves into its own hands Learned senior counsel <NAME> appearing on behalf of unaided <ORG> through its <ORG> of both categories of minority and non minority has questioned the correctness of the directions in the case of <ORG> for setting up permanent committees for fixation of quota and determination of fees In the case of <ORG> the ratio of <ORG> that autonomy of unaided non minority institutions is an important facet of their right under Article and in case of minority under Article read with Article of the Constitution has been ignored The learned counsel raised very serious objections to the manner in which the various permanent committees set up in several States on the directions of <ORG> are conducting themselves and forcing their decisions on private institutions It is submitted that autonomy of a private educational institution could mean that they can according to the objects and purposes of their institutions give preference to a particular class or group of students like <ORG> in <ORG> students from backward area in Bijapur college and transport employees children in Madras <ORG> Corporation Employees College or the children of employees of <ORG> in a college established by that company Learned senior counsel <NAME> also supported the submissions made by other counsel on behalf of the unaided professional institutions and added that the observations of the <ORG> in <ORG> clearly go far beyond anything said by eleven judges in <ORG> It is submitted that as a part of autonomy of the private unaided institution the quantum of fees to be charged must be left to the institution and except for checking profiteering and capitation fees the <ORG> can have no say in fixation of fees It is submitted that it is only the essence of the reason or principle upon which the question before a court has been decided which is alone binding as a precedent It is submitted that restrictions imposed should satisfy the requirements of Article and not only of Article Counsel Dr <NAME> is that there is nothing in <ORG> which permits fixation of quotas for government seats fixation of fee structure by the <ORG> imposition of its reservation policy and imposition of candidates on the basis of common entrance test conducted by the <ORG> In <ORG> the <ORG> can have some controlling influence on unaided institutions for the purpose of ensuring transparency in admissions and checking the collection of capitation fee Apart from supporting the contention advanced by other counsel against the scheme of committees evolved in <ORG> learned counsel submitted that the judgment of <ORG> against which they have filed an appeal before this court has resulted in a situation where affluent students are getting admission at lesser fee and poorer students are kept out of college Objecting to the fee structure prescribed by the committees in Maharashtra the suggestion made on behalf of the institute is as under a students will be charged five times of the average fee which was in vogue before <ORG> judgment It is on the line suggested by this court that <ORG> had made regulations both for the purpose of admissions as well as for fixing reasonable fee which will cover not only the expenditure incurred by the institution but also give them a reasonable revenue surplus for further growth and betterment of the institution Similarly the court has struck down Regulation framed by the <ORG> on the ground that the <ORG> cannot foist fee of students on the institution and it would be left to the management to make provisions for poorer sections of the society through free ships or scholarships It is submitted that if there are certain inherent inconsistencies between various paragraphs particularly and of the judgment in <ORG> they have to be resolved and that was exactly what was done by the five judges in <ORG> For the first time in <ORG> the court held that running an educational institution is an occupation and Article guarantees it as a fundamental right So far as the right to fix a fee structure for unaided minority or non minority colleges or institutes is concerned the argument that pre fixation of fee is a serious encroachment on the rights of minority and non minority it is submitted is not valid as full discretion is given to the management in fixing their fee structure A practical approach to the problem would require a very definite percentage to be fixed for minority institutions say so that even if candidates of their choice belonging to the minority institutions are only they would still have the right to select non minority students to make up the of course from the <ORG> held by the <ORG> Rights of minorities cannot be placed higher than the general welfare of the students and their right to take up professional education on the basis of their merit So far as the regulation of fee structure is concerned it is submitted that in paragraph in <ORG> there is a mention of appropriate machinery to be devised by the <ORG> or University to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and profiteering is checked Arguments were also advanced supporting the directions in <ORG> by learned senior counsel <NAME> appearing for the <ORG> of Tamil Nadu A few concepts There are a few concepts which should be very clear in our minds at the very outset as these are the concepts which flow as undercurrents in the sea of issues surfacing for resolution in all educational cases These concepts are referable to i What is education ii What is the inter relationship of Articles and of the Constitution iii In the context of minority educational institutions what difference does it make if they are aided or unaided or if they seek recognition or affiliation or do not do so iv Would it make any difference if the instructions imparted in such educational institutions relate to professional or non professional courses of study Education Education according to Chambers Dictionary is bringing up or training strengthening of the powers of body or mind culture ibid <NAME> <NAME> has well put it in his opinion in <ORG> para Education plays a cardinal role in transforming a society into a civilised nation Dr <NAME> sought to ensure that the seeds of knowledge were germinated in the minds of as many citizens as possible with a view to enabling them to perform their assigned roles on the stage of democracy Articles and inter relationship between The right to establish an educational institution for charity or for profit being an occupation is protected by Article Notwithstanding the fact that the right of a minority to establish and administer an educational institution would be protected by Article yet the Founding Fathers of the Constitution felt the need of enacting Article But for Article an educational institution even though based on religion or language could have been controlled or regulated by law enacted under Clause of Article and so Article was enacted as a guarantee to the minorities that so far as the religious or linguistic minorities are concerned educational institutions of their choice will enjoy protection from such legislation However merely because Article has been enacted minority educational institutions do not become immune from the operation of regulatory measure because the right to administer does not include the right to mal administer Such a right is generally speaking subject to laws imposing reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public In particular laws may be enacted on the following subjects i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practicing any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business ii the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise The principle would remain the same whether it is a <ORG> legislation or a <ORG> legislation dealing with linguistic or religious minority Whether a minority educational institution though established by a minority can cater to the needs of that minority only Can there be an enquiry to identify the person or persons who have really established the institution Can a minority institution provide cross border or inter State educational facilities and yet retain the character of minority educational institution In Kerala Education Bill the scope and ambit of right conferred by Article came up for consideration The management bodies of such institutions cannot resort to the device of admitting the linguistic students of the adjoining <ORG> in which they are in a majority under the fagade of the protection given under Article It necessarily follows from the law laid down in <ORG> that to establish a minority institution the institution must primarily cater to the requirements of that minority of that <ORG> else its character of minority institution is lost This Court clarified in Kerala Educational Bill that the right to establish and administer educational institutions conferred by Article does not include the right to mal administer and that is very obvious Merely because an educational institution belongs to minority it cannot ask for aid or recognition though running in unhealthy surroundings without any competent teachers and which does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which teaches matters subversive to the welfare of the scholars The dividing line is that in the name of laying down conditions for aid or recognition the <ORG> cannot directly or indirectly defeat the very protection conferred by Article on the minority to establish and administer educational institutions Dealing with the third category of institutions which seek only recognition but not aid their Lordships held that the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice must mean the right to establish real institutions which will effectively serve the needs of the community and scholars who resort to these educational institutions It is not necessary for us to go deep into this aspect of the issue posed before us inasmuch as <ORG> has clarified that merit and excellence assume special significance in the context of professional studies Regulatory measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof are no anathema to the protection conferred by Article The source of this distinction between two types of educational institutions referred to hereinabove is to be found in the principle that right to administer does not include a right to mal administer It must be borne in mind that unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration while at the same time they do not forego or discard the principle of merit This will incidentally take care of poorer and backward sections of the society In such professional unaided institutions the management will have the right to select teachers as per the qualifications and eligibility conditions laid down by the <ORG> university subject to adoption of a rational procedure of selection It has been held that conditions of affiliation or recognition which pertain to the academic and educational character of the institution and ensure uniformity efficiency and excellence in educational courses are valid and that they do not violate even the provisions of Article of the Constitution but conditions that are laid down for granting recognition should not be such as may lead to governmental control of the administration of the private educational institutions However we have reproduced para by dividing it into two parts We cull out and state what <ORG> has to say about such category of institutions i Minority educational institution unaided and unrecognized <ORG> is unanimous on the view that the right to establish and administer an institution the phrase as employed in Article of the Constitution comprises of the following rights a to admit students to set up a reasonable fee structure to constitute a governing body to appoint staff teaching and non teaching and to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any of the employees Obviously such institutions would fall in the category of those who would exercise their right under the protection and privilege conferred by Article to their hearts content unhampered by any restrictions excepting those which are in national interest based on considerations such as public safety national security and national integrity or are aimed at preventing exploitation of students or teaching community para <ORG> Apart from the generalized position of law that right to administer does not include right to mal administer an additional source of power to regulate by enacting condition accompanying affiliation or recognition exists We find great force in the submission made on behalf of the petitioners that the <ORG>s have no power to insist on seat sharing in the unaided private professional educational institutions by fixing a quota of seats between the management and the <ORG> As per our understanding neither in the judgment of <ORG> nor in the <ORG> decision in <ORG> which was approved by <ORG> there is anything which would allow the <ORG> to regulate or control admissions in the unaided professional educational institutions so as to compel them to give up a share of the available seats to the candidates chosen by the <ORG> as if it was filling the seats available to be filled up at its discretion in such private institutions But if the observations made and the conclusions derived are read as a whole the judgment nowhere lays down that unaided private educational institutions of minorities and non minorities can be forced to submit to seat sharing and reservation policy of the <ORG> There are also observations saying that they may frame their own policy to give free ships and scholarships to the needy and poor students or adopt a policy in line with the reservation policy of the state to cater to the educational needs of weaker and poorer sections of the society There is nothing wrong in an entrance test being held for one group of institutions imparting same or similar education The <ORG> can also provide a procedure of holding a common entrance test in the interest of securing fair and merit based admissions and preventing mal administration Vide para Chief Justice <NAME> has clearly ruled that the decision in <NAME> insofar as it framed the scheme relating to the grant of admission and the fixing of the fee was not correct and to that extent the said decision and the consequent directions given to <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> the <ORG> and <ORG> etc Vide para <ORG> upheld <NAME> to the extent to which it holds the right to primary education as a fundamental right but the scheme was overruled Legal provisions made by <ORG> or the scheme evolved by the <ORG> for monitoring admission procedure and fee fixation do not violate the right of minorities under Article or the right of minorities and non minorities under Article The suggestion made on behalf of minorities and non minorities that the same purpose for which <ORG> have been set up can be achieved by post audit or checks after the institutions have adopted their own admission procedure and fee structure is unacceptable for the reasons shown by experience of the educational authorities of various States In our considered view on the basis of judgment in <ORG> and various previous judgments of this <ORG> which have been taken into consideration in that case the scheme evolved of setting up the two Committees for regulating admissions and determining fee structure by the judgment in <ORG> cannot be faulted either on the ground of alleged infringement of Article in case of unaided professional educational institutions of both categories and Article read with Article in case of unaided professional institutions of minorities The learned counsel appearing for the petitioners have severely criticised the functioning of some of the <ORG> so constituted Epilogue We have answered the four questions formulated by us in the manner indicated hereinabove There are several questions which have remained unanswered and there are certain questions which have propped up post <ORG> and <ORG> Issues referable to those areas which are already covered by <ORG> and yet open to question shall have to be answered by a Bench of a larger coram than <ORG> This judgment shall not have the effect of disturbing the admissions already made or with regard to which the process has already commenced The law as laid down in this judgment shall be given effect to from the academic year commencing next after the pronouncement of this judgment Before parting we would like to place on record our appreciation of the valuable assistance rendered by all the learned senior counsel and other counsel appearing in the case and who have addressed us highlighting very many aspects of the ticklish issues in the field of professional education which have propped up for decision in the light of the <ORG> decision in <ORG> and <ORG> decision in <ORG>
