The appeal was pending when the occurrence in question took place At about <NAME> deceased another brother of <NAME> came and reported that on his way from Chanarthal Kalan he was taunted by <NAME> and there was a sharp exchange of hot words between them with reference to the deceased attempt to recover possession of the land He hastened to Chinarthal Khurd and recorded the statement of <NAME> between and He then sent the statement to the <ORG> where on its basis a case was registered same day at The first is that the appellants were charged in respect of offences under Sections and read with Section Penal Code but they have been convicted under Section read with Section Penal Code though there was no specific charge under Section Penal Code against them No appeal was filed by the <ORG> against that order of acquittal which in consequence became final and on the principle of issue estoppel the court was precluded in the murder case from holding that <NAME> was in possession of this gun Moreover the circumstance that most of the gun shot injuries were located on the front side of the victims the non recovery of any gun from <NAME> the recovered double barrelled gun being a licensed weapon of <NAME> the participation of <NAME> and his death in the encounter the recovery of only three bore empties from the scene of occurrence the certainty of one and the possibility of the other two of which having been fired through the bore gun of <NAME> had been established by the evidence of Mr <NAME> Ballistic Expert CW the gun shot injuries on all the five persons namely <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> deceased <NAME> PW <NAME> PW according to the own showing of the prosecution being the result of the three gunfires all are tell tale circumstances pointing to the conclusion that only one gun had been used In the alternative it is contended that there was no reason to disbelieve <NAME> plea of self defence viz In reply Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the <ORG> contends that in exercise of its special jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution this <ORG> does not as a rule of practice reappraise the evidence and disturb concurrent findings of fact recorded by the courts below unless those findings are clearly unreasonable or perverse The witnesses were under no obligation to explain the injuries of <NAME> which might have been fabricated or received in any other incident The preliminary objections raised by the learned Counsel for the appellants are untenable Nor do we find any substances in them If therefore the necessary information is conveyed to him in other ways and there is no prejudice the trial is not invalidated by the mere fact that the charge was not formally reduced to writing It was further observed that it is not correct to say that Section of the Code has no application to an accused in which there is no charge at all We therefore do not propose to deal with those contentions which though noted earlier in this judgment out of judicial courtesy challenge the propriety of the appellants conviction for these three murders Although in examination in chief the Doctor had said that these injuries were likely to be caused by a fire arm the circumstances on record definitely point towards the conclusion that the injury was probably caused with a sharp pointed weapon and not with a gun We have therefore no hesitation in holding that the learned Judges of <ORG> were in error in upholding the conviction of the appellants for the murder of <NAME> merely on the basis of what they termed plausible explanation rather than positive and convincing proof given by the prosecution We would therefore set aside that conviction We now take up matter No ii It will bear repetition that from a combined reading of the statements of <NAME> one made in <ORG> and the other at the trial it was clear that the plea set up by him was one of self defence But there was other evidence circumstantial and direct which shows that the occurrence was not a one sided affair The fact that certain Divas earthen lamps were found with <NAME> deceased and the occurrence took place near the grave of a Muslim Pir does lend some support to the argument that the occurrence might not have been pre planned
