Prior to th July the respondents had filed a classification list in respect of the spun yarn manufactured by them showing the same as covered by Item No III i in the first schedule to the <ORG> and Salts Act <ORG> Act On th February the Superintendent of <ORG> issued a demand notice against the respondent No on the footing that there was short payment of excise duty as the goods manufactured by the respondents were liable to be classified under <ORG> Tariff Item No III ii The respondents filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging the notice of demand On th February the Assistant Collector of <ORG> passed an order modifying the approval granted to the classification lists submitted by the respondents and classifying the aforesaid product of the respondents under Item No III ii of Schedule I of the <ORG> Act on the basis of which the Superintendent <ORG> issued on the th February a notice to the respondent No calling upon them to show cause why duty short levied should not be recovered from them under the provisions of section A of the <ORG> Act The petitioners also filed an appeal before the Collector of <ORG> against the said orders of adjudication Under the provisions of Section A of the <ORG> Act before any demand is made on any person chargeable in respect of non levy or short levy or under payment of duty a notice requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amounts specified in the notice must be served on him The appellants contended that although the notice of demand might be set aside the notice to show cause dated th th February should be treated as a valid notice in respect of the period from th August to th February and the period from th February onwards Under Section A of the <ORG> Act the notice can relate only to a period of six months period to the issue of that notice except in cases where it is alleged that the short levy or payment has occurred by reason of fraud collusion or wilful misrepresentation or suppression of facts or contravention of the provisions of the said Act or rules as contemplated in the proviso to sub section of Section A There are some reports submitted by <ORG> with the details of which we are not concerned Without giving any show cause notice or affording any opportunity to the petitioners to be heard on th February the Superintendent of <ORG> issued a notice of demand for a total sum of Rs against the petitioner No on the footing that there was short payment of excise duty The petitioners filed the aforesaid writ petition in <ORG> challenging the validity of the said notice of demand dated th February On the same day namely th February an order was passed by the Assistant Collector of <ORG> modifying the approval granted to the aforesaid classification lists submitted by the petitioners which had been approved as aforesaid and classifying the aforesaid product under Item No III ii of Schedule of the <ORG>s Act On th February a notice was issued by the Superintendent <ORG> on the petitioner No reciting inter alia that the Assistant Collector had modified the approval of the classification lists on th February and calling upon the petitioner No to show cause why the duty short levied should not be recovered from them under the provisions of Section A of the <ORG>s Act The petitioner No wrote to the excise authorities pointing out that in view of the aforesaid writ petition filed by the appellant the adjudication proceedings should be stayed till writ petition was disposed of The petitioners also filed an appeal before the Collector of <ORG>s Appeal against the orders of adjudication dated th March However the learned Judge directed the Collector <ORG> before whom the appeal filed by the petitioners was pending to decide the appeal in respect of the demand made by the excise authorities for the subsequent period A perusal of the judgment also clearly indicates that <ORG> directed that the Collector <ORG> Appeal should hear the appeal of the petitioners on merits after giving the petitioners an adequate opportunity to put their case and their evidence before him in respect of the period from th February onwards The relevant portion of Section A of the Central Excises Act runs as follows When any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded a Central Excise Officer may within six months from the relevant date serve notice on the person chargeable with the duty which has not been levied or paid or which has been short levied or short paid or to whom the refund has erroneously been made requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice Provided that where any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded by reason of fraud collusion or any wilful mis statement or suppression of fact or contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of the rules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of duty by such person or his agent the provisions of this sub section shall have effect as if for the words Central Excise Officer the words Collector of Central Excise and for the words six months the words five years were substituted A perusal of the aforesaid provisions shows that before any demand is made on any person chargeable in respect of non levy or short levy or under payment of duty a notice requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amounts specified in the notice must be served on him Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant however contended that although the aforesaid Section provides that no demand could be made against a person thereunder without affording that person an adequate opportunity to show cause against the same in the present case though no prior show cause notice was given and the petitioners were not given an opportunity to be heard before the notice of demand was issued such a notice was issued and an opportunity to show cause was given after the demand was made and the demand confirmed after hearing and hence it must be regarded as valid An opportunity to be heard is intended to be afforded to the person who is likely to be prejudiced when the order is made before making the order The next submission of Mr <NAME> was that in any event as the Collector of Central Excise Appeals had been directed to examine the merits of the matter in respect of alleged short levy or non levy and the modification of the classification lists after allowing adequate opportunity to the petitioners to show cause in respect of the period from th February onwards the question as to whether there was short levy or non levy in respect of the period from th August to th February should even also be allowed to be decided by the Collector It was submitted by Mr <NAME> that although the notice of demand may be set aside the notice to show cause dated th February should be treated as a valid and effective notice in respect of the period from th August to th February as well as the period from th February onwards In this connection it is the submission of Dr <NAME> that this notice merely asked the petitioners to show cause against calculation or determination of the amount of short levy and not against the alteration in the classification lists on the basis of which short levy was alleged and hence in respect of the said period from th August to th February the show cause notice is liable to be struck down A reading of these paragraphs clearly shows that the notice set out as an established fact that the classification lists submitted by the petitioners had been modified by the Assistant Collector <ORG> Ujjain and the only matter with respect to which the petitioners were asked to show cause was with regard to the quantification of the amount of the short levy and consequently the amount which was liable to be recovered from the petitioner No Under Section A of the <ORG> Act the notice can relate only to a period of six months prior to the issue of that notice except in cases where it is alleged the short levy or short payment has occurred by reason of fraud collusion or wilful misrepresentation or suppression of facts or contravention of the provisions of the said Act or rules made by the period concerned as contemplated in the proviso to sub Section of Section A No such case has been sought to be made here in the said show cause notice We are therefore of the view that under the said show cause notice the question of short levy or non levy of excise duty prior to th February cannot be gone into by the Collector and <ORG> was right in the view which it took
