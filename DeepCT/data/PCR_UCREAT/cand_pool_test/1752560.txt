JUDGMENT <NAME> The plaintiffs have filed a suit for perpetual injunction alleging infringement of their registered trade mark and have also prayed for a decree for rendition of accounts of profits against the defendants It is alleged by the plaintiffs that they are the proprietors of the following two registered trade marks A Trade mark <ORG> with the device of <ORG> under No dated claiming user since in respect of pencils refills for propelling pens and pencils pen sharpeners pens fountainpeos eraserspin clips and staples included in class It is alleged by the plaintiffs that the conduct of the defendants is fraudulent inasmuch as they are using the trade mark and the device of <ORG> in respect of stationery pins even though the plaintiffs are the registered owners of the said trade mark and device According to the plaintiffs pecuniary compensation will not afford them an adequate relief and if injunction is not granted the plaintiffs will suffer irreparable loss and injury to the business name reputation and goodwill On the basis of the allegations contained in the plaint and the application supported by the documents placed on record an ad interim ex parte injunction was granted inter alia restraining the defendants from manufacturing or selling pins and clips in the carton bearing the trade mark and device Nataraj of which trade mark and device the plaintiffs were the registered owners The defendants filed their written statement and reply to the application It is not necessary to refer to the averments made in the written statement and the reply with regard to the merits of the case in any great detail because the main objection which has been raised therein and which is the only contention which has been argued before me at length by the learned counsel for the defendants is that there has been an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiffs In filing the present suit It is contended by the defendants that the plaintiffs were aware of the use of the trade mark Nataraj by the defendants since the year when the advertisements of the plaintiffs and the defendants appeared in the Magazine under the name <ORG> of March It is also the case of the plaintiffs that they have sales of pins and clips under the trade mark Nataraj It is further alleged that as the plaintiffs are the registered proprietors they have the exclusive right to use the trade mark Nataraj and that it is not necessary for them to have huge sales in order to get protection The main question which really arise for consideration before me is whether the plaintiffs are not entitled to the grant of an interim injunction because of inordinate delay or lakes or acquiescence as alleged by the defendants ded on the basis that the mark used by the defendants was similar to the registered trade mark of the plaintiffs <NAME> fairly conceded that if the defendants defense of the plaintiffs being guilty of inordinate delay or acquiescence is not accepted then in that case interim injunction may have to be issued because there is admittedly an infringement by the defendants of the plaintiffs registered trade mark Under Section of the Trade and Merchandise Marks the registered proprietor of a trade mark gets the exclusive right to use the said mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and the said owner also gets a right to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by the Act Section of the Act inter alia provides that a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who not being the registered proprietor of the trade marker a registered user thereof either uses or permits the use of the trade mark which is identical wither deceptively similar to the registered trade mark in relation to any goods Sub section of Section relates to marks which are registered in part of the Register and it is not necessary to refer to the said provision because in the present case it is an admitted case of the parties that the marks of the plaintiffs have been registered in Part A of the Register It may however be noted that under Section an injunction in respect of a trade mark registered in part of the Register will not be granted if the defendant establishes that the use of the mark of which the plaintiff complains is not likely to deceive or cause confusion or to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and some person having the right either as a registered proprietor or as a registered user to use the trade mark While an action for infringement is taken in respect of trade marks which are registered an action for passing off is in respect of goods for which the marks have not been registered but in respect of which marks over a period of time the user has acquired proprietory right The Court observed that there is a basic difference between the causes of action and the right to relief in suits for passing off and for infringement of a registered trade mark and it was also incorrect lo equate the essentials of a passing off action with those in respect of an action complaining of an infringement of a registered trade mark The following passage clearly brings out the essential similarities and the differences in respect of the reliefs which may be claimed in the aforesaid two types of causes of action THE finding in favor of the appellant to which the learned Counsel drew our attention was based upon dissimilarity of the packing in which the goods of the two parties were vended the difference in the physical appearance of the two packets by reason of the variation in their colour and other features and their general gel up together with the circumstance that the name and address of the manufactory of the appellant was prominently displayed on his packets and these features were all set out for negativing the respondent claim that the appellant had passed off his goods as those of the respondent These matters which are of the essence of the cause of action for relief on the ground of passing off play but a limited role in an action for infringement of a registered trade mark by the registered proprietor who has a statutory right to that mark and who has a statutory remedy in the event of the use by another of the mark or a colourable imitation thereof The action for infringement is statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods Vide In an action for infringement the plaintiff must no doubt make out that the use of the defendant mark is so close either visually phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff rights are violated Expressed in another way if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant the fact that the get up packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which be offers bids goods for sale show marked differeaces or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial where in the case of passing off the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff As stated <ORG> in Durga case supra for such an actio to succeed the plaintiff has merely to show that the essential features of the trade mark have bee adopted by the defendant It has been contended by the learned counsel for the defendants that there has been inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiffs in approach ing this Court and therefore on this ground alone no interim relief should be granted Inordinate delay however has been a factor which has been taken into consideration while declining the relief of a grant of temporary injunction The <ORG> held that the word Slerry had been used for British products of the same type of wine for nearly a hundred years and therefore there was inordinate delay on the part of the defendants and they were not entitled to the grant of an injunction Inordinate delay would therefore be delay of such a long duration that the defendant could have come to the conclusion that the plaintiff has possibly abandoned his right to seek relief or to object to the defendant using the trade mark It seems clear that something less than that is needed to offer a defense but how much less is not clear The plaintiffs filed a suit for injunction alleging that the use of the mark by the defendant amounted to an infringement of the plaintiffs registered mark It was observed by him as follows UPON this matter a great deal of learning has been referred to and we have also had our attention drawn to a number of cases there is nothing which calls upon him to assert his own rights I think so to hold at any rate in a case where the length of time involved is no greater than in this case would be to introduce a wholly novel nay revolutionary doctrine and I think also that it would be contrary to the principles laid down by the decided cases The preliminary injunction is sought upon the theory that there is an urgent need for speedy action to protect the plaintiff rights It is no doubt true that trade mark copyright or a patent belongs to a registered owner and in the sense is his monopoly because he has the exclusive right to use the same But when it becomes known that stolen property and infringement amounts to stealing another person intellectual property is being sold in the market to unwary customers it would be in the public interest that protection is granted to the members of the public After a number of years when the case is finally disposed of after trial and the plaintiff succeeds and gets a permanent injunction then possibly the plaintiff may also be compensated by his being awarded damages or an account of profits Therefore in order to curb the menace of manufacture production and sale of spurious goods and the blatant violation of intellectual property it will be proper for the court to take into consideration the interest of the general public In this regard reference may usefully be made to the following observations of <NAME> at page para which deals with the protection of third parties SOME courts also consider the necessity of protecting third parties A person who is guilty of violating the law or infringing or usurping somebody else right cannot claim the continued misuse of the usurped right It was observed by <NAME> in the matter of an application brought by <NAME> and Coy in such a case there may be an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiff in bringing a suit for injunction the application of the plaintiff for an interim injunction cannot be dismissed on the ground that the defendant has been using the mark for a number of years It would appear to me that where there is an honest concurrent user by the defendant then inordinate delay or lakes may defeat the claim of damages or rendition of accounts but the relief of injunction should not be refused Nevertheless if the Court comes to the conclusion that prejudice is likely to be caused to the general public who may be misled into buying the goods manufactured by the defendant thinking them to be the goods of the plaintiff then an injunction must be issued Furthermore there should be a tacit or an express assent by the plaintiff to the defendant using the mark and in a way encouraging the defendants to continue with the business Applying the aforesaid principles to the present case I find that there is no reason as to why the ad interim injunction should not be made absolute As already noted it has been strenuously contended by the learned counsel for the defendants that the plaintiffs are guilty of inordinate delay lakes and acquiescence but before considering this an important factor which has to be seen is whether the user or adoption by the defendant was honest or fraudulent Not only this the device of the dancing <NAME> which was registered by the plaintiff is the one which has been copied by the defendants The mark used by the defendants is identical to this dancing figure By not writing the name and address to the manufacturer on the cartons of the defendants it appears to me that an effort was being made to mislead the general public It the submitted by the learned counsel for the defendants that the plaintiffs have not objected to the use of the mark by the defendants The plaintiffs did not it was argued take any action in Court for injecting the defendants from using the mark and nor did the plaintiffs it is submitted send any notice to who defendants asking them to refrain from using the mark It was contended that by the plaintiffs limiting bier action to filing an application for cancellation of the copyright led the defendants to believe that the plaintiffs were not objecting to the defendants use of the mark and this amounts to acquiescence on the part of the plaintiffs There is no force in the aforesaid contention of the learned counsel for the defendants There should be a mistaken belief by the defendant that there is no objection to the plaintiff using its mark In the present case the plaintiffs have taken action by applying to the Registrar of Copyright for cancellation of the registration which had been granted to the defendant In the application for cancellation it has been specifically stated by the plaintiffs that the use of the infringing label has adversely affected the business of the plaintiffs It is true that no specific notice was sent to the defendant asking the defendant not to use the mark and it is further correct that no suit for injunction was immediately filed Such non action may disentitle the plaintiff for the award of damages or rendition of accounts but such inaction does not show any consent or acquiescence on the part of the plaintiff to the defendant using the said mark It had been submitted that there was an inordinate delay on the part of the plaintiffs in filing the present suit The plaintiffs in did file an application for cancellation of the registration of copyright of the defendant The defendant certainly had notice of application of the plaintiff having been filed against it in the year for cancellation of registration of the copyright For the aforesaid reasons I restrain the defendants by an interim injunction from using the offending mark NATARAJ and the device of Nataraj or any similar mark or device which is an infringement on the plaintiff registered trademark No and in respect of stationery pins and other stationery items till the final decision of the present suit Parties will bear their own costs
