The deed provided that if the interest for one complete year remains unpaid the creditors shall have power to recover the interest and shall also be at liberty to recover the principal and interest without having any regard for the stipulated period There was a stipulation that if the interest and compound interest were not paid for one year the creditors shall after the expiry of one year have power to recover the principal amount with interest and compound interest without waiting for the expiry of the stipulated period There was an additional clause in the second mortgage deed in the following terms Whenever I the executant shall pay any amount the creditors aforesaid shall receive it without any objection and shall after setting it off against the interest credit the balance towards the principal and the interest will be reduced in proportion to the amount paid Admittedly interest was not paid and there were defaults at the expiry of one year on account of both these mortgage deeds There was an acknowledgment of both these mortgage debts on rd March which gave a fresh start for the purpose of limitation One consolidated suit was filed on nd February to recover the amounts due on both these documents and in the claim was decreed Before the view which prevailed in this Court was that the limitation being to run against a mortgagee from the date of the first default which entitles him to sue for the whole amount Although the view in this Court was that the money became duo within the meaning of Article go as to make the period of limitation for a suit for sale run from the date of the default it was never held that the mortgagor also can by his own default entitle himself to redeem before the expiry of the stipulated period Their Lordships of <ORG> were able to dispose of the case on a different ground but Lord <NAME> who delivered the judgment of their Lordships observed that this <ORG> applying the previous decision in <NAME> case A I All and other cases had held that a single delimit on the part of the mortgagors without without any act of election cancellation or other form of response or acceptance on the part of the mortgagees and even it would appear against their desire operates eo instanti to make the money scoured by the mortgage become due so that all right of action in respect of the security is finally barred years later All this the <ORG> held notwithstanding that the mortgage is for a term certain a provision which may be as much for the benefit of the mortgagees as for the mortgagors and notwithstanding that the proviso is exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagees Their Lordships considered it a matter of great regret that they had to pronounce upon this important and difficult question without the assistance of counsel for the respondents but as the case had been placed before their Lordships very fully and fairly by the counsel for the appellant their Lordships had the opportunity to give full consideration to their judgment Their Lordships accordingly laid down that a proviso of such a nature is inserted exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagees and that it purports to give them an option either to enforce their security at once or if the security is ample to stand by their investment for the full term of the mortgage It was accordingly laid down that the mortgage money does not become due within the meaning of Article Limitation Act until both the mortgagor right to redeem and the mortgagee right to enforce his security have accrued and that this would of course also be the position if the mortgagee exercised the option reserved to him There is accordingly no doubt whatsoever that the Full Bench cases of this Court have been expressly overruled and are no longer good law It is therefore argued that when the words to be interpreted are different it is the decision of the Full Bench of five Judges which is binding on this Court and not the decision of their Lordships of <ORG> the learned Counsel further draws our attention to the passage in the judgment of their Lordships quoted above where it was laid down that the mortgage money does not become due until both the mortgagor right to redeem and the mortgagee right to enforce his security have accrued It is then contended that in the present case the mortgagor had already a right under the deeds to red earn before the expiry of the fixed period and so when the mortgagee also came to have the right to sue there was perfect mutuality and the money must be deemed to have become duo within the moaning of Article It is further pointed out that in the Limitation Act the words become due or falls due and the word payable are used in different senses Reference is made to Article whore on a bill of exchange or a promissory note payable at a fixed time after date limitation begins to run from the date when the bill or note falls due I take the pronouncement of their Lordships to mean that a clause of this nature is exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagee and gives him a perfect option or liberty to sue for his money or to stand by his investment for the full term of mortgage and so long us the mortgagee does net by means of any act of election cancellation or other form of response or acceptance make the money become due time does not begin to run against him Indeed <ORG> considered that the words bond becomes payable in Article meant very the same thing as money becomes due in Article considered that <ORG> had not only emphasized but perhaps extended the view taken in <NAME> case A I All It therefore seems to me that the basis of both the views must be deemed to have gone on account of the latest pronouncement of their Lordships It follows that time did not begin to run on the two bonds before the expiry of the stipulated periods It is not necessary to decide in this case when time would begin to run if a mortgagee were to enforce a default clause nor is it necessary to consider whether the mortgagor had a right of redemption even before the expiry of the stipulated period So far as the deed of is concerned there can be no doubt as to when the mortgagor could redeem as there was an express clause to that effect at the end of the document But I must say that if a document says that the mortgagor shall have a right to redeem it within a fixed period there is some difficulty in holding that it necessarily means that the mortgagor cannot redeem it before the expiry of the period But on the other hand the context of the document may show that the word in was used loosely for the word for I quite agree and indeed I think we are bound by the authority of the larger <ORG> on this point which certainly has not been overruled by <ORG> It is argued that <NAME> case A I does not apply when the mortgagor has a right to redeem before the expiry of the stipulated period Their Lordships observed that the money does not become due within the meaning of Article until both the mortgagor right to redeem and the mortgagee right to enforce his security have accrued In the present case the mortgagor certainly had a right to redeem the mortgage of before the expiry of the stipulated period They lay stress upon the point that the provision enabling the mortgagees to sue before the expiry of the stipulated period is inserted exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagees giving them an option either to enforce their security at once or to stand by their investment for the full term I take this to mean that the mortgagee has an option of treating the money as having become due by demanding or suing for it and that it does not become due unless he exercises his option even though the mortgagor may already have a right to redeem in accordance with the terms of the mortgage contract If we hold that time begins to run for a suit to enforce the mortgage from the date of the first default that gives an optional cause of action then it could not be said that the provision is inserted exclusively for the mortgagee benefit He would have to sue within years from the date of the first default although he might prefer to stand by his investment for the full term and then sue within years from the expiry of that term He might indeed be compelled to sue before the expiry of the full term if the term were years or more In my view therefore the question whether the mortgagor has a right to redeem before the expiry of the stipulated period is immaterial Time does not begin to run against the mortgagee before the expiry of that period unless he avails himself of the option inserted exclusively for his benefit In one of the deeds dated th September it is expressly stipulated that whenever I the executant shall pay any amount the creditor aforesaid shall receive it without any objection and shall after setting it off against the interest credit the balance towards the principal and the interest will be reduced in proportion to the amount paid It has been argued on the authority of the cases that clauses which provide that the mortgage money shall be paid in so many years or within so many years should be construed as providing for a term certain so that neither the mortgagor can pay nor the mortgagee can recover within that term In <NAME> <ORG> <ORG> of this Court had the occasion to consider a document in which there was a stipulation that the mortgagor would redeem the mortgaged property within years It may be conceded that if there are clear indications in a deed showing that the mortgagor was debarred from paying within the stipulated term which was as much for the benefit of the mortgagee as for his own the mere use of the words andar miad may not neutralise such indications but I am strongly of opinion that in the absence of other words showing that the mortgagor is precluded from redeeming within the term the use of the words in so many years or within so many years in itself implies that the right to redeem and the right to foreclose have not been made coextensive by the parties I have carefully examined these cases and entertain no doubt that the question was res integra and is so at any rate far as this Full Bench is concerned there is nothing to warrant the view that the use of the word within or in does not imply that the mortgagor has a right to redeem before the expiry of the term I have made a usufructuary mortgage for a term of years The agreement is that when I the mortgagor do pay to the mortgagee within ton years the entire mortgage money cash and in a lump sum then the property mortgaged will stand redeemed Hence I have executed this usufructuary mortgage deed by a conditional sale of ten years that it may serve as evidence when necessary The former case was disposed of on another ground though their Lordships made certain observations which were accepted in the second case the High <ORG> held that under a clause in the above form a single default on the part of the mortgagors without any act of election cancellation or other form of response of acceptance on the part of the mortgagees and even it would appear against their desire operates eo instanti to make the money secured by the mortgage become due so that all right of action in respect of the security is finally barred by years later that is in the present case on st February It seems tome that though their Lordships did not decide the question their view is sufficiently indicated by what they considered to be reductio ad absurdum resulting from the view taken by <ORG> Though their Lordships make a reference to a term certain the essential reason for the view implied in that observation seems to be that the mortgagor has in such a case a right of election or cancellation and that the clause being for the benefit of the mortgagee he can waive the benefit It gives one an impression that if the mortgagor has got the right to pay and it is also open to the mortgagee to call in his money by the exercise of an option given to him by the deed the money becomes due As I read para the last but three of their Lordships judgment money does not become due unless the mortgagor is at liberty to pay and the mortgagee is at liberty to sue and the mortgagee having an option to claim immediate payment did not avail himself of the option by claiming it before the expiry of the term In the case before us though the mortgagor had the right to pay at any time within the stipulated term the mortgagee did not avail himself of his option to call in his money and therefore the money sued for did not become due Article read with Article is applicable It is argued that their Lordships of <ORG> have excluded a claim of this kind from the operation of the rule on which they based their judgment when they observed that If in the Indian cases the question were when did the mortgagee cause of action arise that is when he first became entitled to sue for the relief claimed by his suit their Lordships think that there might be much to be said in support of the Allahabad decisions It is contended that we are not concerned with the words become due occurring in Article Limitation Act but with Articles and and the question is when the money sued for became payable which means in substance when did he mortgagor first become entitled to sue for the relief claimed The contention is plausible but I do not think that any distinction can be made between the expressions when money becomes due and when money becomes payable if in either case the mortgagee has an option to disregard the term and he did not exercise that option Precisely the same reasoning holds good in a case in which Article read with Article is applicable as in a case under Article For the reasons mentioned above I agree in answering the question referred to <ORG> in the manner proposed by the Hon ble Chief Justice
