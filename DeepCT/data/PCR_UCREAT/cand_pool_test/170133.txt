The <ORG> officer finding that the deduction of interest claimed was utilised for giving interest free loans to the partners for clearing their income tax dues and as such it could not be said to be a loan incurred for the expenses of the partnership firm not only disallowed the deduction claimed for that assessment year but also issued a notice under for the re opening of the original assessment of the previous years on the ground that the deduction having been wrongly allowed taxable income escaped assessment On the application of the respondent Revenue the <ORG> made a reference under of the Act framing a question namely Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was right in holding that the reassessment made by the <ORG> officer under of the Indian <ORG> Act was incompetent to <ORG> which answered it in the negative and held that the case squarely fell within the ambit of of the Act inasmuch as the information on the basis of which the <ORG> officer sought to reopen the original assessment was based on subsequent facts as also on the materials of the original assessment revealed by more careful and closer circumspection of these materials ii It was not open to the <ORG> officer to have reopened the original assessment merely because he took a different view of the matter in the assessment year The first category deals with cases where an assessee is himself in default and the second category deals with cases where there is an default on the part of the assessee but where the income chargeable to tax has actually escaped assessment for one reason or the other and the <ORG> officer comes to know about the same The word information which has not been defined in the Act is of the widest amplitude and comprehends a variety of factors Since the <ORG> officer was to see that the tax collecting machinery is made as perfect and effective as possible so that the tax payer is not allowed to get away with escaped income tax in view of the difficulty in laying down any rule of universal application the following tests and principles would apply to determine the applicability of to the following categories of cases i Where the information is as to the true and correct state of law derived from relevant judicial decisions ii Where in the original assessment the income liable to tax has escaped assessment duel to oversight inadvertence or a mistake committed by the <ORG> officer on the principle that the tax payer would not be allowed to take advantage of an oversight or mistake committed by the taxing authority iii Where the information is derived from an external source of any kind If these conditions are satisfied then the <ORG> officer would have complete jurisdiction to reopen the original assessment It is obvious that where the <ORG> officer gets no subsequent information but merely proceeds to reopen the original assessment without any fresh facts or materials or without any enquiry into the materials which from part of the original assessment would have no application In the instant case the subsequent information was the discovery by the <ORG> officer the deduction was wrongly claimed and the consequent disallowance of that deduction and the conduct of the assessee itself in not adducing any evidence or materials to prove its stand that the claim was validly made which led to the issue of the notice under for reopening the assessment The case really fell within the tests and principles laid down in A Raman Company case and within the ambit of inasmuch as the <ORG> officer proceeded on the basis of the information which came to him after the original assessment by fresh facts revealed in the assessment for the year and consisted of the conduct of the assessee in not adducing any evidence to support its plea Although the question appears to have been settled in one form or the other by the decisions of this Court the changing and diverse society such as ours dealing in complex commercial activities continues to produce multifarious facts of taxable income which has escaped assessment cloaked under difficult propositions and knotty legal problems The said firm filed its return for the year corresponding to the accounting Gujarati Diwali Year showing a total income of Rs While the assessee filed his return in the year the Income tax officer concerned suspected the correctness of the return particularly the deduction of interest and found that as the amount of the deduction claimed was utilised for giving interest free loans to the partners for clearing up their income tax dues it could not be said to be a loan incurred for the expenses of the partnership business and he accordingly disallowed the deduction claimed by the appellant This discovery led the Income tax officer to issue notice to the appellant under of the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act for reopening the assessment of the year hereafter to be referred to as the original assessment on the ground that the deduction having been wrongly allowed taxable income and escaped assessment Thereafter the appellant filed an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner against the order of the Income tax officer but the appeal was dismissed by the Appellate authority which confirmed the order of the Income tax officer Thereafter the appellant filed a second appeal to <ORG> Bench Calcutta The <ORG> accordingly allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Income tax officer issuing notice to the assessee under for reopening the original assessment Thereafter the respondent namely the Commissioner of Income tax approached the <ORG> for making a reference to <ORG> under of the Act as a result of which the <ORG> referred the case to <ORG> at Calcutta after framing the following question Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was right in holding that the re assessment made by the Income tax officer under of the Indian Income tax Act was incompetent <ORG> after hearing the parties differed from the view taken by the <ORG> and held that the present case squarely fell within the ambit of of the Act inasmuch as the information on the basis of which the Income tax officer sought to re open the original assessment was based on subsequent facts as also on the materials of the original assessment revealed by more careful and closer circumspection of those materials The appellant sought leave to appeal to this Court against the order of <ORG> which having been refused the appellant obtained special leave from this Court and hence this appeal It was also submitted that it was not open to the Income tax officer to have re opened the original assessment merely because he took a different view of the matter in the assessment year In order to appreciate the contentions advanced by counsel for the parties it is necessary to make a brief survey of the provisions of of the Income tax Act If a the Income tax officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his income under section for any year or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment for that year or have been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made the subject of excessive relief under the Act or excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed or notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in clause a on the part of the assessee the Income tax officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment for any year or have been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made the subject of excessive relief under this Act or that excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed he may in cases falling under clause a at any time and in cases falling under clause at any time within four years of the end of that year serve on the assessee or if the assessee is a company on the principal officer thereof a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of section and may proceed to assess or reassess such income profits or gains or recompute the loss or depreciation allowance and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section Provided It would be seen that contemplates two categories of cases for re opening the previous assessment where there has been an omission or failure on the part of the assessee to make a return of his income under or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment and where there has been no such omission on the part of the assessee but the Income tax officer on the basis of information in his possession finds that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any year It is therefore manifest that the first category deals with cases where an assessee is himself in default and the second category deals with cases where there is no fault on the part of an assessee but where the income chargeable to tax has actually escaped assessment for one reason or the other and the Income tax officer comes to know about the same In the instant case however we are concerned with clause of extracted supra Before however proceeding to interpret the ambit and import of it may be necessary to consider the history of of the Act which appears to have passed through different phases with amendments and additions made to the section from time to time If for any reason income profits or gains chargeable to income tax has escaped assessment in any year or has been assessed at too low a rate the Income tax officer may at any time within one year of the end of that year serve on the person liable to pay tax on such income profits or gains or in the case of a company on the principal officer thereof a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of section and may proceed to assess or reassess such income profits or gains and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section Provided that the tax shall be charged at the rates at which it would have been charged had the income profits or gains not escaped assessment or full assessment as the case may be It would be seen that in the section as it stood in the word information was not there at all and the section merely empowered the Income tax officer to reopen the assessment of any year where income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment No conditions or limitations on the power of the Income tax officer were at all laid down under the section It appears that the appropriate <ORG> in its wisdom thought that this would be too wide a power to be given to the Income tax officer and may not be workable In these circumstances by the Indian Income tax Amendment Act this section was recast as under If in consequence of definite information which has come into his possession the Income tax Officer discovers that income profits and gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment in any year or have been under assessed or have been assessed at too low a rate or have been the subject of excessive relief under this Act the Income tax officer may in any case in which he has reason to believe that the assessee has concealed the particulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars thereof at any time within eight years and in any other case at any time within four years of the end of that year serve on the person liable to pay tax on such income profits or gains or in the case of a company on the principle officer thereof a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of section and may proceed to assess or re assess such income profits or gains and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section It may be pertinent to note that by virtue of this amendment the concept of the Income tax officer deriving definite information was introduced for the first time The word information was qualified by definite and an additional condition was incorporated namely that the Income tax officer discovers that income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment There were further amendments in and with which we are not concerned We are now concerned in this case only with as it stood after the amendment of The fact that the adjective definite qualified the word information and the word discovers which were introduced in the Income tax Amendment Act were deleted by the Amendment Act of would lead to the irresistible inference that the word information is of the widest amplitude and comprehends a variety of factors Where the ground on which the original assessment is based is held to be erroneous by a superior court in some other case that will also amount to a fresh information which comes into existence subsequent to the original assessment In our opinion even in a case where a return has been submitted if the Income tax officer erroneously fails to tax a part of assessable income it is a case where the said part of the income has escaped assessment where <NAME> speaking for this <ORG> observed as follows It may be added that after the decision of this Court in <NAME> case it is now settled that information in included information as to the true and correct state of law and so would cover information as to relevant judicial decisions and that such information for the purpose of of the Income tax Act need not be confined only to cases where the Income tax officer discovers as a fact that income has escaped assessment But even in a case where a return had been submitted if the Income tax officer had erroneously failed to tax a part of the assessa ble income it was a case where that part of the income had escaped assessment The matter was again fully considered by this <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> case supra where <NAME> <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> extended the connotation of the word information to two different categories of cases and observed as follows The expression information in the context in which it occurs must in our judgment mean instruction or knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particulars as to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment Jurisdiction of the Income tax officer to reassess income arises if he has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment An analysis of this case would clearly show that the information as contained in must fulfil the following conditions The information may be derived from an external source concerning facts or particulars as to law relating to matter bearing on the assessment That the information must come after the previous or the original assessment was made These categories are in addition to the categories laid down by this <ORG> in <NAME> case which has been consistently followed in several decisions of this <ORG> as shown above On a combined review of the decisions of this <ORG> the following tests and principles would apply to determine the applicability of to the following categories of cases Where the information is as to the true and correct state of the law derived from relevant judicial decisions Where in the original assessment the income liable to tax has escaped assessment due to oversight in advertence or a mistake committed by the Income tax officer It is obvious that where the Income tax officer gets no subsequent information but merely proceeds to re open the original assessment without any fresh facts or materials or without any enquiry into the materials which form part of the original assessment would have no application It was submitted that in the original assessment the assessee had claimed a deduction and had produced the balance sheet and these very factors were also present when the Income tax officer sought to make the assessment for the year and and since no fresh facts were brought to his notice it was not open to him to re open the original assessment The facts of the case relied upon by the appellant are clearly distinguishable from the facts of the present case It is not the case of the Income tax officer that he did not come to know all the relevant facts when he made the original orders of assessment It is also not his case that at the time he made those orders he was not aware of the true legal position It was for the Income tax officer to show that he had received some information subsequent to his passing the original orders of assessment that the Income tax officer came to a finding that the assessee had not proved that the amount of deduction claimed was really in connection with the partnership business but held that this was on account of interest free advance to the partners to pay their income tax dues and the conduct of the appellant in not clearing the doubts of the Income tax officer when the appellant was given the notice to contest the assessment merely on the question of law also spoke volumes against the assessee and was also an additional factor which weighed with the Income tax officer Inasmuch as the entire money borrowed had been utilised not for the purpose of business but in giving interest free advance to the partners of the firm In fact no argument as regards the allowance or disallowance of the interest amount in question was placed but the entire argument of the representative proceeded on the basis that the action itself was illegal There is no doubt that there has been under assessment in this case and there is also no doubt that the fact of under assessment has been brought to the notice of the Income tax officer only in the course of the income tax proceedings for However later on while making the assessment for the assessment years and the I found that the appellant had no evidence with him to show that the funds borrowed on which the interest was paid in fact were utilised for the purpose of the business and not diverted to the partners We might mention that it was submitted by Mr <NAME> that in fact the amount sought to be deducted was paid towards the income tax liability of the partners and this was done to protect the business itself and to improve the credit of the partners In this case <NAME> as he then was speaking for the Court after review of the authorities of this Court and other <ORG> observed as follows What is obligatory in order to apply section is that he must have information in his possession in consequence of which he has reason to believe that the income has escaped assessment or is under assessed etc We are no doubt inclined to agree with the view expressed by <NAME> in the aforesaid case but as this question is not free from difficulty as there is some divergence of judicial opinion on the subject we would refrain from giving any definite decision on this point particularly when in the view we take in the instant case this point does not really arise for determination in this case which is really based on another principle namely that the information was derived by the Income tax officer from fresh facts and is clearly covered by the principles laid down in <NAME> Company case supra For the reasons given above we find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by <ORG>
