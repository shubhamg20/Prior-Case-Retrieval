the building completes ten years during the course of litigation In the present case the benefit of the new Rent Act should be given to the appellant who only seeks the protection of the new Rent Act which became applicable to the premises in question during the pendency of the litigation Sections and of the new Rent Act also indicate that the benefit of the new Act will be given to the tenant if the conditions contemplated in those sections are satisfied Normally the <ORG> has to decide the case on the basis of cause of action that accrued prior to the date of filing the suit and not on a new cause of action But it can and in many cases must take into account events and developments subsequent to the institution of the proceeding provided the rules of fairness to both sides are scrupulously obeyed Normally amendment is not allowed if it changes the cause of action But it is well recognised that where the amendment does not constitute an addition of a new cause of action or raise a new case but amounts to no more than adding to the facts already on record the amendment would be allowed even after the statutory period of limitation The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> The present appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> dated th July disposing of a revision under of the Small Causes Court Act arising out of suit for eviction of the appellant from the premises in suit The respondent filed a suit for eviction and for arrears of rent and damages for use and occupation pendent lite and future on the allegation that the appellant was inducted as a tenant of the premises in suit on a monthly rent of Rs The claim was resisted by the appellant on the ground that the building in question was constructed in and that it was covered by the new Rent Act His further stand was that rent had been cleared upto th April and there was no default in the payment of rent He also challenged the service and the validity of the notice terminating his tenancy was based upon sub of which provides that nothing in this Act shall apply to a building during the period of ten years from the date on which its construction is completed The second ground was based upon the proviso to sub of which contemplates that where a building has been constructed substantially out of funds by way of loan or advance from the State Government or <ORG> or a bank or a Co operative society and the period of repayment of such loan or advance exceeds the aforesaid period of ten years then reference in this sub section to a period of ten years shall be deemed to be a reference to a period of fifteen years or the period ending with the date of actual repayment of each loan or the period ending with the date of actual repayment of each loan of advance including interest whichever is shorter It was contended for the appellant that the building in question had been constructed by a co operative society and the landlord had purchased it from the society and therefore the view taken by the learned Judge that the building was constructed substantially out of funds obtained from the sources mentioned in the proviso to of the new Rent Act was manifestly erroneous The trial court was further directed to afford opportunity to the parties to adduce further evidence in regard to this aspect of the Constitution we granted special leave and with the consent of the counsel for the parties we finally heard the appeal to obviate further delay The only point argued before this Court is whether the premises which was not ten years old on the date of the suit and was exempted from the operation of the new Rent Act can be governed by it if ten years expired during the pendency of the litigation In order to appreciate the contention of the parties it will be relevant at this stage to refer to of the new rent Act I nothing in this Act shall apply to a any building built and held by a society registered under the Societies registration Act Act No LVIII of or by a Co operative society company or firm and intended solely for its own occupation or for the occupation of any of its officers or servants whether on rent or free of rent or as a guest house by whatever name called for the occupation of persons having dealings with it in the ordinary course of business Except as provided in sub section of Section sub section IA of section sub section of Section Section A or sub section of Section nothing in this Act shall apply to a building during a period of ten years from the date on which its construction is completed Provided that where any building is constructed substantially out of funds obtained by way of loan or advance from <ORG> or <ORG> or a bank or a co operative society or <ORG> and the period of repayment of such loan or advance exceeds the aforesaid period or ten years then the reference in this sub section to the period of ten years shall be deemed to be a reference to the period of ten years or the period ending with the date of actual repayment of each loan or advance including interest whichever is shorter Explanation I For the purposes of this sub section a the construction of a building shall be deemed to have been completed on the date on which the completion thereof is reported to or otherwise recorded by the local authority having jurisdiction and in the case of a building subject to assessment the date on which the first assessment thereof comes into effect and where the said dates are different the earliest of the said dates and in the absence of any such report record or assessment the date on which it is actually occupied not including occupation merely for the purposes of supervising the construction or guarding the building under construction for the first time Explanation I to sub enumerates the dates on which the building shall be deemed to have been completed i The date on which the completion thereof is reported to or otherwise is recorded by the local authority having jurisdiction The moment a building becomes ten years old to be reckoned from the date of completion the new Rent Act would become applicable In that case a contention was raised that the building will be deemed to have been constructed on the date of occupation on th June and not on the date of the first assessment and if that be so the appellant would be entitled to the benefit of of the Act on the date when the revision came to be decided by <ORG> This Court however held that it is the date of the first assessment which will be deemed to be the date of completion of the construction in the circumstances of the case and in that view of the matter the building had not become more than ten years old on the date when the revision came to be decided by <ORG> and therefore there was no question of giving the benefit of of the Act to the appellant In the instant case however the building had become more than ten years old during the pendency of the litigation and therefore the question assumes importance in the present case It may be argued that the Court had to decide the case on the basis of cause of action that accrued prior to the date of filing the suit and not on a new cause of action but this question need not detain us as it is covered by decision of this Court in <NAME> <ORG> Dealing with a similar question this Court observed It is basic to our processual jurisprudence that the right to relief must be judged to exist as on the date a suitor institutes the legal proceeding Nor can we contemplate any limitation on this power to take note of updated fact to confine it to <ORG> We affirm the proposition that for making the right or remedy claimed by the party just and meaningful as also legally and factually in legally and factually in accord with the current realities the <ORG> can and in many cases must take cautious cognizance of events and developments subsequent to the institution of the proceeding provided the rules of fairness to both sides are scrupulously obeyed Normally amendment is not allowed if it changes the cause of action But it is well recognised that where the amendment does not constitute an addition of a new cause of action or raise a new case but amounts to no more than adding to the facts already on the record the amendments would be allowed even after the statutory period of limitation The question in the present case is whether by seeking the benefit of of the new Act there is a change in the cause of action That expression for the present purpose only means a new claim made on a new basis constituted by new facts Such a view was taken in <NAME> <ORG> and it seems to us to be the only possible view to take The appellant in the present case only seeks the protection of the new Rent Act which became applicable to the premises in question during the pendency of the litigation We see no reason why the benefit of the new Rent Act be not given to the appellant Sections and of the new rent Act also indicate that the benefit of the new Act will be given to the tenant if the conditions comtemplated in those sections are satisfied It is accordingly allowed in part and the judgment and decree of <ORG> is set aside in so far as it relates to eviction but the judgment of <ORG> setting aside the decree for arrears of rent and remanding the case to the trial court remains intact and the case is sent back to the III Additional District Judge who will apply the new Rent Act and give the protection of the new Act to the appellant and will give him an opportunity to deposit the dues contemplated by of the new rent Act after first determining whether any amount is due from the appellant towards rent as directed by <ORG> The costs here will abide the result Appeal allowed in part
