HEADNOTE The appellants were tried by the Sessions Judge on the charge of committing murder of <NAME> The prosecution relied on the evidence of two eye witnesses and three dying declarations made by the deceased The <ORG> set aside the order of acquittal and convicted the appellants under section read with section I and sentenced each of them to imprisonment for life It is well settled that though a dying declaration must be approached with caution for the reason that the maker of the statement cannot be subjected to cross examination there is neither a rule of law nor a rule of prudence that a dying declaration cannot be acted upon unless it is corroborated It was made by way of First Information Report and it was only after the information was recorded that the investigation commenced ORDER CHANDRACHUD The appellants <NAME> and <NAME> were tried by the learned Sessions Judge Chatarpur on the charge that at about a On April they committed the murder of one <NAME> In support of its case the prosecution relied upon the evidence of <NAME> and Mst <NAME> stated that he saw <NAME> assaulting <NAME> with a spear but that he did not see <NAME> at all The learned Judge was also not impressed by any of the dying declarations with the result that he came to the conclusion that the prosecution had failed to establish its case beyond a reasonable doubt Being aggrieved by the order of acquittal the State Government filed an appeal in <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh which was allowed by <ORG> of that Court by its judgment dated September The appellants have filed this appeal under of the Supreme Court Enlargement of Criminal Appellate Jurisdiction Act It is however unnecessary to discuss every one of the points made by him because basically the scope of this appeal not for getting that the appellants had a right to file this appeal in this <ORG> lies within a narrow compass It was contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the oral statement which <NAME> made cannot in the eye of law constitute a dying declaration because he did not give a full account of the incident or of the transaction which resulted in his death There is no substance in this contention because in order that the <ORG> may be in a position to assess the evidentiary value of a dying declaration what is necessary is that the whole of the statement made by the deceased must be laid before the <ORG> without tampering with its terms or its tenor It was urged by the learned counsel that after the attack the deceased was all along accompanied by a large number of persons and one cannot therefore exclude the possibility that he was tutored into involving the appellants falsely the main objection of the learned counsel is that it was made to the investigating officer himself and ought therefore be treated as suspect The <ORG> officer who recorded the statement did not possess the capacity of an investigating officer at the time when he recorded the statement The judgment on which the counsel relies has therefore no application <ORG> was therefore justified in reversing the order of acquittal passed by <ORG> and in convicting the appellants of the offence of which they were charged In so doing <ORG> did not violate any of the principles governing appeals against acquittal to which our attention was drawn by the appellants counsel from time to time In the result we confirm the judgment of <ORG> and dismiss the appeal
