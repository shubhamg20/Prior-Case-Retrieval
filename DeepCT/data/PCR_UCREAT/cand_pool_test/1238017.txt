The appellant there upon filed a writ petition in <ORG> praying for a writ of mandamns directing the respondent to desist from denying or discontinuing the supply of lubricants and there by save the appellant from being ousted from the business claim for damages from the date the supply was discontinued was also made Before <ORG> it was inter alia contended by the appellant that the correspondent that passed between the appellant and respondent and the invoices issued during the long years of business would show that the respondent always treated the appellant as its agent and distributor sudden stoppage of supply violated the principles of natural jus tice It further averred that there was no concluded contract by the respondent with the appel lant and that the work continued under an adhoc arrangement that the policies of the respondent were governed by the guidelines directions issued to it from time to time by <ORG> whereunder it was no longer possible to give further supplies to the appellant firm The appellant has filed this appeal with special leave It has to be examined in each particular case Having heard counsel for the parties and having considered the facts circumstances and the contentions involved herein we grant special leave and dispose of the appeal by judgment herein This appeal arises out of the judgment and order of <ORG> dated th February It was the case of the appellants before <ORG> and also before this Court that the said firm had been carrying on business as the Lube distrib utor of the respondent company and had been selling all kinds of lubricants filed by them that the firm had been always carrying business as <ORG> of the <ORG> and has been selling all kinds of lubri cants Annexures A to A are copies of the letters written by the <ORG> to the appellants in relation to the dealing of the appellants as <ORG> There are several other documents on which reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants It was contended that there was a change of policy by the respondent company and cer tain documents of the year were relied upon to indicate that the supply of lubricants was stopped to those Associa tions and Dealers to whom ad hoc supplies were given who were merely re sellers traders and who did not have written contracts with the <ORG> It is stated that in the said Product Indent cumDelivery Order there was a note indicating For Condi tions of Supply Please Turnover However in the copies filed with the rejoinder affidavit there are no terms on the reverse side of the Product Indent cum Delivery Order In that background the reliefs mentioned here in before were sought from <ORG> in the application filed under article of the Constitu tion Where in fact there was an actual written agreement the <ORG> contractual relation ship with its distributors was also capable of termination forthwith and was only subject to the normal contractual laws and decisions in the realm of contract could not be the subject matter of proceedings under article of the Constitution it was submitted The conditions of the Proluct Indent cum Delivery Order inter alia categorically provided that <ORG> also reserves the right to cancel your order without any intimation or assigning any reason There was no other contract in the facts and circumstances of the case it was urged They are also bound by the directives to the effect that lubricants are to be sold only to consumers to those parties who will not sell directly or indirectly to foreign oil companies and no sale should take place to old agents or distributor of foreign oil companies All sales of lubricants must take place to actual consumers or to such small parties who will sell actually to consumers and not to foreign oil company There was no assurance whatsoever nor any promise nor any contract or nor any prescribed schedule to supply any quantity of lubricants as alleged to the appel lant or to anybody else It was further asserted in the present case that in view of the ban imposed no fresh distributors could be appointed nor the oil companies empow ered to regularise and contract afresh for dealers distributors in lubricant oils Certain particulars were given how is given and it was stated in the case of four parties the partnership was terminated because of the new policy It was held by <ORG> that for a Writ of mandamus the appellants should have a legal right to enforce the performance of alleged duty by the respondent and since no right was shown to exist by the appellants for selling the continuous supply of the lubricants whatsoever indefinitely for future and no corresponding legal duty was imposed on the respondent to supply the Writ of mandamus was not maintainable We have heard learned counsel Dr <NAME> as well as Mr <NAME> exhaustively The respondent had monopoly in that respect There is no dispute that no intimation was given no notice was given no query or clarification sought for and there was no adjudication as such In a situation of this nature certain activities of the respondent company which consti tuted <ORG> under Article of the Constitution may be in certain circumstances subject to Article of the Constitu tion in entering or not entering into contracts and must be reasonable and taken only upon lawful and relevant consideration it depends upon facts and circumstances of a particular transaction whether heating is necessary and reasons have to be stated In case any right conferred on the citizens which is sought to be interfered such action is subject to Article of the Constitution and must be reasonable and can be taken only upon lawful and relevant grounds of public interest Where there is arbitrariness in <ORG> action of this type of entering or not entering into contracts Article springs up and judicial review strikes such an action down Our attention was drawn to large number of invoices cash memos and to the customer code No allotted to the appellant It was submitted that <ORG> has always treated lube and non lube products on the same basis without dis tinction There is no letter of intent letter of ap pointment much less letter at all Mr <NAME> submitted that in private law field there was no scope for applying the doctrine of arbitrariness or mala fides The validity of the action of the parties have to be tested it was urged on behalf of the respondent on the basis of right and not power It has to be examined in each particular case Mr <NAME> sought to urge that there are certain cases under Article of arbitrary exercise of such power and not cases of exercise of a right arising either under a contract or under a Statute It depends on the nature of the fight involved and nature of the power sought to be exer cised in a particular situation It is true that there is discrimination between power and fight but whether the <ORG> or the instrumentality of a <ORG> has the right to functign in public field or private field is a matter which in our opinion depends upon the facts and circumstances of the situation but such exercise Of power cannot be dealt with by the <ORG> or the instrumentality of the <ORG> without informing and taking into confidence the party whose fights and powers affected or sought to be affected into confi dence Therefore we direct that the case of the respondent be put to the appellants and let the respondent authorities consider afresh the submissions made by the appellant firm namely that the existing arrangement amounts to a contract by which the distributorship was continued in case of the appellant firm without any formal contract and further that the new policy of the <ORG> introduced in December would not cover the appellant firm and as such the appellant should continue Nothing further need be stated or required to be done and we give no directions as to whether reasons should be recorded or hereinafter should be given The Judgment and the Order of <ORG> are there fore set aside and the direction and order as aforesaid are substituted and the application made to <ORG> is disposed of on the aforesaid terms
