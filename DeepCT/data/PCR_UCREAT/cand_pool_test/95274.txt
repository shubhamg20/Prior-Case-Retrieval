Interpretation of a policy of marine insurance entered into by and between the parties herein covering goods in transit is in question in this appeal which arises out of a judgment and order dated th December passed by <ORG> in APO No of whereby and whereunder the appeal preferred by Respondent Insurance Company herein from a judgment and order dated rd December passed in No of passed by a learned Single Judge of the said Court was allowed If owing to circumstances beyond the control of the Assured either the contract of carriage is terminated at a port or place other than the destination named therein or the transit is otherwise terminated before delivery of the goods as provided for in clause above then this insurance shall also terminate unless prompt notice is given to the Underwriters and continuation of cover is requested when the insurance shall remain in force subject to an additional premium if required by the Underwriters either if the goods are forwarded within the said period of days or any agreed extension therein to the destination named herein or to any other destination until terminated in accordance with the provisions of clause above Appellant filed a suit before the original side of <ORG> which was marked as CS No of praying for a decree for a sum of Rs The defendant therefore must be considered to have acquiesced in the continuation of the said policy at any rate it must be taken to have waived the condition prescribed in the said clause So far as Issue No is concerned the learned Judge noticed the definition of constructive total loss as contained in Section of the Marine Insurance Act and opined There is no express provisions to the contrary in the said policy and as such it cannot be disputed that there has been constructive total loss of the said consignment There is evidence on record to show that the cost of bringing down the said consignment to the Calcutta Port from the Singapore Port would be more than it is actual cost see exhibit supra In regard to the correspondences passed between the parties it was opined The conduct of the defendant appellant in this regard clearly indicates that in order to help tracing out the situation the defendant had extended its good office and that too without prejudice There is no pleading or any attempt to prove that the plaintiff or its servant was not privy to the unseaworthiness of the vessel at the time of loading coupled with the termination of the policy and its non extension after the Cargo Safety Construction Certificate and Load Line Certificate expired on th July and on account of plaintiff failure to discharge its obligation either to obtain re shipment of the goods soon thereafter and the failure to take a decision to sell the goods locally immediately and filing of the suit after th August clearly indicates that the claim of the plaintiff was barred by limitation and the suit ought to have been dismissed the plaintiff has not been able to prove that he had taken all steps to avoid the delay the policy was not an all risk policy but was circumscribed and restricted by reason of the Institute Cargo Clause containing the restrictive clauses enumerated in paragraph hereinbefore the plaintiff has not been able to establish its claim by discharging the burden lay upon it to sustain the claim on merit and that the goods were not lost when the claim was lodged the plaintiff has not been able to prove constructive loss by reason of abandonment that by reason of Sections and of the Evidence Act it was proved that the goods were still in existence and were in good condition and that the loss cannot be ascribed to any peril insured as discussed hereinbefore Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of Appellant would submit that <ORG> of <ORG> committed a serious error in arriving at its conclusions insofar as it failed to take into consideration that once the goods were stranded it was covered by the terms of extended insurance policy which would include non delivery for any reason whatsoever Non delivery of goods the learned counsel urged would bring within its fold constructive total loss as there is no serious dispute in regard to the fact that cost of transportation of goods from Singapore to Calcutta was much higher than the actual costs of the goods It was furthermore pointed out that neither any case of applicability of the exclusion clauses was made in the written statement nor any issue was raised In any event in case of an ambiguity a contract of insurance should be construed in favour of the insured Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent on the other hand would submit that Institute Cargo Clause contained restrictive clauses It was submitted that having regard to Sub section of Section of the Marine Insurance Act the insured had a duty to minimize the loss and only in that view of the matter Respondent extended its assistance which cannot be said to be an admission of its liability Having regard to Clause No of the policy it was contended that the contract became terminated and there being no request for continuation of the contract it came to an end in December when it was stranded at Singapore It was further submitted that even if the broad meaning is given to the term stranded the insured having not been deprived of the possession of the goods no loss occurred The questions which arise for consideration before us are i Whether the suit was barred by limitation By letters dated April and October the defendant wrongfully rejected the claim of the plaintiff Plaintiff claim was wrongfully and not maintainable and the same was repudiated by this defendant letters dated April and October It was however stated So that the goods are not sold at the interest of the one consignee alone who has already taken action in <ORG> we would without prejudice strongly recommend in your interest that action be taken by you as consignees and owners of the goods in proper Court at Kuala Lumpur to compel the shipowners to complete the voyage and meantime restraint order should also be secured to protect your interest as well alongwith the other interested Consignee so that no single or arbitrary action is taken by the Court jeopardizing your other consignee interest We may here draw your attention that in terms of the Loss Minimisation Clause in the Policy you are in duty bound to see that all protective measures are taken adequately against Carriers But it is one thing to say that the claim was barred by limitation or the exclusionary clauses would apply but it is another thing to say that the question of invoking the said clause did not arise in terms of the contract of insurance The expression without prejudice may have to be construed in the context in which it is used Finally if a party comes into possession of a privileged document subject to equitable relief for breach of confidence there is no reason why he should not use it and it will be admissible in evidence The converse is that there are some circumstances in which the words are used but where the documents do not attract without prejudice privilege The most obvious cases are first where the party writing was not involved in genuine settlement negotiations and secondly where although the words were used they were used in circumstances which had nothing to do with negotiations Surveyors reports for example are sometimes headed without prejudice although they have nothing to do with negotiations The third case is where the words are used in a completely different sense There are circumstances in which the correspondence is initiated with a view to settlement but the parties do not intend that the correspondence should be without prejudice There is no easy rule here There are authorities in both directions on this and it will depend on the facts There is no reason why every letter for which without prejudice is claimed should contain an offer or consideration of an offer so long as the without prejudice correspondence is part of a body of negotiation correspondence It will bear repetition to state that the vessel could not proceed from Singapore owing to its unseaworthiness It was thus covered by the terms of the extended terms of insurance policy Findings of fact were arrived at by the learned Single Judge on the basis of the pleadings of the parties Subject to any express provision in the policy there is a constructive total loss where the subject matter insured is reasonably abandoned on account of its actual total loss appearing to be unavoidable or because it could not be preserved from actual total loss without an expenditure which would exceed its value when the expenditure had been incurred In particular there is a constructive total loss i where the assured is deprived of the possession of his ship or goods by a peril insured against and a it is unlikely that he can recover the ship or goods as the case may be or the cost of recovering the ship or goods as the case may be would exceed their value when recovered or ii in the case of damage to a ship where she is so damaged by a peril insured against that the cost of repairing the damage would exceed the value of the ship when repaired It was stated SCC para If we give the defined meaning to the expression management occurring in Section of the Act it would mean <ORG> is required to apply to itself for grant of permission to set up a government medical college through the <ORG> We in a case of this nature have to give effect to the terms of insurance In particular there is a constructive total loss where the assured is deprived of the possession of his ship or goods by a peril insured against and a it is unlikely that he can recover the ship or goods as the case may be or the cost of recovering the ship or goods as the case may be would exceed their value when recovered The likelihood of recovery must be judged in the light of the probabilities as they would have appeared to a reasonable assured at the moment when he knew of his loss and could have given notice of abandonment towards the consignment of logs measuring CBM under the and US is still payable to the shipper against the documents for Logs measuring CBM received under the A Thus there is a loss of around over lakhs while disposing the entire consignment in Singapore When the entire case is based on a construction of insurance policy the question of adduction of any oral evidence would be irrelevant particularly when the learned Single Judge gave due credit of the amount received on auction of the goods under the orders of <ORG> Thus whatever has been recovered by way of sale of the said logs the same has to be credited for and Appellant should be held entitled only to the balance amount This leaves us to the question as to whether the exclusionary clauses contained in the insurance policy are attracted Neither any issue has been raised nor any evidence has been adduced in this behalf For the reasons aforementioned the appeal is allowed and the impugned judgment of <ORG> is set aside and the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge is restored Appellant shall be entitled to costs throughout Counsel fees in this appeal assessed at Rs
