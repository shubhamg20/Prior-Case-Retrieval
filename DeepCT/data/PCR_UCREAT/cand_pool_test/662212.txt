The order of reversion has adversely affected their rights and hence without giving them an opportunity to show cause such an order could not have been passed From the side of the respondents it has been averred in the counter affidavit that the resolutions passed by <ORG> on and were not approved by <ORG> By means of its order dated <ORG> was directed to stop the follow up action with regard to the resolutions passed in the aforesaid meetings till further orders and <ORG> was directed to forward those resolutions to <ORG> for approval Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn the attention of this Court to the contents of the said direction issued by <ORG> wherein it was indicated that <ORG> had taken such a decision pertaining to the service conditions of its employees which was beyond the jurisdiction of <ORG> and the provisions contained in the Regulations The contention of Mr <NAME> appears to be that that direction was confined to the provisions contained in Section only The <ORG> may appoint such officers and servants as it considers necessary for efficient performance of its functions on such terms and conditions as may be provided for in regulations made by the <ORG> From a perusal of the entire direction issued by <ORG> it appears that <ORG> had raised objections about the resolutions passed by <ORG> in its meetings dated and which were beyond the powers of <ORG> and the same could not be done without relaxing the provisions of the Act In view of the aforesaid situation it cannot be said that the direction of <ORG> was confined only to the extent what is provided under sub section of Section of the Act Now it has to be seen as to whether <ORG> has been vested with any power to issue such directions to the Mandi Parlshad or not Section of the Act which provides for the power of <ORG> to issue directions is reproduced below In the discharge of its functions the Board shall be guided by such directions on question of policy as may be given to it by <ORG> If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter in respect of which <ORG> may issue a direction under subsection the decision of <ORG> shall be final Mr <NAME> contended that <ORG> is undoubtedly vested with power to issue directions but that direction should pertain only to the policy and not to the powers of the <ORG> to make appointments Section of the Act deals with the powers and functions of the <ORG> which is exhaustive in nature by vesting several powers to the <ORG> but Section is silent on the question as to whether the <ORG> has been vested with a power to increase the strength of the staff or not Does it mean that the <ORG> has an unfettered right to appoint as much people as it desires without any consideration of resources available to it We are of the view that as the Act does not vest to the <ORG> any power to increase the strength of the staff while increasing the strength of the staff the income and the resources of the <ORG> must have to be taken into account but unfortunately that was not done It is matter of policy and <ORG> has been vested with a power under Section of the Act to issue such a direction There is another aspect of the matter that In these writ petitions that direction of the <ORG> Government has not been assailed AIR SC wherein it has been indicated that if the appointment has been cancelled then it is incumbent upon the authority passing such ah order to give opportunity to the person against whom such an order was passed and to give a finding whether the appointments were validly made Regulation of the Regulations which provides for the procedure for recruitment of classes A and posts is reproduced below The appointing authority shall determine the number of vacancies in all the classes A and to be filled during the course of the year as also the number of vacancies to be reserved for candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes and other categories under Regulation The Committee shall having regard to the need for securing due representation of the candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes and other Categories in accordance with Regulation call the eligible candidates for test and or Interview as it may decide The committee shall prepare list of candidates in order of merit as disclosed by the marks obtained In the test and or interview The names of the candidates belonging to such categories for whom vacancies are required to be reserved under Regulation shall be arranged in a separate list according to their inter se merit disclosed by the marks obtained by them The appointing authority shall prepare an eligibility list of the candidates arranged in order of seniority and place it before <ORG> along with their character and other necessary records pertaining to them <ORG> shall consider the cases of the candidates on the basis of records referred to in sub regulation and if it considers necessary may Interview the candidates also In the light of these facts <ORG> observed Since the order of confirmation of the appellant was made in violation of the injunction order the mistake committed in passing the order of confirmation was correct In our view in such circumstances the appellant was not required to be given any opportunity of being heard for correcting such mistake because there was no occasion to take one view or the other in the matter of correction of the said mistake on the basis of the representation to be made by the appellant The finding of the <ORG> that the impugned order of termination was passed without any stigma and not as a punitive measure has been upheld by <ORG> and we find no justification in taking a contrary view simply because the appellant was a President of <ORG> at Kanpur and according to him The <ORG> or Tribunal Is devoid of power to give such direction Since the order of their promotion as a stop gap arrangement to the posts of Assistant Engineers was made in violation of the service regulations the Illegality committed in passing the order of promotion has only been corrected by means of the impugned orders The action of the Director of <ORG> who has passed the impugned orders cannot be faulted because he was bound to follow the direction of the State Government as contained in Section of the Act The State Government has the power to issue such directions under the Uttar Pradesh State Control Over Public Corporation Act Power to issue directions to the statutory bodies as re enacted and amended by the Uttar Pradesh Universities Re enactment and Amendment Act shall in the discharge of its functions be guided by such directions on questions of policies as may be given to it by <ORG> notwithstanding that no such power has expressly been conferred on <ORG> under the law establishing or constituting such statutory body If any question arises whether any matter is or is not a matter as respects which <ORG> may issue a direction under subsection the decision of <ORG> shall be final Therefore it cannot be said that the impugned orders suffer from any infirmity or illegality
