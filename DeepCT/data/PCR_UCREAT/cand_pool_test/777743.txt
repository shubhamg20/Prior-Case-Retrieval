<ORG> passed the Sugarcane Cess Act which authorised <ORG> to impose a cess on the entry of cane into the premises of a factory for use consumption or sale therein The proper meaning to be attached to the words local area in Entry was an area administered by a local body like a municipality a district board a local board a union board a <ORG> or the like Appeal from the judgment and decree dated October of <ORG> in Writ Petition No of Section of this Act gave to the Governor of the power to impose by notification a cess not exceeding annas per maund on the entry of sugarcane into an area specified in such notification for consumption use or sale therein This Act it may be mentioned had taken the place of an earlier Act the Sugar Factories Control Act of which authorised the Governor of to impose by a notification after consultation with <ORG> under the Act a cess not exceeding per cent of the minimum price if any fixed under or annas per maund whichever was higher on the entry of sugarcane into a local area specified in such notification for consumption use or sale therein The first notification under the provisions of of the Act was in these terms In exercise of the powers conferred by sub section of section of Uttar Pradesh Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Act The appellant contended on various grounds that of Act XXIV of was unconstitutional and invalid and prayed for the issue of appropriate writs directing the respondents the State of and the Collector of Gorakhpur not to levy and collect cess on account of the arrears of cess for the crushing season and in respect of the crushing season and successive crushing seasons and to withdraw the notifications dated October and November which have been mentioned above There is a later amendment by which the words four annas have been altered to twenty five naye paise and the words <ORG> have been added after the words factory in sub section Without prejudice to the general application of section of the General Clauses Act every notification imposing cess issued and every assessment made including the amount of cess collected under or in pursuance of any such notification shall be deemed a notification issued assess ment made and cess collected under this Act as if sections and to had been in force at all material dates It also prayed for the issue of a writ in the nature of mandamus directing the respondents not to levy cess upon the petitioners appellants under this new Act the Sugarcane Cess Act One is that the law was invalid being beyond the legislative competence of the State legislature the other is that in any case the provision giving the Governor power to levy any cess not exceeding annas without providing for any guidance as to the fixation of the particular rate amounted to excessive delegation and was accordingly invalid It is quite clear that there is no other entry in either the State List or the Concurrent List under which the legislation could have been made In considering the meaning of the words local area in entry we have on the one hand to bear in mind the salutary rule that words conferring the right of legislation should be interpreted liberally and the powers conferred should be given the widest amplitude on the other hand we have to guard ourselves against extending the meaning of the words beyond their reasonable connotation in an anxiety to preserve the power of the legislature In Re the Central Provinces Berar Act No XI of Sir <NAME> observed I conceive that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret it but I do not imply by this that they are free to stretch or pervert the language of the enactment in the interests of any legal or constitutional theory or even for the purpose of correcting any supposed errors liberal construction should be put upon the words so that the same may have effect in their widest amplitude But if there is any difficulty in ascertaining the limits the difficulty must be resolved so far as possible in favour of the legislative body Nor can we derive any assistance from the judicial interpretation of the words local area as used in the Code of Criminal Procedure or other Acts like Bengal Tenancy Act as these interpretations were made with reference to the scope of the legislation in which the phrase occurs What they say as regards the meaning of the word local offers no guidance except that it is clear that the word local has different meanings in different contexts The use of the words local area instead of the word area cannot but be due to the intention of the Constitution makers to make sure that the power to make laws relating to levy on entry of goods would not extend to cases of entry of goods into any and every part of the state from outside that part but only to entry from outside into such portions of the state as satisfied the description of local area Something definite was sought to be expressed by the use of the word local before the word area The question is what exactly was sought to be expressed In finding an answer to the question it is legitimate to turn to the previous history of constitutional legislation in the country on this subject of giving power to legislature to levy tax on the entry of goods Under clause a of the third sub section of this section the local legislature of any province has with the previous sanction of the Governor General power to make or take into consideration any law imposing or authorising the imposition of any new tax unless the tax was a tax scheduled as exempted from this provision by rules made under the Act The third of the Rules that were made in this matter under Notification No dated December provided that the legislative council of a province may without the previous sanction of the Governor General make and take into consideration any law imposing or authorising a local authority to impose for the purpose of such local authority any tax included in Schedule II of the Rules Schedule II contained items of which items and were in these words A terminal tax on goods imported into or exported from a local area save where such tax is first imposed in a local area in which an octroi was levied on or before July According to <ORG> octroi is an indirect or consumption tax levied by a local political unit normally the commune or municipal authority on certain categories of goods on their entry into its area Bearing in mind this characteristic of octroi duty we find on an examination of items and of the Schedule Rules mentioned above that under the Government of India Act the local legislature of a Province could without the previous sanction of the Governor General impose a tax octroi for entry of goods into an area administered by a local body that is a local government authority and the area in respect of which such tax could be imposed was mentioned in item as local area Here the word octroi has given place to the longer phrase cesses on the entry of goods into a local area for consumption use or sale therein That Article is in these words Any taxes duties cesses or fees which immediately before the commencement of this Constitution were being lawfully levied by the Government of any <ORG> or by any municipality or other local authority or body for the purposes of the <ORG> municipality district or other local area may notwithstanding that these taxes duties cesses or fees are mentioned in the Union List continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by <ORG> by law There can be little doubt that local area in this Article has been used to indicate an area in respect of which there is an authority administering it That section as we have already mentioned authorised the Governor of to impose by a notification after consulting <ORG> under the Act a cess on the entry of sugarcane into a local area specified in such notification for consumption use or sale therein He appears to have accepted the contention that the word local area was used in the sense of an administrative unit but says he the administration need not be political it may be industrial and educational or it may take any other form of governmental activity It is true that when words and phrases previously interpreted by the courts are used by the <ORG> in a later enactment replacing the previous statute there is a presumption that the <ORG> intended to convey by their use the same meaning which the courts had already given to them We are of opinion that the proper meaning to be attached to the words local area in Entry of the Constitution when the area is a part of the <ORG> imposing the law is an area administered by a local body like a municipality a district board a local board a union board a <ORG> or the like As there is no other Entry in either <ORG> List or Concurrent List in which the impugned law could fall there is no escape from the conclusion that this law was beyond the legislative competence of the <ORG> Legislature As the law enacted by the <ORG> stands there is no escape from the conclusion that this entire law must be struck down as invalid In view of this conclusion on the first ground raised on behalf of the appellant it is unnecessary to consider the other ground raised in the appeal that section has gone beyond the permissible limits of delegated legislation We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the order passed by the High <ORG> and order the issue of a writ directing that the respondents do forbear from levying and collecting cess from the appellants on account of arrears of cess for the crushing season and in respect of the crushing season and successive crushing seasons under the Sugarcane Cess Act The appellants will get their costs here and below In my opinion this construction of the expression local area in entry does not automatically result in the invalidity of the impugned enactment and of the levy under it but the extent to which if any the charging section exceeds the power conferred by the entry would depend on matters which have not been the subject of investigation and it is this point that I shall elaborate in the rest of this judgment It is unnecessary for the purposes of this case and possibly even irrelevant to determine the precise scope content and incidents of an octroi duty except that in the context in which it appeared in the Scheduled Taxes Rules framed tinder the Government of India Act the expression signified a tax levied on entry into an area of an unit of local administration It is the second and the third of the above features that call for a more detailed examination in the context of the points requiring decision in the present case I will read that section which runs Leaving the Explanation for the present there are two matters which require advertence The first was the point emphasised by Mr <NAME> for the appellant that entry into the premises of a factory for the purpose of consumption use or sale therein is fastened on as the taxable event treating the factory premises as if that were itself a local area The tax might be levied and collected at the border of the Panchayat area but there is no legal obligation to do so and the place at which the entry of the goods is checked and the duty realised is a matter of administrative machinery which does not touch on the validity of the tax imposition The language of as it stands appears however also to extend to cases where the supply of cane to a factory is from within the same local unit of administration in other words where there is no entry of the cane into the local area as explained earlier In my judgment this is not an objection that should stand in the way of the <ORG> giving effect to a view of the law if that should appear to be the correct one The question is whether the implication of these words would be a rewriting of the provision or whether it would be merely reading the existing provision so as to confine it to the powers conferred upon <ORG> by the relevant legislative entry In view of the strong opinion entertained by my learned brethren I have given the matter the utmost consideration but I feel that the words which I have suggested are a permissible mode of construction of a statute by which wide words of an enactment which would cover an event contingency or matter within legislative power as well as matters not within it are read as confined to those which the law making only had authority to enact The contention urged before the <ORG> was that by the use of the expression property the legislature had evinced an intention to deal with property of every type and that it would be rewriting the enactment and not carrying out the legislative intent if the reference to property in the statute were read as property other than agricultural property Dealing with this contention Sir <NAME> delivering the opinion of the <ORG> said No doubt if the Act does affect agricultural land in the Governors Provinces it was beyond the competence of the <ORG> to enact it and whether or not it does so must depend upon the meaning which is to be given to the word property in the Act The learned Chief Justice observed <ORG> construed the expression personal estate occurring in the statute to refer only to such personal estate as the colonial grant of probate conferred jurisdiction on the personal representatives to administer whatever the domicile of the testator might be that is to say personal estate situate within the Colony in respect of which alone <ORG> had power to grant probate Their Lordships thought that in imposing a duty of this nature <ORG> also was contemplating the property which was under its own hand and did not intend to levy a tax in respect of property A The matter not having been considered from this aspect at earlier stages we have necessarily no material before us for adjudicating upon whether tax levied or demanded from the appellant is due and if so to what extent We have nothing before us to indicate as to how far the cane the entry of which into the factory of the appellant is the subject of the impugned levy has moved into the factory from outside the local unit in which the factory is situated or originated from within the same local area There is one matter to which it is necessary to Per Sir Maurice Gwyer A I would accordingly allow the appeal and remand it to <ORG> for investigating the material facts which I have mentioned earlier with a direction to pass judgment in accordance with the law as above explained In accordance with the opinion of the majority the appeal is allowed the order passed by <ORG> is set aside and a writ be issued directing that the respondents do forbear from levying and collecting cess from the appellants on account of arrears of cess for the crushing season and successive crushing seasons under the Uttar Pradesh Sugarcane Cess Act The appellants will get their costs here and below
