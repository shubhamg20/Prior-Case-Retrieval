Vs RESPONDENT EMPLOYEES STATE INSURANCE CORPORATION DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> JAGANMOHAN BENCH <NAME> JAGANMOHAN VAIDYIALINGAM A CITATION AIR SCR SCC ACT Employees State Insurance Act Power to prescribe by rules the procedure to be followed in proceedings before the court If includes power to prescribe period of limitation for claims under HEADNOTE In exercise of the power conferred by of the Employees State Insurance Act to Prescribe by rule the procedure to be followed in proceedings before <ORG> the State <ORG> made prescribing a period of limitation of twelve months for every application to the Court The appellant took the plea that the application was barred as it was not presented within the period prescribed <ORG> on a reference held that did not grant power to <ORG> to make a rule prescribing a period of limitation on claims enumerated in and therefore was ultra vires the rule making power under On the question whether the power to prescribe a period of limitation for initiating proceedings before the court is a part of and is included in the power to prescribe the procedure to be followed in proceedings before such courts HELD The power under does not empower the government to prescribe by rule a period of limitation for claims under The object of the statutes of limitation is to compel a person to exercise his right to take action within a reasonable time as also to discourage and suppress stale fake and fraudulent claims While this is so there are two aspects of the statutes of limitation the one concerns the extinguishment of the right if a claim or action is not commenced within a particular time the other merely bars the claim without affecting the right which either remains merely a moral obligation or can be availed of to furnish the consideration for fresh enforceable obligation Where a statute prescribing limitation extinguishes the right it affects substantive rights while that which purely pertains to the commencement of action without touching the right is procedural There is therefore no clear cut division between the two ii There is difference between the manner in which jurisprudential lawyersconsider the question and the way in which judges view the matter The safest course would be to examine each case on its own facts and circumstances and determine for in stance whether it affects substantive rights and extinguishes them whether it merely concerns a procedural rule only dealing with remedies whether the intendment to Prescribe limitation is discernible in the scheme of the Act or whether it is inconsistent with the rule making power iii Apart from the implications inherent in the term Procedure appearing in the word in furnishes a clue to the controversy that the procedure must be in relation to the proceedings in court after it has taken seisin of the matter If any such steps are proposed to be taken by the <ORG> and the employee is aggrieved he has a right to file and apply to <ORG> and have his claim adjudicated by it in the same way as the <ORG> can prefer a claim in a case where the liability to pay is disputed Where the legislature clearly intends to provide specifically the period of limitation in respect of claims arising thereunder it cannot be considered to have left such matters in respect of claim under some similar provisions to be provided for by the rules to be made by government under its delegated powers to prescribe the procedure to be followed in proceedings before such court The section only requires <ORG> to follow such procedure as may be prescribed by rules made by the State <ORG> Appeal from the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> in Civil Reference No of of the Employees State Insurance Act hereinafter referred to as the Act relating to the procedure to be followed in proceedings before such Courts and the execution of orders made by such Courts <ORG> made the following Rule Limitation Every application to the Court shall be brought within twelve months from the date on which the cause of action arose or as the case may be the claim became due Provided that the Court may entertain an application after the said period of twelve months if it is satisfied that the applicant had sufficient reasons for not making the application within the said period In those proceedings the Appellant had taken the plea that the application was barred under Rule as it was not presented within twelve months from the date when the cause of action arose or as the case may be when the amount became due before it held that the clear and unambiguous terms of exclude the grant of the power to any State Government to make a rule prescribing a period of limitation on claims ennumerated in Sec were possible that interpretation should be accepted which excludes the grant of such a power because it appeared to it clear from the scheme of the Act and the provisos thereof that the legislature did not intend to confer such power on the State Governments It therefore answered the first question in affirmative namely that Rule is ultra vires the rule making power of the State Government under See This appeal has been filed against that decision by certificate under Art All the High Courts in these cases except that of Allahabad held that the rule is ultra vires the powers conferred on the State Government under Sec inasmuch as it is not empowered to make rules prescribing periods of limitation for applications to be filed before the Court though in Madhya Pradesh case it was also said that Even if it be taken that clause of Sec as it is worded is wide enough to cover a rule of limitation that cannot authorize the Government to frame a rule regulating limitation for the recovery of contributions because according to it the validity of the rule does not necessarily depend on the ascertainment of whether it confers rights or merely regulates procedure but by determining whether it is in conformity with the powers conferred by the statute and whether it is consistent with the provisions of the statute These decisions also held that the scheme of the Act was such that the <ORG> did not and could not have intended to confer any power upon <ORG> to make rules prescribing a period of limitation for application under Sec The question which directly confronts us is whether the power to prescribe periods of limitation for initiating proceedings before the <ORG> is a part of and is included in the power to prescribe the procedure to be followed in proceedings before such <ORG>s If it is procedural law does it make any difference whether it relates to the time of filing application for initiation of proceedings before the <ORG> or whether it relates to interlocutory applications or other statements filed before it after the initiation of such pro ceedings There is also it is submitted no indication in the scheme of the Act that it is otherwise or that there is any impediment for the Government to prescribe under the rule making authority the period of limitation for applications under Sec The topic of procedure has been the subject of academic de bate and scrutiny as well as of judicial decisions over a long period but in spite of it it has defied the formulation of a logical test or definition which enables us to determine and demarcate the bounds where procedural law ends and substantive law begins or in other words it hardly facilitates us in distinguishing in a given case whether the subject of controversy concerns procedural law or substantive law Apart from Legislative action prescribing the time there is no period of limitation recognised under the general law and therefore any time fixed by the statute is neces XLV Harvard Law Journal A statute prescribing limitation however does not confer a right of action nor speaking generally does it confer on a person a right to relief which has been barred by eflux of time prescribed by the law The principle which forms the basis of this rule is expressed in the maxim vigilantibus non dormientibus jura subveniunt the laws give help to those who are watchful and not to those who sleep While this is so there are two aspects of the statutes of limitation the one concerns the extinguishment of the right if a claim or action is not commenced with a particular time and the other merely bars the claim without affecting the right which either remains merely as a moral obligation or can be availed of to furnish the consideration for a fresh enforceable obligation Where a statute prescribing the limitation extinguishes the right it affects substantive rights while that which purely pertains to the commencement of action without touching the right is said to be procedural It may be stated that much water has flown under the bridges since the original English theory justifying a statute of limitation on the ground that a debt long overdue was pre sumed to have been paid and discharged or that such statutes are merely procedural Historically there was a period when substantive law was inextricably intermixed with procedure at a later period procedural law seems to have reigned supreme when forms of action ruled There is therefore no clear cut division between the two to make rules in respect of procedure it confers upon it also the rights to prescribe limitation In truth it has become almost an axiom in jurisprudence that is law of prescription or law of limitation which is meant by that denomination is a law relating to procedure having reference only to the lex fori There were earlier decisions of <ORG> and <ORG> as also a decision of <ORG> rendered under Sec referred to by <NAME> in his referring order in <NAME> case which took the view that <ORG> has riot the power by rule under Sec Again a similar question arose as to whether clause of the Letters Patent of the Lahore High <ORG> there are similar clauses in the Letters Patent of the other <ORG> could validly empower the making of rule prescribing a period for filing an appeal under Clause of the Letters Patent Clause of the Letters Patent empowered <ORG> from time to time to make rules and orders for regulating the practice of the <ORG> etc As the said rule is a law made in respect of special cases covered by it it would certainly be a special law within the meaning of of the Limitation Act These cases are of little assistance and if at all they lay down the principle that interlocutory proceedings before the <ORG> do not deal with substantive rights and are concerned with mere procedure and can be dealt with by rules made under the powers conferred on <ORG> to regulate the procedure It appears to us that there is a difference between the manner in which the jurisprudential lawyers consider the question and the way in which the Judges view the matter Instead of generalising on a principal the safest course would IV to examine each case on its own facts and circumstances and determine for instance whether it affects substantive rights and extinguishes them or whether it merely concerns a procedural rule only dealing with remedies or whether the intendment to prescribe limitation is discernible from the scheme of the Act or is inconsistent with the rule making power etc Apart from the implications inherent in the term procedure appearing in Sec the power to prescribe by rules any matter falling within the ambit of the term must be the Procedure to be followed in proceedings be fore such <ORG> The word in emphasised by us furnishes a clue to the controversy that the procedure must be in relation to proceedings in <ORG> after it has taken decision of the matter which obviously it takes when moved by an application presented before it It was observed by <NAME> at page The distinction between the extinction of a right and the extinction of a remedy for the enforcement of that right though fine is of great importance It is hardly necessary to add that once the liability is extinguished under this clause there is no scope of any acknowledgement of liability thereafter the amounts specified in that Section as an arrear of land revenue prescribes the period within which an appeal should be filed against the order of <ORG> If any such steps are proposed to be taken by the <ORG> and the employer is aggrieved he has a right to file and apply to <ORG> and have his claim adjudicated by it in the same way as the <ORG> can prefer a claim in a case where the liability to pay is disputed It is clear therefore that the right of the <ORG> to recover these amounts by coercive process is not restricted by any limitation nor could the <ORG> by recourse to the rule making power prescribe a period in the teeth of Sec While this is so there is also no impediment for the <ORG> itself to apply to <ORG> to determine a dispute against an employer where it is satisfied that such a dispute exists such fee if any that may be prescribed by rules made by the State <ORG> in consultation with the <ORG> This was probably an appropriate provision in which the legislature if it had intended to prescribe a time for such applications could have provided Be that as it may in our view the omission to provide a period of limitation in any of these provisions while providing for a limitation of a claim by an employee for the payment of any benefit under the regulations shows clearly that the legis lature did not intend to fetter the claim under Sec It appears to us that where the legislature clearly intends to pro vide specifically the period of limitation in respect of claims arising thereunder it cannot be considered to have left such matters in respect of claims under some similar provisions to be provided for by the rules to be made by the <ORG> under its delegated powers to prescribe the procedure to be What is sought to be conferred is the power to make rules for regulating the procedure before <ORG> after an application has been filed and when it is seized of the matter There is no gain saying the fact that if an employee does not file an application before <ORG> within months after the claim has become due or he is unable to satisfy <ORG> that there was a reasonable excuse for him in not doing so his right to receive payment of any benefit conferred by the Act is lost It was pointed out that in the Constitution also where <ORG> was authorised with the approval of the President to make rules for regulating generally the practice and procedure of the <ORG> a specific power was given to it by Art The view taken by <ORG> Madras Punjab and Andhra Pradesh High <ORG>s in the cases already referred to are in consonance with the view we have taken In the latest case <ORG> also following the earlier decision of Madhya Pradesh Madras and Punjab held that the State Government had exceeded its powers to frame Rule as no such power to prescribe limitation under the provisions of Sec does not delegate any power to the Government to make rules but only requires <ORG> to follow such pro cedure as may be prescribed by rules made by <ORG> which rules can only be made under Sec See A provides that Every such application shall be made within a period of three years from the date on which the cause of action arose In the result this appeal is dismissed with costs
