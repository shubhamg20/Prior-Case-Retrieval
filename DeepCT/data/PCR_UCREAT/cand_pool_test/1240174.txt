The court decides forensic questions without getting embroiled in nonlegal disputes working as it does in a sound proof system of sorts The offence of corrupt practice of the Representation of the People Act may be light or grave which is for the Bench which hears the appeal In extensor to hold one way or the other It was for the first time in by amending Act LXVII of that a statutory right of appeal to the Supreme <ORG> was created by A of the Representation of the People Act and a plenary power to grant stay conditional or otherwise was vested in this <ORG> of the Act independently of constitutional remedies The question of an absolute stay or a qualified stay of the unseating verdict did not and could not arise under the pre law and to rely upon past precedents as tantamount to absolute stay of an order which took effect would be untenable In short the restraints set out in the usual stay order cannot and will not detract from the appellant being entitled to exercise such rights as she has including addressing <ORG> and drawing salary in her capacity as Prime Minister The court gave liberty to the parties to move a Division Bench of this <ORG> if justifying considerations appeared necessary later on to move for variations of the conditions of the instant stay order JUDGMENT CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No of and Civil Misc The appellant has moved this Court challenging the unseating verdict against her by <ORG> Although I listened at some length to these arguments and to an extent to the counter submissions made by <NAME> in his endeavour to establish that the holdings were sound I made it fairly clear in the course of the hearing that at this stage when I was considering whether a stay should be granted or not it was premature and perhaps unwise to pronounce on the merits of the appeal itself except where the judgment contained grotesque errors absurd conclusions or grossly erroneous propositions of law Having considered the submissions on this basis I do not think I should express any opinion way or the other on the merits of the findings Leaving aside the injury to private rights as of lesser consequence in election disputes let me look at the customary factors courts are prone to probe in stay matters where the discretion vests in court There was reference at the bar to political compulsions like the swell of the tidal wave in favour of the petitioner which even if true though controverted by the other side cannot breach the legal dykes to force a stay where precedentially it has not been granted May be there is some force in the plea that there should be a stay of operation of the judgment and order in such manner that upsetting the <ORG> in office should be obviated Orders to take effect only on publication An order of the Tribunal under section or section shall not take effect until it is published in <ORG> under section Indeed there was no right of appeal provided in the Act and the aggrieved parties had to approach <ORG> or <ORG> under the provisions of the Constitution To relyupon orders passed under the then law merely staying publication of theorder of the <ORG> in the <ORG> as tantamount to absolute stay ofan order which took effect would be untenable In a major change in the law was made wherebythe order of <ORG> appointed under shall take effect as soon as it is pronounced by the <ORG> vide as amended by Act XXVII of By the same amending Act an appeal was provided from orders of Election <ORG>s to <ORG> and A clothed <ORG> with power to stay operation of the order appealed from and if stay was granted the order shall be deemed never to have taken offect Where an appeal has been preferred against an order made under section or section <ORG> may on sufficient cause being shown and on such terms and conditions as it may think fit stay the operation of the order appealed from Today there is no case of prohibition of publication in the <ORG> For if the disqualification under A operates and he ceases to be a Member there is no need to veto his drawing remuneration voting or participating in the proceedings Can the <ORG> without stultifying itself and usurping power permit a non Member to sit in the <ORG> instead of or even in the Visitor gallery unless it necessarily reads into the order of stay of judgment a suspension of the disqualification also There are a number of other privileges for a Member of <ORG> which are left untouched by this <ORG> prior stay orders I have no doubt that the reasonable effect of a stay order is that there is a plenary eclipse of the High <ORG> judgment and order during the pendency of the appeal subject to the few restraints clamped down on an appellant and are illustrative In short the restrictions set out in the usual stay order cannot and win not detract from the appellant being entitled to exercise such rights as she has including addressing <ORG> and drawing salary in her capacity as Prime Minister It is true that between an absolute stay as sought and the stay as granted there is practically little difference when the petitioner is a Minister Independently of the restrictions under para III on her Membership of <ORG> her rights as Prime Minister or Minister so long as she fills that office to speak in and otherwise to take part in the proceedings of either <ORG> or a joint sitting of the <ORG> without right to vote and to discharge other functions such as are laid down in Articles etc If new events like the convening of <ORG> take place or fresh considerations crop up warranting the review of the restrictions in this stay order the petitioner appellant will be at liberty to move <ORG> of this Court again to modify the restrictions or pray for an unconditional stay
