<ORG> however has refused to regularise their services instead they took steps for direct recruitment This appeal has been preferred against the order of <ORG> denying the interim relief to the appellants In one of those cases <ORG> has directed the to publish the result of the direct recruitment and in another case it appears that <ORG> has issued an order staying the direct recruitment It appears that they were allowed to appear before the <ORG> for direct recruitment and in that process of them were selected by the <ORG> for direct recruitment but they could not also be regularly appointed in view of the stay order of <ORG> If the direct recruitment takes place on one hand and substituted teachers are also directed to be regularised subsequently it would create an enormous problem for the department to accommodate both the categories of persons Having heard counsel on both sides it appears to as that it is necessary to make the following order to avoid further litigation and also to avoid seemingly conflicting interim orders issued by <ORG> If there are additional vacancies in addition to those which are being occupied by the substituted ad hoc teachers they may straightway be appointed against those vacancies and the remaining if any may be appointed after the <ORG> completes the process of selection of substituted ad hoc teachers for regularisation depending upon the vacancy position
