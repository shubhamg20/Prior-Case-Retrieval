The learned Sessions Judge acquitted both the appellants since in his opinion the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution suffered from serious infirmities and did not bring home the offence against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt The State preferred an appeal against the acquittal of the appellants to <ORG> Goa The learned Additional Judicial Commissioner who heard the appeal disagreed with the view taken by the learned Sessions Judge reversing the acquittal of the appellants convicted them of the offence under Section read with Section of the Indian Penal Code for intentionally causing the death of the deceased and sentenced each of them to suffer imprisonment for life The prosecution case against the appellants was that the incident which took place on th October resulting in the death of the deceased was the culmination of a long standing feud between the deceased and the members of his family on the one side and almost the entire village of Canenguinim on the other The conflict centered round a plot of land adjoining the property of <ORG> and though the plot was in the actual possession of the deceased and the members of his family a claim was made to it on behalf of the <ORG> and the rest of the villagers were supporting the claim of the <ORG> There were various incidents of violence between the two groups since and there were complaints and cross complaints resulting in prosecutions of persons belonging to both groups <NAME> took all of them to the place where the dead body was lying and after leaving them to guard the dead body he came home with <NAME> and then after leaving <NAME> at home he proceeded to Quepem for the purpose of lodging the first information report The first information report was taken down by <NAME> and he immediately thereafter started the investigation The trial ended in the acquittal of the appellants but on appeal the acquittal was reversed and the appellants were convicted under Section read with Section and sentenced to suffer life imprisonment We will presently examine first the evidence but before we do so we must point out that this is a case where the acquittal of the appellants by the learned Sessions Judge has been reversed by the learned Additional Judicial Commissioner It is now well settled that though the appellate court has the same powers as <ORG> of appreciating evidence and coming to its own conclusion on questions of fact it should not interfere with an acquittal unless it finds that the view taken by <ORG> is unreasonable or perverse There are several contradictions from which his evidence suffers such as who had which weapon but it is not merely on account of these contradictions of a minor character that we are inclined to reject his evidence There are serious infirmities affecting his evidence and of them the most important is that he is supposed to have given the name of appellant No as the assailant of the deceased even though he had never seen him before the date of the incident Now if this witness had never seen appellant No before it is impossible to understand how he could give his name as the assailant of the deceased when he met <NAME> on the way to the village It shows that he had been prevailed upon by the prosecution to falsely implicate appellant No and if his evidence in regard to the presence of appellant No cannot be accepted it must react adversely against his evidence in regard also to appellant No There is also one other contradiction of a serious nature in the evidence of <NAME> When <NAME> was confronted with this statement made by him in the committal court he first refused to admit that he had made such a statement but then he accepted it <NAME> did not know where the offence had been committed nor did he know where the dead body was lying and he must therefore naturally have taken some time before he could discover the place where the dead body of the deceased had been draged by the appellants <NAME> must have therefore taken at least minutes to reach the place where the dead body of the deceased was lying This story narrated by <NAME> is wholly improbable and has been introduced in order to strengthen the prosecution case which otherwise would have to depend only on the evidence of the child witness <NAME> This is a rather important contradiction because if what <NAME> stated in his first information report were true namely that he started shouting as soon as he saw his father chappals and the pool of blood the appellants would obviously on hearing the shouts have run away but the prosecution wanted that <NAME> should see the appellants standing by the side of the dead body of the deceased so that he could identify them as the assailants of the deceased and therefore <NAME> had to change his story in his evidence before the Court and say that he did not shout until he saw the appellants near the dead body of the deceased It appears to us clearly that <NAME> and <NAME> must have asked the members of the family of the deceased as to who had killed and no names of the assailants must have been given to them since the members of the family were possibly not aware as to who had killed the deceased The evidence of <NAME> also does not therefore inspire any confidence and it cannot form the basis of conviction of the appellants There was also evidence of test identification parade of the appellants held by <NAME> <NAME> of Salceta Then we come to three circumstances on which strong reliance was placed on behalf of the prosecution But this cannot be regarded as an incriminating circumstance when it is remembered that the time at which the police went to the house of appellant No was about mid night and there was nothing unnatural in appellant No refusing to open the door at such an unearthly hour signed by <NAME> also mentioned that appellant No stated before the <NAME> that he was going to show the place where he has kept the weapon used for the commission of the offence It will therefore be seen that there was material contradiction between the evidence given by <NAME> on the one hand and the statement of appellant No Ex We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the order of conviction and sentence recorded against the appellants and acquit them of the offence charged against them
