Constitution of India Articles and Scope of Whether the <ORG> has any special obligations and privi leges attached to it even when it acts within the contractu al field been violated as no opportunity to show cause against the cancellation of lease was given The <ORG> acts purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the obligations which dealings of the <ORG> with the individual citizens import into every transaction en tered into in exercise of its constitutional powers only at the time of entry into the field of consideration of per sons with whom the <ORG> could contract at all But after the <ORG> or its agents have entered into the field of ordinary contract the relations are no longer governed by the constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines rights and obligations of the parties inter se Article or of any other constitutional provision is not violated when the <ORG> or its agents purporting to act within the contractual field perform In this sphere they can only claim rights conferred upon them by contract and are bound by the terms of the contract only unless some statute steps in and confers some special statu tory power or obligation on the <ORG> in the contractual field which is apart from contract The Patna High <ORG> had very rightly divided the types of cases in which breaches of alleged obligation by the <ORG> or its agents can be set up into three types i Where a petitioner makes a grievance of breach of an obliga tion of the <ORG> in cases where on an assurance or repre sentation of the <ORG> he has acted to his prejudice and detriment but the agreement is short of a contract within the meaning of Art of the Constitution ii Where the contract entered into between the person aggrieved and the <ORG> is in exercise of a statutory power under certain Act or Rules framed thereunder and the petitioner alleges a breach on the part of the <ORG> iii Where the contract entered into between the <ORG> and the person aggrieved is nonstatutory and purely contractual and the rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the terms of the contract and the petitioner complains about breach of such contract by the <ORG> The appellants are not entitled to an opportunity to show cause against the cancellation of the leases The question of distinguishing between an administrative and quasi judicial decision can only arise in the exercise of powers exercised under statutory provisions Rules of natural justice are attached to the performance of certain functions regulated by statutes or rules made thereunder involving decisions affecting rights of parties The only question which normally arises in such cases is whether the action complained of is or is not in consonance with the terms of the agreement The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> These appeals are before us after certifica tion of the cases raising identical questions of law as fit for appeal to this Court dealt with by one judgment and orders of <ORG> of <ORG> on two writ petitions Apparently there is no restriction under the terms of the contract upon the amount by which the royalty could be increased by a revision after a three years cycle under this clause Prima facie therefore the appel lants can only get their remedies if they can obtain any at all through ordinary suits for damages or for injunctions to restrain breaches of contract provided they could show how the contracts were broken or were going to be broken The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India It has been urged on behalf of the respondent <ORG> that there has been nO breach of contract in the cases before us The dispute whether there is or there i not a breach of contract should according to the con tention on behalf of the <ORG> be determined by ordinary civil courts as in every case between ordinary litigants who cannot invoke the powers of <ORG> under Article of the Constitution simply because there is a dispute whether an agreement has been broken or not But once the <ORG> enters into the contractual sphere after the require ments of form contained in Article have been complied with does it have to take its place in the eye of law side by side with ordinary parties and litigants or has it any special obligations or privileges attached to it even when it acts within this field Dr <NAME> argument that <ORG> had some special obligations attached to it would have appeared more plausible if it could be shown that the <ORG> or its officers or agents had practised some discrimination against the petitioners appellants at the very threshold or at the time of entry into the field of contract so as to exclude them from consideration when compared with others on any unreasonable or unsustainable ground struck by Article of the Constitution It was held there at Under Article of the Constitution the Executive power of the <ORG> and the <ORG> shall extend to the carrying on of any trade and to the acquisition holding and dis posal of the property and the making of con tracts for any purpose The order of black listing has the effect of depriving a person of equal ity of opportunity in the matter of public contract A person who has been dealing with the <ORG> in the matter of sale and purchases of materials has a legiti mate interest or expectation At this stage no doubt the <ORG> acts purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the obligations which dealings of the <ORG> with the individual citizens import into every transaction entered into in exercise of its constitutional powers But after the <ORG> or its agents have entered into the field of ordinary contract the rela tions are no longer governed by the constitutional provi sions but by the legally valid contract which determines rights and obligations of the parties inter se No question arises of violation of Article or of any other constitu tional provision when the <ORG> of its agents purporting to act within this field perform any act In this sphere they can only claim rights conferred upon them by contract and are bound by the terms of the contract only unless some statute steps in and confers some special statutory power or obligation on the <ORG> in the contractual field which is apart from contract These were stated as follows i Where a petitioner makes a grievance of breach of promise on the part of the <ORG> in cases where an assurance or promise made by the <ORG> he has acted to his prejudice and predicament but the agree ment is short of a contract within the meaning of article of the Constitution ii Where the contract entered into between the person aggrieved and the <ORG> is in exercise of a statutory power under certain Act or Rules framed thereunder and the petitioner alleges a breach on the pan of <ORG> and iii Where the contract entered into between the <ORG> and the person aggrieved is non statutory and purely contractual and the rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the terms of the contract and the petitioner complains about breach of such contract by the <ORG> We do not propose to express an opinion here on the question whether such an obligation could be enforced in proceedings under Article of the Constitution now It then very rightly held that the cases now before us should be placed in the third category where questions of pure alleged breaches of contract are involved The submission made before us is that whenever a <ORG> or its agents or offi cers deal with the citizen either when making a transaction or after making it acting in exercise of powers under the terms of contract between the parties there is a dealing between the <ORG> and the citizen which involves performance of certain legal and public duties If we were to accept this very wide proposition every case of a breach of con tract by the <ORG> or its agents or its officers would call for interference under Article of the Constitution In such a case he submitted there was no possibility of inferring a discrimination In reply learned counsel for the appellants sought to direct our attention towards some allegations showing that there was discrimination between appellants and other parties gov erned by similar contracts in other areas Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that there was a conflict between what was laid down here and the law declared by this <ORG> in <ORG> case supra The propositions of law laid down in the two cases must be read in the context of facts established in each case yet to continue the stay orders is to permit a circumvention of the Constitutional mandate contained in Article and to countenance a gross abuse of the processes of the <ORG> us to be wholly irrelevant inasmuch as a question of the distinc tion between an administrative and quasi judicial decision can only arise in the exercise of powers under statutory provisions Rules of natural justice are attached to the performance of certain functions regulated by statutes or rules made thereunder involving decisions affecting rights of parties Sometimes they may be implied and read the legislation dealing with rights protected by Article of the Constitution They could at times be so implied because restrictions on rights conferred by Article of the Constitution have to be reasonable The only question which normally arises in such cases is whether the action com plained of is or is not in consonence with the terms of the agreement Consequently we dismiss these appeals with costs throughout and discharge the stay orders
