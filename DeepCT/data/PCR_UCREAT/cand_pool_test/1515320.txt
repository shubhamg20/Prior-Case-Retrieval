which provides Whoever by words either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representation or otherwise brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards His Majesty or the Government established by law in British India shall be punished with transportation for life or any shorter term to which fine may be added or with imprisonment which may extend to three years to which fine may be added or with fine The questions asked are Under case No of a whether the Hon ble Minis ters of Bengal are subordinate officers to the Governor within the meaning of Section Government of India Act whether <ORG> should be considered as Government established by law Section of the Act provides that the executive authority which is the same thing in our opinion as legal authority to administer executive Government of a Province shall be exercised on behalf of His Majesty by the Governor either directly or through officers subordinate to him Section provides There shall be a council of ministers to aid and advise the Governor in the exercise of his functions except in so far as he is by or under this Act required to exercise his functions or any of them in his discretion Section provides The Governor shall make rules for the more convenient transaction of the business of <ORG> and for the allocation among ministers of the said business in so far as it is not business with respect to which the Governor is by or under this Act required to act in his discretion There is no specific provision in the Government of India Act nor in any other Statute or Act which we are aware of vesting the ministry with executive functions The use of the word aid in Section does not in our view vest the ministers with any right to exercise executive authority since such a construction would be contrary to the clear provision in Section nor can the rules for the transaction of the business of <ORG> made under Section of the Act override or alter in law the same clear provisions In our view ministers chosen from the elected representatives of the people of the Province for the purpose of carrying into effect if possible and within prescribed limits their wishes and acting as advisers to the Governor cannot be described as officers subordinate to the Governor within the meaning of Section Government of India Act Although the Presidency Magistrates have under Section Criminal the power to refer for the opinion of the High Court any question of law which arises at the hearing of any case pending before them it may be undesirable and in our view in this case it was undesirable to make the reference in the form it came before us It has involved giving a decision on law divorced to some extent from the facts The more desirable course is for the Magistrate to use the second part of Section Criminal which provides that he may give judgment in any such case subject to the decision of <ORG> on such reference Section Government of India Act provides An appeal shall lie to <ORG> from any judgment decree or final order of <ORG> in British India if <ORG> certifies that the case involves a substantial question of law a to the interpretation of this Act or any Order in Council made thereunder and it shall be the duty of <ORG> in British India to consider in every case whether or not any such question is involved and of its own motion to give or to withhold a certificate accordingly In our opinion this case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Government of India Act
