DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> SUDHI RANJAN BENCH <NAME> SUDHI RANJAN MAHAJAN MEHR CHAND BHAGWATI NATWARLAL CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC RF SC SC ACT Indian Income tax Act XI of ss and Order of Appellate <ORG> directing Income tax Officer to allow certain deductions Income tax Officer adding certain other items in computing income Appeal to Appellate Assistant Commissioner Maintainability Order of Appellate <ORG> under inherent powers directing Income tax Officer to revise his order Competency of reference The matter came back to the Income tax Officer and he made an order on September but did not issue any fresh notice of demand The Commissioner of Income tax being of opinion that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain or make such order on a miscellaneous application applied for a reference to <ORG> under of the Income tax Act The Commissioner of <ORG> appealed to <ORG> with the leave of <ORG> Held i that in carrying out the directions of the <ORG> and in passing the order of September the Income tax Officer cannot be regarded as having acted under or of the Act and no appeal lay from his order under The order made by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was not therefore an order under a and no further appeal lay to <ORG> under so as to enable the <ORG> to make an order under and us there was no order under a no question of law can be said to arise out of an order under and there can be no valid reference under or ii even assuming that the order of the Income tax Officer dated September was an order under a or and as such appealable the order made by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner declining to entertain the appeal was not an order under any of the sub sections of a and no appeal lay therefrom to <ORG> under and there could be no order of <ORG> under The order of <ORG> correcting the order of the Income tax Officer and directing that the sum of Rs should not be included cannot be regarded in any event as an order under so as to attract the operation of or The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> two consolidated appeals are directed against the Judgment and order made on January by <ORG> at Madras in References No of and No The facts are shortly as follows The assessee took further appeal before the appellate <ORG> against the disallowance of the several claims by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner including the two items mentioned above being the income from <ORG> made up the total accrued income of Rs as the alleged unassessed foreign income of earlier years remitted to India during the year of account the assessee preferred an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner The Appellate Assistant Commissioner was not satisfied that the assessee had any right of appeal under section of the Act for there had been no assessment under section and no notice of demand had been served on the assessee under section of the Act The contention was that <ORG> had no jurisdiction in law to entertain consider and pass the order which it did on the miscellaneous application seeing that it was neither an appeal under section of the Income tax Act nor could it be regarded as a rectification under section of any mistake committed by the Bench <ORG> took the view that although no specific provision was made in the Act by which it could give effect to its order or explain any ambiguity in such an order by a later order in any miscellaneous application filed by any party such power nevertheless was inherent in the <ORG> The two referred cases came up for consideration before a Bench of <ORG> and it was held that the reference under section was incompetent in view of the earlier decision of that <ORG> mentioned above which they felt to be binding on them and accordingly the Bench declined to answer the questions Section A gives to the aggrieved party a right of appeal to this Court from any judgment of <ORG> delivered on a reference made under section in any case which <ORG> certifies to be a fit one for appeal to this Court Section provides that <ORG> upon the hearing of any such case referred to it under section and shall decide the questions of law raised thereby and shall deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such decision is founded During the opening of the case by the learned Attorney General a question arose as to whether the simple refusal of <ORG> to bear the case on the ground that the reference was incompetent was a decision and judgment such as is contemplated by section of the Act from which alone a right of appeal to this Court is given The learned Advocate appearing for the assessee respondent did not object to this prayer and accordingly we gave leave to the appellant under article and treated this appeal as one filed pursuant to such leave In the circumstances it is not necessary for us to express any opinion on the appealability of the order of <ORG> under section A of the Act The learned Attorney General contends that the decision relied on by <ORG> has no application to the facts of the present case On October an application was made to the <ORG> by the Income tax Officer under section to correct a statement contained in the statement of facts in the order More than days after the date of the service on him of the order of July to wit on October the Commissioner made an application under section of the Act requiring the <ORG> to refer to <ORG> the question as to the correctness of its decision embodied in the order of July It was further held that if the Appellate <ORG> improperly or incorrectly made a reference in violation of the provisions of the statute <ORG> was capable of entertaining an objection to the statement of the case and that if it camp to the conclusion that the case should not have been stated <ORG> was not compelled to express an opinion upon the question referred in the case before us there is no question that the present application was not made within time but the contention is that section only contemplates an application for a reference of a question of law arising out of such order which clearly means an order made under section and therefore if there is no valid order under that section no question of law can be said to arise out of such order and consequently the Appellate <ORG> can have on jurisdiction to make any reference to <ORG> under section Section provides that if on any application being made under sub section the Appellate <ORG> refuses to state the case on the ground that no question of law arises the assessee or the Commissioner may within the time specified therein apply to <ORG> and <ORG> may if it is not satisfied of the correctness of the decision of the Appellate <ORG> require the Appellate <ORG> to state the case and to refer it The jurisdiction given to <ORG> under this sub section is conditional on an application under sub section being refused by the Appellate <ORG> If therefore an application under sub section was not well founded in that there was no order which could properly be said to be an order under sub section of section then the refusal of the Appellate <ORG> to state a case on such misconceived application on the ground that no question of law arises will not authorise <ORG> on an application under sub section of section to direct the <ORG> to state a case The jurisdiction of the <ORG> and of <ORG> is conditional on there being an order by the Appellate <ORG> which may be said to be one under section and a question of law arising out of such an order The only question for our consideration therefore is whether in this case any question of law arose out of an order which can properly be said to have been made by the Appellate <ORG> under sub section of section for if it did not then the Appellate <ORG> would have no jurisdiction under sub section of section to refer a case nor would <ORG> have jurisdiction under sub section of that section to direct the <ORG> to do so It was at one stage suggested by the learned AttorneyGeneral that we should in the first instance remit the matter to <ORG> for their decision on this question but as the question is one of law depending on the construction of the relevant sections of the Act it will save time if it is decided by us here and now It is not disputed that we have the power on the hearing of this appeal to decide this question There is no provision in the Act permitting such an application There being no appeal under section and the order having been made in exercise of its supposed inherent jurisdiction Turning now to section we find that any assessee objecting to an order passed by an Appellate Assistant Commissioner under section or section may appeal to <ORG> within the time specified in sub section which time however may be extended by the <ORG> under sub section A Under sub section <ORG> is given power after giving both parties to It is thus clear that <ORG> can make an order under section only on an appeal from an order passed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner under section or section If therefore there is no order which may properly be said to have been made by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner under section or section then there can be no appeal under section and consequently there can be no order under section Then comes section which gives power to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner to hear and dispose of such appeal It is therefore clear that in order that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner may exercise his jurisdiction and make an order under section there must be an appeal as contemplated by section Therefore it be order made by <ORG> in this case on August must be read and construed as a direction to the Income tax Officer to carry out the directions by allowing the two deductions in question He could not otherwise reopen the assessment already made by him under section Therefore in carrying out the directions of the <ORG> and in doing what be aid on September the Income tax Officer cannot be regarded as having acted under section or section of the Act and that being the position no appeal lay from that order of the Income tax Officer under section of the Act I The result of it was that there was no proper appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner such as is contemplated by section and therefore the order made by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner cannot be regarded as an order made by him under section for an order under section can only be made in disposing of an appeal properly filed under section and consequently no further appeal lay to <ORG> under section so as to enable <ORG> to make an order under sub section of that section In the premises there being no order which may properly be said to have been made under section no question of law can be said to arise out of an order made under section and consequently there can be no valid reference under section subsection or sub section Even if the order dated September made by the Income tax Officer after the matter came back to him to give effect to the decisions of <ORG> be regarded as an order made by him under section or section and as such appealable under section then the order made by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner on November declining to admit the appeal clearly amounted to a refusal on his part to exercise the jurisdiction vested in him by law Such an order not coming within the purview of section or section no appeal lay therefrom to <ORG> under section and if no such appeal properly came before <ORG> it could not properly make an order under section and if there was no order under section there could be no reference under section sub section or sub section It follows therefore that the order of <ORG> correcting the order of the Income tax Officer directing that the sum of Rs should not be included in the assessment cannot be regarded as an order passed by <ORG> under section so as to attract the operation of section The result therefore is that we dismiss these appeals with costs
