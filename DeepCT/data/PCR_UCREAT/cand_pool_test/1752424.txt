If there was no appeal from that order the order of the District Judge dated th May was passed without jurisdiction and although there would be no appeal against it to this Court we have intimated that in this case we are prepared to consider this appeal as an application under Section of the Code to have that order set aside on the ground that it was made without jurisdiction <ORG> had also a decree against <ORG> in execution of which he applied to attach <ORG> decree against <ORG> There is some question as to the date on which this application was granted but the Judge finds it was prior to the th September on which date an application by <ORG> to execute his decree for the balance after setting off the smaller decree <ORG>nder Section of the Code of Civil <ORG>rocedure was rejected It is clear that no appeal would lie unless the order complained of can be regarded as an order made under Section of the Code that is an order determining a question arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed or their representatives and relating to the execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree Now the question related to the execution discharge or satisfaction of <ORG> decree against <ORG> and the point for our consideration is whether Having been allowed to attach that decree can be treated as the representative of <ORG> in the determination of that question that is to say whether a person who attaches a decree is a representative of the decree holder The District Judge appears to think that this can only be done in cases which come within that distinct provision that is in cases where the decree which has been attached and the decree which is sought to be executed are the decrees of different <ORG>s Where both decrees are decrees of the same <ORG> the section assumes that that <ORG> has jurisdiction to execute the attached decree that is its own decree on the application of the attaching creditor It is only where the decree attached is the decree of another <ORG> that a special provision is necessary and accordingly the section specially provides that in such a case the attaching creditor must make a formal application to the <ORG> which made the decree to execute its own decree which he has attached For these reasons we are of opinion that an appeal did lie to the District Judge and that this appeal must be dismissed with costs
