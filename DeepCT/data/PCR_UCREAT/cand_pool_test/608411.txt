It covered a wide field in the matter of land reforms and inter alia provided for the imposition of a ceiling on holdings of lands the surrender of excess of lands grant of compensation thereof and the assignment of the surrendered lands in accordance with the order of priority mentioned in the Bill collection of purchase price constitution of Land <ORG>s etc Whether the validity or invalidity of transfers effected by persons owning or holding lands exceeding the ceiling limit could be determined with reference to the ceiling area in force on the date of the transfer or in accordance with the ceiling area prescribed by Act of whether sub section of was retrospective in operation section of section came into force on January because section of the amending Act of was brought into force on that date or whether it came into force on April when section as originally enacted came into force Subsection of section of the Act provides that i Section of the Act shall come into force at once ii the other provisions of the Act shall come into force on such dates as the Government may appoint iii different dates may be appointed for different provisions of the Act and iv any reference in any such provision to the commencement of this Act shall be construed as a reference to the coming into force of that provision of the Act or its other provisions on the dates appointed for them but for obvious reasons rule iv continued to hold the field inasmuch as it laid down the rule of construction that any reference to the commencement of the Act shall be construed as a reference to the coming into force of that particular provision Sub section of section as originally incorporated in the Act came into force on April It was amended by section of the Amending Act of which came into force on January but that proved to be fortuitous and was supplanted by section of the Amending Act of from the same date The amended section of the Act is a distinct rule or a clause for it provides the extent of the ceiling area in the cases mentioned in it its effect on the lands owned or held individually by members of a family or jointly by some or all the members of the family the taking into account of the shares of the members of the family or an adult unmarried person the effect of conversion of any class of land into any other class of land specified in the Schedule or into a plantation and the extent of land liable to be surrendered lands covered by a private trust or a private institution and exemption of land covered by section It may well be stated that sub section of section is also a provision of the law by itself for it lays down a distinct rule relating to conversion of land for observance by all concerned There is no force in the other argument that a landholder is in any event entitled to the benefit of the exemption under section as amended by the Act of in respect of the extent of plantation within the ceiling area even though it were converted into a plantation during the period April to December The argument is untenable because while sub section of section provides that the provisions of Chapter III shall not apply to lands and plantations mentioned in it that is overridden by and is subject to the requirement of sub section of section The question for consideration is whether the certificate of purchase issued by <ORG> under section of the Act is binding on <ORG> in proceedings under Chapter III of the Act for the purpose of taking a decision in regard to the ceiling area under sub section of section Sub section of that section shows that the question for examination by the <ORG> is not that relating to the existence of the tenancy rights of the person who files the statement under sub section but that relating to the bona fides of his belief that the land sought to be excluded by him is liable to be purchased by a cultivation tenant There is nothing in the sub section to require that the finding recorded by the <ORG> in those proceedings would be conclusive proof of any other matter so as to bind <ORG> or any authority Sub section of section therefore does not impinge on the authority of <ORG> to discharge its own functions under section Some of the persons who owned or held lands exceeding the ceiling prescribed by the Act had voluntarily transferred some of their lands after the publication of the Kerala Land Reforms Bill in <ORG> on September Section of the Amending Act of which inserted sub section in section does not state that it has been made with retrospective effect and sub section does not in terms state that it shall be deemed to have come into force from the date of the amendment which was made by the Amending Act of The reason is that the meaning which is to be given to a statute should be such as will carry out its object CIVIL APPEAL NO OF Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated of <ORG> in CRP Nos and of CIVIL APPEAL NOS OF Appeals by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated of <ORG> in CRP Nos and of A The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The learned counsel for the appellants have categorically stated at the <ORG> that no question relating to the validity of the Kerala Land Reforms Act Act of hereafter referred to as the Act or any of its provisions arises in these appeals by special leave We have heard them together virtually as companion appeals at the instance of learned counsel for they arise out of several judgments of <ORG> in matters relating to the implementation of the provisions for the restriction on ownership and possession of land in excess of the ceiling area and the disposal of excess land It is true that all these points do not arise in all the cases before us and some learned counsel have raised additional arguments in the peculiar facts and circumstances of their cases It covered a wide field in the matter of land reforms and inter alia provided for the imposition of a ceiling on holding of lands the surrender of excess lands grant of compensation therefor and the assignment of the surrendered lands in accordance with the order of priority mentioned in the Bill collection of purchase price constitution of <ORG> etc There were other amendments also but it is agreed that they do not bear on the controversy before us Whether the validity or invalidity of transfers effected by persons owning or holding lands exceeding the ceiling limit should be determined with reference to the ceiling area in force on the date of the transfer or in accordance with the ceiling area prescribed by Act of whether sub section of section is retrospective in operation While Chapter I of the Act contains provisions relating inter alia to its commencement and defines some of the important terms and expressions Chapter II contains many provisions for the benefit of tenants and deemed tenants including restoration of lands and fixity of their tenure purchase of landlords rights by cultivating tenants and rent payable by certain categories of tenants etc The provisions of the Chapter do not apply to the leases tenancies and transferred lands and transactions mentioned in section Section makes it obligatory to surrender the excess land and section vests such excess lands in <ORG> free from all encumbrances Section makes provision for the surrender of excess land obtained by gift purchase or mortgage lease surrender or any other transfer inter vivos or by bequest or inheritance or otherwise if the total extent of land thereby exceeds the ceiling area That has been so from the inception of the Act and the question therefore is whether those who felt tempted by the exemption in favour of plantations and converted their lands into plantations after the commencement of the Act would get the benefit of the exemption and if so from which date would the conversion be recognised This has been dealt with in sub section of section of the Act which prescribes the ceiling It is not in dispute before us that section came into force on April That section came into force on January It is not necessary to refer to it as the legislature amended sub section of section once again by section of the Amending Act of which by virtue of section of that Act also came into force on January and thereby supplanted from the very inception the amendment which had been brought about by the Amending Act of The amended sub section which is the subject matter of the point under consideration reads as follows Where after the commencement of this Act any class of land specified in Section II has been converted into any other class of land specified in that Schedule or into a plantation the extent of land liable to be surrendered by a person owning or holding such land shall be determined without taking into consideration such conversion The controversy therefore is whether the restriction of sub section of section came into force from January because section of the Amending Act of was brought into force on that date or whether it came into force on April when section as originally enacted by the Act came into force The provisions of this Act except this section which shall come into force at once shall come into force on such date as the Government may by notification in the <ORG> appoint Provided that different dates may be appointed for different provisions of this Act and any reference in any such provision to the commencement of this Act shall be construed as reference to the coming into force of that provision It therefore provides that i section of the Act shall come into force at once ii the other provisions of the Act shall come into force on such dates as the Government may appoint iii different dates may be appointed for different provisions of the Act and iv any reference in any such provision to the commencement of this Act shall be construed as a reference to the coming into force of that provision Section as has been stated came into force on April and the reference in sub section of that section to the commencement of this Act meant a reference to the coming into force of that provision with effect from April It may be that the first three rules or directions contained in sub section mentioned above were spent on the coming into force of section of the Act or its other provisions on the dates appointed for them but for obvious reasons rule iv continued to hold the field in as much as it laid down the rule of construction that any reference to the commencement of this Act shall be construed as a reference to the coming into force of that particular provision It will be recalled that sub section of section as originally incorporated in the Act came into force on April As has been mentioned sub section of section was emended by section of the Amending Act of which came into force on January but that proved to be fortuitous because it was supplanted by section of the Amending Act of from the same date Reference in this connection has been made to sub section of section of the Amending Act of It will be remembered that section of the Amending Act of which amended section came into force on January and as the legislature decided to amend it once again by section of the Act of with retrospective effect from the same date January it made a specific provision to that effect in section of the Amending Act of and left the date of commencement of the Act for purposes of sub section of section to be determined according to the proviso to sub section of section of the Act which as has been stated was a subsisting provision He has invited our attention to <NAME> <NAME> for the contention that the true meaning of provision is a section or series of sections forming a self contained integral whole that section to should be construed as a composite provision dealing with the ceiling area and that the assumption that section alone was brought into force as a distinct provision when section had not been brought into force is not legally sustainable Examined in this perspective section of the Act as amended by section of the Amending Act of is to say the least a distinct rule or clause for it provides the extent of the ceiling area in the cases mentioned in it sub section its effect on the lands owned or held individually by the members of a family or jointly by some or all of the members of the family sub section the taking into account of the shares of the members of the family or an adult unmarried person sub section the effect of conversion of any class of land specified in Schedule II into any other class of land specified in the schedule or into a plantation and the extent of land liable to be surrendered by a person owning or holding such land sub section lands owned by a private trust or a private institution sub section and exemption of lands covered by section sub section Sections and contain certain other provisions relating to the law of ceiling on land but that cannot detract from the basic fact that section contains a provision in fact an important provision of the law relating to the imposition of ceiling on land dealt with in Chapter III It may well be said that sub section of section is also a provision of the law by itself for it lays down a dis tinct rule relating to conversion of lands for observance by all concerned We have gone through <NAME> <NAME> but that was quite a different case where the section which authorised the launching of the prosecution of a defaulter was brought into force but not the other provision which prescribed the period of limitation for the prosecution and <ORG> was persuaded to take the view that it was the legislative intent that the prosecution should be governed by the limitation prescribed by the other section As Chapter III of the Act was not applicable to those lands because of the exemption under section and as that exemption continued until January when section of the Amending Act of came into force it was held by this Court that as the exemption was not withdrawn until January the transfers made between September and January were valid under the provisions of the Act The argument is untenable because while sub section of section provides that the provisions of Chapter III shall not apply to the lands and plantations mentioned in it that is overridden by and is subject to the requirement of sub section of section Section provides for the issue of the certificate of purchase sub section of that section reads as follows The certificate of purchase issued under sub section shall be conclusive proof of the assignment to the tenant of the right title and interest of the land owner and the intermediaries if any over the holding or portion thereof to which the assignment relates The real question for consideration therefore is whether the certificate is binding on <ORG> for the purpose of taking a decision in regard to the ceiling area under sub section of section It may be mentioned in this connection that while <ORG> deals with most of the matters relating to tenants and is constituted under section <ORG> is constituted under section A and deals with statements filed under sub section of section by persons owning or holding land in excess of the ceiling area A reading of sub section of section shows that the question for examination is not that relating to the existence of the tenancy rights of the person who files the statement but that relating to the bona fides of his belief that the land sought to be excluded by him is liable to be purchased by a cultivating tenant There is nothing in the sub section which could be said to declare that the finding recorded by the <ORG> in those proceedings would be conclusive proof of any other matter which it may determine so as to bind the <ORG> and Board or any other authority Sub section of section therefore does not in terms or in substance impinge on the authority of the <ORG> Land Board to discharge its own functions under section of the Act If a certificate of purchase is issued by <ORG> to any such person and he tenders it in proceedings before the Taluk Land <ORG> the <ORG> is required by law to treat it as conclusive proof of the fact that the right title and interest of the land owner and intermediary over the land mentioned in it has been assigned to him Mr <NAME> is not justified in arguing that <ORG> has power only to determine the identity of the surplus land leaving every other matter to <ORG> The argument loses sight of requirement of sub section of section that the <ORG> shall inter alia by order determine not only the identity of the land to be surrendered but also its extent It would thus appear that even though the certificate of purchase issued under sub section of section is conclusive proof of the assignment of the right title and interest of the landowner in favour of the holder in respect of the holding concerned under sub section that only means that no contrary evidence shall be effective to displace it unless the so called conclusive effective is inaccurate on its face or fraud can be shown Halsbury Laws of England fourth edition vol If a certificate of purchase has a bearing on what the <ORG> is called upon to decide we have no doubt that the <ORG> will take it into consideration if it is produced for its consideration with due regard to the evidentiary value assigned to it under section in the light of our decision on point No Point No Some of the persons who owned or held lands exceeding the ceiling prescribed by the Act had voluntarily transferred some of their lands after the publication of the Kerala Land Reforms Bill in <ORG> on September As has been stated the ceiling area was considerably reduced by the amendment which was made in section by the Amending Act of It was again amended by Act of hereafter referred to as the Amending Act of with effect from November when that Act came into force As has been stated sub section of section was inserted on November and the point for determination is whether it was retrospective or retroactive in operation so as to govern the transfers effected after September date of publication of the Bill of even though the original section read with the original section invalidated only those transfers which were in excess of the higher ceiling prescribed by the original section Section follows section which it will be recalled prescribes the ceiling area and section which prohibits the owning or holding or possession under a mortgage land in excess of the ceiling area As has been observed by this Court in <NAME> case section has been enacted with a view to making the provisions of section and effective It makes references to ceiling area in sub sections and and sub section states what exactly is meant thereby As has been mentioned that amendment was made by section which came into force on January It is true that section of the Amending Act of which inserted sub section in section of the Act does not state that it has been made with retrospective effect and sub section does not in terms state that it shall be deemed to have come into force from the date of the amendment which was made by the Amending Act of We shall also bear in mind the other equally important rule of interpretation that a statute is not to be read retrospectively except for necessity Section has been enacted for the purpose of making certain voluntary transfers invalid on the ground that they are deemed to be calculated to defeat the provision of the law relating to imposition of ceiling on land It will be remembered that the Act had not even come into force on September but it all the same invalidated the transfers made after that date in excess of the ceiling it prescribed In taking this view we have only taken into consideration the plain and clear wordings of the sub section and if in doing so it so happens that sub section becomes retroactive in operation we must hold that it is so It has to be appreciated that from the inception the Act forward on voluntary transfers effected after September for the obvious reason that the Bill was published on that date in <ORG> and those concerned know that they would be required to surrender the excess lands It was therefore considered necessary to introduce the Kerala Land Reforms Amendment Bill clause of which inter alia provided for the insertion of the following as sub section of section of the Act For the removal of doubts it is hereby clarified that the expression ceiling area in sub sections and means the ceiling area specified in sub section of section as amended by the Kerala Land Reforms Amendment Act or It is true that the intention of the legislature cannot be ascertained from any statement by way of a note on the clauses of a Bill or breviate and as has been stated the duty of the court is to find the natural meaning of the words in a statute in the context in which they are used but it has always been considered permissible and even desirable for a court while interpreting a statute to take note of the history of the statute and the circumstances in which it was passed or the mischief at which it was directed The reason is that the meaning which is to be given to a statute should be such as will carry out its object A No of <NAME> and another vs State of Kerala and others As we have taken a different view on point No and as the purchase certificate came up for consideration in <ORG> the appeal is allowed to the extent that <ORG> shall re examine the matter in the light of our decision on that point The appeal is therefore allowed and it is ordered accordingly A No of <NAME> vs State of Kerala and others In the view we have taken on point No about the evidentiary value of the certificate of purchase the appeal is allowed and the case is sent back to <ORG> for fresh disposal according to law in that respect A No of <NAME> and others vs State of Kerala and others The view taken by <ORG> in regard to the evidentiary value of the purchase certificate is not correct for reasons mentioned by us while dealing with point No The appeal is therefore allowed to this extent and <ORG> shall re examine its decision in this respect The appeal is allowed to this extent and it is ordered accordingly A No of <NAME> and another vs Clause of sub section of section of the Act provides that in the case of a family consisting of more than five members the ceiling area of the land shall be ten standard acres increased by one standard acre for each member in excess of five subject to the limit prescribed by the clause The expression family has been defined in clause of section as follows family means husband wife and their unmarried minor children or such of them as exist The view taken by <ORG> in <NAME> case is therefore correct and as it has been rightly followed in the appeal before us the appeal has no merit and is dismissed It is not disputed that there is a pine apple canning factory on acres and there is a pine apple plantation on the adjoining area of acres But according to that definition commercial site means leaving out the inapplicable portion any land which is used principally for the purposes of any trade commerce industry manufacture or business We find however that <ORG> did not interfere with the finding of <ORG> because there was no lease deed and there was absolutely no material to prove that the land was held by the tenants There is nothing on the record to show that a certificate of purchase was produced for the <ORG> consideration and it is futile to argue that its evidentiary value was ignored by the <ORG> On the claim that the land used for growing fuel was exempt as it fell within the definition of plantation under section a as it was an ancillary purpose also there is a finding of fact against the <ORG> The appeal has no merit and is dismissed Here again <ORG> was not justified in interfering with the <ORG> finding of fact for there was nothing to show that it was an area from which crop was not gathered at the relevant time In fact it appears from the order of the <ORG> that no other estate had made any such claim The appeal is therefore allowed to the extent that the <ORG> decision is restored in both these matters The appeal has no merit and it is dismissed We find that there was no satisfactory evidence to prove the partition and separate possession of the daughter There is no merit in this appeal and it is dismissed It has however been found as a fact that the alleged tenancy of <NAME> had not been established and there is nothing wrong if the plea to that effect has been rejected A No of <NAME> and another vs The State of Kerala and others We have dealt with the evidentiary value of the purchase certificate while examining point No which has a bearing on this appeal The appeal is therefore allowed and the case is sent back to <ORG> for fresh disposal in this respect according to the law We find that no such argument was advanced in the <ORG> or before <ORG> and as it happens there is nothing to show that even the existence of the certificate of purchase was brought to the notice of the <ORG> or <ORG> All that was urged in <ORG> was that out of acres acquired in the appellant got possession of only acres and that there was a lease of some land in favour of <NAME> in There is no merit in this appeal and it is dismissed A No of <NAME> and others vs <ORG> Talappilly and others It has been argued by Mr <NAME> that <ORG> erred in upholding the <ORG> view that the properties received by the deceased <NAME> under the partition deed of belonged to her exclusively as the property really belonged to the tavazhi consisting of herself her daughter and the lineal descendants This is a finding of fact and there is nothing wrong with the view that the property which fell to <NAME> share was her own property There is no merit in the appeal and it dismissed The Board reexamined the evidence and found that there was satisfactory evidence to prove that the land was not a private forest as on April In view of that finding of fact there is no merit in this appeal and it is dismissed No real attempt was made to explain the delay and <ORG> therefore rightly upheld the <ORG> decision that the application was barred by limitation <ORG> has given satisfactory reasons for that view and there is no occasion for us to interfere with that finding A Nos of <NAME> vs <ORG> <ORG> and others Special leave in these appeals has been granted limited to the question of urban lands measuring acres The <ORG> gave its finding in this matter after making the necessary enquiries and visiting the lands <ORG> has stated in its order dated October on the review petition that the question of non applicability of the Act to non agricultural lands was not urged for its consideration In view of our decision on point No the appeal is allowed and the case is sent back to <ORG> for fresh disposal in this respect according to law A No of Kuruvilla vs The State of Kerala and others In view of our decision on point No the appeal is allowed and the case is sent back to <ORG> for fresh disposal according to the law in so far as the question of exclusion of acres of land in Trikhadambe village is concerned
