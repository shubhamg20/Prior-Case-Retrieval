The appellants in the two appeals which are disposed of by this judgment are sisters The appellants filed their returns in respect of the two notices under Section Of the two questions referred to <ORG> by the <ORG> under Section at the instance of the <ORG> only one survives for our decision Section of the Income Tax Act provided for payment of tax under capital gains in respect of any profits or gains whatsoever from the sale exchange relinquishment or transfer of a capital asset effected after st day of March and such profits and gains shall be deemed to be income of the previous year in which the sale exchange relinquishment or transfer took place Section of the Act which substantially corresponds with Section of the Act continues to provide that Any profits or gains arising from the transfer of a capital asset effected in the previous year shall save as the otherwise provided in Sections EA EB and be chargeable to income tax under the head Capital gains and shall be deemed to be the income of the previous year in which the transfer took place The words capital assets has been defined in Section of the Act which as it stood at the relevant time that is prior to its amendment in provided iii agricultural land in India It has been held by this Court that the principle of <ORG> that a distribution of assets of a company in liquidation does not amount to a transfer continues to apply to the Act Where there is transfer of assets and not a distribution on liquidation then having regard to Section viii which provides that Nothing contained in Section shall apply to the following transfers viii any transfer of agricultural land in India effected before the st day of March it may have been argued at least on behalf of the Company that the transfer having been concluded in was exempt from capital gains The question is does the words assets in Section mean capital assets as defined in Section of the Act If it does then it is conceded by the <ORG> there is no question of subjecting the agricultural lands received by the assessees from the company in liquidation to capital gains If the words capital assets and assets as used in Sections and respectively did not overlap then there was no need to provide for a non obstante clause in Section with reference to Section That appears to be the plain meaning of the section and we see no reason to construe it in any other fashion The invocation of Section of the Act which defines Capital asset is as such unnecessary for the purpose of construing Section We accordingly dismiss the appeals without any order as to costs
