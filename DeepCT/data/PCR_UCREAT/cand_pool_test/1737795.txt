After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioners this Court on passed the necessary orders in terms of prayer of the petition and further called upon the respondent No to show cause why an order be not granted as sought in terms of prayers and It is after notice given to the other side and after their appearance and after the counter affidavit being filed the present application has come up before me for the grant of reliefs and as prayed in the said application There is no dispute in support of the loan being advanced or breach having been committed in terms of the loan agreements The main contention raised on behalf of the petitioners is that in terms of Section of the Act the interim order as contemplated therein if conditions as stipulated are satisfied should be passed It is thus urged that since in the present case all the conditions mentioned therein namely the breach of the agreements and the nonpayment of the loan therefore the order as contemplated under Sub section of Section of the Act is mandatory and the court should pass such an order The argument is that in view of this section no further proceedings could be gone into in the present case as there is bar under this section Learned counsel for the petitioners vehemently urged that mere registration of an application by the Registrar on a reference made under Section of the said Act would not constitute an enquiry being pending and therefore this court is precluded from passing the necessary orders in terms of Section of the aforesaid Industrial Finance Corporation Act It is next urged that under Section of Act No of the language used is The <ORG> may make such inquiry as it may deem fit It may on enquiry come to the conclusion that the application that for treating the company concerned as sick unit is not acceptable and thus reject the application but it cannot be said that <ORG> has discretion not even to enquire specially after reference being registered and after nominating a Bench of the <ORG> On the facts of this case and on the basis of affidavits filed by the parties I am of the opinion that the circumstances are such which lead to irresistible inference that enquiry is pending under Section of the Act A copy of this order may be given to the learned counsel for the parties on payment of usual charges within three days
