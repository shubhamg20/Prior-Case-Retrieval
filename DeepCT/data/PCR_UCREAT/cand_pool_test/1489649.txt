There were persistent protests by the public against the exaction of Rs per seat for every candidate admitted into the college and there were demands in <ORG> from <ORG> The petitioners thereupon filed this writ petition praying for the issue of a writ in the nature of a writ of mandamus restraining the <ORG> from enforcing the provisions of the Andhra Pradesh Ordinance of A of the Constitution which covers only cases of taking over the management of property for a limited period in public interest Before the writ petition was heard the Ordinance was replaced by the Rangaraya Medical College Taking over of the Management Act which received the assent of the President on the rd of July A of the Constitution would only apply to cases where management simpliciter was taken over without taking possession of the properties and assets of the petitioners In the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> the allegations of mala fide are denied It is also pointed out that most of the members who agitated for the taking over of the college include prominent members of <ORG> and opposition parties and it is therefore absurd to suggest that the legislation was effected as the President of the second petitioner was the President of <ORG> On the merits it is stated that the Ordinance and the Act being legislation for taking over management of the property of the petitioners for a limited period in public interest they are outside the pale of Article It is well settled that the validity of a legislation cannot be attacked on the grounds of mala fides and it is not the province of the <ORG> to go into the motive of the legislature in enacting legislation nor is it for the <ORG> to scan the wisdom or the reasonableness of the policy behind a statute no law providing for a taking over of the management of any property by the <ORG> for a limited period either in public interest or in order to secure proper management of the property shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article A may apply a the legislation must be one whereby the management of any property is taken over by the state it should be for a limited period it should be in the public interest or in order to secure proper management of the property Section of the Act provides at the management of the college shall in the <ORG> and shall continue to so vest for a period not exceeding five years or until the medical college is acquired whichever is earlier It is clear from this provision that the management is taken over for a limited period namely not exceeding five years or until the medical college is acquired whichever is earlier If the management was to be continued beyond the expiry of ten years the Collector has to hold a formal inquiry and send a report to the State <ORG> which had to be taken into consideration by the State <ORG> before it decided to continue the management any further A is available only where there is a definite limit in the law for the period of management They did not accept the argument that so long as there was possibility of return of land to the original owner it must be construed that the management is of a limited period If it was stated in the Act that the management was until acquisition it could have been argued on the strength of the decision of <ORG> that the period is indefinite and it cannot be stated definitely when the college would be acquired Thus even if there is no acquisition the management cannot extend over a period of five years In that case Section of the Sick Textile Under taking Taking Over of Management Act provided that in certain circumstances the Central <ORG> may make a declaration that the management of a textile undertaking ought to be taken over by it Hence in that case there was no limited period For the above reason we agree with the conclusion of <ORG> We however do not agree with the observation that merely because he Act does not contemplate the return to private management and specifically provides for taking over of the management pending nationalisation it cannot be said to be for a limited period In the counter affidavit it is stated that there was a clamour from all sources against the exaction of a huge amount of capitation fee of Rs per seat In the above circumstances though a contention was raised in the writ petition that the management was not in the public interest <NAME> could not and did not seriously argue that taking over of the college was not in public interest Mr <NAME> drew our attention to the various provisions of the Act Under of the Act <ORG> shall be deemed to include all assets rights and lease holds powers authorities and privileges and all property movable and immovable including lands buildings stores instruments and vehicles cash balances reserve fund investments and book debts and all other rights and interests arising out of such property as were immediately before the appointed day in the ownership possession power or control of the private management and all books of account registers and all other documents of whatever nature relating thereto The fact that possession is only taken for the purpose of management is made clear by which provides that during the period when the management of the medical college remains vested in the <ORG> it shall pay to the person interested in respect of any property such sum as is equal to the rent which would have been payable for its use and occupation if it is an immovable property or for its use if it is a movable property had it been taken on lease for that period Under the proviso it is stated that if the sum is not settled by any agreement the matter shall be referred to the arbitrator for making an award The learned counsel for the petitioner strongly relied on the decision of <ORG> in Amritsar Municipality State of Punjab where taking over by <ORG> which were run by <ORG> together with all the buildings in which the schools were functioning and other movable and immovable properties connected with the institutions which belonged to the committee under the Punjab Local Authorities Aided Schools Act of was challenged A the management of the Schools could be taken over by the state for a limited period in public interest of the Act provided that all rights and interests of the <ORG> including the rights of maintenance management and control shall be transferred and vest in <ORG> Whereas in the case before <ORG> the proprietary and ownership rights apart form the rights pertaining to management and control were taken over by the Sections which were declared unconstitutional in the present case it is only the management that is vested in the <ORG> under of the Act It is thus seen that <ORG> was not dealing with a case where the <ORG> was only taking over management but a case which involved the transfer of possession by way of compulsory acquisition The learned <ORG> Pleader also submitted that on the strength of the counter affidavit of the <ORG> this was made clear by this <ORG> in The learned counsel for the petitioner also drew our attention to of the Act which is in the following terms For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that any liability incurred by the private management in relation to the medical college before the appointed day shall be enforceable against the private management and not against the Government or the Special Officer In the writ petition there is no averment that there are any liabilities of the petitioners which the <ORG> is likely to refuse to take over
