Cinematograph Act Section A Whether the issuance of the certificate issued by the specialised <ORG> bars the criminal <ORG> jurisdiction to try for offences under Sections I HEADNOTE Pursuant to the complaint filed by the second respondent against the appellants under sections read with section of the Penal Code for alleged punitive prurience moral depravity and shocking erosion of public decency of the film Satyam Shivam Sundaram the Metropolitan Magistrate recorded the statement of three witnesses including the complainant in a preliminary inquiry under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure and holding that a prima facie case existed for summoning the appellants made an order directing issue of summons for their attendance Still a general principle pervades this branch of law when a specific provision is made easy resort to inherent power is not right except under compelling circumstances Not that there is absence of jurisdiction but that inherent power should not invade areas set apart for specific power under the same code The present case falls under that category where the accused complain of harassment through the <ORG> process When the order in original is before the <ORG> to dismiss the petition for non production of a copy of it is to bring the judicial process into pejoration and if a copy were so sacred that the original were no substitute for it some time could have been granted for its production which was not done A view of the film may tell more than volume of evidence will and maybe any court before making up its mind may like to see the picture from the angle of Sections I There is no meaningful alternative for an intelligent eye Regard must be had by the court to the fact that the certificate represents the judgment of a body of persons particularly selected under the statute for the specific purpose of adjudging the suitability of films for public exhibition and that judgment extends to a consideration of the principal ingredients which go to constitute the offences under ss and of the Indian Penal Code A petition under to quash the proceedings was moved Even so a general principle pervades this branch of law when a specific provision is made easy resort to inherent power is not right except under compelling circumstances Not that there is absence of jurisdiction but that inherent power should not invade areas set apart for specific power under the same Code In <NAME> case this <ORG> has exhaustively and if I may say so with great respect correctly discussed and delineated the law beyond mistake Apparent conflict may arise in some situations between the two provisions and a happy solution section of section operates only in exercise of the revisional power of <ORG> meaning thereby that <ORG> will have no power of revision in relation to any interlocutory order But in case the impugned order clearly brings about a situation which is an abuse of the process of the <ORG> or for the purpose of securing the ends of justice interference by <ORG> is absolutely necessary then nothing contained in Section can limit or affect the exercise of the inherent power by <ORG> The present case falls under that category where the accused complain of harassment through the courts process The label of the petition filed by an aggrieved party is immaterial When the order in original is before you to dismiss the petition for non production of a copy of it is to bring the judicial process into pejoration and if a copy were so sacred that the original were no substitute for it some time could have been granted for its production which was not done There is no doubt and counsel on both sides agree that a certificate by a high powered <ORG> with specialised composition and statutory mandate is not a piece of utter inconsequence Since we are directing <ORG> to re hear the case there is no room for further examination of the law except to sketch the perspective I would therefore set aside that order but direct the court to proceed with the hearing and bring it to a close expeditiously A view of the film may tell more than volumes of evidence will and maybe any court before making up its mind may like to see the picture from the angle of I There is no meaningful alternative for an intelligent eye I allow the appeal and send the case back for fresh disposal PATHAK This is an appeal against an order of <ORG> rejecting a petition filed by the appellants for quashing an order summoning the appellants on a complaint filed by the second respondent in respect of offences under sections and read with section of the Indian Penal Code Pursuant to a complaint filed by the second respondent the Metropolitan Magistrate recorded the statement of three witnesses including the complainant in a preliminary inquiry under of the Code of Criminal Procedure and holding that a prima facie case existed for summoning the appellants he made an order directing issue of summons for the petitioners attendance of the appellants The present appeal is directed against that order The questions which arises on the order of <ORG> are whether a the petition filed by the appellants under of the Code of the Criminal Procedure could be treated by <ORG> as a revision petition under of the Code and assuming that it could be regarded as a revision petition whether <ORG> was right in rejecting it on the ground that a certified copy of the Metropolitan Magistrate order summoning the appellants was not filed with it There is no difficulty in laying down that in a trial for the offences under ss and of the Indian Penal Code a certificate granted under of the Cinematograph Act by <ORG> does not provide an irrebuttable defence to accused who have been granted such a certificate but it is certainly a relevant fact of some weight to be taken into consideration by the criminal court in deciding whether the offence charged is established Regard must be had by the court to the fact that the certificate represents the judgment of a body of persons particularly selected under the statute for the specific purpose of adjudging the suitability of films for public exhibition and that judgment extends to a consideration of the principal ingredients which go to constitute the offences under ss and of the Indian Penal Code
