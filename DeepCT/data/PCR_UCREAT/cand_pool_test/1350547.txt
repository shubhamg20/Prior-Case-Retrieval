Subsequently in the Act was amended by the addition of which inter alia provided Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods shall not after the st day of March be imposed where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter <ORG> trade For the year the Sales Tax Officer assessed the appellant to sales tax on a net assessable turnover by taking the value of the whole of the copra purchased by him adding thereto the respective values of the oil and the cake sold inside the <ORG> and deducting only the value of the copra corresponding to the oil sold inside the <ORG> It was contended for the appellant that in the calculation of the net turnover he was entitled to include the total value of the oil sold by him both inside and outside the <ORG> and deduct therefrom the total value of the copra purchased by him and further that under the overriding provision of the Act under he was entitled to have the value of the oil sold outside the <ORG> deducted The non obstante provision contained in of the Act has the effect of taking transactions relating to inter <ORG> trade out of the purview of the Act and they are excluded in the calculation of the gross turnover as well as the net turnover on which sales tax can be assessed for the year st April to st March and for issuing proper directions to <ORG> to assess the same according to law The appellant preferred an appeal to the Assistant Sales Tax Commissioner A No of who dismissed the same by his order dated May A further petition to the Government for redress met with the same fate and the appellant thereupon filed the petition in <ORG> The decision of this appeal turns on the construction of the relevant provisions of the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Act Act XI of and the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Rules made thereunder which may be conveniently set out here Section defined a sale as under Sale with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means every transfer of the property in goods by one person to another in the course of trade or business for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration Explanation Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Sale of Goods Act for the time being in force the sale or purchase of any goods shall be deemed for the purpose of the Act to have taken place in the United State wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made Section defined turnover as the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought by or sold by a dealer whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise shall be excluded from his turnover Section was the charging section and it provided for levy of taxes on sales of goods in the terms following Subject to the provisions of this Act a every dealer shall pay for each year a tax on his total turnover for such year and the tax shall be calculated at the rate of three pies for every Indian rupee in such turnover A dealer whose total turnover in any year is less than ten thousand Indian rupees shall not be liable to pay any tax for that year under sub section or sub section Section enacted that the provisions of the charging section shall not apply to the sale of electrical energy and any goods other than arrack and foreign liquor on which duty is or may be levied under the Travancore or Cochin Abkari Act or the Travancore or Cochin Opium Act Section conferred upon the Government power to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act The Act as originally enacted received the assent of the <ORG> on January After the advent of the Constitution however the Act was amended by the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Amendment Act and was added thereto which ran as under Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act a a tax on the sale or purchase of goods shall not be imposed under this Act i where such sale or purchase takes place outside the State of Travancore Cochin or ii where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods shall not after the st day of March be imposed where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide Rule provided that the tax or taxes under or or the notification or notifications under shall be levied on the net turnover of a dealer It specified all amounts which a registered manufacturer of cocoanut and or groundnut oil and cake may be entitled to deduct from his gross turnover under Rule subject to the conditions specified in the rule Any dealer who manufactures cocoanut groundnut oil and cake from cocoanut and or copra or groundnut and or kernel purchased by him may on application to the assessing authority having jurisdiction over the area in which he carries on his business be registered as a manufacturer of cocoanut groundnut oil and cake and a certificate issued in Form VI He next contends that which was added to the Act by the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Amendment Act prohibits the levy amongst others of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce This is an overriding provision which it is contended entitled him to deduct the value of the oil sold outside the <ORG> viz Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act a tax on the sale or purchase of goods shall not be imposed under this Act where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce The turnover is there defined as the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought or old by a dealer and that definition comprises within its scope both these types of sales whether inside the <ORG> or outside the <ORG> Rule made by the <ORG> under the rule making power prescribes that the gross turnover of a dealer for the purposes of the rules shall be the amount for which the goods are sold by him After having thus provided for the inclusion of all sales within the gross turnover provides that the tax or taxes under which is the charging section shall be levied on the net turnover of a dealer <ORG> decided against the appellant observing that the definitions given in and of the Act applied only in the absence of anything repugnant in the subject or context and on a perusal of the relevant provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder it was of opinion that these definitions were clearly inapplicable for the following reasons There can be no doubt that what has been intended is a taxation of copra at the purchase point and the avoidance of sales tax in respect of the oil extracted by a registered manufacturer from such copra to the extent of the value of the copra used for the said manufacture in all those cases where but for the concession he would have been liable to pay both the purchase tax on copra and the sales tax on oil under the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Act The answer given by the learned counsel for the appellant to the above reasoning was that in fiscal statutes what you have got to look to is not the spirit of the statute but the letter of the law and if you could not bring a particular tax within the letter of the law the subject could not be made liable for the same principle of all fiscal legislation it is this if the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be On the other hand if the <ORG> seeking to recover the tax cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law the subject is free however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be It is no doubt true that in construing fiscal statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax one must have regard to the strict letter of the law and not merely to the spirit of the statute or the substance of the law If the <ORG> satisfies the <ORG> that the case falls strictly within the provisions of the law the subject can be taxed If on the other hand the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxing statute no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter We must of necessity therefore have regard to the actual provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder before we can come to the conclusion that the appellant was liable to assessment as contended by the Sales Tax Authorities VIII all of which levied sales tax on a more or less uniform basis bringing within their ken not only the sales which were actually effected within the territory but also sales where adopting the nexus theory eve one of the ingredients of sale was found to have taken place within the territory laid down restrictions on the <ORG> Legislatures to enact laws imposing or authorising the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of goods in certain cases therein specified so that after January no <ORG> could impose a tax on the sale or purchase of goods falling within these categories The Assam Sales Tax Act had incorporated therein an addition to the charging section section of the Act and A which was inserted by of the Assam Sales Tax Amendment Act Assam Act IV of was to the following effect Nothing in sub section shall except in cases covered by the first proviso to sub section of section of this Act be deemed to render any dealer liable to tax on the sale of goods where such sale takes place outside the State of Assam in the course of the import of the goods into or export of the goods out of the territory of India or in the course of inter State trade or commerce except in so far as <ORG> may by law otherwise provide The Explanation which was substituted for the original Explanation by of the Hyderabad General Sales Tax Amendment Act Hyderabad Act XXXII of read as under Explanation Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any other law for the time being in force a transfer of goods in respect of which no tax can be imposed by reason of the provision contained in Article of the Constitution shall not be deemed to be sale within the meaning of this clause In our opinion of the Act in cases falling within the categories specified under Art of the Constitution has the effect of setting at nought and of obliterating in regard thereto the provisions contained in the Act relating to the imposition of tax on the sale or purchase of such goods and in particular the provisions contained in the charging section and the provisions contained in and other provisions which are incidental to the process of levying such tax judgment of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> there are three stages in the imposition of a tax There is the declaration of liability that is the part of the statute which determines what person in respect of what property are liable Next there is the assessment Liability does not depend on assessment If there is a liability to tax imposed under the terms of the taxing statute then follow the provisions in regard to the assessment of such liability If there is no liability to tax there cannot be any assessment either Sales or purchases in respect of which there is no liability to tax imposed by the statute cannot at all be included in the calculation of turnover for the purpose of assessment and the exact sum which the dealer is liable to pay must be ascertained without any reference whatever to the same There is a broad distinction between the provisions contained in the statute in regard to the exemptions of tax or refund or rebate of tax on the one hand and in regard to the non liability to tax or non imposition of tax on the other In the former case but for the provisions as regards the exemptions or refund or rebate of tax the sales or purchases would have to be included in the gross turnover of the dealer because they are prima facie liable to tax and the only thing which the dealer is entitled to in respect thereof is the deduction from the gross turnover in order to arrive at the net turnover on which the tax can be imposed In the latter case the sales or purchases are exempted from taxation altogether The <ORG> cannot enact a law imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax thereupon and they are not liable to any such imposition A If they are thus not liable to tax no tax can be levied or imposed on them and they do not come within the purview of the Act at all The very fact of their non liability to tax is sufficient to exclude them from the calculation of the gross turnover as well as the net turnover on which sales tax can be levied or imposed If this distinction is borne in mind it is clear that of the Act enacts a provision with regard to nonliability of these transactions to tax and these transactions were therefore taken out of the purview of the Act We are therefore of opinion that the conclusion reached by We are therefore therefore of opinion that the conclusion reached by <ORG> was correct the calculations of the net turnover made by <ORG> were also correct and this appeal must stand dismissed with costs
