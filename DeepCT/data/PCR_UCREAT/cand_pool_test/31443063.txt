The classification made by the Appellate Collector was revised by <ORG> in a proceeding initiated suo motu under Section of the <ORG> Act In order that the <ORG> is able to appreciate the rival contentions both sides addressed us referring to several standard authorities and treatises It is claimed by the appellants that pyratex which is the commercial name for Latex imported by them is exactly similar to the Latex referred to in Mr <NAME> affidavit since it also contains butadiene styrene and vinyl pyridine in the same proportion of with no measurable resin content The impugned order itself takes note of all the contentions raised before the <ORG> and also pressed before us This approach is also convenient and unobjectionable since it is urged on behalf of the respondents that we should not entertain fresh materials which were not available before the authority It was pointed out before the authority by the appellants that rubber was always obtained first in a latex form and latex was nothing but an aqueous state of rubber that Latex is a liquid rubber designed for use in tyre manufacture as a bonding agent by cross linking with fabrics It was also pointed out with reference to the classification of synthetic rubber latices that <ORG> itself had ruled in several cases that these were to be regarded as coming under I It appears from the order itself that <ORG> was not treating rubber latex as raw rubber assessable under item I till and a decision was taken in that year to accord the same tariff treatment to rubber latex as to rubber raw because it was found that latex had to be imported for various specific uses which required a liquid form In fact it does not replace rubber in use though it has similar properties The authority repelled the contention in the following words It appears that there is no accepted definition of the term resin in trade usage or technical literature and resins are identified by their use as resins and in this view Latex may well be considered as a resin latex To revert to the order of the authority it is clear that the authority would be have found no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that Latex in view of chemical composition and physical properties is rubber raw if the same were commercially used as rubber That section reads Except as otherwise provided in this Act or any other law for the time being in force duties of customs shall be levied at such rates as may be specified under the Indian Tariff Act or any other law for the time being in force on goods imported into or exported from India We are therefore not required to consider the history and chemistry of synthetic rubber and Latex as a component of SBR with regard to which extensive arguments were addressed by both sides by quoting from different texts and authorities Dealing with the meaning of the term vegetables in the Excise Tax Act in King <ORG> CLR <ORG> observed as follows Now the statute affects nearly everyone the producer or manufacturer the importer wholesaler and retailer and finally the consumer who in the last analysis pays the tax This Court held as follows But this word must be construed not in any technical sense nor from the botanical point of view but as understood in common parlance It has not been defined in the Act and being a word of every day use it must be construed in its popular sense meaning that sense which people conversant with the subject matter with which the statute is dealing would attribute to it It was contended in that case that charcoal would be covered under Entry I of Part III of Schedule II to that Act This Court again referred with approval to the decision in <ORG> case supra and followed the principle laid down in <NAME> case supra This Court finally observed The Kiln gas in question therefore is neither carbon dioxide nor compressed carbon dioxide known as such to the commercial community and therefore cannot attract Item in the First Schedule Mr <NAME> draws our attention to several authorities to impress upon us that butadiene styrene latices are compatible with many resins and modifiers We find the same description reiterate in a book Latex Natural and Synthetic by <NAME> a Reinhold Pilot Book where at page it is stated that there is one type of speciality rubber latex that deserves special notice It is clear that meanings given to articles in a fiscal statute must be as people in trade and commerce conversant with the subject generally treat and understand them in the usual course We do not see any reason why the same policy could not have been followed in the <ORG> book being complementary to each other It is best left to the authorities entrusted with the subject In this case there is rather voluminous evidence from the standard authorities in favour of Latex being a component of SBR which is admittedly classified under rubber raw But assuming and only assuming that evidence is balanced the best course in a fiscal measure is to decide and fix the entry under which the article comes otherwise it will give rise to adoption of varying standards where uniformity should be the rule There is however no estoppel in law against a party in a taxation matter we do not attach any significance to this aspect of the matter pointed out by counsel The basis of the reason with regard to the end use of the article is absolutely irrelevant in the context of the entry where there is no reference to the use or adaptation of the article In the result the appeals are allowed with costs We should observe that we express no opinion with regard to the question relating to countervailing duty under Section AA of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act in these appeals
