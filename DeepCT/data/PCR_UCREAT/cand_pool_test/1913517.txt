HEADNOTE The rule of estopple has gained new dimensions in recent years and a new class of estoppel viz Where parties enter into an agreement which is intended to create local relations between them and in pursuance of such arrangement on a party makes a promise to the other which he knows will be acted on and which is in fact acted on by the promise the <ORG> will treat the promise at finding on the promiser to the extent that it will not allow him to act inconsistently with it even although the promise may not be supported by consideration in the strict sense It was urged on behalf of <ORG> that the authority given to it to discharge the tax liabilities of <ORG> were ultra vires its powers and therefore provided no legal basis to resist the plain claim Held that <ORG> had not acted ultra vires its powers It was contended on behalf of <ORG> that in view of of the limitation Act the claim made leaving aside the claim made in respect of the assessment for the assessment years was not barred because <ORG> was a non resident company never present in India and therefore under the section the time during which the defendant has been absent from India had to be excluded for the purpose of computing the period of limitation Held that the suit was barred by limitation a <ORG> had waived the lien it might have had over the shares The defendant resisted the suit on Various grounds It denied that the plaintiff had paid the amounts shown in the plaint schedule or it was liable to be reimbursed the payments made if any It opined that the liability to pay the tax in question was the joint liability of <ORG> as well as <ORG> and the same having been discharged by the former it had no claim on <ORG> It opined that the suit was a dishonest attempt on the part of <NAME> to absolve his liability for paying for the shares in respect of which he had obtained a decree for specific performance In order to appreciate the various contentions advanced before this <ORG> it is necessary briefly to refer to the history of the case At this stage it may be mentioned that in accordance with the agreement entered into between <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> was to discharge the tax liability of <ORG> to the extent of Rupees lakhs Consequently <ORG> filed a suit in <ORG> on its original side for the specific performance of the agreement entered into between him and the <ORG> In the suit for specific performance though <ORG> was a party it did not plead that it had any lien over the shares with which we are concerned in this case That application was rejected on September on the ground that the application being one for execution it must be in a tabular form and that any imposition of time limit would be to engraft something on the decree which does not exist in the decree One other circumstance that is necessary to be mentioned before proceeding to consider the points in controversy is that despite the various resolutions passed by <ORG> of <NAME> as well as by the shareholders of that company at the general meeting the present suit was filed by the Secretary of <NAME> even without obtaining the sanction of <ORG> <ORG> liability to pay tax arose because of the dividends it was deemed to have received from <ORG> as a result of A proceedings But there is dispute between the parties as to the exact amount paid by <ORG> It was contended on behalf of <ORG> that liability is a joint liability of both the company as well as that of the shareholders Section A empowers the Income tax Officer to order in writing if the conditions prescribed in that section are satisfied that the undistributed portion of the assessable income of a company earned in the previous year as computed for income tax purposes and reduced by the amount of income tax and super tax payable by the company in respect thereof shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividends amongst the shareholders as on the date of the concerned general meeting It was urged on behalf of <ORG> that the income that can be brought to tax as a result of an order under A is not a real income it is only a deemed income that income came to be taxed because of the failure of the company to declare dividends It is only for the purpose of convenience that income is taxed in the hands of the shareholders hence the liability to pay that tax in equity must be that of the company and it is for that reason A has provided for the realisation of the tax due from the shareholders from the company In this connection reliance was also placed on the language of which empowers the <ORG> to assess the income of a nonresident assessee in the hands of his agent but at the same time that section empowers that agent to retain in his hands a sum equal to his estimated liability under that section from out of the It was lastly urged that if dividends were deemed to have been declared those deemed dividends remained in the hands of the company and when the company paid tax in respect of the same it must be held to have paid the same out of the dividends of the shareholders that remained in its hands On the other hand it was contended on behalf of <ORG> that any assessment made in pursuance of an order under A is an assessment on the shareholders and not on the company The dividends deemed to have been distributed under A is considered to be the income of the shareholders and not that of the company For that reason it was contended on behalf of <ORG> that it is entitled to be reimbursed in respect of the tax paid by it That section says Any person employed by or on behalf of a person residing out of the taxable territories or having any business connection with such person or through whom such person is in the receipt of any income profits or gains upon whom the Income tax Officer has caused a notice to be served of his intention treating him as the agent of the non resident person shall for all the purposes of this Act be deemed to be such agent It was contended on behalf of <ORG> that it was not residing out of the taxable territories it is a private limited company hence it must be held to be residing in all places where it eams or deemed to earn any income It was further urged that <NAME> was not a person employed by or on behalf of <ORG> nor did <ORG> have any business connections with <NAME> Before going into the other contentions we may briefly deal with the contention that the suit was not properly instituted There is also reason to believe that when the Directors of <ORG> ratified the action taken by <NAME> they behaved in an irresponsible manner as seen earlier Whether the claim made in the suit or any portion thereof is barred by limitation The judgments of the trial court In this case there was no plea of any release under of the Contract Act If the answer to that question is in the affirmative then there is no need to examine whether there was any waiver or abandonment as pleaded by <NAME> That rule has gained new dimensions in recent years A new class of estoppel i promissory estoppel has come to be recognised by the courts in this country as well as in England We shall presently refer to decisions bearing on that topic but before doing so let us examine whether <ORG> made any representation to <ORG> if so what is that representation But it was urged on behalf of <ORG> that the resolutions in question were mere promises to do something in the future They were not representations of any fact and as those promises were not supported by any consideration they afford no legal basis to resist the claim made in the plaint It was plainly admitted by the witnesses examined on behalf of <ORG> that the amounts paid on behalf of <ORG> were not considered as debts due from that company till about the time of filing the suit The documents produced in the case and the admissions made by the witnesses examined on behalf of <ORG> make it abundantly clear that the idea of claiming back the tax paid on behalf of <ORG> came to be entertained by <ORG> only after <NAME> came to control that company Discussions took place between the Directors of the two companies and as a result on January a letter was sent by the lessor to the lessee confirming that the ground rent of the It also claimed at that rate for the quarters ending September and December Answering that question <NAME> as he then was held that where parties enter into an agreement which is intended to create legal relations between them and in pursuance of such arrangement one party makes a promise to the other which he knows will be acted on and which is in fact acted on by the promise the court will treat the promise as binding on the promiser to the extent that it will not allow him to act inconsistently with it even although the promise may not be supported by consideration in the strict sense Therein the court divided the claim made in the suit into two categories one for the period prior to the end of and the other for the period thereafter stated in High Trees case is that where one party has by his words or conduct made to the other a promise or assurance which was intended to affect the legal relations between them and to be acted on accordingly then once the other party has taken him at his word and acted on it the party who gave the promise or assurance cannot afterwards be allowed to revert to the previous legal relationship as if no such promise or assurance had been made by him but he must accept their legal relations subject to the qualification which he himself has so introduced even though it is not supported in point of law by any consideration but only by his word But that principle does not create any cause of action which did not exist before so that where a promise is made which is not supported by any consideration the promises cannot bring an action on the basis of that promise In exercise of its powers under of the Imports and Exports Control Act <ORG> issued the Imports Control Order and other orders setting out the policy governing the grant of import and export licences That prayer was resisted by the government on various grounds inter alia that the Export Promotion Scheme was administrative in character that it contained mere executive instructions issued by the Government to the Textile Commissioner and created no enforceable rights in the exporters who exported their goods in pursuance of the scheme and it imposed no obligation on the government to issue import certificates <NAME> <NAME> was dealing with a case of serving army officer who wrote to <ORG> regarding a disability and received a reply that his disability had been accepted as attributable to military service The rule laid down in these decisions undoubtedly advance the cause of justice and hence we have no hesitation in accepting it It was urged on behalf of <ORG> that the authority given to it to discharge the tax liabilities of <ORG> as well as the agreements entered into by it with <ORG> and the <NAME> brothers were ultra vires its powers and consequently they provide no legal basis to resist the plaint claim Clause of the Memorandum empowers the <ORG> to carry on business in India and elsewhere as merchants general merchants agents and traders etc Sub clause of that clause gives power to the company to receive money on deposit at interest or otherwise and lend money to such per sons with or without security and on such terms as may seem expedient and in particular to customers of and other persons having dealing with the company and to give any guarantee or indemnity as may seem expedient Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for <ORG> invited our attention to several decisions wherein the courts had taken the view that the actions taken by the companies concerned were ultra vires their powers There was no idea of recovering the amount paid as tax from <ORG> It was clearly admitted by the Secretary of <ORG> and other witnesses examined on behalf of that company that the idea of suing <ORG> for recovering the tax paid was con ceived for the first time after <ORG> obtained the decree for specific performance Hence it is governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act which came into force on April The amounts claimed in the present suit except those in respect of the assessment for the assessment year were all admittedly paid before November But it was urged on behalf of <ORG> that in view of of the Limitation Act the claim made leaving aside the claim made in respect of the assessment for the assessment year is not barred It was urged on behalf of <ORG> that <ORG> is a non resident company The question of residence of an insurance company registered and having its registered office in a foreign country came up for consideration before <ORG> in <ORG> Public Trustee Its business is necessarily carried on by agents and I do not know why its domicile should be considered to be confined to the place where the goods are manufactured There may be two domiciles and two jurisdictions and in this case there are as I conceive two domiciles and a double sort of jurisdiction one in Scotland and one in England and for the purpose of carrying on their business one is just as much a domicile of the corporation as the other For the reasons mentioned above this appeal fails and it is dismissed Turning to the question of costs from what we have said earlier it is clear that there was no justification for bringing the suit There is no justification to make <ORG> in which <NAME> has only per cent shares to bear the costs
