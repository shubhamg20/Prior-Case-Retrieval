The matter was carried in appeal before <ORG> which by the impugned order dismissed the appeal filed by the accused appellant and held that accusations under Section have been made out against him who was accused No before the trial Court the accused appellant had taken a definite stand that a shot was fired by the deceased which did not hit him and the deceased and <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> assaulted him and made him senseless That being the position there is no scope for interference in this appeal Further there was a confusion between bullet and pellet which has been clarified by the investigating officer There was not even any suggestion about the defence version to any of the prosecution witnesses and for the first time while giving statement under Section We shall first deal with the question regarding non explanation of injuries on the accused Issue is if there is no such explanation what would be its effect We are not prepared to agree with the learned counsel for the defence that in each and every case where prosecution fails to explain the injuries found on some of the accused the prosecution case should automatically be rejected without any further probe In <NAME> case supra it is made clear that failure of the prosecution to offer any explanation regarding the injuries found on the accused may show that the evidence related to the incident is not true or at any rate not wholly true Non explanation of injuries by the prosecution will not affect prosecution case where injuries sustained by the accused are minor and superficial or where the evidence is so clear and cogent so independent and disinterested so probable consistent and creditworthy that it outweighs the effect of the omission on the part of prosecution to explain the injuries It is for the defence to put questions to the prosecution witnesses regarding the injuries of the accused persons When that is not done there is no occasion for the prosecution witnesses to explain any injury on the person of an accused State of Bihar AIR SC it was observed that the obligation of the prosecution to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in the same occurrence may not arise in each and every case In other words it is not an invariable rule that the prosecution has to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in the same occurrence If the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution are believed by the <ORG> in proof of guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt question of obligation of prosecution to explain injuries sustained by the accused will not arise When the prosecution comes with a definite case that the offence has been committed by the accused and proves its case beyond any reasonable doubt it becomes hardly necessary for the prosecution to again explain how and under what circumstances injuries have been inflicted on the person of the accused In the case at hand trifle and superficial injuries on accused are of little assistance to them to throw doubt on veracity of prosecution case That makes a significant factual difference between <NAME> case supra and the present case It has to be noted that there was not even a suggestion to any of the prosecution witnesses that the injuries were sustained by the accused appellant in the manner indicated by him as stated for the first time in the statement under Section In his examination the doctor PW has categorically stated that there was only one injury on the body of the deceased and no other injury was found anywhere on the person of the deceased
