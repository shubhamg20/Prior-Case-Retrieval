Shorn of details that are no longer relevant the facts of this case are as follows The respondent was appointed Sub Inspector of Police by <NAME> Punjab on January On March the Superintendent of Police Amritsar an officer subordinate to <NAME> recorded an order purporting to dismiss the respondent from service After exhausting his remedies by way of departmental appeal the respondent instituted a suit on April against the Punjab Province claiming a declaration that the order of the Superintendent of Police of March was void and of no effect inasmuch as it was made by an officer subordinate to the authority by which the respondent had been appointed and thus contravened the direction laid down in Section of the Constitution Act The defendant has come up on appeal to this Court The respondent has filed cross objections claiming arrears of pay for the whole period from March till January His contention was that the plaintiff had no right to maintain a suit against the <ORG> or its representative for recovery of arrears of pay The order of March purporting to dismiss the respondent having been made by an authority that had been expressly debarred by Section of the Constitution Act from making it was utterly void of all effect He was thus entitled to draw his salary for the period of his service after March Against the decree of the Judicial Commissioner the plaintiff sought to move this Court by application which was dismissed on the ground that he could only come up by way of appeal under Section of the Constitution Act As the claim relates to a period subsequent to the institution of the suit the petitioner may have a separate remedy in respect of the same It was however contended on behalf of the appellant that a servant of the <ORG> held office during His Majesty pleasure and could be dismissed at will and that consequently he had no right to maintain a suit to recover arrears of pay It was urged that the <ORG> was by prerogative exempt from liability to be sued by its servants for recovery of pay and that the prerogative could not be derogated from by any contract express or implied between the <ORG> and its servants providing for payment of salary The petition of right is founded on averments that there was a contract between the suppliant and the <ORG> and that the contract had been broken If the terms of the appointment definitely prescribe a term and expressly provide for a power to determine for cause it appears necessarily to follow that any implication of a power to dismiss at pleasure is excluded This appears to follow from the reasoning of the <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> A It may be conceded that in the absence of express limitation a public servant in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure It has however been made subject to the express provisions of the Constitution Act some of which are set out in the remaining sub sections of Section It follows of course that where office is held during pleasure and is terminated at pleasure no claim can possibly arise to salary or remuneration in respect of a period subsequent to such termination Section runs as follows Except as expressly provided by this Act every person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> in India or holds any civil post under the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed from the service of His Majesty by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Provided that this subsection shall not apply a where a person is dismissed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge or where an authority empowered to dismiss a person or reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason to be recorded by that authority in writing it is not reasonably practicable to give to that person an opportunity of showing cause Notwithstanding that a person holding a civil post under the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure any contract under which a person not being a member of a civil service of the <ORG> in India is appointed under this Act to hold such a post may if the Governor General or as the case may be the Governor deems it necessary in order to secure the services of a person having special qualifications provide for the payment to him of compensation if before the expiration of an agreed period that post is abolished or he is for reasons not connected with any misconduct on his part required to vacate that post Sub sections and are statutory limitations upon the right of the <ORG> to dismiss its servants at will There is nothing in the language of the section that compels us so to limit the relief that ought to follow upon contravention of its provisions It is manifest that the stipulation or proviso as to dismissal is itself of statutory force and stands on a footing quite other than any matters of rule which are of infinite variety and can be changed from time to time Where however <ORG> has intervened and has provided by statute for powers previously within the prerogative being exercised in a particular manner and subject to the limitations and provisions contained in the statute they can only be so exercised I agree that in all this legislation there is not a trace of a suggestion that the <ORG> was left free to ignore these statutory provisions and by its unfettered prerogative do the very things the statutes empowered the <ORG> to do but free from the conditions and restrictions imposed by the statutes It is quite obvious that it would be useless and meaningless for the <ORG> to impose restrictions and limitations upon and to attach conditions to the exercise by the <ORG> of the powers conferred by a statute if the <ORG> were free at its pleasure to disregard these provisions and by virtue of its prerogative do the very thing the statutes empowered it to do Whichever mode of expression be used the result intended to be indicated is I think the same namely that after the statute has been passed and while it is in force the thing it empowers the <ORG> to do can thenceforth only be done by and under the statute and subject to all the limitations restrictions and conditions by it imposed however unrestricted the Royal Prerogative may theretofore have been It is thus obvious that the prerogative right of the <ORG> to dismiss its servants at will having been given statutory form in Sub section of Section it can only be exercised subject to the limitations imposed by the remaining sub sections of that section and it must follow as a necessary consequence that if any of those limitations is contravened the public servant concerned has a right to maintain an action against the <ORG> for appropriate relief There is in our judgment no warrant for the proposition that that relief must be limited to a declaration and should not go beyond it It was urged that apart from the prerogative of the <ORG> to terminate the service of any of its servants at will there was the further prerogative that no servant of the <ORG> could maintain an action against the <ORG> to recover arrears of pay even after the pay had been earned and had become due and that this prerogative had been preserved in the case of India by Section of the Constitution Act Rule a debt owing or accruing from the <ORG> through the appropriate officer to Mr <NAME> in respect of salary unpaid While a study of the material sections of the various Government of India Acts might leave an Indian civil servant who was minded to take action against the <ORG> in respect of salary unpaid in very considerable doubt as to the appropriate officer to name as a defendant there is in my view nothing in any of those Acts which lends any colour to the suggestions that Indian civil servants have been placed in a more privileged position than other servants of the <ORG> in respect of rights of action arising out of their appointment or their conditions of service against the <ORG> through its appropriate officer or department The relevant portions of Section of the Civil Procedure Code of run as follows The following property is liable to attachment and sale in execution of a decree namely lands houses or other buildings goods money bank notes cheques bills of exchange hundis promissory notes Government securities bonds or other securities for money debts shares in a corporation and save as hereinafter mentioned all other saleable property moveable or immovcable belonging to the judgment debtor or over which or the profits of which he has a disposing power which he may exercise for his own benefit whether the same be held in the name of the judgment debtor or by another person in trust for him or on his behalf Provided that the following particulars shall not be liable to such attachment or sale namely i salary to the extent of the first hundred rupees and one half the remainder Provided that where such salary is the salary of a servant of the <ORG> or a servant of a railway company or local authority and the whole or any part of the portion of such salary liable to attachment has been under attachment whether continuously or intermittently for a total period of twenty four months such portion shall be exempt from attachment until the expiry of a further period of twelve months and where such attachment has been made in execution of one and the same decree shall be finally exempt from attachment in execution of that decree the pay and allowances of persons to whom the Indian Army Act or the Burma Army Act applies or of persons other than commissioned officers to whom the Naval Discipline Act as modified by the Indian Navy Discipline Act applies any allowance forming part of the emoluments of any servant of the <ORG> or of any servant of a railway company or local authority which the appropriate Government may by notification in the Official Gazette declare to be exempt from attachment and any subsistence grant or allowance made to any such servant while under suspension Explanation Attention may also be drawn to Order XXI Rule of the First Schedule to the Civil Procedure Code which prescribes the procedure for the attachment of the salary of a public servant For us to hold that while a creditor of a servant of the Crown was entitled as of right to compel the Crown to pay to him a substantial portion of the salary of such servant in satisfaction of a decree obtained against him the servant himself had no right to sue the Crown for recovery of arrears of pay would be to lend our authority to an absurd proposition against which we must guard ourselves The result is that the very Act containing Section itself confirms the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code above referred to Section must therefore be read not only with the sub sections following but also with the relevant provisions of the Civil Procedure Code We must accordingly conclude that a servant of the <ORG> in India has the right to maintain a suit for recovery of arrears of pay which have become due to him We agree with the learned Judges of <ORG> that the respondent was in this case entitled to a decree for arrears of pay It was urged on behalf of the appellant that the claim for arrears of pay was governed by Article and not by Article of Schedule I to the Limitation Act Article applies to suits for wages not otherwise provided for by the Schedule and covers in our judgment a suit to recover arrears of pay We do not see any warrant for placing so narrow a construction upon the word wages used in Article The word occurs in Article but that article is limited in its operation to suits for the wages of household servants artisans or labourers The period of limitation under this article is the same as under Article namely three years and it begins to run when the contract is broken or where there are successive breaches when the breach in respect of which the suit is instituted occurs or where the breach is continuing when it ceases It is obvious that if this was a case of breach of contract there were successive breaches at the end of each month and the respondent would still be entitled to recover arrears of pay which fell due within a period of three years before the institution of the suit In our judgment the period of limitation for a suit to recover arrears of pay is provided for in Article and Article is thus not applicable In <NAME> The North West Frontier Province this Court held that if a person holding a civil post under the <ORG> in India was ordered to be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed the order was inoperative and of no effect so far as the civil servant was concerned The question therefore is whether in the present case after such an inoperative order was served on the respondent he had a right to claim any salary in a Court of law against the <ORG> It was contended for the appellant that every civil servant except in special eases where it is otherwise provided by law held office under the <ORG> during His Majesty pleasure On behalf of the appellant it was argued that Section of the Constitution Act recognizes the principle that a civil servant holds office during His Majesty pleasure and that is a prerogative of the <ORG> If it formed part of the same prerogative Section recognised it and the <ORG> should therefore give effect to it It was contended that Section and limited the right of dismissal but did not give any remedy to the civil servant The salary is described in some English decisions as a bounty but I do not find any decision to support the contention that the option not to pay the salary is a prerogative of the <ORG> These observations support the view that the right to dismiss at pleasure is only an implied term of service under the <ORG> and not a special prerogative It is therefore necessary to ascertain from the words used in Section what the <ORG> intended to do Sub section puts one limitation on the power to dismiss and provides who can dismiss a civil servant Sub section contains a statutory provision of what steps should be taken before a civil servant could be dismissed It may be noted that under the <ORG> of India Act of there was no such provision in the Act itself The rules which were framed under the Act contained a similar provision In England it has been held that even if there was an express contract made by a representative of the <ORG> with the servant to employ him for a fixed number of years that provision was against public policy and the right to dismiss at His Majesty pleasure remained unaffected It will be meaningless to permit a contract for payment of compensation without there exising any remedy to enforce it If therefore under Sub section a suit is permissible there is no reason why a suit cannot be permitted to enforce the rights given under Sub sections and It was argued that the aggrieved person may file a suit to obtain a declaration that the provisions of Sub section and or were not complied with The argument that the privilege to the extent of the expressed words used in Sub sections and only was waived cannot be accepted because the same argument would prevent a suit being filed by the civil servant under Sub section as it does not expressly provide for enforcing the payment of compensation by a civil suit No decision of the English <ORG>s showing the effect of such provisions in a statute has been cited at the bar The provisions of Section of the Civil Procedure Code give a right to the creditor to attach the salary of a servant of the <ORG> There were similar provisions in the Civil Procedure Code of also It seems to me therefore that <ORG> has not accepted the principle that the <ORG> is not liable to pay its servant salary for the period he was in service as applicable to British India or as forming part of the doctrine that service under the <ORG> is at His Majesty pleasure I agree that the appeal should be dismissed with costs
