HEADNOTE The appellants who were carrying on business in tobacco had in their licenced warehouse considerable quantity of tobacco on February Clause of the Bill made provision for the amendment of the Central Excises and Salt Act by way of alteration of duties inter alia on unmanufactured tobacco by imposing an excise duty of annas per recoveries shall be made of all duties which have not been collected but which would have been collected if the amendment had so come into force The appellants challenged the legality of the demand on the grounds inter alia that excise duty was a tax on goods which must exist at the time when the tax was levied and it must have been intended and expected by the legislature that it would be passed on to the consumer and as the retrospective operation of the duties deprived the tax of these qualities they did not fall within the term duties of excise in Entry List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India and therefore of the Finance Act in so far as it imposed an excise duty retrospective before the date of its enactment was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> and the impugned levy contravened Art because a retrospective levy of an excise duty deprived the tax payer of the right of passing it on and recovering it from his buyer and that this constituted a restraint on the right to hold property which was not saved by cl of Art Per <NAME> Entry in List I deals with taxes on goods manufactured or produced while Entry in List II deals with the carrying on of trade i an activity in the nature of buying and selling and the Central Excises and Salt Act in its pith and substance relates to duty on goods manufactured or produced and has no relationship with Entry Clause of the Bill made provision for the amendment of the Central Excise Act Act of by way of alteration of duties on tobacco manufactured and unmanufactured and it also imposed a new duty of excise on biris varying from to annas per lb Section of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act Act XVI of enacted Where a bill introduced into the Indian Parliament provided for the imposition or increase of a duty of excise <ORG> might cause to be inserted in the bill a declaration that it was expedient in the public interest that any provision of the bill relating to such imposition or increase shall have immediate effect under this Act A declaration under this section was made in respect of the provision for imposing the duties on tobacco under cl of the bill already adverted to A declared provision shall have the force of law immediately on the expiry of the day on which the Bill containing it is introduced A declared provision shall cease to have the force of law under the provisions of this Act a When it comes into operation as an enactment with or without amendment or when the Central Government in pursuance of a motion passed by parlia ment directs by notification in the Official Gazette that it shall cease to have the force of law or if it has not already ceased to have the force of law under clause a or clause then on the expiry of the sixtieth day after the day on which the Bill containing it was introduced shall be deemed to have effect on and from the st March and accordingly a refund shall be made of all duties collected which would not have been collected if the amendment had come into force on that day and recoveries shall be made of all duties which have not been collected but which would have been collected if the amendment had so come into force which they filed in <ORG> at Nagpur urging that the retrospective operation given to by sub thereof was illegal ultra vires and unconstitutional and besides that the provision in of the Excise Rules which contained the machinery for enforcing the demand was not adequate to meet the situation arising out of the change in the law from the provisions of the bill to those of the Act This petition was heard by <ORG> of the Court and every contention raised by the appellants including that based on the adequacy of the new A to cover the present case was rejected Before proceeding further it is only necessary to state that there is no material difference between the facts of the cases covered by Civil Appeals as well as the points raised in the Writ Petitions and that this judgment will cover and dispose of the other appeals and the petitions We might also at this stage mention that other parties who were similarly situated as the appellants in Civil Appeals to of and who had filed petitions under Art Mr <NAME> learned Counsel who appeared for the appellants urged three point in support of the appeals Section of the Finance Act in so far as it imposed an excise duty retrospectively before the date of its enactment April was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> The contention on this head was briefly this The impugned tax was imposed by <ORG> in purported exercise of the power to levy a duty of excise on tobacco within Legislative Entry of Union list which reads Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except An excise was basically an indirect tax i a tax or duty not intended by the taxing authority to be borne by the person on whom it is imposed and from whom it is collected but is intended to be passed on to those who purchased the goods on which the duty was collected but when such a tax was imposed with retrospective effect it could not be passed on so such a levy deprived the tax of its essential characteristic of being indirect That the impugned levy was unconstitutional in that it contravened the fundamental right guaranteed to the citizens of India to hold property under Art the point urged being that a retrospective levy of an excise duty deprived the tax payer of the right of passing it on and recovering it from his buyer that this constituted a restraint on the right to hold property the amount of the tax levy conferred by Art We shall now proceed to consider these points in that order It had therefore in order that it might truly be duty of excise to satisfy two tests a It had to be an indirect tax i levied in such a manner that the person from whom the tax was collected was in a position to pass it on to those who acquired the goods from him or at least the taxing authority expected him to pass it on and laid no impediment on his ability to do it The same argument was Presented in a slightly different from by saying that though <ORG> generally speaking had the power to legislate in respect of everyone of the subjects included in the relevant legislative entries whether prospectively or retrospectively including legislation with regard to taxation still if the retrospective levy of a taxes altered its essential nature and identity then the power to legislate retrospectively would be open to <ORG> only if the tax in its altered from i a tax direct and personal would be open to <ORG> to impose In support of his submission regarding the nature of an excise duty and that meaning that ought to be attributed to the expression as it occurs in Entry of the union List Mr <NAME> placed before us judgments of <ORG> in appeals from Canada and some decisions of <ORG> and of <ORG> Similar passages in relation to a duty of excise being an indirect tax occur in other judgments of <ORG> to which learned Counsel drew our attention Of these it is sufficient to refer to one more Attorney General for British Columbia <ORG> which raised the question as to whether a tax which was imposed upon every consumer of fuel oil according to the quantity which he had consumed imposed by the Fuel Oil Tax Act of of British Columbia was a direct tax under head of the British North America Act Lord <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the Board referred to the passage from the judgment of Lord <NAME> in City of Halifax Fairbanks Estate just now quoted and went on to add The ultimate incidence of the tax in the sense of the political economist is to be disregarded but where the tax is imposed in respect of a transaction the taxing authority is indifferent as to which of the parties to the transaction ultimately bears the burden We consider that not much assistance could be derived from these decisions for the interpretation of the scope or content of the term duties of excise in Entry of the Union List As these expressions had a settled meaning in economic theory the <ORG> had necessarily to find out whether the particular tax imposed by the Province fell within the class of indirect taxes or not Here there is no question of direct and indirect taxation nor of the definition of specific and residuary powers Sir <NAME> in In re the Central Provinces and Berar Act XIV of speaking of the word excise as occurring in the legislative lists in the Government of India Act and for this purpose there is no variation in the lists in Schedule VII of the Constitution said Its primary and fundamental meaning in English is that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in the taxing country and intended for home consumption It was then contended on behalf of <ORG> that an excise duty is a duty which may be imposed upon home produced goods at any state from production to consumption and that therefore the federal legislative power extended to imposing excise duties at any stage The ultimate incidence of an excise duty a typical indirect tax must always be on the consumer who pays as he consumes or expends and it continues to be an excise duty that is a duty on home produced or home manufactured goods no matter at what stage it is collected As Lord <NAME> said in the decision to which reference has already been made after referring to the decision of <ORG> in the <NAME> case Consistently with this decision their Lordships are of opinion that a duty of excise primarily a duty levied on a manufacturer or producer in respect of the commodity manufactured or produced Before dealing with the Australian decision to which Mr <NAME> drew our attention we could conveniently dispose of the American cases which were referred to by the learned counsel bearing on the meaning of the word excise We might point out that the American decisions do not assist the appellant in the least since under the Constitution of the United States practically every tax other than a capitation a poll tax or a tax on land is termed an excise duty and even income tax was held to be an excise until the decision of <ORG> of the United States in <NAME> <ORG> It has to be borne in mind that the American Constitution provides that direct taxes have to be apportioned among the States according to their respective populations Art Mr <NAME> referred us to some of the decisions in Australia and in particular to <ORG> Victoria in support of his submission that the characteristic of being an indirect tax and therefore the capability of being passed on was an essential ingredient and pre requisite of an excise duty We should be disposed to say on the contrary that in Australia all taxes on the sale of commodities are or may be regarded as duties of excise Under the Australian Constitution power to impose duties of excise is as we have said the exclusive right of <ORG> the residuary taxing power remains in the States In the Indian Constitution Act the whole of the taxing power in this particular sphere is expressly apportioned between the <ORG> and the Provinces to the one being assigned the power to impose duties of excise to the other taxes on the sale of goods As regards the general proposition however there is little controversy but these decisions did not lay down that if by reason of the tax being levied retrospectively the duty cannot be passed on it ceased to be a duty of excise On the other hand there is express and high authority for the position that a duty of excise could be validly levied with retrospective effect under the Australian Constitution The question for consideration before <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> related to the constitutional validity of the Excise Tariff Act passed by <ORG> Lord <NAME> delivering the judgment of the Board observed It is a little difficult to understand the first point taken by the appellants The <ORG> had undoubted power to impose taxation under the express words of of the Constitution and it is not now disputed that the <ORG> could if it thought fit make the Act retrospective and impose the duties from the date of the resolution There was nothing therefore in either the subject matter of the Act or in the mode of dealing with it which was beyond the power of the <ORG> In our opinion the above aptly describes and covers the point raised by the appellants in the appeals now before us There is no doubt that excise duties have been referred to by the economists and in the judgments of <ORG> as well as in the Australian decisions as an instance of an indirect tax but in construing the expression duty of excise as it occurs in Entry we are not concerned so much with whether the tax is direct or indirect as upon the transaction or activity on which it is imposed In this context one has to bear in mind the fact that the challenge to the legislative competence of the tax levy is not directed to the imposition as a whole but to a very limited and restricted part of it For instance the state of the market might be such that the duty imposed upon and collected from the producer or manufacturer might not be capable of being passed on to buyers from him Learned Counsel urged that this would not matter as one had to have regard to the general tendency of the tax and the expectation of the taxing authority and to the possibility of its being passed on and not to the facts of any particular case which impeded the operation of natural economic forces We do not think that there is any substance in this contention The provisions of the impugned enactment have to be read in the light of A of the Sale of Goods Act which enacts In the event of any duty of customs or excise on any goods being imposed increased decreased or remitted after the making of any contract for the sale of such goods without stipulation as to the payment of duty where duty was not chargeable at the time of the making of the contract or for the sale of such goods duty paid where duty was chargeable at that time a if such imposition or increase so takes effect that the duty or increased duty as the case may be or any part thereof is paid the seller may add so much to the contract price as will be equivalent to the amount paid in respect of such duty or increase of duty and he shall be entitled to be paid and to sue for and recover such addition and if such decrease or remission so takes effect that the decreased duty only or no duty as the case may be is paid the buyer may deduct so much from the contract price as will be equivalent to the decrease of duty or remitted duty and he shall not be liable to pay or be sued for or in respect of such deduction The question as to the scope of of the Tariff Act of came up for consideration before a Bench of <ORG> whose decision is reported in <NAME> <NAME> The transaction of sale between the plaintiff and the defendant took place on March and the price payable by the plaintiff was based on the rate of duty prevailing on that date The learned Judges held that on the terms of of the Tariff Act of indentical with A of the Sale of Goods Act the fact that the contract was no longer executory but that delivery had been made and the price paid was no bar to the plaintiff succeeding in his suit It will be seen that A is in two parts the first cl a dealing with the case of an increase in duty and conferring on the seller the right to recover the amount of the increased duty from the buyer and the second limb cl Whatever argument might be raised baned upon the language of the second limb of the section it is not open to doubt that in the case of an increase in duty the seller would be entitled to recover the duty from the buyer provided a there was no contract to the contrary by which he had precluded himself from claiming such enhanced duty i the contract having negatived or limited the seller right to prefer such a claim or was at least silent as regards what was to happen in the event of the duty being increased the change in the rate of duty was effected after the date of the contract He urged that being a tax levied on goods notwithstanding that it was collected from the producer or manufacturer it followed that the essential attribute or characteristic of that duty was that the producer or manufacturer must own or have possession and control over the goods at the moment of the levy Besides it may also be pointed out that even in strict theory there is no basis for the submission now under consideration To deny this would in effect deny the legal effect of the tax being imposed retrospectively and fictionally deemed to be in force on an earlier date In dealing with the arguments of learned Counsel on the scope and content of Entry of the Constitution and of the meaning of the expression duty of excise in that entry we have also covered the special argument questioning the right of <ORG> to impose retrospectively a duty of excise It was conceded that <ORG> has power to enact laws with retrospective effect and as it was not suggested that laws dealing with taxation are any exception to that rule the only ground upon which the learned Counsel could rest this submission was that being an indirect tax capability of being passed on was an essential characteristic or requirement of a duty of excise and so its imposition with retrospective effect deprived it of that essential character and therefore rendered it a duty of a different nature and for that reasons a retrospective imposition of an excise duty was not permissible For the reasons already stated we find no substance in this form of argument either and we have no hesitation in rejecting it the right to hold property and was not saved by Art i because the law contemplated by that sub article was a valid law for the imposition of a tax which satisfied the requirements both of legislative competence and of the rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution A law which imposes a tax and provides for its levy and collection is as much a law as a law under other non taxation entries of the legislative list All laws including laws imposing taxes are within Part III of the Constitution being laws under Art and that such laws were not governed by Part III of the Constitution and specially because the money sought to be taken by the State as tax by virtue of a fiscal enactment was not property within Art and that the expression laws for the purpose of imposing a tax used in Art merely enacts that all taxation the imposition levy and collection shall be by law and that the Article beyond excluding purely executive action does not by itself lay down any criterion for determining the validity of such a law to justify any contention that the criteria laid down exclude others to be found elsewhere in the Constitution for laws in general We do not understand these decisions as laying down any such broad proposition We are further satisfied that the learned Judges could not have meant that if a law imposing a tax was outside the legislative competence of the legislature enacting it as the argument before us appeared to suggest it could be a law under which a person could be deprived of his property under Art In all these cases the legislation imposing the tax or the fee which had been held not to have been within the legislative competence of the authority imposing the tax or the fee was struck down on the ground that those laws violated the freedom guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution Learned Counsel laid some stress on the fact that in these cases the tax or fee was held to be unconstitutional as imposing an unreasonable restraint on the right to carry on a trade or business guaranteed by Art and not as an infringement of the right to hold property under Art But this is not to say that the burden of a tax that may be constitutionally laid upon an individual needs to be justified by a showing that he individually will receive benefit from the expenditure of the proceeds of the tax and much less that the degree of that burden may be measured by the amount of benefit that the tax payer is excepted to receive In fact in <NAME> State of Kerala already referred to certain provisions of the Act therein challenged which prescribed the procedure for the levy of the tax were struck down on the ground of being obnoxious to Art Having regard to the very limited controversy before us we do not consider it necessary to embark on any further or more detailed examination of this question except to say that we cannot accept the argument of the learned Additional Solicitor General that by reason of Art In support of the submission that a tax levied with retrospective effect was unconstitutional as being an unreasonable restriction on this right to hold property Art Learned Counsel also referred us to a few later decisions of <ORG> in which retrospective taxation has been held arbitrary and capricious and to amount to a violation of the due process clause contained in the th Amendment In regard to these decisions two points have to be noted that the decisions of <ORG> of the United States are not uniform and there are undoubtedly decisions of the <ORG> of a later date which speak the other way And the present status of <NAME> <NAME> is not entirely clear Since the <NAME> case can be distinguished on its facts it may well give way In any event it would seem that after the <NAME> case no application of the estate tax can be successfully resisted on the score of retroactivity Any classification for taxation is permissible which has reasonable relation to a legitimate end of governmental action A tax may be levied for past privileges and protection as well as for those to come and Justice <NAME> made the added observations which have been repeatedly quoted in later decisions as well as in text books For more than half a century it has been settled that a law of <ORG> imposing a tax may be retroactive in its operation Each of the fifteen income tax acts adopted from time to time during the last sixty seven years has been retroactive in that it applied to income earned prior to the passage of the act during the calendar year mere retrospectivity in the imposition of the tax cannot per se render the Law unconstitutional on the ground of its infringing the right to hold property under Art Such unauthorised imposition would undoubtedly not be a reasonable restriction on the right to hold property beside being an unreasonable restraint on the carrying on of business if the tax in question is one which is laid on a person in respect of his business activity This restriction or impairment of his right to pass on the duty he urged rendered the restriction imposed on him in the shape of the obligation to pay the duty unreasonable but his submission was that it lacked the character of reasonableness because it deprived him of the right to pass on the tax to others It would be seen that it is the same argument as was presented to challenge the legislative competence of <ORG> to enact the legislation If notwithstanding that according to economic theory or doctrines propounded by economists a duty of excise does not cease to be such merely because it is imposed at a time or in circumstances as pointed out earlier in conjunction with a system of price control in which it cannot be passed on one fails to see any substance in the argument that the imposition of such a tax is an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of the fundamental rights to hold property guaranteed by Art Recovery of duties or charges short levied or erroneously refunded When duties or charges have been short levied through inadvertence error collusion or misconstruction on the part of an officer or through mis statement as to the quantity description or value of such goods on the part of the owner or when any such duty or charge after having been levied has been owing to any such cause erroneously refunded the person chargeable with the duty or charge so short levied or to whom such refund has been erroneously made shall pay the deficiency or repay the amount paid to him in excess as the case may be on written demand by the proper officer being made within three months from the date on which the duty or charge was paid or adjusted in the owners account current if any or from the date of making the refund which are set out in this rule and that consequently there was a defect in the operative machinery for collection of the refund We consider therefore that there is no substance in the objection that A is not wide enough to cover the recovery of the duty from the appellants Thereupon the appellants filed a petition under Art The appellants again filed a petition in <ORG> which was decided against them and against that judgment the appellants have come to this court on a certificate under Art Counsel for the appellants has raised two questions against the legality of the taxes The <ORG> had no power to make a retrospective legislation while making a law under item of List I so as to affect goods that had been cleared from the warehouses after payment of proper duties at the rates prevailing on the date that the goods were cleared because a <ORG> power to make retrospective laws is subject to constitutional limitations namely the language of item of List I duty of excise as defined in the Constitution and its nature and character is such that it is not capable of being exercised after the goods on which it is imposed are no longer in possession of the warehousemen and after they have passed into the common stock of the country legislation of this character imposes an unreasonable restriction under Art Item of List I provides Item Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India In the corresponding item under the Government of India Act the same language was used so that the nature of the duties remains the same both under the Constitution and under the Government of India Act Section of the Act empowers the levying of duties specified in the First Scheduled By of the Act retrospective effect was given to the duties imposed by the Finance Act taking effect as and from the First day of March It was argued that Excise Duty is a tax on goods which must exist at the time when the tax is levied and it must have been intended and expected by the legislature that it will be passed on to the consumer and as retrospective operation of such duties has not got these qualities when the goods are no longer in possession of the person sought to be taxed they do not fall within the term duty of excise and therefore they are beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> Hence there is no question of direct and indirect taxation The Indian Constitution is unlike any that have been called to their Lordships notice in that it contains what purports to be an exhaustive enunciation and division of legislative powers between the Federal and <ORG> Legislatures In England it was later on extended to comprise other taxes but the fundamental conception of the term is that it is a tax on articles produced or manufactured in the country <NAME> <NAME> after referring to the distionary meaning of the word excise said at But its primary and fundamental meaning in English is still that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in the taxing country and intended for home consumption I am satisfied that is also its primary and fundamental meaning in India and no one has suggested that it has any other meaning in entry No It is not denied that laws are to be found which impose duties of excise at stages subsequent to manufacture or production but so far as I am aware in none of the cases in which any question with regard to such a law has arisen was it necessary to consider the existence of a competing legislative power such as appears in entry No But Mr <NAME> relied on the observations of the learned Chief Justice at where he said Thus <ORG> will have the power to impose duties on excisable articles before they become part of the general stock of the Province that is to say at the stage of manufacture or production and <ORG> an exclusive power to impose a tax on sales thereafter But these observations only mean this that when there is a competition between the duty imposed at the stage of manufacture of production and a tax imposed on sales thereafter the sphere of the Central and <ORG> comes into operation but as the previous passages show it does not in any manner vary the meaning of the word excise nor does it accept a further qualification which is sought to be included in that phrase as a necessary quality of that tax that unless it is capable of being passed on to the consumer or the person taxed can indemnify himself it is not a duty of excise Again at <NAME> said The essence of a tax on goods manufactured or produced is that the right to levy it accrues by virtue of their manufacture or production If a duty is imposed on the goods manufactured or produced when they issue from the manufactory then the duty becomes leviable independently of the purpose for which they leave it and irrespective of what happens to them later <NAME> Sons <NAME> again went into the question of the nature of the duty of excise under the expression duties of excise and said at There is in theory nothing to prevent <ORG> from imposing a duty of excise on a commodity as soon as it comes into existence no matter what happens to it afterwards whether it be sold consumed destroyed or given away A taxing authority will not ordinarily impose such a duty because it is much more convenient administratively to collect the duty as in the case of most of the Indian Excise Acts when the commodity leaves the factory for the first time and also because the duty is intended to be an indirect duty which the manufacturer or producer is to pass on to the ultimate consumer which he could not do if the commodity had for example been destroyed in the factory itself It is the fact of manufacture which attracts the duty even though it may be collected later and we may draw attention to the Sugar Excise Act in which it is specially provided that the duty is payable not only in respect of sugar which is issued from the factory but also in respect of sugar which is consumed within the factory <ORG> described the nature of the duty of Excise in Governor General in Council <ORG> as a duty which is primarily levied on a manufacturer or producer in respect of the commodity manufactured or produced That this is so is clearly exemplified in those excepted cases in which the <ORG> not the <ORG> legislature has power to impose a duty of excise In dealing with excise duty there is no mention of a direct or indirect taxes <ORG> has avoided this incidence to be characteristic of the tax taxable event is the manufacture or production of goods it is immaterial what happens to them afterwards whether they are sold consumed destroyed or given away it is not a necessary incidence that the manufacturer must be able to pass it on to the consumer or indemnify himself the general tendency of its being passed on may be there but it may be prohibited by the circumstances economic or otherwise and of the Constitution read with the relevant entry in List I of Schedule VII <ORG> is empowered to make laws with regard to taxes and no limitation or restriction is imposed in regard to retrospective legislation In view of what has been said above the cases decided in Canada or Australia cannot have any application The word trade in item of List II has reference to the carrying on of an activity in the nature of buying and selling and may in a different context mean a calling or an industry Therefore reading the two items together it is obvious that item deals with taxes on goods manufactured or produced and item deals with the carrying on of trade i an activity in the nature of buying and selling and the Act in its pith and substance relates to duty on goods manufactured or produced and has no relationship with item of List II Even assuming that the nature and tendency of the duty of Excise is as contended by Mr <NAME> that it can be passed on to the consumer even than the complaint of the appellants that they have been deprived of that opportunity is not well founded because of A of the Indian Sale of Goods Act which was in the Indian Tariff Act In the event of any duty of customs or excise on any goods being imposed increased decreased or remitted after the making of any contract for the sale of such goods without stipulation as to the payment of duty where duty was not chargeable at the time of the making of the contract or for the sale of such goods duty paid where duty was chargeable at that time a if such imposition or increase so takes effect that the duty or increased duty as the case may be or any part thereof is paid the seller may add so much to the contract price as will be equivalent to the amount paid in respect of such duty or increase of duty and he shall be entitled to be paid and to sue for and recover such addition and if such decrease or remission so takes effect that the decreased duty only or no duty as the case may be is paid the buyer may deduct so much from the contract price as will be equivalent to the decrease of duty or remitted duty and he shall not be liable to pay or be sued for or in respect of such deduction This section provides for the recovery by the seller of the amount of increase in duty from the purchaser where the increase takes effect subsequent to the contract and for the right of the purchaser to recover from the seller the duty in cases where there is a similar decrease and this right exists both before the delivery is given taken and price received or paid as the case may be Narayanan Chettiar Kidar Sahib In that case the Government duty had not been reduced but the Buyer claimed that it had constructively been decreased because the tariff valuation had been reduced and so constructively it must be reckoned that there was a decrease in the duty on the goods sold This contention was negatived by <ORG> and it was held that a change of duty means a change in the rate of duty and not a change of tariff value The grounds of attack may be stated in this way that the nature of an excise duty is such that normally it is passed on to the purchaser by the manufacturer or the producer and it has that tendency and quality as the impugned duty was enhanced at a time when the appellants had cleared their goods after paying the then prevailing duty it was not possible for them to realize the excise duty from any purchaser and at the time of the clearance of the goods the appellants had paid all the taxes under the then existing law and the new liability rendered them liable to pay an illegal exaction or in the alternative to suffer the consequences of non payment which are of a drastic nature <NAME> on Constitutional Law The power of taxation is one so unlimited in force and so searching in extent that the courts scarcely venture to declare that it is subject to any restrictions whatever except such as rest in the discretion of the authority which exercises it Chief Justice <NAME> said in <NAME> Maryland The power of taxing the people and their property is essential to the very existence of government and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which the government may choose to carry it The only security against the abuse of this power is found in the structure of the government itself Thus according to American view the power to tax is an attribute of sovereignty tax is an rateable contribution of each individual in a State towards the amount of revenue which is essential for the existence and operation of a public governing body it being essential for the very existence of an organised State it may be exercised on objects to the utmost extent to which the legislature may choose to carry it and the needs of the revenue are only known to the legislature and the court cannot enquire into the necessity of imposing a tax or the objects on which the imposition should be made or the extent of the imposition But there are other forms of taxation whose retroactive imposition cannot be said to be similarly offensive because their incidence is not on the voluntary act of the taxpayer and which deal with rights of property and in Arts Article guarantees personal freedoms subject to certain restrictions All citizens shall have the right to acquire hold and dispose of property Art Nothing in sub clauses and of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said sub clauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe If the appellants contention is sustained then it will mean the deprivation of <ORG> of its right to choose the objects of taxation and therefore <ORG> will only vary the rates of duties proposed by the <ORG> or the time of their effectiveness at the peril of their being declared invalid although they may be within its legislative competence and may in its opinion be necessary for the carrying out of its policies or subserve the proper governance of the country In the Indian Constitution there is an exhaustive enunciation and distribution of legislative powers including powers as to taxation between the <ORG> and <ORG> Article is in Chapter XII and provides No tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law which means that all taxation has to be under a law enacted by a legislature of competent jurisdiction and subject to constitutional limitations In the latter case it was also held that the Indian Constitution recognises no fundamental right to immunity from taxation and that is why presumably no constitutional protection is provided against the exercise of that power There was no similar provision in the corresponding chapter of the Government of India Act If collection of taxes amounts to deprivation of property within the meaning of article then there was no point in making a separate provision again as has been made in article In our opinion the protection against imposition and collection of taxes save by authority of law directly comes from article and is not secured by clause of article All that we wish to state is that this application in so far as it purports to be founded on article read with article to this court is misconceived and must fail But it is important to notice that the Article which was sought to be applied in those cases was Art which deals with deprivation of property and not Art In <NAME> <ORG> the assault was not against the imposition or the vires of the tax but against the vires of A of the Indian Income tax Act which empowers the Commissioner of Income tax to transfer any case from one Income tax Officer subordinate to him to another and empowers <ORG> to transfer any case from one Income tax officer to another It was held that the discretion vested in the authorities empowered to make the transfer is not discriminatory and there was no interference with the right of the citizen to carry on his trade or calling It was held that if a tax is levied without due legal authority on any trade or business then it is open to the citizen to approach this Court under Art since his right to carry on trade is violated or infringed by the imposition of the tax and Art There again the taxation law itself was not challenged on the ground of violation of any fundamental right which has reference to property but the imposition of the tax was assailed on the ground that it was not imposeable on the transactions which had been entered into In all these cases relied upon by counsel for the appellants the basis of attack was that the tax was not within the legislative competence of the legislature imposing the tax and therefore the tax was being illegally recovered from the assessee or an objection was taken to the differential mode of imposition and collection and use of a more stringent procedure i illegal discrimination between persons similarly situated under Taxation on Income Investigation Commission Act The imposion of an illegal tax not within the legislative competence of the legislature a colourable piece of legislature imposing a tax which is not a tax but is an imposition of a confiscatory nature a breach of principles of natural justice or imposing an unimposeable tax have all been held to be violative of the right to carry on trade under Art These cases do not support the proposition which has been contended for by the appellants that the very imposition of the tax is a contravention of the right of the assessee to acquire hold or own or dispose of property or on the ground of contravention of Art It was held in that case <NAME> case that all laws within Art are subject to Part III and that for a law to be valid it must satisfy two tests of being enacted by a legislature having legislative competence and it should not contravene any of the fundamental rights The reasons given by the learned Chief Justice were a In the procedure to be adopted for the levying of the tax there was no provision for a notice to be given to the assessee There was no procedure for rectification of mistakes committed by the assessing authorities There is no procedure for obtaining the opinion of a superior Civil Court on a question of law as is generally found in all taxing stautes No duty was cast upon the assessing authority to act judicially and There was no right of appeal provided to the assessee because its procedural part made no provision for giving a hearing to the assessees or for appeal nor was <ORG> required to act judicially and the imposition though called a tax was in effect confiscatory and therefore a colourable piece of legislation and if it contravened Art it was liable to be struck down and that such law must also pass the test of the limitations prescribed in Part III of the Constitution but it did not lay down that all Articles in Part III would be applicable to taxation laws nor did it decide contrary to <NAME> case that Art was intended to limit the powers of the <ORG> to impose taxes and thus to discharge its duty in regard to country financial needs and policies allows the enacting of laws which impose reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public It must have relation to the existence of the thing to be regulated Therefore where an Act is deprivatory as the imposition of a tax is it cannot fall within Art the right to hold or dispose of it perishes with it and Art Fourthly The power to tax is an attribute of sovereignty and it is an accepted principle that the exercise of that power is not subject to judicial control because no Constitutional Government can exist without the power to raise money for its needs and the only security against abuse is in the structure of the Government There is no indication that the Indian Constitution has rejected or modified the American concept of the sovereignty of the <ORG> in regard to the power of taxation Fifthly Article declares the right of a citizen and cl prescribes its limits It would seem therefore that the reasonableness of tax laws is not justiciable and therefore they cannot fall within clause of Art This will violate the very principles of due process relied upon by the appellants Seventhly In American due process which has a variable concept has not been applied to retrospective operation of tax laws except to tax on voluntary gifts of property and that also was doubted in <NAME> <NAME> a case of inter <ORG> trade and <ORG> case which was also a case of inter <ORG> trade and some of the provision of the impugned Act there were held to be unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on trade and <NAME> case a case dealing with the imposition of the restriction on the right to purchase except through a particular society were not cases in which the imposition of a tax was challenged on the ground of infringement of Art I therefore agree that appeals be dismissed with costs
