The plaintiff present appellant obtained a decree in which it was directed inter alia that the present respondents Nos and should pay him a sum of over Rs The present appellant having purchased the land at the sale held in execution of the decree attempted to get possession but was obstructed by the first second third and fourth respondents The District Judge held that the order relating to him must be considered to have been passed under Section Civil Procedure Code and that there was consequently no appeal against that order The fourth respondent claims under an alienation made by the defendants Nos to in Original Suit No of after the date of the decree in that suit As this respondent is not a judgment debtor and as it has not been shown that he has resisted the attempt of the appellant to get possession on behalf of any one of the judgment debtors it must be held that his case comes under Section of the Civil Procedure Code and that there was consequently no appeal against the order of the District Munsif in so far as it related to him The District Judge has further held that there is no appeal against the order of the District Munsif in so far as it affects respondents Nos and It would be impossible to hold that having been a party to the decree he ceased to be a party because he purchased the property at the sale held in execution This second appeal is dismissed with costs The decree holder in execution of his decree which directed the sale of certain properties mortgaged to him by defendants Nos and and the ancestors of defendants Nos and subject to a prior charge thereon of Rs In my opinion the question thus raised between the decree holder purchaser and the said defendants relates within the meaning of Section Civil Procedure Code to the execution or enforcement of the decree against those defendants and the order appealed against is not the less an order under Section because it is also passed under Sections and neither of which is specified in Section
