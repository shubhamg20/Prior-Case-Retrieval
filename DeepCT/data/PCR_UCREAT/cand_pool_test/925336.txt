We are dealing in this case with two appeals Nos Amarpur is a village or a small town in the Bulandshahr district and seems to be one of the twelve villages which go under the collective name of Bara Basti With very few exceptions all the hundred and twenty men who were tried by the learned Sessions Judge the appeals of many of whom are now before us were Mahomedans while it will be seen from the evidence when we come to deal with it that all the victims of the disturbance which took place were Hindus While we think that it does bear out the view formed by the learned Judge that there was ill feeling between them we ourselves hesitate to pursue it very far or to deal with it at length in this judgment because we take the view that although in assessing the value of the evidence it is a matter always to be borne in mind it cannot serve as a substitute for a critical examination of the evidence itself We shall have occasion during the course of this judgment to say that in this and in other respects the learned Judge has adopted a number of altogether arbitrary tests in weighing the evidence and in our view this is one of the matters in which it is possible that he has allowed himself to be unduly influenced by the surrounding atmosphere It cannot be said that the riot was not of a communal nature at all but it was essentially a quarrel between the Mahomedans on the one side assisted by a few low caste Hindus and a section of the Hindu community namely the Vaishes on the other the root cause being economic rather than religious It would thus appear that the rioters were less inspired by fanatical fury against the Hindus as such than by a desire to loot and plunder the Banias These eight men were all charged in respect of this incident at the temple as well as in respect of their general participation in the disturbance which took place later at the bazar A volume of evidence has been directed against them which we shall have occasion to deal with later To put the matter shortly we have therefore to deal with a situation on this morning in which an attack was made by eight men on the temple at about seven in the morning and in which about an hour later there is said to have been a general looting of the bazar by two crowds of Mahomedans We regret that the charge of criminal conspiracy was ever raised but we have no doubt that it was designed to be used as a means of bringing the crime home to this very large number of accused persons by means other than direct proof of their individual share in the events of this morning The next charge against the respondents is a uniform charge under Sections and Penal Code read with Section In many cases there is evidence before us of individual acts by individual appellants who were seen and recognized among the crowds Apart from specific evidence relating to the injuries inflicted upon <NAME> and <NAME> at the temple there is very little evidence of the individual beating in the bazar and therefore Section is consistently relied upon to support this charge against the majority of the appellants There is only one instance of anything being burnt and we think it right to say straightway that so far as all the respondents are concerned against whom there is no specific evidence of their having individually taken part in that incident we fail to see how any charge of arson can be established against them Finally there are charges under Sections and I founded on the alleged defilement of the Shiva temple at A in the morning by the men who entered with shoes on their feet and the alleged disturbance by them of the worship taking place there It is wholly unreasonable as we think to suggest that there was any common intention to defile the temple or to disturb its worship running through the whole of the incidents of this day and common to all those who took part in them We now propose to deal particularly with the incident at the temple and the appeals against the eight respondents who are said to have been involved in it and and and have been sentenced to the terms of punishment to which we have drawn attention But we have come to the conclusion upon the best consideration of the evidence that we have been capable of giving it that it would be unsafe to disturb the finding of the learned Judge He says he left for fear of darogah and if so he himself may have had a guilty conscience Even <NAME> failed to tell the darogah what he had seen of the temple incident when he had an opportunity of doing so on the th Whatever might have been our view had we had an opportunity of seeing and hearing the witnesses ourselves we think that in this case we should not be doing right by substituting a judgment of our own for that formed by the learned Sessions Judge as to the credibility of the eye witnesses For the purpose of Section we have no doubt that three persons gathered together for purposes of worship are sufficient to constitute an assembly We agree with the learned Sessions Judge in not convicting them under Section because in our view there is insufficient proof as to what constitute the temple precincts which ought to be regarded as sacred It will be remembered that those sentences are respectively one month under Section one week under Section and three months under Section all to run concurrently We have now to consider the cases of the respondents in so far as they relate to the bazar incidents as distinct from the affair at the temple We have already said that we can find no reason to treat the temple and the bazar incidents as one transaction so as necessarily to implicate whether under Section I We have already had occasion to observe the method of assessment of the value of evidence adopted by the learned Judge We could hardly have deprecated this display of industry had it been followed at any stage by a critical examination of their evidence on its merits nor do we desire it to be thought that we consider such considerations as the relationship of witnesses to complainants and so forth as matters entirely to be ignored Complainants themselves are contemptuously dismissed as on that account unreliable notwithstanding the fact that in many cases such as the identification of their own looted property they are the appropriate witnesses to give if not the only persons who can give the necessary evidence These methods have made our own task doubly difficult as we have had to examine with the minutest care the evidence of each witness without in most cases the assistance of any real expression of the Judge own views upon it For that reason we know of no other way in which we can adequately deal with the case than to take each individual respondent case and to deal with it separately Before dealing with the cases of the individual respondents there is one thing more we have to say in deference to Mr <NAME> able argument before us But it is in our view impossible to refuse to face the fact that there is a difference between the consideration of a case upon an appeal of this kind and its consideration when res integra in the Court below As <ORG> has pointed out in the first and fourth of the matters it has expressly alluded to <ORG> will be slow to disturb a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who has had opportunities for assessing the value of evidence which <ORG> has not had We have tried to adopt these principles in considering the cases of individual respondents in this appeal and we have been slow to disturb a finding of fact by the learned Judge except where we have come to the conclusion that notwithstanding the advantages enjoyed by him in seeing and hearing witnesses the conclusions he reached were wrong We shall now take the cases of individual respondents We shall in each case indicate only whether or not they ought in our judgment to have been found by the learned Judge on the evidence before him to have participated in the looting and we shall leave till later an exact discussion of what offences those who ought to have been convicted have been guilty of This man is one of those who are alleged to have taken part in the affair at the temple and in whose case we have already dismissed the appeal by the Government against his acquittal upon charges so far as they relate to that incident He was also acquitted at the trial of any participation in the bazar incidents and we have now to deal with the appeal in that respect also Mr <NAME> who appears on behalf of a large number of the respondents has argued that the document is not admissible in evidence for any purpose He says that A is not the first information report and that it is obvious on its face that it was not recorded as such The real point to be determined is whether on the particular facts of the case <NAME> statement given and recorded at the Basi police outpost at on th November was a statement made in the course of an investigation under the Code of Criminal Procedure A recorded a statement made in the course of the investigation We have to consider what is meant by the words in the course of As it seems to us it is to protect accused persons from being prejudiced by statements made to police officers who by reason of the fact that an investigation is known to be on foot at the time the statement is made may be in a position to influence the maker of it and on the other hand to protect accused persons from the prejudice at the hands of persons who in the knowledge that an investigation has already started are prepared to tell untruths It had in our opinion no reference at all to the investigation which had in fact begun from <NAME> We take the view that the words in the course of in the context of this Section import that the statement must be made as a step in a pending investigation to be used in that investigation He observes that there was no necessity for making a second report and that too at a different police station We do not find anything very extraordinary in this man movements nor in his making of the report as he was obviously unaware that any other report had been actually made and he was only doing what the zamindar had advised him to do Nor do we think it necessarily very strange that he had first gone to several villages in an attempt to get help There is nothing in his story as given in evidence in <ORG> which as we read it is prima facie untruthful Apart from this exhibit and the evidence of <NAME> himself there are only two witnesses who give evidence implicating this respondent one a boy of twelve years old who gave his statement to the police on th November and the other a Chamar named <NAME> who only made his statement to the investigating officer on st December His case therefore rests entirely on the evidence of eye witnesses There are only three witnesses against him a boy <NAME> aged or who is a nephew of the complainant <NAME> and who appeared to the learned Judge to be tutored another boy named <NAME> who is only twelve years old whose cross examination was not altogether reassuring and another witness <NAME> who admits to having very poor vision A the corroborative value of which we have already discussed and in addition there are ten eye witnesses against him We have had to examine the evidence of each eye witness in relation to each respondent individually For while any two or more men may well have been in a position to recognise a particular group of rioters and those only we cannot dismiss from our minds that where witnesses who have no obvious connexion with one another furnished lists and in particular long lists of identical people whom they say they have recognized among the looters there is a possibility that this identification is the result of collaboration between them rather than of actual observation There are no less than eye witnesses against him We are at a loss to understand upon what principle a complainant who after all is one of the persons most likely to know the facts should ex hypothesi be unworthy of belief It suffices to say that we can find nothing which prima facie discredits the evidence of such of them as the man we have just mentioned of <NAME> who had every opportunity to recognize the witness who broke into his own shop of <NAME> who made the report of <NAME> and of several others There is no evidence that this is not true and no attempt has been made to show that he was ever in his house between the th when the goods were stolen and the st when they were discovered For the reasons in respect of each of them which we have discussed at such length we have no doubt that they all individually took an active part in the looting that went on We do not think that we can reasonably come to any other conclusion It remains for us to consider the question of the sentences and in that connexion we shall take into our consideration the remaining application Revision No of on the part of the <ORG> for a review of the sentences passed by the learned <NAME> Judge In the ensuing sentences which we think fit to pass whether by way of revision of the sentences already passed by the learned Judge or upon the convictions which we ourselves have made we have in all cases taken into account that they have already passed some time in jail or in custody to six months rigorous imprisonment under Section read with Section I to six months rigorous imprisonment under Section read with Section I As to all the twenty seven men in whose cases we are allowing this appeal in respect of the looting in the bazaar and whose names we have set out above they each stand now convicted also under Section read with Section I We have carefully considered whether there is any ground other than in relation to Section upon which we can and ought to differentiate between them But on the whole we have come to the conclusion that there is no sufficient reason for us to differentiate between them The sentence which we think it proper to pass upon all of them except <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> in respect of the offence under Section read with Section I
