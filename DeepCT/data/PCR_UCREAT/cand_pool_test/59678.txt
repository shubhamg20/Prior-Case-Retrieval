In the present defendant No again moved the revenue authorities and finally the Commissioner passed on May an order that he did not consider it necessary to cancel the Prant Officer order dated September But again on July defendant No by an application moved the Commissioner to revise his own order dated May and on November the Commissioner passed the order that under Section of the Watan Act the Collector should pass such order as he thought fit regarding the rent to be paid on <ORG> The Collector accordingly passed on March the order that the fair rent of Rs The plaintiffs prayed a that the <ORG> should declare that the plaintiffs are Watandars of the Nagwand Patilki watan and that defendant No is not Watandar of the same watan and that the <ORG> should issue a permanent injunction to defendants Nos and that they should not recover from the plaintiffs more than assessment or judi payable on watan lands <ORG> Defendant No pleaded that the Court had no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the suit under Section a of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act that the suit was barred by limitation under Article of the Indian Limitation Act that the cause of action arose in when the request of the plaintiffs predecessor in title to be declared a Watandar was rejected that it also arose in when during an inquiry held for the determination of the custom of the watan as to service and the appointment of a representative Watandar it was decided that the plaintiffs predecessor in title was not a representative Watandar but held the watan land as tenant only that the allegation in paragraph of the plaint that the cause of action arose in was not true that the allegations in paragraphs and of the plaint that in the Patilki watan land in dispute was granted to the plaintiffs ancestor was not true and was denied that it was also denied that in or at any time thereafter the ancestor of defendant No ceased to be the Watandar or that the plaintiffs ancestor was appointed and recognised as a Watandar of the Patilki watan in dispute It was made by an officer duly authorized in that behalf and such a suit was within the prohibition of Section a of the Bombay Revenue Jurisdiction Act He came to the conclusion that when an order is made on a specific decision such as ia contained in Exhibit that a person is not a Watandar a person seeking to obtain a declaration from a civil <ORG> that the decision is bad certainly seeks to avoid that order and accordingly the suit was dismissed with costs It has been argued that the order made by the Commissioner on November to the Collector was ultra vires as he had no power to revise his own order of May But it would appear from the record of the proceedings before the Commissioner on that date that they were ex parte without hearing <NAME> and the Commissioner admitted that as <NAME> had not been given full opportunity of representing her case he reconsidered the matter on November after hearing pleaders for <NAME> and for respondents the present appellants We agree with the District Judge that this Court has no jurisdiction to set aside orders made under Sections and A and Section of the Watan Act But it is contended by the plaintiff that they would be entitled to ask the <ORG> to grant them the declaration they asked for in the plaint that they and not defendant No are the Watandars of the watan in question as against defendant No leaving out of consideration defendant No In the first place that would be striking out the main relief asked for in the plaint against both the defendants and would also entirely change the character of the suit It was there argued that the Secretary of <ORG> was merely a formal party and that it was merely a contest between two private parties does not come in the way of the plaintiff and the decisions of this Court that <ORG> has jurisdiction to entertain a suit to be declared a Watandar are really confined to cases of that class We agree with the conclusions arrived at by the learned Judges in that case Here the Commissioner has come to the conclusion that the appellants are not Watandars and if we were to deal with the case as if the Secretary of <ORG> were not a party and there was merely a private dispute between the appellants and defendant No as to whether the plaintiffs were Watandars we should be in effect passing judgment on the decision of the Commissioner and oven if we were of opinion that the plaintiffs were Watandara our decision would be of no value whatever to the plaintiffs as against <ORG> We see no reason therefore why we should alter the character of the suit which is we think beyond the jurisdiction of the <ORG> in order to enable the plaintiffs to try and obtain what as far as we can see would be an entirely useless declaration Therefore we dismiss the appeal with costs
