A person aggrieved by the decision of the appellate authority has a right to apply to <ORG> for revision Overruling the defendant munic ipality objection as regards the civil court jurisdic tion to entertain the suit the trial court decreed the suit In appeal it was contended in this Court by the plain tiffs that may bar a suit to challenge an act which was within the purview of the Act but it could not bar a suit to challenge an act which was outside the Act or the Rules and since in this case the defendant had no power to revise or reopen the assessment Such provision howev er does not exclude cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure ii questions of the correctness of the assessment apart from its constitution ality are for the decision of the authorities and a civil suit does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to be final or there is an express prohibition in the particular Act In either case the scheme of the par ticular Act must be examined because it is a relevant en quiry Both the Act and the Rules contain provisions ena bling the aggrieved party to challenge an illegal assessment or levy of double duty Assuming that neither of the two eventualities mentioned in occurred and therefore there was no justification for imposing double duty the error could be corrected only in the manner provided in the Act and by the authority pre scribed therein It had the power to assess and levy double duty If the appropriate authority while exercising its jurisdic tion anti power under the relevant provisions of the Act The instant case does not fall within the proposi tions in <NAME> case because not merely gives finality to the orders passed by the special tribunal but expressly provides that such orders shall not be questioned in any other manner or by any other authority than is pro vided in the Act Plaintiffs are a limited company having their registered office at Calcutta In respect of the articles which were imported by the retail shops at Jabalpur within the limits of the then <ORG> between April and March the plaintiffs had paid to <ORG> a sum of Rs Plaintiffs preferred an appeal against the decision of <ORG> to the Sub Divisional Officer Jabalpur who by an order dated July modified the decision of <ORG> by permitting them to charge the octroi duty on an amount which was less by than the retail price of the goods In conformity with the appellate order but under protest plaintiffs paid to <ORG> a sum of Rs Plaintiffs paid that amount too on September under protest Defendants had raised contentions both as regards the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain the suit and as regards limitation but <ORG> rejected those contentions and held that it had jurisdiction to entertain the Suit and that it was not barred by limitation On the ques tion of limitation <ORG> held that applying the special period of limitation provided in of the Cen tral Provinces and Berar Municipalities Act the suit was within limitation as regards the payment made by the plaintiffs on September but that it was barred by limitation as regards the payment made on August <ORG> has granted to both the parties a certificate to file an appeal to this Court under art The first question for consideration is whether the civil court has jurisdiction to entertain the suit brought by the plaintiffs Under rule framed by <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by ss and of that Act octroi duty was payable on the current price of articles which is equivalent to the cost price of the articles to the importer plus the cost of carriage and not the price prevailing in the local market Section of the Act of provides for appeal against the assessment or levy of any tax under the Act to the Deputy Commissioner or to such other officer as may be empowered by <ORG> in that behalf Section of the Act which bears directly on the question of jurisdiction reads thus No objection shall be taken to any valuation assessment or levy nor shah the liability of any person to Since the sub section expressly prohibits a challenge to a valuation assessment or levy in any other manner than is provided in this Act and since the Act has devised its own special machin ery for inquiring into and adjudicating upon such chal lenges the common remedy of a suit stands necessarily excluded and cannot be availed of by a person aggrieved by an order of assessment to octroi duty In <ORG> Hawkesford <NAME> referred to various classes of cases in which the jurisdiction of ordinary courts is excluded the third class of such cases being where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it In <ORG> case <ORG> was dealing with the provisions of the Sea <ORG> Act section whereof gave a right of appeal to the person aggrieved by any decision or order passed by the <ORG> Officers under that Act Section further gave the aggrieved person a right to make an application to <ORG> for revision of the appellate decision or order The last paragraph of section provided Every order passed in appeal under this section shall subject to the power of revision conferred by section re was no express exclusion of the civil courts Juris diction to entertain a suit challenging an order passed by a <ORG> Officer but <ORG> while recognis ing that the exclusion of the jurisdiction of civil courts was not to be readily inferred and that such exclusion must either be explicitly expressed or clearly implied observed that looking at the last paragraph of section of the Sea <ORG> Act it was difficult to conceive what further chal lenge of the order was intended to be excluded other than a challenge in <ORG> If a provision merely giving finality to an order could be construed as ousting the civil <ORG> jurisdiction of the Act which is far more expressive can legitimately be construed to have the same effect But counsel for the plaintiffs contends that cannot oust the civil <ORG> jurisdiction to entertain the present suit because the defendant have no power at all either under the Act or under the The appellants in <NAME> case filed a suit for recovery of excise tax paid by them under of the Central Provinces Municipalities Act on the ground that after the coming into force of A of the Government of India Act till January a tax in excess of Rs It was held by this Court by majority that since <ORG> had no authority to levy a tax beyond what was permitted by A of the Government of India Act or art of the Constitution were wholly without jurisdiction and therefore a suit for refund of tax recovered by the Municipality in violation of the constitutional provisions was maintainable Section of the Madhya Bharat Sales Tax Act provided that no assessment made and no order passed under the Act or the Rules made thereunder shall be called in question in any Court It was conceded by the State Government that the sales tax levied on the appellants was unconstitutional in view of art of the Constitution but it was contended that the civil Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appellants suit for refund of the tax in view of of the Act After an examination of various decisions including those to which we have referred in this judgment <NAME> who spoke for <ORG> formulated seven propositions bearing on the construction of statutes which expressly or by necessary implication bar the jurisdiction of civil Courts The st proposition states that where the statute gives a finality to the orders of the special tribunals <ORG> jurisdiction must be held to be excluded if there is adequate remedy to do what <ORG> would normally do in a suit Such provision however does not exclude those cases where the provisions of the particular Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure The th proposition which bears more appropriately on the instant case says that questions of the correctness of the assessment apart from its constitutionality are for the decision of the authorities and a civil suit does not lie if the orders of the authorities are declared to be final or there is an express prohibition in the particular Act barred by of the Act which provided to the extent material that no assessment made and no order passed under the Act or the Rules Observing that if the appropriate authority while exercising its jurisdiction and powers under the relevant provisions of the Act comes erroneously to the conclusion that a transaction which is an outside sale is not an outside sale and proceeds to levy sales tax on it its decision cannot be said to be without jurisdiction the <ORG> held that the suit was barred from the cognizance of the civil <ORG> In coming to this conclusion the <ORG> relied upon the decision in Firm and <NAME> sons The state of Andhra Pradesh which had taken the view while interpreting a similar provision in A of the Madras General Sales Tax The decision in Bharat Kala Bhandar supra was brought to the notice of the <ORG> in <ORG> supra case but that decision was distinguished on the ground that the provision which fell for construction therein was worded differently and as observed in <ORG> supra deci sions on other statutory provisions are not of materrial assistance except in so far as general principles of con struction are laid down If there were a provision which so provided or which could be so construed that provision would itself be unconstitutional In Kamla Mills supra case it was observed that if a statute creates a special right or liability pro vides for the determination of that right or liability by tribunals specially constituted in that behalf and lays down that all questions in regard to that right or liability shall exclusively determined by the tribunals so constitut ed it becomes pertinent to enquire whether remedies nor mally associated with actions a civil <ORG> are prescribed by the said statute or not If the <ORG> is satisfied that the Act provides no remedy for making a claim for the recov ery of an illegally collected tax the <ORG> might hesitate to construe a provision giving finality to the orders passed by the tribunals specially created by the Act as creating an absolute bar to the suit and if such a construction was not reasonably possible the <ORG> would be called upon to examine the constitutionality of the provision excluding the civil <ORG> jurisdiction in the light of arts According to the st proposition in <NAME> supra case if the statute gives finality to the orders passed by the special tribunals created by it <ORG> jurisdiction would be excluded if the statute provides adequate remedies to do what <ORG> are normally empowered to do in a suit These considerations make it neces sary to examine the relevant provisions of the Act of and the Rules framed thereunder with a view to seeing whether they provide adequate remedies to the aggrieved party to challenge a wrong or illegal exaction of octroi duty and whether correspondingly the authorities specially created by the Act have the power to do what civil Courts are generally empowered to do This inquiry is relevant even though of the Act does not merely say that orders passed by the special tribunals shall be final but provides that no objection shall be taken to any assessment levy etc Section provides that an appeal against the assessment or levy of or refusal to refund any tax under the Act shall lie to the Deputy Commissioner or to such other officer as may be empowered by the Provincial Govern ment in that behalf Sub section A of gives to the person aggrieved by the decision the appellate authority the right to apply to <ORG> for revision of the decision on the ground a that the decision is contrary to law or is repugnant to any principle of assessment of a tax or that the appellate authority has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law or has failed to exercise the jurisdiction vested in it by law Section empowers the appellate or revision authority to draw up a statement of the case and make a reference to <ORG> for its decision if any question as to the liability to assessment or as to the principle of assessment arises in the matter on which the authority entertains a reasonable doubt Then comes which by sub provides for a limitation of days for appeal and by sub lays down the injunction which is the bone of contentions in the instant case that no objection shall be taken to any valua tion assessment or levy nor shall the liability of any person to be taxed or assessed be questioned in any other manner or by any other authority than to is provided in the Act Section of the Act empowers <ORG> make rules regulating the assessment of taxes and for preventing evasion of assessment Section which appears under the heading Collection of taxes empowers the government to make rules regulating the collection of taxes including the prevention of evasion of payment and payment of lump sums in composition In exercise of the powers conferred by and and in supersession of the earlier rules <ORG> made rules for the assessment collection and refund of the octroi tax which were gazetted on April and were amended from time to time There is no constitutional prohibition to the assessment which is im peached in the instant case as there was in <ORG> supra <ORG> supra and <NAME> supra The tax imposed in those cases being unconstitu tional its levy as said by <NAME> who spoke for the majority in <ORG> supra was without a vestige or semblance of authority or even a shadow of right Secondly both the Act and the Rules contain provisions which we have noticed above enabling the aggrieved party effectively to challenge an illegal assessment or levy of double duty It had the power to assess and levy double duty Section of the Punjab Act provided that no refund of any tax shall be claimed by any person otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder It was held by this Court that the liability to pay terminal tax was created by the Act and since a remedy was given to the party aggrieved in the enforcement of that liability the suit for refund was not maintainable by reason of We would like to add that if the observations on which plaintiffs rely are to be understood literally they are contrary to the decision in <ORG> supra case where speaking for a seven Judge Bench <NAME> ob served that if the appropriate authority while exercising its jurisdiction and powers under the relevant provisions of the Act comes to an erroneous conclusion it cannot be said that the decision is without jurisdiction The st proposition refers to cases where the statute merely gives finality to orders proposition because of the Act does not merely give finality to the orders passed by the special tribunals The nd proposition deals in its first paragraph with cases where there is an express bar to the civil <ORG>s jurisdic tion The second paragraph of that proposition deals with cases where there is no express exclusion Not only that the Act of provides an effective remedy to an aggrieved party to challenge the assessment of octroi duty and to claim refund of duty illegally paid or recovered but the plaintiffs in fact availed themselves of these remedies In when <ORG> reopened and revised the past assessments by charging octroi duty on an amount which was only less than the retail price of the goods and when it levied double duty by way of penalty plaintiffs preferred an appeal against the decision of <ORG> to the Sub Divisional Officer Jabalpur who by an order dated July modified the decision of the <ORG> by asking them to charge octroi duty on an amount which was less by instead of than the retail price of the goods Considering that the defendants revised the assess ment after a lapse of time parties will bear their costs throughout
