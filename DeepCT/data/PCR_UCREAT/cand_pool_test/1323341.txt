Respondent No filed an application before the District Judge There was also a term for Payment of interest which was to be a half yearly payment It is alleged that after the payment of the first instalment the petitioner paid some amount against the second instalment It was also pleaded by the petitioner that as the factory had been closed for the last three years and it was not possible for him to pay the whole amount he should be granted the facility of instalments He placed reliance on the decision in <ORG> <ORG> Learned counsel also contended that although an appeal under Sub section of Section of the Act could be filed still on account of some ailment in the petitioner family no appeal could be filed but on that ground the petition could not be thrown out as apparently the learned District Judge has refused to exercise jurisdiction vested in him by law Section of the Act no doubt provides that <ORG> may by notice in writing demand the payment of full amount advanced to any industrial concern in the event of the happening of certain events and the clauses of this section provide for all those circumstances which will entitle the <ORG> to demand the whole amount Section of the Act provides the procedure for the recovery of the amount It was contended on reference to the statement of objects and reasons which was attached to the Bill of this Act when it was presented for enactment that the scheme of Section provides a special procedure for recovery of the amounts due to a <ORG> Section provides for an application by the <ORG> on the basis of which proceedings for recovery can bp launched any officer of <ORG> generally or specially authorized by the Board in this behalf may apply to the District Judge within the limits of whose jurisdiction the industrial concern carries on the whole or a substantial part of its business for one or more of the following reliefs namely a for an order for the sale of the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to <ORG> as security for the loan or advance or for transferring the management of the industrial concern to <ORG> or for an ad interim injunction restraining the industrial concern from transferring or removing its machinery or plant or equipment from the premises of the industrial concern without the permission of the Board where such removal is apprehended The three clauses of Sub section provide for various reliefs which the <ORG> can seek when it makes an application under this section Section of the Act prescribes the procedure after such an application has been filed before the District Judge At the same time as he passes an order under Sub section recorded by him calling upon it to show cause on a date to be specified in the notice why the ad interim order of attachment should not be made absolute or the injunction confirmed If no cause is shown on or before the date specified in the notice under Sub sections and Sub section of Section provides that a notice shall be issued to the industrial concern to show cause why the order passed should not be made absolute and along with this notice a copy of the order will also be sent This language was considered by <ORG> in AIR SC where it was held as under The question which really arises is whether by using the words in the manner provided in the Code of Civil Procedure in Section the <ORG> intended to include the provisions in the Code dealing with appeals There is no doubt that under the Code of Civil Procedure an order setting aside or refusing to set aside a sale in execution of a decree is appealable under XLIII Rule i It cannot therefore be doubted that when the <ORG> used this language to bring in the Code of Civil Procedure the relevant provisions of the Code were made applicable In AIR Pat a question arose about the jurisdiction of the District Judge under Section of the Industrial Finance Corporation Act which is more or less analogous to Section of the present Act and it was observed as under The question therefore that arises for our consideration is whether the proceedings under Section of the Act are the proceedings contemplated by Section of the Code Consequently it cannot be doubted that while enquiring into the claim as provided in subsection the District Judge ought to have investigated into the circumstances pleaded by the petitioner as he had jurisdiction under Order Rule Civil to consider the case of the petitioner Sub section of Section which provides the reliefs which the District Judge can grant is as under After making an investigation under Sub section the District Judge may a confirm the order of attachment and direct the sale of the attached property vary the order of attachment so as to release a portion of the property from attachment and direct the sale of the remainder of the attached property release the property from attachment confirm or dissolve the injunction or transfer the management of the industrial concern to <ORG> or reject the claim made in this behalf Provided that when making an order under Clause the District Judge may make such further orders as he thinks necessary to protect the interests of <ORG> and may apportion the costs of the proceedings in such manner as thinks fit Provided further that unless <ORG> intimates to the District Judge that it will not appeal against any order releasing any property from attachment such order shall not be given effect to until the expiry of the period fixed under Sub section within which an appeal may be preferred or if an appeal is preferred unless <ORG> otherwise directs until the appeal is disposed of These reliefs which a District Judge can grant while deciding an application under Section of the Act clearly go to show that the District Judge can also release a property from attachment and while so doing he can also pass orders for protecting the interests of <ORG> In AIR SC this question was considered by <ORG> and it was observed that An order under Section of the Income tax Act is not appealable It is true that a petition to revise the order could be moved before the Commissioner of Income tax If <ORG> had not entertained his petition <NAME> could have moved the Commissioner in revision because at the date on which the petition was moved the period prescribed by Section A of the Act had not expired We are unable to hold that because a revision application could have been moved for an order correcting the order of the Income tax Officer under Section but was not moved <ORG> would be justified in dismissing as not maintainable the petition which was entertained and was heard on the merits In that view of the matter the principles laid down by the <ORG> will fully apply to the present case also and no distinction can be drawn only on that ground It appears that what the <ORG> felt was that if at the time of motion hearing the petition had not been entertained the petitioner could have sought the alternative remedy but that not having been done after lapse of long time it would not be fit to refuse to grant relief as now it would not be possible for the petitioner to avail of the alternative remedy also Apart from that the question involved in the present case is about the jurisdiction of the District Judge and by refusing to investigate into the objections raised by the petitioner the District Judge had refused to exercise jurisdiction in him by law In the circumstances of the case the parties are directed to bear their own costs
