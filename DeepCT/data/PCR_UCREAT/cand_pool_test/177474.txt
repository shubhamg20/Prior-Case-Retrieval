the assessment The learned counsel foil lie assessee also submitted that the orders of the Income Tax Officer should not only be erroneous but the order should have resulted in prejudice to the interests of the revenue and unless the two conditions prescribed in section are satisfied the Commissioner has no power to revise the orders of the Income Tax Officer of dated wherein this Court held that the Commissioner has the jurisdiction under section to interfere with the order passed by the Income Tax Officer as per he directions given by the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner under section

Commissioner to make or cause to be made such enquiry as the deems necessary in order to find out if the order passed by the Income Tax Officer was erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue The only limitation on his power is that he must have some materials which would enable him to form a prima facie opinion that the order passed by the Income Tax Officer was

the Income Tax Officer had considered the points on which revision proceedings were initiated which indicate that there was a lack of proper enquiry Section empowers the Commissioner to call for and examine the record of any proceeding under the Act and if he considers that any order passed by the Income Tax Officer is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue he may after

prejudicial to the interests of the revenue and set aside the orders of the Income Tax Officer with the direction to the Income Tax Officer to consider the points in detail On the other hand in the instant case the Commissioner has found that the records do not show that the Income Tax Officer had considered the points on which revision proceedings were initiated which indicate that there was a lack of proper enquiry But in our opinion there is nothing in section to show that the Commissioner should in all cases record his final conclusion on the points in controversy before him But in our opinion there is nothing in section to show that the Commissioner should in all cases record his final conclusion on the points in controversy before him The above position of law is well settled by the decision of <ORG> in the case of Addl ITR wherein <ORG> held as under Now even on this question we find that there is nothing in section to show that before passing the final order under that section the Commissioner must necessarily and in all cases record final conclusions about the points in controversy before him In the instant case the Commissioner found that the Income Tax Officer was not correct in granting relief to some of the items considered in the original assessment proceedings and from the instances or specimen of some of the cases examined by him he came to the conclusion that the Income Tax Officer had not completed the assessment by following the procedure expected of him The order of the Commissioner clearly shows that he had enough materials and on that basis he exercised the powers of revision under section set aside the order and ordered to make fresh assessment The Commissioner has pointed out in the orders of revision that there were certain glaring mistakes in the orders of assessment made by the assessing officer and the Commissioner after examining the records held that the Income Tax Officer had not considered the points raised in the show cause notice and we are of the opinion that the Commissioner had properly exercised the jurisdiction under section In the instant case the Commissioner found that the Income Tax Officer was not correct in granting relief to some of the items considered in the original assessment proceedings and from the instances or specimen of some of the cases examined by him he came to the conclusion that the Income Tax Officer had not completed the assessment by following the procedure expected of him The order of the Commissioner clearly shows that he had enough materials and on that basis he exercised the powers of revision under section set aside the order and ordered to make fresh assessment The Commissioner has pointed out in the orders of revision that there were certain glaring mistakes in the orders of assessment made by the assessing officer and the Commissioner after examining the records held that the Income Tax Officer had not considered the points raised in the show cause notice and we are of the opinion that the Commissioner had properly exercised the jurisdiction under section This Court also held that the Commissioner has the power to set aside a portion of the order of the assessing authority which is against the revenue or he may remit the matter to the Income Tax Officer for further enquiry after setting aside the relief given by the assessing officer Therefore the Commissioner in our opinion had set aside the orders of the Income Tax Officer insofar as they relate to the matters which were the subject matters of revision The learned counsel for the assessee strongly placed reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of <ORG> supra wherein this Court held that the prejudice contemplated under section must be prejudicial to the income tax administration as a whole and section cannot be invoked as a jurisdictional corrective or as a review of a subordinate order in exercise of the supervisory power We are of the opinion that the above decision has no application as the words prejudicial to the interests of the revenue as held by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra have wide impact and where it was found that the assessing officer failed to apply his mind in proper perspective and where the officer had completed the assessment without conducting or making the enquiry that is necessary for the purpose of deciding the issue before him the order passed in such circumstances can be said to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue in the sense that the order is not in accordance with law and once such a conclusion is reached by the Commissioner the Commissioner would have necessary power to invoke his jurisdiction under section The Commissioner is expected to examine the orders of assessment to find out whether there is any error resulting in prejudice to the interest of the revenue and in that process the question as to who participated in the assessment proceedings or made the order of assessment is an immaterial consideration This Court also held that the Commissioner has the power to set aside a portion of the order of the assessing authority which is against the revenue or he may remit the matter to the Income Tax Officer for further enquiry after setting aside the relief given by the assessing officer Therefore the Commissioner in our opinion had set aside the orders of the Income Tax Officer insofar as they relate to the matters which were the subject matters of revision The learned counsel for the assessee strongly placed reliance on the decision of this Court in the case of <ORG> supra wherein this Court held that the prejudice contemplated under section must be prejudicial to the income tax administration as a whole and section cannot be invoked as a jurisdictional corrective or as a review of a subordinate order in exercise of the supervisory power We are of the opinion that the above decision has no application as the words prejudicial to the interests of the revenue as held by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra have wide impact and where it was found that the assessing officer failed to apply his mind in proper perspective and where the officer had completed the assessment without conducting or making the enquiry that is necessary for the purpose of deciding the issue before him the order passed in such circumstances can be said to be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue in the sense that the order is not in accordance with law and once such a conclusion is reached by the Commissioner the Commissioner would have necessary power to invoke his jurisdiction under section The Commissioner is expected to examine the orders of assessment to find out whether there is any error resulting in prejudice to the interest of the revenue and in that process the question as to who participated in the assessment proceedings or made the order of assessment is an immaterial consideration The learned counsel also placed reliance on the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra The decision of <ORG> has no application to the facts of the case The Commissioner therefore came to the conclusion that the claim of the assessee required examination as to whether the expenditure in question was allowable as a revenue expenditure or not allowable as a capital expenditure In the factual situation the Court held it is not open to the Commissioner to re examine the matter and he has no power to set aside the orders of assessment and direct the Income Tax Officer to re examine the issue Therefore the decision of <ORG> cited supra has no application to the facts of the case The learned counsel also placed reliance on the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra The decision of <ORG> has no application to the facts of the case The Commissioner therefore came to the conclusion that the claim of the assessee required examination as to whether the expenditure in question was allowable as a revenue expenditure or not allowable as a capital expenditure In the factual situation the Court held it is not open to the Commissioner to re examine the matter and he has no power to set aside the orders of assessment and direct the Income Tax Officer to re examine the issue Therefore the decision of <ORG> cited supra has no application to the facts of the case There is no quarrel over the proposition of law laid down by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra wherein <ORG> held that the twin conditions prescribed in section viz There is no quarrel over the proposition of law laid down by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra wherein <ORG> held that the twin conditions prescribed in section viz The learned counsel also relied upon the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra and the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra and submitted that the Commissioner in the instant case had exercised the powers of revision on the basis of report of audit party and therefore the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to invoke his jurisdiction under section The decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra has no application as the Commissioner there had surrendered his jurisdiction and authority to <ORG> in deciding the questions which were sought to be raised by the company in the revision application He is the head of the department in the administrative side and he is also given the power of quasi judicial nature under section to exercise the powers of revision There is no dispute that there is no right of appeal to the department against the orders of the assessing authority to the first appellate authority and jurisdiction to reopen or to rectify the mistake is subject to the fulfilment of statutory conditions to reopen the assessment or to rectify the mistake in the order If after such investigation the Commissioner comes to the conclusion that the order is erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue he can pass any orders as he thinks fit but where the materials are already available on record there is nothing which precludes the Commissioner from taking into consideration already available materials on record <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra has laid down the above proposition that it is open to the Commissioner to take into account the materials which come into existence subsequent to the completion of the orders of the assessment made by the Income Tax Officer The report of the internal audit party does not have any binding effect on the Commissioner and the order passed by the Commissioner shows that he has applied his mind independently to the errors pointed out by the internal audit party and then came to the conclusion that the orders passed by the Income Tax Officer were erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue The learned counsel also relied upon the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra and the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra and submitted that the Commissioner in the instant case had exercised the powers of revision on the basis of report of audit party and therefore the Commissioner had no jurisdiction to invoke his jurisdiction under section The decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra has no
