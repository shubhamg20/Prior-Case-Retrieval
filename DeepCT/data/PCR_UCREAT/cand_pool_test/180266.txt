JUDGMENT <NAME> The plaintiff has filed the present suit for injunction to restrain defendant No from infringing its copyright in its name with the logo and for passing off its trade name goodwill and for rendition of accounts Along with the suit the plaintiff filed an application being I A No under Order Rules I and of the Code of Civil Procedure for grant of interim injunction in its favor The case of the plaintiff is that for the last over years the plaintiff company is engaged in the business of transport and carriage of goods and parcels The defendant is alleged to be creating an impression in the trade that it is a part of <ORG> The plaintiff has listed various acts of the defendant to show the dishonest intention of the defendant and to establish that the defendant is mis using the trade name and copyright in the logo vested in the plaintiff Some of these are a The word Prakash of the plaintiff company name is being used by the defendant and the same is being used in the same manner and prominent style as that of the plaintiff Therefore the plaintiff has sought the relief of rendition of accounts by the defendant In its application under Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure defendant has set out its case in detail It is submitted by the defendant that the present suit for passing off is not maintainable in as much as the plaintiff is not claiming the relief of passing off in relation to any goods Therefore it is stated that there is no question of any deception being caused Another argument raised by the defendant justifying use of the word Prakash in the name of the defendant company is that if the plaintiff is aggrieved it should have approached <ORG> by way of objection to the registration of the said name as per the provisions of Section of the Companies Act and this <ORG> is not the proper forum for that purpose Apart from the plaintiff there are a number of other transporters in Delhi alone having the name Prakash Subsequently there were disputes between the family members which ultimately resulted in ouster of <NAME> from the Chairmanship and control of management of the present plaintiff No action was taken by the plaintiff against others in the same trade using the word Prakash in their names and therefore there is no balance of convenience in favor of the plaintiff My attention has also been invited to a passage in Bullen and Leak on Pleadings to emphasise that there are five requirements in a suit for passing off AII at page which is to the following effect MYLords <ORG> vs <ORG> and the later cases make it possible to identify five characteristics which must be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing off a misrepresentation made by a trader in the course of trade to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence and which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or in a quia timet action will probably do so That is why it is submitted that the plaintiff has stated in para of the plaint as under THAT the actual amount of the profits earned by the defendant by misusing the plaintiff trade name logo can be ascertained only on the defendant rendering true and honest accounts to the Court By reference to para of the plaint which is the prayer clause in the suit it is pointed out that the plaintiff has undertaken to pay the requisite court fee on the amount due to the plaintiff on account of loss damages being ascertained after the defendant has rendered account Thus according to counsel for the plaintiff the argument on behalf of the defendant that there is no pleadings or claim regarding damages is without any merit or substance If there is a likelihood of the offending trade mark invading the proprietary right a case for injunction is made out Having regard to the provisions of law and in the light of the submissions made by the Counsel for the parties I am of the view that the plaintiff has pleaded the necessary facts which could be pleaded at this stage and the plaintiff can not be non suited on the basis of arguments advanced on behalf of the defendant The plaintiff has sought relief of rendition of account and has also pleaded that the gain of the defendant is loss of the plaintiff It is in view of the difficulty of the plaintiff to ascertain the exact amount of loss damage at the stage of filing of the suit that the Courts have laid down that no claim for specific amount can be made in the suit The next contention urged on behalf of the defendant is that a passing off action can lie only with regard to goods and not for services Another party starting same business in same name or in a deceptively similar name is likely to harm the business reputation and goodwill of the other party and there is no reason why such activity be not prevented was likely to deceive the public and therefore injunction was granted to restrain the defendant company from carrying on business under their registered name or any other name resembling plaintiff name and likely to mislead the public into the belief that the business carried on by the defendant company was the same as the business carried on by the plaintiff company or in any way connected therewith This view also find support from a judgment of <ORG> in Re The next point urged by the counsel for the defendant is that there can be no specific right with regard to a name and in this connection it is further urged that the word Prakash used by the defendant in its name is part of the name of the promoter of the defendant company and therefore there can not be any objection to the use of the said word In this connection at the outset I may put it on record that the defendant does not claim that the word Prakash is being used in the sense that it is Hindi vernacular word meaning light However it will always remain a question of fact whether the use of generic word has acquired a secondary meaning as a trade name and whether its use by any party will or will not cause confusion In the Registrar of Trade Marks Vs Hamdard National Foundation Air Delhi page <ORG> of this Court had occasion to consider the same question in relation to name Safi The Court further felt satisfied that the respondent had made out a case that its trade mark Safi was capable of distinguishing his goods from those of others in the trade It is further pointed out on the basis of material placed on record and particularly the affidavit filed on behalf of the defendant that the defendant company has been floated by ex Directors and senior officers of the plaintiff The promoters of the defendant company being ex Directors employees of the plaintiff are in the know of its business secrets and its trade connections and they want to exploit the same So far as the fact that the defendant has been floated by ex Directors employees of the plaintiff there is no dispute Therefore on this basis he submits that the plaintiff has no cause of action any more Counsel for the defendant however submits that there is no balance of convenience in favor of the plaintiff because the class of customers involved is not likely to get confused or affected by the use of the word Prakash in the name of the defendant As per the trade practice it is stated that forwarding notes are prepared by qualified persons in the office of the various clients who are big business houses and such persons are able to identify the transporters with whom they want to deal The plaintiff therefore could not claim on behalf of the overseas bank the exclusive right to use the name <ORG> in respect of banking business in England It further follows from the above discussion that unless the plaintiffs right to its trade name is protected the plaintiff is likely to suffer an irreparable loss and injury This brings me to the fourth contention of the defendant The defendant has referred to certain pages from the telephone directory to show that under the category of transporters there are other concerns mentioned therein who use the word Prakash with their names This argument to my mind has no force Therefore the mere fact that the plaintiff has not chosen to take any action against such other parties cannot disentitle the plaintiff from taking the present action I have prima facie found that the plaintiff has such a right
