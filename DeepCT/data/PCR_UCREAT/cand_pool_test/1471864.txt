It was however found on the scrutiny of the service book and the leave account of the petitioner that he had exhausted all the leave that was due to him and the extraordinary leave granted to him exceeded days on the th October His appointment as a temporary <ORG> was treated as a re employment and his pay was accordingly fixed at the minimum of the time scale of <ORG> that is Rs The petitioner applied for earned leave for one month with effect from and thereafter asked for an extension of days leave with effect from to the Assistant Collector of <ORG> <NAME> It also expressly said that the petitioner was called upon to show cause in writing within days of the receipt of the charge sheet why disciplinary action should not be taken against him on the above charges and that he should submit Ms explanation to the office The notice to show cause also expressly informed him that he should also state in writing whether he wished to be heard in person or to produce any witness or witnesses in defence and if so a list of such witnesses along with their addresses to be furnished with his explanation In fact there was hardly anything of which evidence was necessary The other charge was unauthorised absence which also was admitted fact What the petitioner was always trying was to avoid a transfer from Calcutta and whenever he was asked to join his duty at any station outside Calcutta he was always ready with some excuse or other and granted himself leave without waiting for the Authorities to grant him leave and without determining whether any leave was due to him or not and if so on what account There is some justification for this complaint but there is no merit behind it Besides the letter of the Deputy Head Quarters Assistant of was only a reply to the petitioner own letters dated and and cannot be elevated into a formal order by anybody In fact there is nothing on record to show that the petitioner offered at any stage to rejoin his duties at Cooch Behar within days time allotted to him by the formal order passed on the employee and dated He complains that the petitioner had no reasnoable opportunity of showing cause against the action taken I have come to the conclusion that neither in the facts of this case nor in law such objections can be sustained I shall state my reasons very briefly The learned Chief Justice of <ORG> at of the report Says But if the servant has no right to the post as where he is appointed to a post permanent or temporary either on probation or on an officiating basis and whose temporary service has not ripened into a quasi permanent service as defined in the Temporary Service Rules the termination of his employment does not deprive him of any right and cannot therefore by itself be a punishment Thereafter the learned Chief Justice of India goes on to observe in his Lordship judgment in the above case To put it in another way if the Government has by contract express or implied or under the Rules the right to terminate the employment at any time then such termination in the manner provided by the contract or the Rules is prima facie and per se not a punishment and does not attract the provisions of Article A part of the obligations of a <ORG> servant as I understand under these Rules is that he takes the risk of the amendments made in these Rules from time to time Then Mr <NAME> argued that there was no grant of extraordinary leave to the petitioner in this case and therefore Rule would not apply I have however come to the conclusion that it is essentially unsound and cannot be upheld Here again I shall state my reasons briefly It can be granted to an officer only in special circumstances and the duration of such extraordinary leave under the rules cannot exceed or months on any one occasion the longer period being only admissible in case of i pulmonary tuberculosis in a recognised sanatorium or ii tuberculosis of any other part of the body by a qualified tuberculosis specialist or a civil surgeon or iii leprosy The order of the Assistant Collector therefore was clearly beyond the rules as the applicant not satisfying the above conditions could never have more than three months extraordinary leave I am therefore of the opinion that the Collector of Excise order of was justified under this rule On the facts I find that the petitioner had ample opportunities to show cause against the two charges of disobedience to orders and of unauthorised absences He was found guilty of both these charges In those circumstances the observations made by the learned Chief Justice of India in the case quoted above apply with all the vigour to the facts of the present case He knew that the vacancy also had been filled up when he was served with that order of because it stated that the vacancy had been filled up A <ORG> servant who has consistently refused to obey orders of transfer and who has consistently absented himself from duty without being granted leave does not discharge the minimum obligations of a <ORG> servant and when even under the formal order of the Assistant Collector of Excise dated he did not even offer to rejoin within the time of days given to him and does not move the <ORG> until long after the vacancy has been filled up then he is not in my opinion a fit proper and deserving case to be helped and aided with a constitutional writ of mandamus or certiorari from this <ORG> I therefore dismiss this application and discharge the Rule I make no order as to costs
