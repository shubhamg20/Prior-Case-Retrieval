The appellants filed writ petitions in <ORG> contending that for the period before September the price had not been properly fixed according to the provisions of the Act the prices fixed by the <ORG> on September and December were bit by Arts Since there was no controlled price before September in the present case iv the price had to be calculated with reference to the average market rate prevailing in the locality on the basis of published figures available in the locality or a neighbouring locality during the period of months immediately preceding the dates of notification of the price a The orders passed by the <ORG> fixing the price relate only to certain districts of Andhra Pradesh Hence there is no violation of Art Therefore for the reasons given in that case which were accepted in <NAME> case Ss and of the Act are not hit by Art Therefore there is no violation of Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These ten appeals on certificates granted by <ORG> raise common questions and will be dealt with together Consequently <ORG> directed by the notification that the price at which rice or paddy shall be sold in any locality in the said States and Union territories in compliance with an order made with reference to cl of sub A Further on the same day <ORG> issued another notification by which in pursuance of cl iv of sub On August <NAME> in exercise of the powers conferred upon him by the notifications mentioned above directed a number of rice millers in Tadepalligudem to sell to the Assistant Director Food <ORG> certain quantities and kinds of rice at the price calculated in accordance with cls On September <ORG> issued a notification fixing the maximum price at which rice and paddy of various kinds was to be sold in any one transaction of more than ten maunds in the districts of Krishna West Godavari and East Godavari in the State of Andhra Pradesh under cl of sub Following this fixation the Deputy Director made requisitions between September and December of different varieties of rice from various appellants under the powers vested in him by the notifications already referred to under cl of sub The contention of the appellants with respect to this period is that the notification fixing price and the action taken thereunder is hit by Art The appellants therefore along with a large number of other rice millers filed writ petitions before <ORG> With respect to the first period the appellants prayed that the Deputy Director be directed to fix the price of rice requisitioned from them at the rate calculated with reference to the average of the market rate prevailing at Tadepallegudem during the period of three months immediately preceding the date of the notification after giving notice and opportunity to the appellants to make their representation regarding the price to be fixed as it was contended that the Deputy Director had fixed the price for this period arbitrarily and without regard to the provisions of the Act As to the subsequent two periods after <ORG> had fixed the maximum price the appellants prayed that the Deputy Director be directed to fix fair prices having regard to the prevailing market rates on the relevant dates on which the stocks of paddy and rice were requisitioned and that this should be done after giving opportunity to the appellants to make their representation in the matter The notifications issued by <ORG> fixing maximum prices were attacked on the ground that the power vested by the Act in <ORG> to impose controls was an arbitrary power without limitation and wag therefore an unreasonable restriction and hit by Art <ORG> rejected all the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants and dismissed the writ petitions with costs It is said that the provisions of the Act impose unreasonable restrictions on the right to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation We are of opinion that there is no force in this contention So the first principle which the Act provides is that the price fixed should be fair and that involves in it all factors which have to be taken into account in fixing a fair price The legislature having enacted that the price fixed should be fair there is in our opinion sufficient indication of the principle on which the price should be fixed Then we come to the contention that the procurement which was made after December when the price was reduced by the notification of December as compared with the price fixed in the notification dated September should have been in accordance with the notification of September at any rate insofar as the rice purchased by the appellants between September and December was concerned The result of the notification of December was that even though the appellants had purchased rice and paddy between September and December at higher prices in terms of the notification of September they had to sell it to the <ORG> at lower rates It cannot therefore be said that there was any such loss to the appellants as would not have happened even in the normal course of business Again the result of acceptance of this argument would be that there would be two sets of maximum prices prevalent whenever there is a reduction in the price by a subsequent notification even though the higher price may not be a fair price Lastly we may refer to the converse case where prices are raised by a subsequent notification We have no doubt that if that is so the appellants would not come forward and say that the earlier stocks purchased by them should be sold at old prices Now the provision which applies is sub If <ORG> is of the opinion that it is necessary so to do for controlling the rise in prices or preventing the hoarding of any foodstuff in any locality it may by notification in the Official Gazette direct that notwithstanding anything contained in sub section the price at which the foodstuff shall be sold in the locality in compliance with an order made with reference to clause of subsection shall be regulated in accordance with the pro visions of this sub section ii Any notification issued under this sub section shall remain in force for such period not exceeding three months as may be specified in the notification iii Where after the issue of a notification under this sub section any person sells foodstuff of the kind specified therein and in the locality so specified in compliance with an order made with reference to clause of sub section there shall be paid to the seller as the price therefore a where the price can consistently with the controlled price of the foodstuff if any fixed under this section be agreed upon the agreed price where no such agreement can be reached the price calculated with reference to the controlled price if any where neither clause a nor clause applies the price calculated with reference to the average market rate prevailing in the locality during the period of three months immediately preceding the date of the application iv For the purposes of sub clause of clause iii the average market rate prevailing in the locality shall be determined by an officer authorised by <ORG> in this behalf It is not in dispute that the notification as required by cl i of sub A was issued on June and under cl ii the notification was to remain in force for three months There are three ways in which the price has to be fixed which are indicated in sub cls Sub clause lays down that where agreement cannot be reached the price has to be fixed with reference to the controlled price It cannot be disputed that sub clause applies only where there is a controlled or maximum price Sub clause a also in our opinion applies only where there is a controlled or maximum price for the two sub clauses are complementary to each other and must be read to apply to the same situation Thus as sub clause undoubtedly applies only to a case where there is a controlled a also applies to a case where there is a controlled price The use of the words if any in both sub clauses must have the said sense and that is that these two sub classes apply only When there is a controlled or maximum price fixed in fact applied as there was no controlled price during the relevant period That price had to be calculated with reference to the average market rate prevailing in the locality during the period of three months immediately preceding the date of the notification The notification was issued in this case on June and therefore the Deputy Director had to take into account the market rates prevailing in the locality between March to June and arrive at an average therefrom of cl iii had to be applied for working out the average market rates in the locality It lays down that these rates shall be determined by an officer authorised by <ORG> in this behalf It is however urged that the words published figures in cl iv would include even the prices in the accounts books of the appellants for these prices must be taken to be published prices inasmuch as the accounts books used to be shown to sales tax and income tax authorities and the entries therein were therefore published The words published figures must be given their ordinary meaning The resultant action taken by him by which the prices at Vijayawada were reduced by about Rs These rates were compiled before the notification of June in a free market and show that there is a difference in price between Tadepallegudem and Vijayawada and prices at Tadepallegudem arc generally lower than the prices at Vijavawada and on an average the price at Tadepallegudem is about Rs We may also refer to the last part of cl iv of sub A which says that the average market rate so determined shall be final and shall not be called in question in any Court It appears however from the evidence that it is really not in dispute that Nallarlu and Garikulu rice is slightly inferior to Akkulu rice We however direct in the circumstances that the parties will bear their own costs of this Court
