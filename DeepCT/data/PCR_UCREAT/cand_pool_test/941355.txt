According to an affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents these manufacturers employed a process of burning lime stone with coke in a lime kiln with a regulated amount of air whereby a mixture of gases was generated consisting of carbon dioxide nitrogen oxygen and a small quantity of carbon monoxide The appellants filed writ petitions in <ORG> challenging the validity of this excise duty but these petitions were dismissed It was contended inter alia on behalf of the appellants that the lime kiln was maintained to generate a mixture of gases and not carbon dioxide and at no stage in the process of generating this mixture and passing it through the sugarcane juice was carbon dioxide which formed one of the contents of the mixture either compressed liquidified or solidified The mixture of gases so generated was not carbon dioxide as known to the market nor was it according to the specifications laid down by <ORG> which required the carbon dioxide content to be at least Furthermore the duty being on goods it could be charged only on goods known as carbon dioxide in the trade and marketable as such HELD The gas generated by the appellant companies was kiln gas and not carbon dioxide as known to the trade i to those who deal in it or who use it It was not correct to say that because the sugar manufacturer wants carbon dioxide for carbonation purposes and sets up a kiln for it that he produces carbon dioxide and not kiln gas In fact what he produces is a mixture known both to trade and science as kiln gas one of the constituents of which is no doubt carbon dioxide At the same time the duty being on manufacture and not on sale the mere fact that kiln gas generated by these is not actually sold would not make any difference if what they generate and use in their manufacturing processes is carbon dioxide The Judgment of the Court as delivered by <NAME> These appeals by certificate are against the common judgment of <ORG> which dismissed the writ petitions filed by the appellant companies challenging the legality of excise duty levied against them under Item in Sch As both the appeals and the writ petition raise a common question of law they were heard together and are disposed of by this common judgment Compressed liquefied or solidified gases the following iv Carbon acid Fifty per cent Fifty per cent carbon dioxide ad valorem By a notification dated March issued under of the Central Excises Rules <ORG> exempted as from April carbonic acid utilised in manufacture of sugar within the factory of production for clarifying and bleachin sugarcane juice or syrup from so much of the excess of Rs The contentions raised on behalf of the appellant companies and <ORG> may be summarised as follows that the lime kiln is maintained to generate a mixture of gases and not carbon dioxide Sup I that at no stage in the process of generating this mixture and sucking it into the sugarcane juice for refining carbon dioxide which forms one of the contents of the said mixture is either compressed liquidified or solidified that the mixture of gases so generated is not carbon dioxide as known to the market that according to the specifications laid down by <ORG> carbon dioxide content has to be at least that the mixture of gases so generated has no other use except for processing sugarcane juice that the said mixture is neither sold nor is marketable nor known to the trade that the excise duty sought to be recovered on the con tent of carbon dioxide in the said mixture of gases cannot fall under Item that these concerns are not manufacturers of carbon dioxide as carbon dioxide is not separated from the said mixture of gases by any process nor is the carbon dioxide content in the said mixture compressed liquefied or solidified that the mere fact that the said mixture of gases is passed through a conduit pipe by a process of suction cannot mean that carbon dioxide becomes compressed carbon dioxide at that or any other stage that the term compressed in Item contemplates the form in which the article sought to be levied is manufactured There is no separation of carbon dioxide from the said mixture at any stage nor is it compressed or stored as carbon dioxide in cylinders and lastly that the duty being on goods it can be charged only on goods known as carbon dioxide in the trade and marketable as such The deponent there asserts that the company of which he is the senior chemist uses carbon dioxide in considerable quantity in manufacturing aerated waters that carbon dioxide so used contains of pure carbon dioxide that compressed liquidified or solidified carbon dioxide as known to the trade or sold in the market contains a minimum of carbon dioxide conforming to the specifications of <ORG> that such carbon dioxide is contained in steel cylinders under a pressure of minimum of lbs He also refutes the statement that the process of generating kiln gas is independent of the manufacture of soda ash and states that the process of manufacture of soda ash is a continuous and integrated process wherein a certain quantity of kiln gas is released which is directly utilised without removal or storage in the manufacture of soda ash There are observations in some of them which states that there are three important processes for commercial production of carbon dioxide viz As the <ORG> argued these concerns undoubtedly require carbon dioxide in the processes employed by them while manu facturing sugar and soda ash and to meet their requirement they have set up lime kilns by which they produce kiln gas which includes carbon dioxide to the extent of about to which they in fact use after compressing it through a pump or otherwise at one stage or the other in their manufacturing processes Nonetheless is it possible to say that the lime kilns set up for the aforesaid purpose produce carbon dioxide and even if it be so that at one stage or the other through the pump or otherwise the carbon dioxide so produced becomes compressed carbon dioxide as envisaged by the legislature when it decided to introduce Item in the First Schedule It cannot be gain said that by burning limestone with coke in the kiln the manufacturer actually produces kiln gas of which one of the constituents undoubtedly is carbon dioxide and which he utilises while producing his ultimate excisable goods The mixture of gases so generated is known as kiln gas in the trade i to those who manufacture sugar and soda ash The Act charges duty on manufacture of goods The word manufacture implies a change but every change in the raw material is not manufacture There must be such a transformation that a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use The duty is levied on goods As the Act does not define goods the legislature must be taken to have used that word in its ordinary dictionary meaning The dictionary meaning is that to become goods it must be something which can ordinarily come to the market to be bought and sold and is known to the market The contention there was that in the course of manufacture of vanaspati a vegetable product from groundnut and til oil the respondents brought into existence at an intermediate stage of manufacturing refined oil which fell within the description of vegetable nonessential oil all sorts in Item of the First Schedule The contention would seem to assume that the goods subjected to duty must be goods known as such in the market product and was chargeable to duty did not alter the position that at an earlier stage the respondents manufactured refined oil as known to the market and that the fact that they did not put this refined oil in the market but used it to produce the finished product did not affect their liability This Court held that if a new substance was brought into existence from raw materials and that substance was the same as refined oil as known to the market it would be subject to duty The question therefore was was the substance sought to be charged refined oil known to the market The affidavits showed that deodorization was necessary before the product could be called refined oil It was held that raw oil purchased by the respondents for the purpose of manufacturing vanaspati did not become at any stage refined oil as known to the consumers and the commercial community The affidavits filed in the instant cases and the scientific works referred to above show that the mixture of gases produced from the kiln is known both in trade and in science as kiln gas and not as carbon dioxide It is also not correct to say that because the sugar manufacturer wants carbon dioxide for carbonation purpose and sets up a kiln for it that he produces carbon dioxide and not kiln gas In fact what he produces is a mixture known both to trade and science as kiln gas one of the constituents of which is no doubt carbon dioxide At the same time the duty being on manufacture and not on sale the mere fact that kiln gas generated by these concerns is not actually sold would not make any difference if what they generate and use in their manufacturing processes is carbon dioxide In our view the gas generated by these concerns is kiln gas and not carbon dioxide as known to the trade i to those who deal in it or who use it The kiln gas in question therefore is neither carbon dioxide nor compressed carbon dioxide known as such to the commercial community and therefore cannot attract Item in the First Schedule In this view it is not necessary for us to consider certain other contentions raised by the appellants and the petitioners in the writ petition In the result the appeals and the writ petition must allowed and the orders passed by <ORG> in the appeals must be set aside The respondents in these appeals as also in the writ petition will pay costs to the appellants and the petitioner in the writ petition
