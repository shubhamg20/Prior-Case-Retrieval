on which the disputed tax amounts to Rs i turnover means the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought by or sold by a dealer whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise shall be excluded from his turnover Section Subject to the provisions of this Act a every dealer shall pay for each year a tax on his total turnover for such year and the tax shall be calculated at the rate of three pies for every rupee on such turnover Before us the correctness of the aforesaid conclusion is challenged on the ground that the Act having been passed by <ORG> and having regard to the territorial limits of the enacting authority the word land in Section i would mean land within the Madras State so that produces from rubber estates beyond the boundaries of the enacting State would not be of the land that <ORG> intended to save from the sales tax There the provisions of the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act were challenged on the ground of its extending to agricultural properties as well of being a Central Act to be beyond the competence of the <ORG> and being therefore void Rejecting the argument <NAME> <NAME> observes as follows No doubt if the Act does affect agricultural land in the Governors Provinces it was beyond the competence of the <ORG> to enact it and whether or not it does so must depend upon the meaning which is to be given to the word property in the Act It is now well settled that there is a general presumption that the <ORG> does not intend to exceed its jurisdiction and it is a sound principle of construction that the Act of a sovereign <ORG> should if possible receive such an interpretation as will make it operative and not inoperative There under <ORG>s may by law impose on goods imported from other States or the <ORG> territories any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced When confronted with such a position and the presumption of the constitutionality precluding the <ORG> having such an intention the petitioners Advocate was compelled to argue that the restriction under Article a is against levying tax at the point of import and not when the imported goods are being sold in the market We are afraid that such an interpretation is not justified and there are overwhelming decisions declining to place such a restricted interpretation on Article a The Constitution permits taxation upon goods imported from States other than taxing States within certain defined limits as laid down in Article of the Constitution at the imposition of sales tax on the petitioner in respect of sales of tobacco imported into Madhya Pradesh was held illegal being in violation of Article a of the Constitution and that the petitioner was entitled to refund of the amount paid by him as tax The learned Chief Justice observes as follows We are not prepared to adopt the construction suggested by the learned Advocate General namely that Article does not deal with the imposition of taxes on purchase or sale of goods and that it refers to tax on imported goods in the act of import That article as it is worded gives to <ORG> the power to impose on goods imported from other States any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and similar goods of local origin It follows that the first ground taken against the order of <ORG> and for sustaining the tax levied on the sales of rubber at Fort Cochin from the rubber estates situated in the then Travancore Cochin area is not sufficient In any case the levy of tax on the sales of rubber produced from lands situated outside Madras State would be discriminatory and void as rubber sold from the estates within the Madras State would not be liable to tax on the ground of being agricultural produce and this brings us to the next ground urged for reversing the decision of the lower Tribunal One is that though the aforesaid term has not been defined by the Madras General Sales Tax Act yet the Madras Plantations Agricultural Income tax Act in defining what is agricultural income included that from rubber as well by second Explanation to Section ii which reads as follows Agricultural income derived from such plantation by the cultivation of coffee rubber cinchona or cardamom means that portion of the income derived from the cultivation manufacture and sale of coffee rubber cinchona or cardamom as the case may be as may be defined to be agricultural income for the purposes of the enactments relating to Indian income tax It follows that rubber is an agricultural produce and this ground for reversing the order sustaining the dealer objection also fails
