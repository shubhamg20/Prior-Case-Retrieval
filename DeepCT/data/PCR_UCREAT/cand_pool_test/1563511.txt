Rule of the Seniority Rules provides that the year of allotment of an officer appointed to the service by promotion shall be the Year of allotment of the junior most direct recruit who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of continuous officiation by the promotee The respondent filed a writ petition in <ORG> contending that Rule is not governed by its second proviso that his case was governed by the main and on the basis of his continuous officiation in a senior post as an officer included in the Select List of the years and approved by the <ORG> and accepted by <ORG> his year of allotment should be which was the year of allotment of a junior most direct recruit officer who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of the officiation by the respondent Even if the second proviso governed the main and only the list of February was the Select List his year of allotment should be on the basis that his continuous officiation throughout from to was approved by <ORG> by inclusion in the approved lists The choice of February mentioned in <ORG> communication dated July was arbitrary and There was discrimination between him and another officer In appeal to this Court HELD The object of the second proviso is to cut down the period of officiation which could be taken into consideration under Though in the letter of July there was a reference to a list called fit for continuous officiation list there was in fact no such list and the expression referred only to the list of November of officers for promotion in an officiating capacity In the present case <ORG> after applying its mind to the problem approved the period from February to July and there was no evidence to show that the period of officiation prior to February of the respondent was approved by <ORG> It has a definite relation to the question of approved period of officiation becaue it was on that date that the <ORG> approved the inclusion of the respondent in the list for officiating appointment for the first time after the Promotion Regulation had come into force There was no discrimination between the respondent and the In this petition the petitioner had prayed for a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to fix the petitioner seniority and year of allotment as instead of the year fixed by <ORG> In order to ensure that the conditions of service applicable to officers of <ORG> are as uniform as possible rules regulating pay and other conditions of services will be framed by <ORG> to such extent as may be considered necessary In respect of matters not covered by the said rules an officer of <ORG> will be governed by such rules as may be framed by the <ORG> under which he is for the time being serving and if no such rules are framed by the rules applicable to the Central Service Provincial Police Service Class as the case may be His name also appeared in a similar list on July One of the questions which has to be decided in this case is whether these lists can come within the expression select list used in the second proviso in of the Indian Police Service Regulation of Seniority Rules hereinafter referred to as the Seniority Rules which came into force on September On January the <ORG> replied as follows I am directed to refer to <NAME> <NAME> letter No AIS I dated the th Dec It stated The approved continuous officiation of these officers counting for seniority commenced from the th February the date on which <ORG> approved the fit for continuous officiation list containing their names The learned Attorney General who appears for the appellant urges that the case of the petitioner is covered by the second proviso to of the Seniority Rules and is not governed only by He says that the Select List of was a Select List within the meaning of the second proviso and the seniority of the petitioner should be counted from that date In the alternative he contends that the petitioner officiation in senior posts prior to July had in fact been approved and was approved officiation within the second proviso He further says that there has been discrimination and one <ORG> has been given benefit which has been denied to the petitioner The main point that arises in this case is whether the Select Lists of and can be deemed to be treated as Select Lists within the second proviso Assignment of Year of Allotment Every officer shall be assigned a year of allotment in accordance with the provisions hereinafter contained in this rule The year of allotment of an officer in service at the commencement of these rules shall be the same as has been assigned to him or may be assigned to him by <ORG> in accordance with the orders and instructions in force immediately before the commencement of these rules Provided that where the year of allotment of an officer appointed in accordance with rule of the Re cruitment Rules has not been determined prior to the commencement of these Rules his year of allotment shall be determined in accordance with the provision in clause of sub rule of this rule and for this purpose such officer shall be deemed to have officiated in a senior post only if and for the period for which he was approved for such officiation by <ORG> in consultation with the <ORG> The year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service after the commencement of these rules shall be a where the officer is appointed to the Service on the results of a competitive examination the year following the year in which such examination was held where the officer is appointed to the Service by promotion in accordance with rule of the Recruitment Rules the year of allotment of the junior most among the officers recruited to the Service in accord ance with rule of those Rules who officiated continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date of commencement of such officiation by the former Provided that the year of allotment of an officer appointed to the Service in accordance with rule of the Recruitment Rules who started officiating continuously in a senior post from a date earlier than the date on which any of the officers recruited to the Service in accordance with rule of those Rules so started officiating shall be determined ad hoc by <ORG> in consultation with <ORG> con cerned Provided further that an officer appointed to the Service after the commencement of these Rules in accordance with rule of the Recruitment Rules shall be deemed to have officiated continuously in a senior post prior to the date of the inclusion of his name in the Select List prepared in accordance with the recruitment Explanation An officer shall be deemed to have officiated continuously in a senior post from a certain date if during the period from that date to the date of his confirmation in the senior grade he continues to hold without any break or reversion a senior post otherwise than as a purely temporary or local arrangement This takes us to the next point whether the petitioner is governed by the main portion of rule and not by the second proviso In our opinion the object of the second proviso is to cut down the period of officiation which would be taken into consideration under rule No material has been brought to our notice to show that <ORG> did not apply its mind to the problem There is no doubt from the correspondence we have set out above that <ORG> were quite aware of the requirements of a <ORG> list It has definite relation to the question of approved period of officiation because it is on this date that <ORG> approved the inclusion of the petitioner in the list for officiating appointment for the first time after the Promotion Regulations had come into force The learned counsel has taken us through the correspondence But as we are allowing the appeal it is not necessary to finally decide whether the petition should have been dismissed only on this ground In the result the appeal is allowed the judgment and order of <ORG> set aside and the petition dismissed but there will be no order as to costs here and in <ORG>
