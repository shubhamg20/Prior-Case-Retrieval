Whether over invoicing of the goods for export would mean attempt to export prohibited goods and Whether while exporting the goods exporter has to give value of the goods as provided under Section of the Customs Act hereinafter referred to as the Act or the value of goods which he expects to receive on sale of goods in the overseas market The facts in brief are It is stated that the appellant is engaged in the export of garments On enquiry the market price of the skirts was ascertained to be Rs per piece according to which total value of the goods comes to Rs The exporters had claimed a draw back of Rs on the consignment Rs per piece Being aggrieved by the said order the appellant filed appeal before <ORG> New Delhi hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> The following export goods shall be liable to confiscation any goods attempted to be exported or brought within the limits of any customs area for the purpose of being exported contrary to any prohibition imposed by or under this Act or any other law for the time being in force The aforesaid Section empowers the authority to confiscate any goods attempted to be exported contrary to any prohibition imposed by or under the Act or any other law for the time being in force Hence for application of the said provision it is required to be established that attempt to export the goods was contrary to any prohibition imposed under any law for the time being in force From the aforesaid definition it can be stated that a if there is any prohibition of import or export of goods under the Act or any other law for the time being in force it would be considered to be prohibited goods and this would not include any such goods in respect of which the conditions subject to which the goods are imported or exported have been complied with This would also be clear from Section which empowers <ORG> to prohibit either absolutely or subject to such conditions to be fulfilled before or after clearance as may be specified in the notification the import or export of the goods of any specified description The notification can be issued for the purposes specified in sub section a The Central Government may by notification in the Official Gazette prohibit the taking or sending out by land sea or air hereafter in this section referred to as export of all goods or of any goods or class of goods specified in the notification from India directly or indirectly to any place so specified unless the exporter furnishes to the prescribed authority a declaration in the prescribed form supported by such evidence as may be prescribed or so specified and true in all material particulars which among others shall include the amount representing i the full export value of the goods or ii if the full export value of the goods is not ascertainable at the time of export the value which the exporter having regard to the prevailing market conditions expects to receive on the sale of the goods in the overseas market and affirms in the said declaration that the full export value of the goods whether ascertainable at the time of export or not has been or will within the prescribed period be paid in the prescribed manner This Section contemplates that exporter is required to furnish to the prescribed authority in prescribed form declaration of true material particulars which include a the amount representing the full market export value of the goods or in the alternative if the full export value of the goods is not ascertainable the value which the exporter expects to receive on the sale of the goods in the overseas market and the exporter has to affirm that full export value of goods will be received The notification issued in exercise of the power under Section also inter alia provides that Central Government prohibits the export of all goods unless exporter furnishes to the prescribed authority a declaration in the prescribed form of material particulars including the full export value of the goods or in the alternative the value of the goods which he expects to receive on their sale in overseas market Further the learned Additional Solicitor General referred to the notification issued under the said Section relevant part of which reads thus GSR In exercise of the powers conferred by sub section of Section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and in supersession of the notification of <ORG> in <ORG> Department of Economic Affairs No GSR dated the th November <ORG> hereby prohibits the export otherwise than by post of all goods either directly or indirectly to any place outside India other than Nepal and Bhutan unless the exporter furnishes to the prescribed authority a declaration in the prescribed form supported by such evidence as may be prescribed or so specified and true in all material particulars which among others shall include the amount representing i the full export value of the goods or ii if the full export value of the goods is not ascertainable at the time of export the value which the exporter having regard to the prevailing market conditions expects to receive on the sale of the goods in the overseas market and affirms in the said declaration that the full export value of the goods whether ascertainable at the time of export or not has been or will within the prescribed period be paid in the prescribed manner For the purposes of the Customs Tariff Act or any other law for the time being in force whereunder a duty of customs is chargeable on any goods by reference to their value the value of such goods shall be deemed to be the price at which such or like goods are ordinarily sold or offered for sale for delivery at the time and place of importation or exportation as the case may be in the course of international trade where the seller and the buyer have no interest in the business of each other and price is the sole consideration for the sale or offer for sale Provided that such price shall be calculated with reference to the rate of exchange as in force on the date on which a bill of entry is presented under section or a shipping bill or bill of export as the case may be is presented under section A Subject to the provisions of sub section the price referred to in that sub section in respect of imported goods shall be determined in accordance with the rules made in this behalf It was therefore contended that there is no scope of application of Section for determining the value of goods by applying the criteria laid down in the said Section For determining the export value of the goods we have to refer to the meaning of the word value given in Section of the Act which specifically provides that value in relation to any goods means the value thereof determined in accordance with the provisions of sub section of Section Section specifically provides that in case of assessing the value for the purpose of export value is to be determined at the price at which such or like goods are ordinarily sold or offered for sale at the place of exportation in the course of international trade where the seller and the buyer have no interest in the business of each other and the price is the sole consideration for sale From the aforesaid provisions mainly Section read with Section of the Act and Section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act it is crystal clear that a Exporter has to declare full export value of the goods sale consideration for the goods exported This Rule is to be read along with Section of the Foreign Trade Development Regulation Act which inter alia provides that no export or import shall be made by any person except in accordance with the provisions of this act the rules and the orders made thereunder and the export and import policy for the time being in force Hence in cases where the export value is not correctly stated but there is intentional over invoicing for some other purpose that is to say not mentioning true sale consideration of the goods then it would amount to violation of the conditions for import export of the goods Learned senior counsel Mr <NAME> submitted that in some cases exporter may get much higher value of the goods than the market price prevailing in the country and therefore merely because higher export value is mentioned it cannot be inferred that it is not the true sale consideration However this would depend upon facts and circumstances as well as evidence on record in each case In that set of circumstances the Court upheld the order passed by the authorities that there was violation of Section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act I A No OF We had heard learned counsel for the intervenor on the question of law involved in this appeal
