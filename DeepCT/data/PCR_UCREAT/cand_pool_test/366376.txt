<ORG> and <ORG> respectively while civil appeals arising out of SLP Nos of and of are filed by the employees unions viz For the sake of convenience we will first deal with the facts in Civil Appeal arising out of SLP No of and the questions of law as they arise therefrom Accordingly a joint application was made to the Assistant Commissioner of Labour under Section of the ID Act requesting him that the disputes mentioned therein be referred for adjudication to <ORG> and consequently the reference from which the present proceedings arise was made If yes what would be due to them on that account and from whom Whether such employees are entitled to revision of their present wages If yes what should be their revised wages and from which date Whether the said employees prove that so far as their services are concerned there have been breaches of any of the provisions of the Factories Act Employees Provident Fund Act Maternity Benefits and Workmen Compensation Act If yes what relief can be legally given to them in that respect and from which date The <ORG> also gave consequential direction for payment of arrears of wages to the worrkmen by adjusting the advances which were given to them by the interim directions of the <ORG> <ORG> by its decision under challenge before us held among other things that there was no demand for abolition of contract labour system as contended by the <ORG> and hence the preliminary objection raised by the <ORG> that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to consider the question of the abolition of contract labour system in view of the provisions of the Act had no merit in it One of the factors taken into consideration by the <ORG> was the continuous nature of work Before us the main contention advanced on behalf of the appellant Board is that after the coming into force of the Act it is only the appropriate Government which can abolish the contract labour system after consulting <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be and no other authority including the industrial adjudicator has jurisdiction either to entertain such dispute or to directs its abolition It is also contended on behalf of the Board that in any case neither the appropriate Government nor the industrial adjudicator has the power to direct that the workmen of the erstwhile contractor should be deemed to be the workmen of the principal employer and such a direction is contrary to the provisions of the Act It is also contended that if the contract is genuine as evidenced by the registration certificate granted to the principal employer and the licence issued to the contractor then it would have to be held that the workmen concerned are in effect the workmen of the contractor and not the workmen of the principal employer and hence no dispute can be raised under the ID Act by such workmen for any relief since it is only the workmen present or past who can raise such a dispute under the ID Act for relief against their employer On the other hand it is contended on behalf of the workmen that the Act does not prevent or prohibit the raising of a dispute under the ID Act for abolition of the contract labour system In either case on the basis of the well known factors laid down by the judicial decisions to establish the relationship of the employer and the employee between the parties the <ORG> or the <ORG> as the case may be will have jurisdiction to declare the contract labourers as the direct employees of the principal employer and grant consoquential reliefs In view of the aforesaid contentions the questions that fall for consideration in this appeal which are common to all the appeals are as follows a Whether an industrial dispute can be raised for abolition of the contract labour system in view of the provisions of the Act If so who can raise such dispute Whether the Industrial Tribunal or the appropriate Government has the power to abolish the contract labour system and In case the contract labour system is abolished what is the status of the erstwhile workmen of the contractors We may first refer to the relevant provisions of the Act The Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the Bill provided as under The system of employment of contract labour lends itself to various abuses The Act came into force on and from th September Liberty is given to the appropriate Government to apply the provisions of the Act to any establishment employing such number of workmen less than as may be specified in the notification Section i defines workmen as under i workmen means any person employed in or in connection with the work of any establishment to do any skilled semi skilled or un skilled manual supervisory technical or clerical work for hire or reward whether the terms of employment be express or implied but does not include any such person A who is employed mainly in a managerial or administrative capacity or who being employed in a supervisory capacity draws wages exceeding five hundred rupees per mensem or exercises either by the nature of the duties attached to the office or by reason of the powers vested in him functions mainly of a managerial nature or who is an out worker that is to say a person to whom any articles and materials are given out by or on behalf of the principal employer to be made up cleaned washed altered ornamented finished repaired adapted or otherwise processed for sale for the purposes of the trade or business of the principal employer and the process is to be carried out either in the home of the out workers or in some other premises not being premises under the control and management of the principal employer It also provides that the licence issued may contain such conditions including any particular conditions as to hours of work fixation of wages and other essential amenities in respect of contract labour as the appropriate Government may deem fit to impose in accordance with the rules if any made under Section Section provides for the grant of licences in the prescribed form and the application for licence has to contain the particulars regarding the location of the establishment the nature of process the operation or work for which contract labour is to be employed and such of the particulars as may be prescribed The following conditions are prescribed by Rule i the licence shall be non transferable ii the number of workmen employed as contract labour in the establishm ent shall not on any day exceed the maximum number specified in the licence iii save as provided in these rules the fees paid for the grant or as the case may be for renewal of the licence shall be non refundable iv the rates of wages payable to the workmen by the contractor shall not be less than the rates prescribed under the minimum wages Act for such employment where applicable and where the rates have been fixed by agreement settlement or award not less than the rates so fixed a in cases where the workmen employed by the contractor perform the same or similar kind of work as the workmen directly employed by the principal employer of the establishment the wage rates holidays hours of work and other conditions of service of the workm en of the contract shall be the same as applicable to the workmen directly employed by the principal employer of the establishment on the same or similar kind of work Provided that in the case of any disagreement with regard to the type of work the same shall be decided by <ORG> Central in other cases the wage rates holidays hours of work and conditions of service of the workmen of the contract shall be such as may be specified in this behalf by <ORG> Central Section casts an obligation on the principal employer to provide any amenity required to be provided under the Act to the contract labour and permits the principal employer to recover all expenses from the contractor incurred by him for providing the amenities Sections to of Chapter VI prescribe penalties for contravention of the provisions of the Act Section of Chapter VII requires every principal employer and every contractor to maintain such registers and records giving such particulars of contract labour employed the nature of work performed by the contract labour the rates of wages paid to the contract labour and such other particulars in such form as may be prescribed Under the Act the Government has in exercise of power granted by Section of the Act made Contract Labour Regulation and Abolition Rules hereinafter referred to as the Rules which have come into force from th February Rule prescribes the form and the terms and conditions on which licence is issued to the contractor In cases where the workmen employed by the contractor perform the same or similar kind of work as the workmen directly employed by the employer of the establishment the wage rates holidays hours of work and other conditions of service of the workmen of the contractor shall be the same as applicable to the workmen directly employed by the employer Rule states that every licence granted to the contractor shall remain in force for months from the date it is granted or renewed The workmen have to be paid minimum wages and where there are agreements settlements etc Further if the contract labour is employed for doing the same type of work as is done by the direct employees of the principal employer wages have to be paid and facilities given to the contract labour as are paid or given to the direct employees of the principal employer Further the principal employer is required to nominate the representative duly authorised by him to be present at the time of the disbursement of wages by the contractor to the labour and such representative is required to certify the wages paid to the labour The contractor is also required to obtain a licence before undertaking or executing any work through contract labour and he can execute such work only in accordance with the licence issued to him The contravention of any provision of the Act including contravention of any condition of the licence granted to the contractor is made a penal offence It is against the background of these provisions of the Act and in the light of the decisions of this Court which are cited before us that we have to answer the questions raised in these appeals In the first instance it is argued that the said section gives exclusive authority to the appropriate <ORG> to prohibit contract labour and that too after following the procedure laid down therein Although the comparable units in the same region carried on the working of loading and unloading through contract labour the <ORG> held that since the contract labour has to be discouraged the appellant must employ only permanent workmen for doing the said job as well This <ORG> held that the <ORG> acquired jurisdiction to entertain the dispute in view of the reference made by the State Government on April Under these circumstances the <ORG> had to adjudicate upon the points referred to it having due rgard to the principles laid down by the courts particularly this <ORG> governing the abolition of contract labour The <ORG> further held that the Act had received the assent of the President before the passing of the <ORG> award while the State Act had come into force before the passing of the award Though the contention that the <ORG> lost jurisdiction to consider the question of contract labour in view of these enactments could not be accepted it was held that this <ORG> would be justified when dealing with the appeal to give effect particularly to the provisions of the Act having due regard to the clearly expressed intention of the legislature in the said Act regarding the circumstances under which contract labour could be abolished Since the Act had come into force on th February and under Section of the Act the jurisdiction to decide matters connected with the prohibition of contract labour was vested in the appropriate Government it is only the appropriate Government that can prohibit contract labour by following the procedure and in accordance with the provisions of the Act Further under clause of Section of the Act one of the relevant factors to be taken into account when contract labour regarding any particular type of work is proposed to be established is whether that type of work is done ordinarily through direct workmen in the establishment or an establishment similar thereto It will thus appear from this decision firstly that an industrial dispute can be raised by the direct workmen of the establishment for abolition of the contract labour system Secondly although on the date the dispute was raised the Act was not in force and hence the dispute with regard to the abolition of the contract labour system had to be decided by the <ORG> since the Act came into force at the time of the decision the dispute had to be decided in accordance with the provisions of the Act SCR the matter came to this Court by way of a writ petition filed by the workmen under Article of the Constitution It was contended by the workmen Association that out of and odd workmen working within the premises of the respondent Company as many as a thousand workers were treated as contract labour and placed under the control and at the mercy of contractors and though they did the same work as workers directly employed by the company they were not paid the same wages nor were their conditions of service the same as that of the directly employed workers It was further alleged that the management paid to the contractors and in turn the contractors paid salary to them after deducting substantial commission and the wages paid to them did not bear comparison to the wages paid to those directly employed by the company The respondent company opposed the petition by contending that if the petitioners had any genuine grievance they could avail themselves of the rights secured to them under the Act Minimum Wages Act Equal Remuneration Act etc It was further contended on behalf of the company that certain jobs though required to be done within the plant area could more conveniently and efficiently be done on a job contract basis and this was actually due to the introduction of a new technology for expansion of production programme with foreign collaboration If there is any dispute with regard to the type of work the dispute has to be decided by the Chief Labour Commissioner Central The <ORG> further held that it was not possible in an application under Article to embark upon an enquiry whether the thousand and odd workmen working in various capacities and engaged in multifarious activities did work identical with work done by the workmen directly employed by the company and whether for that reason they should not be treated as contract labour but as direct employees of the company The <ORG> also directed the Chief Labour Commissioner to enquire into the question whether the work done by the workmen employed by the contractors is the same type of work as that done by the workmen directly employed by the principal employer in the <ORG> <NAME> Since several representations made by them to the authorities proved fruitless they approached this <ORG> under Article of the Constitution to direct the respondent Union of India and others to exercise their power under Section of the Act and to abolish the contract system and further to direct the <ORG> to regularise the services of the existing catering cleaners and to extend to them the service benefits then available to other categories of employees in the catering establishments On this point there was a conflict in the decisions of <ORG> of Delhi Calcutta Punjab and Kerala on the one hand and of the <ORG> of Madras Bombay Gujarat and Karnataka on the other It is a matter for the appropriate Government to decide after considering all the matters as required by Section of the Act These decisions in unambiguous terms lay down that after the coming into operation of the Act the authority to abolish the contract labour is vested exclusively in the appropriate Government which has to take its decision in the matter in accordance with the provisions of Section of the Act In other words if there is no genuine contract and the so called contract is sham or a camouflage to hide the reality the said provisions are inapplicable When in such circumstances the concerned workmen raise an industrial dispute for relief that they should be deemed to be the employees of the principal employer the <ORG> or the industrial adjudicator will have jurisdiction to entertain the dispute and grant the necessary relief In this connection we may refer to the following decision of this <ORG> which were also relied upon by the counsel for the workmen The workmen made a demand for abolition of the contract system and for absorbing workmen employed through the contractor into the regular service of the company The company objected to the reference on the ground that it was incompetent inasmuch as there was no dispute between it and the respondents and it was not open to them to raise a dispute with respect to the workmen of some other employer viz In appeal this <ORG> held that the dispute raised was an industrial dispute within the meaning of section of the Industrial Disputes Act because i the respondent workmen had a community of interest with the workmen of the contractor ii they had also substantial interest in the subject matter of the dispute inasmuch as the class to which they belonged was substantially affected thereby and iii the company could give relief in the matter While dealing with the contention that the <ORG> should not have interfered with the management manner of having its work done in the most economical and convenient way that it thought proper and that the case in question was not one where the contract system was a camouflage and the workmen of the contractors were really the workmen of the company the <ORG> held that it may be accepted that the contractor in that case was an independent person and the system was genuine and there was no question of the company carrying on the work itself and camouflaging it as if it was done through contractors in order to pay less to the workmen It had left to the company to decide for itself how many workmen it should employ and on what terms and had merely directed that when selection is being made preference be given to the workmen employed by the contractor Its importance lies in the fact that it lends support to the proposition that even after the coming into operation of the Act the industrial adjudicator will have in appropriate cases jurisdiction to investigate as to whether the contract is genuine or not and if he comes to the conclusion that it is not he will have jurisdiction also to give suitable relief But they were hired by contractors who had executed agreements with the petitioners to get such work done Shri <NAME> is support of his contention relied upon certain decisions of this Court under the Citizenship Act where the finality is attached to the decision of the Central <ORG> taken under Section of the said Act The provisions of Section of the Citizenship Act which are more or less pari materia with the provisions of Section of the present Act are as follows If any question arises as to whether when or how any person has acquired the citizenship of another country it shall be determined by such authority in such manner and having regard to such rules of evidence as may be prescribed in this behalf It is not necessary for us to go into the question of the finality of the decision under Section of the Act since as held by this Court in <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> supra the exclusive authority to decide whether the contract labour should be abolished or not is that of the appropriate <ORG> under the said provision Hence in such cases the workmen can make a grievance that there is no genuine contract and that they are in fact the employees of the principal employer One reason for the same pointed out to us was that the workmen engaged by the contractor may not be qualified to be engaged by the principal employer according to the latter rules of recruitment As regards the first situation the condition no of the licence to be granted to the contractor in Form VI under Rule of the Rules requires that wage rates holidays hours of work and other conditions of service of the contract workmen shall be the same as applicable to the workmen directly employed by the principal employer for performing the same or similar type of work Hence is should not be difficult to verify the workmen who were actually working in the establishment in question for a given period of time and the period for which they had worked since the record of payment of wages made to them would be available as it is to be made in the presence of the representative of the principal employer who is also responsible to make the payment of the whole of the wages or the balance of it in case the contractor makes default It may be that the establishment may not require the whole complement of the workmen erstwhile employed by the contractor He has the jurisdiction to change the contractual relationships and also make new contracts between the employer and the employees under the ID Act However the situation is obviously different when the labour contract is genuine and there is no relationship of employer employee between the principal employer and the workmen of the contractor The appellants who were the workmen of the respondent espoused the cause of one Dr <NAME> Assistant Medical Officer who had been dismissed without hearing with a month salary in lieu of notice but who had accepted such payment and left the tea garden Both the <ORG> and the appellate industrial <ORG> took the view that as Dr <NAME> was not workman the dispute was not an industrial dispute as defined in Section of the ID Act Having regard to the scheme and objects of the Act and its other provisions the expression any person in Section of the Act must be read subject to such limitations and qualifications as arise from the context the two crucial limitations are the dispute must be a real dispute between the parties to the dispute as indicated in the first two parts of the definition clause so as to be capable of settlement or adjudication by one party to the dispute giving necessary relief to the other and the person regarding whom the dispute is raised must be one in whose employment non employment terms of employment or conditions of labour as the case may be the parties to the dispute have a direct or substantial interest In The <ORG> case supra to which we had an occasion to refer to earlier in another context after taking due note of the propositions of law laid down in Dimakuchi supra this <ORG> has discussed the law on the subject elaborately The contention of the learned Solicitor General is two fold in this connection namely i that there is no real or substantial dispute between the company and the respondents and ii that the subject matter of the dispute is such that it cannot come within the terms of the definition in Section There is undoubtedly a real and substantial dispute between the company and the respondents on the question of the employment of contract labour for the work of the company It was this aspect of the matter which was considered in <NAME> case and it was held that the words any person used in Section would not justify the workmen of a particular employer to raise a dispute about any one in the world though the words any person in that provision may not be equated with the words any workman If therefore the dispute is a collective dispute the party raising the dispute must have either a direct interest in the subject matter of dispute or a substantial interest therein in the sense that the class to which the aggrieved party belongs is substantially affected thereby We see no insuperable difficulty in the practical application of this test In a case where the party to a dispute is composed of aggrieved workmen themselves and the subject matter of the dispute relates to them or any of them they clearly have a direct interest in the dispute The learned Solicitor General particularly emphasised that there was no question of the interest of the respondents being prejudicially affected by the employment or non employment or the terms of service or conditions of labour of the workmen of <NAME> and Company and placed reliance on the words may prejudicially affect their interest appearing in the observations quoted above Besides it is contended by Mr <NAME> for the respondents that even if prejudicial effect on the interest of the workmen espousing the cause is necessary this is a case where the respondents interest may be prejudicially affected in future in case the contract system of work is allowed to prevail in this branch of the work of the company They have also a substantial interest in the subject matter of the dispute in the sense that the class to which they belong namely workmen is substantially affected thereby In view of the aforesaid decision it cannot be and was not disputed before us that the direct workmen of the principal employer can espouse an industrial dispute for absorption of the contractor workmen and the industrial adjudicator will have jurisdiction to entertain such dispute and grant the necessary relief If on such reference being made by the workmen the appropriate <ORG> does not abolish the contract labour the industrial adjudicator has to reject the reference since the jurisdiction to abolish the contract is exclusively vested in the appropriate <ORG> and he has no jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute Our conclusions and answers to the questions raised are therefore as follows i In view of the the provisions of Section of the Act it is only the appropriate <ORG> which has the authority to abolish genuine labour contract in accordance with the provisions of the said Section No Court including the industrial adjudicator has jurisdiction to do so It is only if the adjudicator comes to the conclusion that the contract is sham that he will have jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute If however he comes to the conclusion that the contract is genuine he may refer the workmen to the appropriate <ORG> for abolition of the contract labour under Section of the Act and keep the dispute pending It is in the light of the above position of law which emerges from the provisions of the Act and the judicial decisions on the subject that we have to answer the contentions raised in different civil appeals before us that contrary to the submission made by the learned counsel the direct employees of the <ORG> had espoused the cause of the contract labourers and the appellant <ORG> had also accepted the fact that the dispute in question was raised and supported also by the said employees We therefore reject the said contention We find nothing in the said clause which supports the contention of the learned counsel In paragraph of the statement of claim it is averred that the <ORG> has been employing Mukadam supervisors who are draped in different paper arrangements and are now known as contractors of the Thermal Power Station and the <ORG> and the so called contractors have joined hands for mass victimisation and termination of services even without payment of due wages Again in paragraph of the statement of claim it is stated that the workmen are being paid wages by the management of the <ORG> through Mukadam supervisors now known as contractors of the <ORG> It was then contended by the learned counsel that <ORG> has nowhere recorded a finding that the contract in question was sham camouflage make believe or a subterfuge The <ORG> has on the basis of the evidence on record come to the conclusions among others that i the work was being done on the premises of the <ORG> itself as the coal was being used for the purposes of the <ORG> viz It is true that the <ORG> has not in so many words recorded a finding that the contract was sham or bogus or a camouflage to conceal the real facts Thus read the decision makes it clear that the <ORG> has based its conclusion both on the ground that the workmen were in fact engaged by the appellant <ORG> and not by the contractors who were merely intermediaries set up by the <ORG> and also on the ground that there was no valid proof of the registration certificate and the licences in the possession of the <ORG> and the contractors respectively It is not therefore correct to say that the decision of the <ORG> is based only on the latter ground We are of the view that there is a factual finding recorded by the <ORG> that the labour contracts in question were not genuine and the decision of the <ORG> is based on this ground as well The explanation to Section makes the decision of the appropriate <ORG> final only on the question whether the process or operation or the work in question is of a perennial nature or not and that too when a dispute arises with regard to the same It is the terms of the reference which will determine the jurisdiction of the industrial adjudicator to enetertain and decide the reference It was also contended by him that the industrial Tribunal cannot make recruitment and create contract against third parties and for this purpose reliance was placed by him on the decisions reported in <ORG> Vs Their Workmen LLJ Krishna Kurup Vs General Manager <ORG> Baroda SCC and <NAME> Vs State of Punjab Ors Vs Their workmen supra the facts were that the appellant company carried on business of <ORG> in north east India between various river stations in Bengal and Assam and for this purpose it maintained a number of ghats or stations on the river Brahmaputra in Assam Meanwhile a material change in the circumstances of the company working took place in one sector of its operation It was contended by the company that the said <ORG> were not its employees and in the alternative the termination of the services of the workmen being the result of the closure of the ghat in question they were not entitled to any relief The <ORG> further found that though the company had guaranteed the payment at the prescribed rate to these workmen and in that sense had undertaken the liability to pay that money at that rate the record showed that the money was paid to the contractor and the contractor paid it to the workmen from month to month until the ghat in question was closed In <NAME> Vs General Manager <ORG> Baroda supra out of workmen whose services had been terminated by the respondent company by an oral order employees in respect of whom <ORG> had recorded a finding for their absorption subject to scrutiny were absorbed by the company pending the special leave petition before this <ORG> The <ORG> also relied upon the affidavit filed on behalf of the company that it had not been able to provide work to all workmen who were absorbed and only of them had been allotted work and the rest had not been assigned any work whatsoever On these facts the <ORG> held as follows Section FF provides that where there is a transfer of an undertaking by agreement or operation of law an employee who loses his job because of such transfer will have a right to compensation from the predecessor except where he gets the benefit of uninterrupted service with the new employer on no less favourable terms than before and will be entitled to compensation in case he should be retrenched later by the new employer A second type of cases is one in which there is in form and perhaps also in law a succession but the management continues to be in the hands of the same set of persons organised differently Though these exceptions to the above rules would still be operative it is not necessary here to decide whether this principle will help to identify the transferee corporation with <ORG> for the present purposes particularly as there is a catena of cases which do not approve of such identification It has abridged the rights of the appellants by purporting to transfer only the tubewells and retrenched the appellants from service as a consequence Thus it would be seen that these three decisions have not in any way diluted the propositions of law laid down by this <ORG> in Dimakuchi and <ORG> supra where the <ORG> has approved of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to direct the principal employer to absorb the workmen of the erstwhile contractor as his direct employees depending upon the satisfaction of the factors laid down therein and on terms that the <ORG> on the basis of the material before it may deem fit to fix in the circumstances of the case It is also not correct to say that the Act is a complete Code by itself and therefore <ORG> has no jurisdiction to give a direction to the principal employer to absorb the workmen in question There is nothing in the Act which can be construed to have deprived the industrial adjudicator of the jurisdiction to determine the same So long as therefore the said jurisdiction has not been taken away from the industrial adjudicator by any express provision of the Act or of any other statute it will have to be held that the said jurisdiction which as pointed out above has been recognised even by the decisions in <NAME> and Standard Vacuum cases supra continues to exist We find nothing in the decisions relied upon on behalf of the appellant which goes counter to this proposition of law The decisions in <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> supra on which reliance is placed on behalf of the appellant for the purpose have already been discussed by us above In the present case there is nothing in the Act as pointed out earlier which has either expressly or impliedly taken away the raising of an industrial dispute to absorb the ex contractor workmen in the principal establishment when the dispute has been espoused by the direct workmen or the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to give a direction for the purpose of course on such terms as it deems fit in the circumstances of each case The decisions relied upon by <NAME> on behalf of the workmen viz Civil Appeals are therefore dismissed but with no order as to costs In this case <ORG> has given relief of reinstatement with back wages to the workmen There is no finding recorded by the <ORG> whether the industrial dispute was raised by the direct employees of the appellant <ORG> and whether the labour contract was genuine or not If and when such dispute is raised the <ORG> should make the reference within two months of the receipt of the dispute and the industrial adjudicator should dispose of the same as far as possible within six months thereafter Civil appeal is therefore allowed but with no order as to costs We therefore recommend that a all undertakings which are employing the contract labour system in any process operation or work which satisfies the factors mentioned in clauses a to of Section of the Act should on their own discontinue the contract labour and absorb as many of the labour as is feasible as their direct employees both the Central and the State Governments should appoint a Committee to investigate the establishments in which the contract labour is engaged and where on the basis of the criteria laid down in clauses a to of Section of the Act the contract labour system can be abolished and direct employment can be given to the contract labour the Central Government should amend the Act by incorporating a suitable provision to refer to the industrial adjudicator the question of the direct employment of the workers of the ex contractor in the principal establishment when the appropriate Government abolishes the contract labour
