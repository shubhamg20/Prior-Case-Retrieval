That doctrine so far as we have to consider it in this case may be stated as follows When a person is proved to have had a knowledge of certain facts or to have been in a position the reasonable consequence of which knowledge or position would be that he would have been led to make further enquiry which would have disclosed a particular fact the law fixes him with having himself had notice of that particular fact But if there is not actual notice and no wilful or fraudulent turning away from an enquiry into and consequent knowledge of facts which the circumstances would suggest to a prudent mind then the doctrine of constructive notice ought not to be applied In dealing with that question the District Judge has considered that the plaintiff had notice at the time of his purchase of all the circumstances which have been subsequently proved in evidence in this case of all the circumstances which led both the <ORG>s below to hold that the two original transactions were merely benami transactions Indeed <NAME> was entitled to a share in family property and from the circumstance that the plaintiff on his purchase took from <NAME> a guarantee to which I shall refer presently it might be inferred that the plaintiff considered <NAME> as a person not without means These circumstances might have been sufficient to support the findings of the <ORG>s below as between <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> but it by no means follows that the purchaser had any knowledge at the time he purchased of the circumstances which have been proved at the hearing of this case and if he was in honest ignorance at the time of his purchase of course he ought not to be bound by any of such circumstances With respect to the second conveyance by the two attorneys the learned Judge considered that it was benami because there was no proof of any pressure of liabilities which would justify the sale But in reality there was then a debt due from <NAME> <NAME> to one <NAME> of Rs Therefore there was in this transaction a complete change of debtors to the creditor and a discharge of the original debtor to <NAME> and it would at least seem that <NAME> must have considered the transaction a bond fide one and that he was content to accept <NAME> as a sufficiently responsible person for one of his sureties The learned Judge has also relied upon the fact that there was no change of management on the occasion of these first conveyances but he is scarcely justified in coming to that conclusion for in a different part of his judgment he also finds that the ryot rents were paid in the name of the ostensible purchasers and therefore there was to that extent at least a change in the management The learned Judge says that the plaintiff case was that he had acquired by his purchase the rights of his vendors We are unable to find that that was the case made by his plaint The plaintiff case really was that he had acquired by his purchase a title to the property as a bond fide purchaser for value without notice He says that the plaintiff and the defendant resided in the same village that the properties purchased were adjacent to the place where both lived that the plaintiff was intimate with the defendant and his family and that he was also connected by marriage with the defendant Now it is true that the plaintiff was connected by marriage with the defendant and it was also proved that he was intimate with the defendant family but it appears from the defendant own evidence that there was enmity between himself and the plaintiff Then the learned Judge proceeds to say that nothwithstanding these recitals the plaintiff admits that he made no enquiry Now it is difficult to understand how the learned Judge came to that conclusion because he afterwards finds that the only enquiry plaintiff says he made was a question to <NAME> one of defendant attorneys whether there was any harm in buying a question which <NAME> admits he answered in the negative But he admits that this enquiry was made of him and that he made that answer and it further appears that another of the attorneys was an attesting witness to the plaintiff conveyance We think therefore that the learned Judge was not justified in finding that the plaintiff made no enquiry and it is difficult for us to say how he could make any other or more satisfactory enquiry than he actually did from the authorized agents of the defendant Then the learned Judge further finds that the plaintiff must be fixed with constructive notice because he did not ask for the accounts or zemindary papers and did not obtain the deeds but with respect to the papers we understand that the zemindary papers were given up to the plaintiff on his purchase and with respect to not obtaining the deeds such negligence might he important as against a third person with whom they might have been deposited for value but is of comparative unimportance as against <NAME> <NAME> who had placed his affair in the hands of attorneys one at least of whom had assured the plaintiff that he was safe in purchasing But what the learned Judge seems principally to have relied upon is the fact that in the conveyance to the purchaser from the ostensible vendors there is a covenant or guarantee of title from them to him to this effect that they undertake or guarantee that there is no other person having any right in the property it is certainly unusual and not to be expected that mere benamidars who have no interest whatever in the property should take upon themselves the personal liabilities and responsibilities of a guarantee and if it is an unusual thing to have such guarantee in a deed of conveyence the reason for its insertion may have been that the plaintiff did make enquiries for the deeds and with respect to the title before he completed his purchase He in fact made enquiries of the agents of the defendant We therefore think that there is no ground in this case for fixing the plaintiff with constructive notice of any of the circumstances which as the <ORG>s below have held prove that the conveyances to the ostensible vendors of the plaintiff were benami transactions and this being so and the first <ORG> having held that he paid full value on his purchase and the District Judge not having come to any contrary finding we think he must be treated as a purchaser for value without notice and that therefore his title is good and that he is entitled to recover as against the defendant But the language which I am about to quote is appropriate to the present case It is a principle of natural equity which must be universally applicable that where one man allows another to hold himself out as the owner of an estate and a third person purchases it for value from the apparent owner in the belief that he is the real owner the man who so allows the other to hold himself out shall not be permitted to recover upon his secret title unless he can overthrow that of the purchaser by showing either that he had direct notice or something which amounts to constructive notice of the real title or that there existed circumstances which ought to have put him upon an enquiry that if prosecuted would have led to a discovery of it Now neither of the <ORG>s below in this case have held that there was actual notice and we are of opinion that the circumstances stated in the judgment of the lower <ORG> are not sufficient to fix the plaintiff with constructive notice or ought to have put him upon an enquiry which if prosecuted would have led to the discovery that his ostensible vendors were benamidars One other question has arisen in this case which was not raised at the bar and which certainly did not arise in the <ORG>s below <ORG>s below and in fact it was admitted by the defendant in the pleadings that there was a sale under the zemindar decree to <NAME> Even if any objection could now be taken on this point we do not think these words contemplate that nothing would pass to a purchaser unless a certificate were issued for we are of opinion that the order affirming the sale would be sufficient to pass a title to the purchaser and the certificate which might afterwards be obtained by him would be merely evidence that the property so passed The appellant will be entitled to his costs of this appeal and of the <ORG>s below
