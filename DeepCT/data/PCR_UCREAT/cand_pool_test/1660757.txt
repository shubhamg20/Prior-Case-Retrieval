As to the security bonds we agree with the observation of the Subordinate Judge On the whole we are satisfied that there are no grounds for questioning the finding as to the matter of hereditary right This second appeal having come on for final hearing the <ORG> delivered Judgment as follows it is observed by the learned Judge with reference to a contention that the alienee was of the same caste and sect as the alienor To hold so would tend to public mischief in inducing needy incumbents of hereditary religious offices who desired to sell them to give a dishonest recognition to qualifications which in fact were not the qualifications demanded by the nature of the office It was then argued that in the case before us the brothers of the plaintiff father consented to the alienation in his favour and that there is evidence to that effect on the record Of course it is not intended that those who may have a claim by hereditary right as the legal heir should be in any wise prejudiced by this judgment We must reverse the decree of the Courts below and dismiss the suit
