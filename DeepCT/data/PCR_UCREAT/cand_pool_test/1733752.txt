The plaintiff counteracted this defence of the defendant by stating that the building was completed only in March and as per Section i of the Act nothing in the Act shall apply to any building for a period of five years from the date on which the construction is completed and notified to the local authority concerned The defendant appealed in A No of which Was heard and disposed of by a Bench of this Court consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> JJ The learned Judges considered it unnecessary at that stage to go into the question as to whether any decree that may be passed in the suit is executable or not in view of the provisions of Section of the Act as that question will arise only at the stage of the execution after the decree is passed The defendant apart from contesting the execution for delivery of possession took out A No of under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure to declare that the decree passed in the suit is not executable in view of the provisions of the Act This revision is preferred against the order passed by the Court below in Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the defendant would submit that even prior to the date of the decree in the suit and pending the suit the exemption under Section of the Act had lapsed and even though the jurisdiction of <ORG> to pass a decree is not ousted on the lapse of the exemption the Act became applicable to the premises in question and when the execution came to be levied the provisions of the Act squarely applied and there could not be an eviction of the defendant who has become a tenant within the meaning of the Act except under the provisions of the Act Learned Counsel further submits that with or without the exemption the jurisdiction of <ORG> to pass a decree in ejectment even against a tenant within the meaning of the Act is not ousted and this proposition has emerged from the judicial precedents rendered under the Rent Control Statute which prevailed and which is prevailing in this State and the only inhibition is with reference to evicting the tenant in execution of such a decree or otherwise except through the processes under the Act and on the conditions set out therein getting satisfied therefor and when the execution came to be levied in respect of the decree the Act had come to be applied to the premises in question and the decree could not be availed of to evict the defendant who is a tenant within the meaning of the act The contentions raised by the respective counsel oblige me to bestow some serious attention on the case law on the subject including that which has arisen in similar contingencies under the Act itself or under similar statutes current and prevailing anterior to the enactment of the Act It says that nothing in the Act shall apply to any building for a period of five years from the date on which the construction is completed and notified to the local authority concerned By this exemption the application of the Act gets postponed for a period of five years and the Act comes into force so far as this building is concerned only after the lapse of the five years Chandrasekhara Aiyar held that there was an ouster of jurisdiction of Civil Courts and the remedy of the plaintiff was to go before the Controller <NAME> dealt with a case where the landlord had after giving notice filed a suit for evicting a tenant and had obtained a decree therein and levied execution for delivery prior to the amendment of the House Rent Control Order prescribing that a tenant could not be evicted except under an order of the Rent Controller and the learned Judge held that the landlord right to execute the decree was not taken away by the amendment which came into force subsequent to the application to execute the decree was relied on but the learned Judge did not accept the same and held that the wording of the section is not such as to deprive <ORG> of their power to entertain the suit for eviction and to adjudicate upon it and what the Control Order prohibits is eviction outside the provisions of Section A of the Order once again dealt with a similar contention and repelled the same holding that It cannot be said that these words are wide enough to deprive <ORG> of their jurisdiction to pass decrees all that the rule contemplates is the control of the relief of eviction <NAME> was dealing with a case where the suit for ejectment was pending when the Madras Non Residential Building Rent Control Order was amended The District Munsif upheld the contention of the defendant that under Section of the Amended Non Residential Buildings Rent Control Order a tenant could not be evicted and accordingly held that the previous order directing delivery was wrong and the court had jurisdiction to set aside that order and to order re delivery as the execution petition had not been closed and the proceedings were still pending before the <ORG> <NAME> construed the expressions in execution of a decree or otherwise occurring in Section of the Control Order and held that it would have reference to a decree in a suit instituted after the amendment and the learned Judge declined to construe the section retrospectively and further held as follows If there is nothing else in the enactment to indicate that every pending legislation or pre existing substantive rights of parties were intended to be affected by the amended Order I must hold in accordance with the well established rules of construction of statutes that the amended Control Order Section Clauses and had no application to the present execution petition and that the order for delivery originally made was right and proper A I The learned Judge further observed that the Order itself is only for a short duration and if and when it is repealed or it expires without being renewed the previous decree of <ORG> will have to be executed by the civil court as in ordinary cases The learned Judges adverted to the fact that execution proceedings were filed long after the amendment came into force and that they are not concerned with the applicability of the new law to pending proceedings The contention before the Bench was that the moment a person files a suit he obtains thereby a vested right to have applied not only to the suit but to all execution proceedings also the law relating to execution as it existed at the time of filing the suit The Bench repelled the said contention observing as follows We know of no such principle and we find no reason to think from the cases that have been cited before us that if a new law is introduced restricting the right to execute execution proceedings can nevertheless be instituted if such a right existed on the date of the filing of the suit Atica Begum in which a reference was made to certain English cases interpreting British statutes said to be similar to the statute under consideration and the learned Judges declared that they have not seen those decisions of statutes and they are not at all convinced that any such general principle exists the Bench summed up the proposition by stating that the jurisdiction of a civil court to entertain and pass a decree in a suit for eviction by the landlord against the tenant was not expressly or impliedly taken away by the provisions of the Rent Control Order and in this view the Bench dismissed the civil miscellaneous appeal before it <NAME> and <NAME> dealt with the case of a decree on compromise passed in a suit instituted by the landlord against the tenant for recovery of possession of the property The order for delivery was made in execution on th April directing delivery by th June As against this order there was an appeal and the order of delivery was stayed ex parte on th April On th July the appeal was dismissed upholding the order of delivery and the appellate court apparently taking the view that Section of the Madras Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act would not make the original order for possession ipso factc invalid Against this order of the District Munsif the tenant filed an appeal which was heard and disposed of by the Subordinate Judge who dismissed the appeal on the ground that Section of the Act could not apply to pending execution proceedings that is to say the prior execution petition wherein an order for eviction had already been passed The Bench found as per the facts above that though there was an order of eviction in a prior execution petition the tenant could not be evicted in pursuance of that order and that was why the subsequent execution petition was filed on th July and it was filed after the Rent Control Act had come into operation in the village in which the property was situated the Bench observed as follows It was contended before <ORG> that the moment a person files a suit he obtains thereby a vested right to have applied not only to the suit but to all execution proceedings also the law relating to execution as it existed at the time of filing the suit No doubt there is a reference to pending proceedings in one part of the judgment but it was not necessary to deal with the point because they held that during the interval between the passing of the decree and the filing of the execution petition there was no pending proceeding Ultimately the Bench countenanced the principle that the executing <ORG> is bound to apply the provisions in the statute which had come into force even before the date of the execution petition which it was called upon to dispose The Bench also took note of the fact that it was not a case where during the pendency of an already filed execution petition the Rent Control Act came to be extended to the village in question and by the time of the filing of the concerned execution petition the Act had already come into force Section of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order while giving liberty to the landlord to file a suit for eviction of a tenant before a competent <ORG> provided that no decree for eviction of a tenant passed by a <ORG> shall be executed unless a certificate to that effect is obtained from the Controller In exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the Punjab Urban Rent Restriction Act and all other powers enabling him in this behalf the Governor of Punjab is pleased to direct that the provisions of Section of the said Act shall not apply in respect of decrees for ejectment of tenants in possession of buildings which satisfy the following conditions namely a Buildings constructed during the years and are exempted from all the provisions of the said Act for a period of five years to be calculated from the dates of their completion and Section of the Punjab Act stated that a tenant in possession of a building or rented land shall not be evicted therefrom in execution of a decree passed before or after the commencement of the Act or otherwise and whether before or after the termination of the tenancy except in accordance with the provisions of that section It was contended before <ORG> that the decree having been passed after the lapse of the period of exemption the exemption from the restrictions placed by Section will not be available because not only the suit ought to have been filed but the decree for eviction ought to have been obtained within the period of exemption The decree passed in such suits were held by <ORG> to be executable free from the fetters imposed by Section <ORG> took note of the fact that the buildings constructed in and had already been exempted from the provisions of Section by two earlier notifications and found that the notifications granted exemption to decrees in suits filed within the period of exemption though the decrees came to be passed after the lapse of such period It merely states that nothing in the Act shall apply to any building for a period of five years from the date on which the construction is completed and notified to local authority concerned In <NAME> <NAME> Ismail as he then was dealt with a case where a decree was passed prior to the amendment to Section of the Act and taking advantage of the amendment limiting the period of exemption to new buildings only for a period of five years it was contended that the decree stood nullified In <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> dealt with a case where a suit for ejectment was filed taking advantage of Clause iii of Section of the Act prior to the amendment in which provided that nothing contained in the Act would apply to any non residential building the rental value of which on the date of the commencement of the Act as entered in the property tax assessment book of the municipal council district board panchayat or panchayat union council or <ORG> exceeded Rs <ORG> held that the suit will abate even if there was no express allegation in the plaint to the effect that the suit was instituted on the ground that the building was exempted under Clause iii of Section of the Act and the Act as such could apply to the building in question and the tenant became a statutory tenant and he could not be evicted except in accordance with the provisions of the Act ejectment came to be levied after the Pondicherry Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act came into force A contention that the suit itself was barred and the civil <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass a decree In ejectment was negatived by this <ORG> in second appeal and the question as to whether reliance could be placed on the provisions of the Pondicherry Act was left open to the stage of execution of the decree When the question was raised in execution the tenant could not succeed and the executing <ORG> held that the decree was one passed before the enforcement of the Act to the area in question and that was no bar to the executability of the decree However during the pendency of the first appeal the Act was made applicable to the town where the building was situated and the tenant filed an application in the first court for a declaration that the decree cannot be executed There the landlord filed a suit for eviction and for other reliefs on the ground that the period of ten years had not lapsed on the date of suit The only point argued before <ORG> on a special leave petition was whether the premises which was not ten years old on the date of the suit and was exempted from the operation of the Act could be governed by it if ten years expired during the pendency of the litigation A contention was put forth that the <ORG> had to decide the case on the basis of cause of action that had accrued prior to the filing of the suit and not on a new cause of action The Supreme <ORG> ruled out that the moment the building becomes ten years old to be reckoned from the date of completion the Act would become applicable for the purpose of enabling the tenant to work out the rights under it The discussion of the case law which has preceded and my assessment thereof oblige me to take note of the following indisputable propositions The Act as such does not oust the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain a suit for eviction by a landlord against a tenant and the passing of a decree in such a suit A decree validly passed would still be unexecutable on account of the law that is prevailing or which comes into force at the relevant point of time The filing of the suit in <ORG> during the period of exemption and the obtaining of a decree in such a suit even during or after the lapse of the period of exemption is of no consequence at all and if at the time the decree is put into execution to evict the tenant the Act has intervened and come into force that alone would govern The courts are not concerned with the policy of the legislature or with the result whether injurious or otherwise by giving effect to the language used nor is it the function of the Court where the meaning is clear act to give effect to it merely because it would lead to hardship I make no order as to costs
