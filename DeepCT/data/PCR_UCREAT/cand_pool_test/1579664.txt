As the lands claimed by each of the plaintiffs fell partly to the share of one set of co sharers on partition and partly to the shara of another each plaintiff brought two suits The defendants have preferred these second appeals to this <ORG> It has been found as a fact in the Courts below that the lands were not the bakasht of the co sharers originally but raiyati jote land acquired by the plaintiffs or their predecessors and this is corroborated by the Record of Rights published in which whilst describing the lands as bakasht of the plaintiffs or their predecessors states that they were formerly an occupancy raiyati jote acquired by them as share holding proprietors and gives the amount of rent which the other co sharers were entitled to under Section of the Bengal Tenancy Act It was argued on behalf of the appellants that the plaintiffs having been parties to the partition suit originally were bound by the decision in that suit in But far as it treated the land as bakasht But even if they are to be treated as parties to the partition suit notwithstanding that they sold their proprietary interest shortly after the suit was instituted and ceased to be interested any longer as proprietors still it has not been shown that there was any issue in the suit as to the nature of the land in question In the latter case although no occupancy right can vest in the fractional proprietor he still acquires a separate interest in the raiyati holding paying to his co proprietors their share of the rent It is contended however that the Bengal Tenancy Act has no application to the present case as the interest of the plaintiffs was originally acquired before when the first Bengal Tenancy Act was passed and that we must consider the law then existing I can see no reason why under the old law any more than under the present Bengal Tenancy Act this right should cease to exist because the co sharer transfers his interest to another proprietor Whether before the amending Act of the co owner or his transferee could sever the interest by subletting to a tenant may be a question of some difficulty and no authority has been drawn to our attention on the subject but in my opinion it is unnecessary to determine this point for whatever may be said as to the retrospective effect of the first Sub section of Section which limits the rights of a proprietor the second sub section in so far as it refers to the rights of a sublessee which come into operation after the Act must I think apply to all cases where such a sub lease is effected after the passing of the amending Act whether the occupancy right was acquired before or after the passing of that Act or the Act of In my opinion the conclusion arrived at by the lower Courts was right in the particular circumstances of the case and these appeals should be dismissed with costs to the contesting respondents together with interest at the usual rate
