of the Constitution leaves no scope in India for the application of the American doctrine that the declaration by a court of unconstitutionality of a statute which is in conflict with the Constitution affects the parties only and there is no judgment against the statute and it does not strike the statute from the statute book of came up for hearing in the first instance before a Bench of Hon ble Judges composed of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> who delivered the following Judgments dated th February <NAME> is an appeal by special leave from a judgment of <ORG> at Bombay reversing the order of acquittal passed in favour of the appellant by <ORG> <ORG> Bombay and convicting him of an offence under section of the Bombay Prohibition Act and sentencing him to one month rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs He also filed a written statement on the th March setting out in detail the whole history of his case He further stated that on the night in question he had at about or after dinner taken a dose of Phos and was proceeding in his jeep car for a drive via Cuffee Parade and Marine Drive when the accident took place In regard to the offence under section of the Bombay Prohibition Act he observed that the evidence did not go to show conclusively that the appellant had consumed alcohol without a permit that there were certain medicinal preparations which were allowed to be used by law and there was no satisfactory evidence to show that the appellant had not consumed those tonics but only liquor for which he ought to have a permit The respondent the State of Bombay took two appeals before <ORG> against each of these two cases <ORG> followed a decision of its own <ORG> in <NAME> State where it had been held that Once it is proved by the prosecution that a person has drunk or consumed liquor without a permit it is for that person to show that the liquor drunk by him was not prohibited liquor but was alcohol or liquor which he is permitted by law to take medicated alcohol It came to the conclusion that the appellant had failed to prove the existence of circumstances from which the Court could come to the conclusion that the liquor which was consumed by the appellant was not prohibited liquor but liquor which was excepted by the Bombay Prohibition Act from its operation and set aside the order of acquittal passed by the learned Presidency Magistrate in his favour convicting him of the offence and sentencing him as above It may be noted that the Act as it stood before the amendment by Bombay Act XXVI of which came into operation on the nd October enacted in section the only presumption as to the commission of offences in certain cases which cases had nothing to do with the question before us It however considered the restrictions imposed by sections and of the Act on the possession sale use and consumption of liquor not reasonable restrictions on the fundamental right guaranteed by article of the Constitution to acquire hold and dispose of property so far as medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol were concerned and declared the said sections invalid so far as they prohibited the possession sale use and consumption of these articles See also the dictum of Field in <NAME> Shelby County An unconstitutional Act is not law it confers no rights it imposes no duties it affords no protection it creates no office it is in legal contemplation as inoperative as though it had never been passed The <ORG> may give its reasons for ignoring or disregarding the statute but the decision affects the parties only and there is no judgment against the statute No offence could be committed by the consumption of liquid medicinal or toilet preparations containing alcohol and the provision enacted in section read in the light of the definitions of intoxicant and liquor contained in sections and of the Act in so far as it prohibited the consumption or use of liquor including liquid medicinal or toilet preparations containing alcohol was rendered inoperative and unenforceable by the declaration to the extent of the inconsistency and liquid medicinal or toilet preparations containing alcohol were lifted out of the category of validly prohibited liquor Penal statutes should be strictly construed and the <ORG> could only penals the consumption or use of validly prohibited liquor which only could constitute an offence under section It was strenuously urged before us on behalf of the respondent that the declaration in effect though not in terms enacted an exception or proviso to section and that therefore the onus lay upon the appellant to prove the existence of circumstances bringing his case within the exception or proviso It had the effect of rendering the prohibition of consumption or use of liquid medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol as having never at any time been possessed of any legal force and so not to be enforceable wherever any accused person was charged with having contravened the provisions of section of the Act If this is the effect of the declaration made by this Court there is no room for holding that the only duty of the prosecution was to prove that the accused had taken liquor in some form or the other and that the burden lay on the accused to prove that be had taken a liquid medicinal or toilet preparation containing alcohol When an accused person is charged with having committed an offence it is for the prosecution to prove all the ingredients of the offence with which he has been charged and the ingredients of the offence under section as stated above were that he had consumed or used liquor validly prohibited i spirits of wine methylated spirits wine beer toddy and all non medicinal and non toilet liquid preparations consisting of or containing alcohol There was no presumption enacted in the Act as it stood which would throw the burden of proof on the accused to show that he had consumed or used liquid medicinal or toilet preparation containing alcohol There was no exception or proviso enacted either in terms or in effect in section which attracted the operation of section of the Evidence Act and cast upon the accused the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing his case within such exception or proviso It is for the prosecution to prove that he has committed the offence and that burden is not in any manner whatsoever displaced by section of the Evidence Act <ORG> in arriving at its decision in <NAME> <ORG> supra above referred to was impressed with the circumstance that the prosecution could not possibly prove that no form of medicated alcohol was taken by the accused that there were evidently numerous forms of medicated alcohol and that it was impossible for the prosecution on the very face of things to exclude all those forms If the prosecution were to lead evidence that the accused had not taken it in the form of Winedex the accused would say that he had taken it in the form of Waterbury Compound or Hall Wine It therefore came to the conclusion that once the prosecution had discharged the onus which was upon it to prove that the accused person had consumed liquor it would be for the accused to show that the liquor which was taken by him was liquor in the form of medicated alcohol in other words not prohibited liquor As there are a number of preparations which come within the category of liquid medicinal and toilet preparations consisting of or containing alcohol there are a number of preparations which come within the category of non medicinal or non toilet liquid preparations consisting of or containing alcohol and it would be really for the police investigating the alleged offence to find out which out of the latter category of preparations the accused had consumed and bring him to book for the same The difficulty in the way of the prosecution proving its case need not deflect the <ORG> from arriving at a correct conclusion That was not enough and I have therefore come to the conclusion that the prosecution failed to prove that the appellant had committed the offence with which he was charged I would therefore allow the appeal and quash the conviction and sentence passed upon the appellant by <ORG> Two questions of law have been raised in this case viz The <ORG> may give its reasons for ignoring or disregarding the statute but the decision affects the parties only and there is no judgment against the statute The definition of the word liquor with its inclusive content remaining intact and valid that content has to be imported wholesale into the meaning of the word liquor in section and it appears to me that it is not permissible to read it or understand it in a different sense the amendment can be made in one of many modes and that there is no reason to choose between them and that it is not fair to an accused person to read it in a manner throwing the burden on him when a more favourable mode is open Now if the relevant portion of the section is recast in the manner above indicated in any of the alternative modes in the portion marked A above I have no doubt that every one of these modes is only an exception or a proviso which falls within the specific terms of section of the Evidence Act i an exception or proviso in the law defining the offence If on the other hand the section is treated as amended by incorporating the portion marked omitting the portion marked A it appears to me with great respect that it is to alter the very content of the word liquor in the section for which I can find no legal justification In particular it is to be noticed that the appellant put forward a specific defence in Paragraph of the written statement filed by him into <ORG> in answer to the charge <NAME> regret that I am unable to agree with the view taken by my learned brother <NAME> The facts giving rise to this appeal have been stated in his Judgment which I have had the advantage of reading and it is unnecessary to restate them It was there held inter alia that section in so far as it prohibited the consumption of medicinal preparations was an unreasonable restriction on the rights of an owner to hold and enjoy property and was therefore void as being repugnant to article of the Constitution I agree with the appellant that section has no application They merely interpret the law and declare whether it is valid or not and the result of a declaration that it is not valid is that no effect could be given to it in a <ORG> of law The definition of liquor in section in its extended sense having thus been held to be valid it follows that unless there is something in the particular provision to the contrary the word liquor must wherever it occurs in the statute include medicinal preparations and that is the meaning which it must bear in section There is a strong presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a statute and it is for those who assail it as unconstitutional to establish it The contention of the appellant is when analyzed that section is bad in so far as it hits medicinal preparations containing alcohol as it contravenes article of the Constitution and the decision of this Court in The State of Bombay and Another <NAME> supra is relied on as supporting it It was argued for the appellant that this Court had declared that section was void under article of the Constitution in so far as it related to medicinal preparations that that meant that it was to that extent a nullity and that it should in consequence be read as if it did not include medicinal preparations The answer to it depends on two considerations firstly does the constitutional prohibition which has been infringed affect the competence of the <ORG> to enact the law or does it merely operate as a check on the exercise of a power which is within its competence and secondly if it is merely a check whether it is enacted for the benefit of individuals or whether it is imposed for the benefit of the general public on grounds of public policy That would also be the position when a limitation is imposed on the legislative power in the interests of the public as for instance the provisions in Chapter XIII of the Constitution relating to inter <ORG> trade and commerce In <NAME> Barron it was observed that provisions of a constitutional nature intended for the protection of the property owner may be waived by him the position was thus stated A person may by his acts or omission to act waive a right which he might otherwise have under the Constitution of the United States as well as under a statute In <ORG> <ORG> where a statute was impugned on the ground that it imposed unreasonable restrictions on the rights of a corporation to carry on business and thereby violated the rights guaranteed under the Fourteenth Amendment the Court observed There is nothing in the nature of such a constitutional right as is here asserted to prevent its being waived or the right to claim it barred as other rights may be by deliberate election or by conduct inconsistent with the assertion of such a right The rights guaranteed under article are enacted for the benefit of owners of properties and when a law is found to infringe that provision it is open to any person whose rights have been infringed to waive it and when there is waiver there is no legal impediment to the enforcement of the law It is scarcely necessary to add that the question of waiver is relevant to the present controversy not as bearing on any issue of fact arising for determination in this case but as showing the nature of the right declared under article and the effect in law of a statute contravening it Though it was valid with reference to intra state sales it was unconstitutional in so far as it related to inter State sales That Act in terms removed the obstacle and we perceive no adequate ground for adjudging that a re enactment of the <ORG> law was required before it could have the effect upon imported which it had always had upon domestic property The position is thus stated by <NAME> in his work on Constitutional Law at page A court decision merely decides the case that is then under adjudication and a finding of unconstitu tionality does not destroy the statute but This question again it may be noted does not arise as such for determination in this case and is material only as showing that an infringement of a constitutional prohibition which does not affect the competence of a <ORG> but is merely a check on its exercise does not render the law a nullity Reference may be made in this connection to the statement of the law in Corpus Juris Volume page et seq to which counsel for the respondent invited our attention As already explained article only has the effect of nullifying or rendering all inconsistent existing laws ineffectual or nugatory and devoid of any legal force or binding effect only with respect to the exercise of fundamental rights on and after the date of commencement of the Constitution It is true that the question which the <ORG> was considering there was different from the one which we have now to decide in this appeal It was next contended that even if the burden lay on the appellant to prove that he had taken a medicinal preparation he must be held on the evidence to have discharged it because the doctor who examined him at on the day of the occurrence stated in his evidence that he was coherent in his speech and could walk along a straight line that the smelling of alcohol could be caused by oxidation and that the condition of the conjunctive in the eyes could result from street dust They also remarked that the appellant could have informed both the sub inspector and the doctor who examined him that he had taken medicine in which case the police might have been in a position to find out whether there was a medicine bottle at his residence at that time If the learned Judges were right in their view that the burden lay on the appellant their finding that it had not been discharged is not one which is open to attack It was also contended that the trial magistrate having acquitted the appellant the presumption of innocence which the law raises in favour of the accused became reinforced and that there were no compelling reasons for the appellate Court to have reversed the order of acquittal By THE Court Having regard to the judgments of the majority the appeal will be dismissed subject to the modification that the sentence imposed upon the appellant will be reduced to that already undergone There was an application for review of the aforesaid Judgments under article of the Constitution and the Hon ble Judges of the original Bench <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> passed the following order dated th April referring the case for the opinion of the Constitution Bench Under proviso to article of the Constitution we refer the following question for the opinion of the Constitution Bench of the Court medicinal or toilet preparations containing alcohol on the ground that it infringes article of the Constitution The facts giving rise to the reference are these <NAME> the appellant in the case was at the relevant period officiating Regional Transport Officer Bombay Region to the offence under section of the Bombay Prohibition Act it was observed that there were certain medicinal preparations which were allowed to be used by law and there was no satisfactory evidence to show that the appellant had not consumed those tonics but only liquor for which he ought to have a permit On this view of the law on the merits of the case it was held that the appellant had failed to prove the existence of circum stances from which the Court could come to the conclusion that the liquor which was consumed by the appellant was not prohibited liquor but liquor which was excepted by the Bombay Prohibition Act from its operation On this view of the effect of <NAME> decision it was held that the onus rested on the accused to establish that his case fell within the exception and he had failed to discharge that onus In that case the constitutional validity of the Bombay Prohibition Act XXV of was challenged on different grounds Section prohibits the use or consumption of liquor without a permit The meaning to be given to the expression void in article is no longer res integra The minority view there was that the word void had the same meaning as repeal and therefore a statute which came into clash with fundamental rights stood obliterated from the statute book altogether and that such a statute was void ab initio It was further pointed out in one of the judgments representing the majority view that the American rule that if a statute is repugnant to the Constitution the statute is void from its birth has no application to cases concerning obligations incurred or rights accrued in accordance with an existing law that was constitutional in its inception but that if any law was made after the th January which was repugnant to the Constitution then the same rule shall have to be followed in India as followed in America Thus in this situation there is no scope for introducing terms like relatively void coined by American Judges in construing a Constitution which is not drawn up in similar language and the implications of which are not quite familiar in this country Both these declarations of unconstitutionality go to the root of the power itself and there is no real distinction between them The legislative power of <ORG> and the <ORG> Legislatures as conferred by articles and of the Constitution stands curtailed by the fundamental rights chapter of Constitution A mere reference to the provisions of article and articles and is sufficient to indicate that there is no competency in <ORG> or a <ORG> Legislature to make a law which comes info clash with Part III of the Constitution after the coming into force of the Constitution Article is in these terms The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void This is a clear and unequivocal mandate of the funda mental law prohibiting the <ORG> from making any laws which come into conflict with Part III of the Constitution Without finally expressing an opinion on this question we are not for the moment convinced that this theory has any relevancy in construing the fundamental rights conferred by Part III of our Constitution They have been put there as a matter of public policy and the doctrine of waiver can have no application to provisions of law which have been enacted as a matter of constitutional policy A citizen cannot get discrimination by telling the <ORG> You can discriminate or get convicted by waiving the protection given under articles and In view of this clear enactment there is no scope in India for the application of the American doctrine enunciated by <NAME> The Constitution of the United States Vol I wherein the learned author states the declaration by a court of unconstitutionality of a statute which is in conflict with the Constitution affects the parties only and there is no judgment against the statute that the opinion or reasons of the court may operate as a precedent for the determination of other similar cases but it does not strike the statute from the statute book the parties to that suit are concluded by the judgment but no one else is bound a new litigant may bring a new suit based on the very same statute and the former decision cannot be pleaded as an estoppel but can be relied on only as a precedent In America there is no similar statutory provision and that being so the doctrine enunciated by the learned author can have no application here The <ORG> has to take notice only of what the law of the land is and convict the accused only if he contravenes the law of the land Apart from this circumstance it seems plain that unless there is a power to make a law inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of the Constitution there can be no power to engraft an exception of the nature suggested by our brother But when there is no power to enact at all what is proposed to be embodied in the exception there is no power to enact an exception by enacting a law which the <ORG> is not competent to make The <ORG> has no power to make a law abridging fundamental rights and therefore there is no power to engraft an exception by taking something out of a law which cannot be enacted With the observations made above the opinion in this case is returned to the Bench which originally heard the appeal It is necessary at the outset to refer to the relevant statutory provisions bearing on the question Article gives to all citizens the fundamental right to acquire hold and dispose of property By sub article however it is provided that nothing in clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by sub clause either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe By virtue of sub article the right conferred by sub clause cannot affect the operation of the Act in so far as it imposes reasonable restrictions of the kind mentioned in that sub article If however this existing law imposes restrictions which are unreasonable then it becomes inconsistent with the right guaranteed to the citizens by article and consequently under article shall to the extent of such inconsistency be void It is beyond all dispute that it is for the <ORG> to judge whether the restrictions imposed by any existing law or any Part thereof on the fundamental rights of citizens are reasonable or unreasonable in the interest of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe If the <ORG> holds that the restrictions are unreasonable then the Act or the part thereof which imposes such unreasonable restrictions comes into conflict and becomes inconsistent with the fundamental right con ferred on the citizens by article and is by article This is plainly the position as I see it So far as it is material for our present purpose this Court held that under entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act <ORG> had the power to make laws with respect to intoxicating liquors that is to say the production manufacture possession transport purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors and there was therefore no legislative incompetency in <ORG> to enact the Bombay Prohibition Act that the word liquor as understood in India at the time of the Government of India Act covered not only those alcoholic liquids which are generally used as beverages and produce intoxication but also liquids containing alcohol and therefore the definition of liquor contained in section of the Act was not ultra vires and that the restrictions imposed by sections and of the Act on the possession sale use and consumption of liquor were not reasonable restrictions on the fundamental right guaranteed by article so far as medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol were concerned and that the said sections were invalid so far as they prohibited the possession sale use The very foundation of this declaration was that the prohibition imposed by this section against the consumption or use of liquid medicinal or toilet preparations was an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of the fundamental right of citizens to acquire hold and dispose of property which in that case was liquid medicinal or toilet preparations containing alcohol The law thus declared by this Court is by virtue of article of the Constitution binding on all Courts within the territory of India The appellant came up to this Court in appeal after having obtained special leave from this Court The appeal came up for hearing before a Division Bench of this Court consisting of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> however took the view that as the <ORG> had no legislative function and as judicial decisions did not amend or add to a statute but merely interpreted the law and declared whether it was valid or not the result of a judicial declaration that a statute or any part thereof was not valid was only that no effect could be given to it in a <ORG> of law but that it did not mean that the statute or the part thereof declared void had gone out of the statute book after the <ORG> decision <NAME> felt inclined to agree with the view of <NAME> but as that aspect of the matter had not been fully argued he passed on to the argument canvassed before them namely that the part of the section declared invalid went out of the Act and the Act stood appropriately amended pro tanto An application for review was however made on the ground that the judgments of the learned Judges involved a decision on constitutional matters which that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to decide but which could only be dealt with by a Constitution <ORG> In such a situation it cannot be said that the judicial declaration means that such a statute is void for all purposes including past transactions that took place before the commencement of the Constitution In other words when a citizen is charged with an offence under section read with section he will be entitled to say I am a citizen of India Suppose after the declaration a person is charged with an offence under section read with section and in such a case the prosecution proves that the accused has taken alcohol in some form or other as is the evidence of the doctor in the present case The very basis of that declaration is that a citizen has the fundamental right to consume or use liquid medicinal or toilet preparations containing alcohol and section in so far as it prohibits such consumption or use imposes an unreasonable restriction on his fundamental right under article I answer the question referred to us accordingly Section of this very Bombay Prohibition Act raises a very strong presumption of guilt and throws the burden on the accused to prove his innocence in certain cases Take section of the Indian Penal Code which says Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence Nobody will contend that this section requires the prosecution to prove that the acts constituting the offence charged against the accused were not done in the exercise of the right of private defence In coming to the conclusion that I have I have in a large measure found myself in agreement with the views of <NAME> on that part of the case After the opinion of <ORG> the following Order dated th September was pronounced by a Bench composed of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> who had originally heard the appeal
