is a limited company having its registered office at Ahmedabad It was assessed to income tax for the year and <ORG> by his order dated June assessed the excess amount of Rs The assessee raised various contentions before <ORG> inter alia that the said income was not liable to be taxed under of the Income tax Act under the head capital gains and that in any case in order to determine the amount of capital gains the market value of the shares only should be taken into consideration as the price of Rs The assessee preferred an appeal against that order to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner under of the Income tax Act and that was dismissed on March on the ground that it was not maintainable Meanwhile on September the appellant filed an application before the Commissioner of Income tax under A of the Income tax Act for revising the order of <ORG> dated September It may be noticed that long before the revision petition was dismissed the appeal filed by the assessee against the order of <ORG> to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was dismissed on March On November the attention of the Commissioner was also drawn to the fact that <ORG> in the case of a reference to that Court at the instance of <ORG> held that the market value of the shares should be taken into consideration to ascertain the excess realized on the sale of the shares of the assessee for the purpose of capital gains tax Thereafter on July the assessee filed Writ Application No of in <ORG> at Allahabad inter alia for a writ of certiorari or any other direction or order of like nature to quash the order of the Income tax Commissioner Lucknow dated March and the Order of <ORG> dated September and for a writ of mandamus or any other order or direction of the like nature directing the Commissioner to pass a fresh order in accordance with the decision of <ORG> and direct <ORG> to pass a fresh order in accordance with law and to issue a notice of demand as required by of the Income tax Act <ORG> dismissed the said application in limine mainly on the following grounds the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition was highly unsatisfactory and on the basis of such an affidavit it was not possible to entertain the petition the facts given in the affidavit were incomplete and confused and even on merits there was no force in the revision petition Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant contended that the affidavit filed in support of the petition was in accordance with law and that even if there were any defects the court should have given an opportunity to the appellant to rectify them and that <ORG> should have held that the revision against the order of the Income tax Officer to the Commissioner was maintainable under section A of the Act as the appeal against that order to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner was not maintainable and that it should have directed the commissioner of entertain the revision and dispose it in accordance with law directing the Income tax Officer to issue a notice of demand under section of the Income tax Act Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the revenue while supporting the order of <ORG> raised a preliminary objection namely that the order of the Commissioner under section A of the Income tax Act was an administrative act and therefore no writ of certiorari would lie to <ORG> to quash that order under article of the constitution We shall first take the preliminary objection for if we maintain it no other question will arise for consideration Article of the Constitution reads <ORG> shall have power throughout the territories in relation to which it exercise jurisdiction to issue to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any <ORG> within those territories directions orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari or any of them for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose This article is couched in comprehensive phraseology and it ex facie confers a wide power on the high court to reach injustice wherever it is found The said decisions laid down the following conditions to be complied with The body of persons must have legal authority the authority should be given to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and they should have a duty to act judicially So far there is no dispute The true view as it seems to us is that the duty to act judicially may arise in widely different circumstances which it would be impossible and indeed inadvisable to attempt to define exhaustively When on the other hand the decision is that of an administrative body and is actuated in whose or in part by questions of policy the duty to act judicially may arise in the course of arriving at the decision the body concerned had to consider proposals and objections and consider evidence then there is the duty to act judicially in the course of that inquiry Further an administrative body in ascertaining facts or law may be under a duty to act judicially notwithstanding that its proceedings have none of the formalities of and are not in accordance with the practice of a court of law If on the other hand an administrative body on arriving at its decision at no stage has before it any form of lis and throughout has to consider the question from the point of view of policy and expediency it cannot be said that it is under a duty at any stage to act judicially II at pages and thus It is not necessary that it should be a court an administrative body in ascertaining facts or law may be under a duty to act judicially notwithstanding that its proceedings have none of the formalities of and are not in accordance with the practice of a law A body may be under a duty however to act judicially and subject to control by means of these orders although there is no form of lis inter parts before it it is enough that it should have to determine a question solely on the facts of the particular case solely on the evidence before it apart from questions of policy or any other extraneous considerations There are innumerable decisions of this court were it issued a writ of certiorari to quas a quasi judicial act of an administrative tribunal or authority If the statute expressly imposes a duty on the administrative body to act judicially it is a clear case of a judicial act With this background let us look at the relevant provisions of the Income tax Act The commissioner may on application by an assessee for revision of an order under this act passed by any authority subordinate to the Commissioner made within one year from the date of the order or within such further period as the commissioner may think fit it allow on being satisfied that the assessee was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within that period call for the record of the proceeding in which such order was passed and on receipt of the record may make such inquiry or cause such inquiry to be made and subject to the provisions of this Act may pass such order thereon not being an order prejudicial to the assessee as he thinks fit provided that the Commissioner shall not revise any order under this sub section if a where an appeal against the order lies to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner or to <ORG> but has not been made the time within which such appeal may be made has not expired or in the case of an appeal to <ORG> the assessee has not waived his right of appeal or where an appeal against the order has been made to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner the appeals is pending before the appellate assistant Commissioner or the order has been made the subject of an appeal to the Appellate tribunal Provided further that an order by the Commissioner declining to interfere shall be deemed not to be an order prejudicial to the assessee After such enquiry he can make an order not to the prejudice of the assessee but to his benefit It is implicit in revisional jurisdiction that the revising authority shall give an opportunity to the parties affected to put forward their case in the manner prescribed But it is said that the commissioner exercising jurisdiction under section A of the Act us only functioning as an administrative authority and all his orders make thereunder partake of that character But the Board incidentally made the following observations On the contrary section follows upon a number of sections which determine the rights of the assessee and is itself as its language clearly indicates intended to provide administrative machinery by which a higher executive officer may review the acts of his subordinates and take the necessary action upon such review there is no justification for giving him a view right of appeal These observations were made in the context of a question whether a reference would lie to <ORG> against an order of the commissioner But the question whether the order of the commissioner under section of the Act was a judicial or a quasi judicial act subject to the prerogative writ of certiorari was neither raised nor decided in that case that question was not germane to the enquiry before the <ORG> for the appeal did not arise out of any order made in a writ of certiorari <ORG> mainly dismissed the writ petition on the ground that the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition was highly unsatisfactory and that on the basis of such an affidavit it was not possible to entertain the petition In exercise of the powers conferred by article of the constitution and of other powers enabling it in that behalf of <ORG> framed the Rules of Court Chapter XXII thereof deals with the procedure to be followed in respect of proceeding under article of the constitution other than a writ in the nature of habeas corpus The relevant rule is sub rule of rule of Chapter XXII which reads The application shall set out concisely in numbered paragraphs the facts upon which the applicant relies and the grounds upon which the court is asked to issue a direction order or writ and shall conclude with a prayer stating clearly so far as circumstances permit the exact nature of the relief sought But it is said that the affidavit filed in support if the application did not speak to matters which were within the depondent own knowledge That apart if the affidavit was defective in any manner <ORG> instead of dismissing the petition in limine should have given the appellant a reasonable opportunity to file a better affidavit complying with the provisions of of Ch XXII of the Rules But the fact that a Division Bench of one of <ORG>s in India had taken the view in favour of the appellant indicates that the question raised is in our view an arguable one and it requires serious consideration Be that as it may <ORG> did not finally decide two important questions that really arose for consideration before it namely i whether a revision lay to the commissioner under section A of the Act against the order of the Income tax Officer and ii whether the Income tax Officer should have issued a demand under section of the Act The Officer to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner reject the appeal filed by the appellant as being not maintainable As no appeal lay to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner against the calculations made by the Income tax Officer the commissioner had certainly power to revise the said order On March the appellant filed an application requesting <ORG> to issue a notice of demand as required by section of the Act When any tax penalty or interest is due in consequence of any order passed under or in pursuance of this act the Income tax Officer shall serve upon the assessee or other person liable to pay such tax penalty or interest a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable Pursuant to the directions given by the tribunal the Income tax Officer made fresh calculations under the head Capital gains and pursuant to the said calculation he should have passed an order and issued the Income tax Officer did not discharge his duty which he was bound to do under the Act with the result he had become amendable to a writ of mandamus directing him to do what he should have done under the Act In the result the order of the high Court is set aside and we issue a writ of certiorari quashing the order of the commissioner and a writ of mandamus directing the Income tax Officer to pass as order and issue a notice in accordance with law The appellant will have his costs throughout
