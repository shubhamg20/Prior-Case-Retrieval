i Modern penology regards crime and criminal as equally material when the right sentence has to be picked out although in our processual system there is neither comprehensive provision nor adequate machinery for collection and presentation of social and personal data of the culprit to the extent required in the verdict on sentence The medical evidence shows that <NAME> and <NAME> were stabbed to death with a chisel identified by the accused own father <NAME> and the blacksmith who made it Post mortem was done over the body of the child the accused was arrested and eventually she was charged with offences under and I of course there is no direct evidence in the case but the prosecution has placed a clinching wealth of circumstances and an extra judicial confession to to substantiate its version However there are circumstances attaching to his whereabouts and the slight delay in his statement to the police and the dubiety of his character which permitted his openly wearing a stolen gold ring received from another man wife We have hardly any doubt that the conviction deserves to be confirmed Counsel for the <ORG> correctly drew our attention to the great limitations on the exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction under art Modern penology regards crime and criminal as equally material when the right sentence has to be picked out although in our processual system there is neither comprehensive provision nor adequate machinery for collection and presentation of the social and personal data of the culprit to the extent required in the verdict on sentence there was an argument about the absence of procedure laid down by the law for determining whether the sentence of death or something less is appropriate in the case The Court viewed this Criticism from the constitutional angle and observed The <ORG> is primarily concerned with all the facts and circumstances in so far as they are relevant to the crime and how it was committed and since at the end of the trial he is liable to be sentenced all the facts and circumstances bearing upon the crime are legitimately brought to the notice of the court He is also questioned generally on the case and there is an opportunity for him to say whatever he wants to say He has a right to examine him self as a witness thereafter and give evidence on the material facts In important cases like murder the court always gives a chance to the accused to address the court on the question of sentence In this unclear situation it is unfortunate that there are no penological guidelines in the statute for preferring the lesser sentence it being left to ad hoc forensic impressionism to decide for life or for death We have also given thought to the legal changes wrought into the penal code in free India Under of the Criminal Procedure Code as it stood before its amendment by Act of the normal rule was to sentence to death a person convicted for murder and to impose the lesser sentence for reasons to be recorded in writing No Even so when a wise discretion vests in the court what are the guidelines in this life and death choice The humanism of our Constitution echoing the concern of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is deeply concerned about the worth of the human person California Reporter Capital Punishment Thorstn Sellin The final position as we see it is neither with the absolute abolitionist nor with the Mosaic retributions Where the murderer is too young or too old the clemency of penal justice helps him Where the offender suffers from socioeconomic psychic or penal compulsions insufficient to attract a legal exception or to downgrade the crime into a lesser one judicial commutation is permissible Other general social pressures warranting judicial notice with an extenuating impact may in special cases induce the lesser penalty Extraordinary features in the judicial process such as that the death sentence has hung over the head of the culprit excruciatingly long may persuade the court to be compassionate Likewise if others involved in the crime and similarly situated have received the benefit of life imprisonment or if the offence is only constructive being under read with or again the accused has acted suddenly under another instigation without premeditation perhaps the court may humanely opt for life even like where a just cause or real suspicion of wifely infidelity pushed the criminal into the crime We cannot obviously feed into a judicial computer all such situations since they are astro logical imponderable in an imperfect and undulating society A legal policy on life or death cannot be left for ad hoc mood or individual predilection and so we have sought to objectify to the extent possible abandoning retributive ruthlessness amending the deterrent creed and accenting the trend against the extreme and irrevocable penalty of putting out life <NAME> Appeal allowed in part
