The complainant and father of the deceased aggrieved by the order of <ORG> preferred these appeals by way of special leave to appeal There is a higher standard of proof in criminal cases than in civil cases but there is no absolute standard in either of the cases She used to visit her parents at Amritsar occa sionally and during those visits she used to tell them that there was demand for dowry and also taunting of her by the members of the family of her in laws and also insinuation that she was carrying on illegitimate child There are sufficient relevant and acceptable evidence to that effect Learned Addl Sessions Judge held that there was absence of burn injuries on the fingertips of the mother in law and other members of the family After marriage she used to stay in the house of her in laws at Raja Sansi On the totality of these evidence on record it was held by the learned Sessions Judge that the accused were guilty of abetment to suicide and as such punishable under of the I <ORG> on appeal was of the view that the guilt of the accused had not been proved and as such acquitted them It was contended on behalf of the accused that there was no direct evidence of the act of suicide by <NAME> There is ample and sufficient evidence that she had complained that she was taunted for bringing meager dowry and that even insinuated that she was carrying an illegitimate child There is also evidence that the persons in the house of her in laws in cluding the mother in law mother of the accused <NAME> made no attempt to save her from the burn injuries The absence of any burn injury in the hands of the people around indicates and establishes that there was no attempt to save the deceased though she was seen being burnt While civil case may be proved by mere preponder ance of evidence in criminal cases the prosecution must prove the charge beyond reasonable doubt There is a higher standard of proof in criminal cases than in civil cases but there is no absolute standard in either of the cases Having regard to the circumstances of the case there is no direct evidence indicating the circumstances in which the death took place the conduct of the accused and the nature of the crime with which the accused was charged there cannot be any scope of doubt that the learned Sessions Judge was right and the conviction was properly made The fact the two view are reasonably possible is not established by the fact that two different conclusions are reached by two adjudica tory authorities For the reasons aforesaid I respectfully agree with the judgment and order proposed by my learned brother The appeal was allowed on holding that there was no evidence on record that the ac cused at the time of commission of suicide by <NAME> in any way instigated or abetted her to commit suicide and as such the prosecution failed to establish the charge against the accused and their conviction consequently can not be sustained She used to visit the house of her parents at Amritsar occasionally and during these visits she used to tell them that her in laws were not happy with the dowry given to her and they used to taunt her and insisted her to bring more dowry and that they even used to taunt her that her parents at the time of the marriage did not serve them with proper meals He recorded the statements of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> He further held referring to the provisions of A of the Evidence Act that having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case it may be presumed that the ac cused persons have abetted the suicide committed by the deceased and they fail to reverse this prosecution case by any evidence The accused respondents preferred an appeal being Crimi nal Appeal No of in <ORG> and Haryana It has been contended by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant that the cruel behaviour mal treatment and taunts for not bringing sufficient dowry have been made to the deceased <NAME> soon after her coming to the house of her in laws PF lodged by the complainant it has been specifi cally stated that due to constant harassment of <NAME> by the accused persons for having brought less dowry in her marriage as well as due to constant taunts and also torture the deceased committed suicide by pouring kerosene oil on her and burnt herself and afterwards she died It has also been stated that due to the bad treatment meted out towards his daughter <NAME> at the hands of her husband <NAME> her mother inlaw <NAME> and her father in law <NAME> that she had not brought scooter and fridge and had brought less dowry in her marriage they had forced her to put kerosene oil on her body and commit suicide and as they often taunted her saying that she had begotten immoral and illegal pregnancy and for this reason she had committed suicide and thus had lost her life Furthermore though the house of the accused persons is not far off yet the information was given not by his son in law or other members of the family promptly but it was given by the maternal uncle of the son in law <NAME> at to the appellant although the incident occurred at about It is also evident that the deceased <NAME> who had second to third degree burns on her person was brought to the hospital in the evening and the doctor I immediately examined her and declared that she was already dead It is pertinent to mention that in the appeal before <ORG> it was not urged on behalf of the accused that the case of suicide was not proved and as such there was no finding by <ORG> on this score This decision is not at all applicable to the instant case in view of our specific finding that the evidence adduced on behalf of the prosecution clearly establish that the deceased <NAME> committed suicide at the instiga tion and abetment of the accused persons in the commission of the said offence We have already referred to the material portions of the FIR as well as all the statements made by in his evidence as well as his statement under Section Cr <NAME> told them that there was no improvement in the treatment meted out to her and she was being taunted and tortured by her in laws in the same way and she was not happy They had also taunted that she was having illegitimate child She further stated that the respondents were leveling allegations that she had been carrying an illegiti mate child and that she should die It was also stated by her that her mother in law <NAME> was present in the house and she was abusing <NAME> in their presence <ORG> without properly considering and weighing the evidences of the prosecution witnesses and on a wrong appreciation of the evidences found that the prosecution failed to prove the ingredients of Section of I It was also held that there was no evidence on record that the accused at the time of commis sion of suicide by <NAME> deceased in any way insti gated or abetted her to commit suicide even though it has been brought but in evidences that the deceased was being maltreated by the accused continuously after her coming to the house of her in laws We have also stated hereinbefore that though the incident occurred at the information of the death of <NAME> by burning was given to her father <NAME> at in his shop at Amritsar We have already referred to hereinbefore the evidences of the prosecution witnesses who clearly testified to the greedy and lusty nature of the accused in that they persist ently taunted the deceased and tortured her for not having brought sufficient dowry from her father We fully accept this finding of the Additional Sessions Judge and we also held that the delay in lodging the FIR in the above circumstances does not raise any doubt regarding the veracity of the said two witnesses and there is no infirmity in the evidences of and which would render them unsafe to base the conviction of the accused as wrongly observed by the High Court It has been contended on behalf of the accused respond ents that Section A of the Indian Evidence Act was inserted in the Statutes Book by Act of whereas the offence under Section I The provisions of the said Section do not create any new offence and as such it does not create any substantial right but it is merely a matter of procedure of evidence and as such it is retrospective and will be applicable to this case It is profitable to refer in this connection to Hals bury Laws of England Fourth Edition Volume Page wherein it has been stated that The general rule as mat all statutes other than those which are merely declaratory or which relate only to mat ters of procedure or of evidence are prima facie prospective and retrospective effect is not to be given to them unless by express words or necessary implication it appears that this was the intention of the legislature It has also been stated in the said volume of <ORG> at page that The presumption against retrospection does not apply to legislation concerned merely with matters of procedure or of evidence on the contrary provisions of that nature are to be construed as retrospective unless there is a clear indication that such was not the inten tion of <ORG> The question arose whether this provision which came into force on July can be applied in the instant case It was held that the husband evidence was admissible in that Section of the Act of only altered the law as to the admissibility of evidence and the effect which the courts are to give to evidence so that the rule against giving retrospective effect to Acts of Parliament did not apply For the reasons aforesaid we set aside the judgment and order of acquittal passed by <ORG> and affirm the conviction of the accused of the offence under Section I and sentence imposed upon them by the Additional Sessions Judge Amritsar
