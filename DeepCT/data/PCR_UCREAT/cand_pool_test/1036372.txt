It claimed that the dividend income should be grossed up under Income tax Act and that it should be allowed credit under for the tax deducted at source on the dividend in the hands of the companies The words holder of a share are really equal to the word shareholder and the expression holder of a share denotes only a person who as a shareholder has his name entered on the register of members The company only recognises those persons whose names are on the register of members and they alone are legally entitled to the dividend declared In the case of a blank transfer equities exist between the transferor and the transferee and the transferee has a right to claim the dividend from the transferor who holds it in trust for him but the company is only liable to the transferor and not to the transferee Where any dividend has been paid credited or distributed or is deemed to have been paid credited or distributed to any of the persons specified in section who is a shareholder of a company which is assessed to income tax in the taxable territories or elsewhere such person shall if the dividend is included in his total income be deemed in respect of such dividend himself to have paid income tax exclusive of super tax of an amount equal to the sum by which the dividend has been increased under sub section of section It is itself chargeable under the Act In <NAME> <ORG> Lord <NAME> stated the law which in substance is also the law in our country thus My Lords it is now clearly established that in the case of a limited company the company itself is chargeable to tax on its profits and that it pays tax in discharge of its own liability and not as agent for its shareholders At one time it was thought that the company in paying tax paid on behalf of the shareholder but this theory is now exploded by decisions in this <ORG> and the position of the shareholders as to tax is as I have stated it The company recognises no person except one whose name is on the register of members upon whom alone calls for unpaid capital can be made and to whom only the dividend declared by the company is legally payable Of course between the transferor and the transferee certain equities arise even on the execution and handing over of a blank transfer and among these equities is the right of the transferee to claim the dividend declared and paid to the transferor who is treated as a trustee on behalf of the transferee These equities however do not touch the company and no claim by the transferee whose name is not in the register of members can be made against the company if the tranferor retains the money in his own hands and fails to pay it to him Section of the Indian Companies Act defines share as share in the share capital of the company Section deals with the mode of forming incorporated companies and in the case of companies limited by shares the liability of the members is limited to the amounts if any unpaid on the shares respectively held by them Regulation of Table A reads as follows The instrument of transfer of any share in the company shall be executed both by the transferor and transferee and the transferor shall be deemed to remain holder of the share until the name of the transferee is entered in the register of members in respect thereof The words holder of a share are really equal to the word shareholder and the expression holder of a share denotes in so far as the company is concerned only a person who as a shareholder has his name entered on the register of members The same position obtains in India though the completion of the transaction by having the name entered in the register of members relates it back to the time when the transfer was first made The question that arises in the present case is whether by reason of ss and the assessee who was a transferee on a blank transfer is entitled to the benefits of the grossing up of the dividend income The assessee contends that the word shareholder includes even a person who holds a share as a result of a blank transfer and does not necessarily mean a member of the company whose name is on the register of members The question that falls for consideration is whether the meaning given to the expression shareholder used in of the Act by these cases is correct Learned counsel for the assessee cited a number of authorities in which the ownership of the dividend was in question and it was held that the transferee whose name was not registered was entitled to the dividend after transfer had been made Section lays down The principal officer of every company shall at the time of distribution of dividends furnish to every person receiving a dividend a certificate to the effect that the company has paid or will pay income tax on the profits which are being distributed and specifying such other particulars as may be prescribed Section A makes it clear if any doubt existed that by the term shareholder is meant the person whose name and address are entered in the register of shareholders maintained by the company This takes us immediately to the register of members and demonstrates that even for the purpose of the Indian Income tax Act the words member and shareholder can be read as synonymous The words of must accordingly be read in the light in which the word shareholder has been used in the subsequent sections and read in that manner the present assessee notwithstanding the equitable right to the dividend was not entitled to be regarded as a shareholder for the purpose of of the Act In view of this we are satisfied that the answer given by <ORG> on the question posed by the <ORG> was correct
