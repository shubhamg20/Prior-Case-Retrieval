The <ORG> appointed under the Displaced Persons Debts Adjustment Act dismissed the petition filed by the appellant claiming certain sums from the respondents The taxing Judge to whom question of payment of court fees was referred came to the conclusion that the appellant should pay ad valorem court fees under Schedule I Article of the <ORG> Fees Act Where a legislature uses an expression bearing a well known legal connotation it must be presumed to have used the said expression in the sense in which it has been so understood There is no force in the contention of the respondent that under of the <ORG> Fees Act the decision of the taxing Judge was final and could not be re opened in any court and as such no appeal under Article was maintainable The appellants had filed an application under of the Act before the <ORG> alleging that it was a partnership firm and claimed that an amount of Rs The appellants then filed an appeal before <ORG> with a nominal court fee of Rs The stand taken by the revenue was that as the present appeal was against a decree the case of the appellants squarely fell within the ambit of of the <ORG> Fees Act and therefore ad valorem court fees were payable under Sch It was against this order that the appellants filed a petition for special leave to this <ORG> which having been granted the appeal has now been placed before us for hearing This appeal involves a short but substantial question of law as to the interpretation scope and ambit of Sch of the Court Fees Act as applicable to appeals preferred against the orders or decrees passed by the <ORG> constituted under the Act In the first place he contended that as the proceedings before the <ORG> were not proceeding in <ORG> nor was the <ORG> a Court therefore the decision of the <ORG> even though loosely called as a decree is not a decree as contemplated by of the Code of Civil Procedure and therefore the case of the appellants clearly falls within the ambit of Sch It was next contended that as the <ORG> had disallowed the claim of the appellants by the order impugned before <ORG> the order did not amount to any decree and therefore the question of payment of ad valorem court fees did not arise Secondly it was submitted that the <ORG> was nothing but a Civil <ORG> and the provisions of the Act would show that the <ORG> was clothed with all the powers and incidents of a Civil <ORG> Therefore it was said Sch In order to understand the contentions raised by the counsel for the parties it may be necessary for us to trace the history of the Act and the circumstances in which it was passed Soon after independence there were stray and piecemeal legislations providing for some facilities for displaced debtors and creditors but there was no uniform law to cater to their growing needs in view of the situation faced by them following the partition of our country In these circumstances therefore the Government decided to bring out a uniform legislation so as to be a complete code in itself providing for a cheap and expeditious remedy for displaced debtors and creditors The matter was first entrusted to a <ORG> and then to <NAME> a retired Judge of <ORG> who after taking evidence of a large number of displaced persons and examining the nature of the claims submitted a report which formed the basis of the Displaced Persons Debts Adjustment Act In this Bill we have introduced what might be called a somewhat revolutionary principle namely that no debtor will be called upon to pay more than his paying capacity I submit that these are all very necessary and humane considerations which take into account the actual paying capacity of the debtor Thus it would appear that the intention of <ORG> was to bring out a legislation which would provide for a cheep and expeditious remedy to the displaced persons and entrust the work to a <ORG> which may be able to decide the claims quickly instead of leaving the displaced debtors or creditors to follow the dilatory and cumbersome process of the civil courts the Travancore Cochin General Sales Tax Act this <ORG> observed as follows It is no doubt true that in construing fiscal statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax one must have regard to the strict letter of the law and not merely to the spirit of the statute or the substance of the law If the Reve nue satisfs the <ORG> that the case falls strictly within the provisions of the law the subject can be taxed If on the other hand the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxing statute no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter We therefore propose to decide the question raised before us in the light of the principles enunciated above but before doing that it may be necessary to give a brief survey of the scheme and structure of the Act in order to find out the real nature scope and ambit of the statute Section of the Act provides for constitution of <ORG> to exercise jurisdiction under the Act and empowers <ORG> to designate any civil court or class of civil courts as the <ORG> or <ORG> and may also define the areas in which such <ORG> shall exercise jurisdiction Sections and of the Act provide for issue of notices to the respondents and give right to the respondents to file their objections Section provides for an inquiry into the application made under The statute designedly uses the word proceeding in rather than a suit which clearly shows that the <ORG> was aware of the distinction between a proceeding and a suit It is therefore clear that the decree which the <ORG> passes is not a decree of <ORG> but a decree passed by a <ORG> in a proceeding under and section of the Act Section prescribes the procedure for displaced creditor petition filed under of the Act and authorises the <ORG> to pass a decree as it thinks fit We have purposely mentioned this fact because some of <ORG> have taken the view that where the <ORG> rejects the claim of a displaced creditor or debtor either on the ground that the petitioner is not a displaced debtor or creditor but not on merits such an adjudication does not amount to a decree The next relevant provision is which regulates the procedure for claims against insurance companies and sub of this section provides for a decree to be passed by a <ORG> Section provides for a simplified procedure in certain cases where the claim is below Rs Section of the Act provides the procedure for scaling down of debts by a displaced debtor Section is the provision for appeals against any decree or final order of the <ORG> or against any order passed in the course of execution It is possible therefore to urge that the provisions of such a measure are to be treated as being particularly special in their nature and that they also serve an important national purpose There is no provision therein which compels either a displaced debtor or a displaced creditor to go to the <ORG> he is satisfied with the reliefs which an ordinary civil court can give him in the normal course It is also desirable to notice that so far as a claim of a displaced creditor against a non displaced debtor is concerned the main facilities that seem to be available are the claim can be pursued within one year after the commencement of the Act presumably even though it may have been time barred a decree can be obtained on a mere application i without having to incur the necessary expenses by way of court fee which would be payable if he had to file a suit the creditor has the facility of getting his claim adjudicated upon by a <ORG> which has jurisdiction over the place where he resides i a place more convenient to him than if he had to file a suit under the ordinary law in which case he would have to file a suit at the place where the defendant resides or part of the cause of action arises As pointed out above the claim of the appellants in the present case before us was dismissed by the <ORG> on merits and the stand taken by the <ORG> which found favour with the Taxing Judge of <ORG> was that the appellants should pay ad valorem court fees as their claim was rejected on merits Memorandum of appeal when the appeal is not from a decree or an order having the force of a decree and is presented Two rupees In order to attract application of this article the following conditions must be fulfilled i that the document sought to be stamped must be a memorandum of appeal ii that the appeal should be presented to <ORG> and iii that the appeal should not be from a decree or an order having the force of a decree The third condition of the article is couched in a negative form thus implying that this provision would have no application to appeals against decrees The question that falls for determination is as to whether or not the decision given by the <ORG> under the Act could be said to be a decree within the meaning of Sch It was submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that the Court Fees Act and the Code of Civil Procedure being statutes complementary to each other should be read as one harmonious whole An order rejecting a plaint or directing accounts to be taken or determining any question mentioned or referred to in section but not specified in section is within this definition an order specified in section is not within this definition The Code of Civil Procedure of also gave a full and complete definition of decree in which runs thus decree means the formal expression of an adjudication which so far as regards the <ORG> expressing it conclusively determines the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit and may be either preliminary or final It would be seen that an order rejecting a plaint was clearly mentioned as falling under the term decree In view of this clear definition of the order rejecting a plaint it became necessary to make a corresponding change in Sch of the Court Fees Act and by Act of the words from an order rejecting a plaint or used in Sch before were expressly omitted for the simple reason that an order rejecting a plaint having been incorporated in the definition of a decree it was not necessary to retain it in the Court Fees Act This is the most important intrinsic evidence to show that the <ORG> in enacting the Court Fees Act used the term decree in the same sense as it was used in of the Code of Civil Procedure or in the code obtaining before that day <NAME> where this Court observed as follows In our view in considering the question as to the maintainability of an appeal when the court fee paid was insufficient to start with but the deficiency is made good later on the provisions of the Court Fees Act and the Code of Civil Procedure have to read together to form a harmonious whole and no effort should be made to give precedence to provisions in one over those of the other unless the express words of a statute clearly override those of the other <NAME> There are a number of other decisions of <ORG> which have also taken the view that the word decree appearing in Sch It was further held that the word decree has not been defined in the Court fees Act or in the General Clauses Act and it was safe to assume that the word has been used in the Court fees Act in the sense in which it is used in the Civil Procedure Code The above provision of law therefore indicates that under the Code of Civil Procedure a decree could only be passed in a proceeding which could be termed a suit In the above case the order passed in a proceeding before <ORG> was held not to be a decree Court Fees Act bears the meaning given to it by Civil Nor can it be disputed that there is a vital difference between a decree and order in matters relating to appeals Apart from the above considerations it is a well settled principle interpretation of statute hat where the <ORG> uses an expression bearin a well known legal contation it must be premised to have used the said expression in the sense in which it has been so understood <NAME> on Statute Law observes as follows There is a well known principle of construction that where the legislature uses in an Act a legal term which has received judicial interpretation it must be assumed that the term is used in the sense in which it has been judicially interpreted unless a contrary intention appears There are a number of decisions which have taken the view that Sch In order that an adjudication should amount to a decree under the Code of Civil Procedure it must be a formal expression of an adjudication conclusively determining the rights of the parties with regard to all or any of the matters in controversy in the suit It is true that the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure are made applicable to the proceedings which are commenced by applications We find ourselves in complete agreement with the aforesaid observations made by <NAME> In <NAME> and other <ORG> and Others while construing an almost identical question <ORG> observed as follows It is to afford relief to displaced persons and that purpose may well be frustrated if in cases of preliminary dismissals of the applications the appeals are to be filed with ad valorem court fee on the disputed amount even assuming that it is capable of ascertainment at the particular stage The creditor therefore if he has a right of appeal has to pay court fee under Sch which mentions appeals which are not preferred from a decree or an order having the force of a decree Here the order though it finally determined the application under was not a decree nor did it have the force of a decree for it is not strictly in accordance with the terms of If this is not done and the application is rejected on the ground that the loss did not take place in the circumstances specified in section that order cannot be said to be a decree appears to have taken the same view and observed as follows Having regard to the general purpose of the Act which is almost entirely intended to benefit displaced persons and relieve them from the hardships consequent on their displacement I do not think there can be any doubt that the Act was intended to benefit all displaced persons who had property in West Pakistan which suffered loss or damage and which was covered by an insurance policy entered into before and in force at the time when the loss or damage was sustained whether this occurred before or after the th of August My own view is that it was certainly never anybody intention that displaced persons whether debtors or creditors should have to pay ad valorem court fees on appeals against orders dismissing their applications and I am inclined to share the view of <NAME> that an order dismissing an application whether under or or is merely a final order which does not necessitate the drawing up of any decree sheet or amount to a decree and more particularly so in the case where an application has been dismissed as in the present case on a preliminary point without going into the merits at all We find ourselves in complete agreement with the observation made by <NAME> in the decision referred to above We are however unable to agree with the view taken by these Courts Before concluding we must notice an argument advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents The observations relied upon by the respondents are prefaced by the observations of <NAME> who spoke for the <ORG> where he has clearly mentioned that the <ORG> was not called upon to consider this point thus We are however not called upon to consider the point as to whether would apply to the present suit or whether the present suit would fall under iv Further more it appears that as the appellant before <ORG> was satisfied with the observations made by the <ORG> he did not press for a decision on the question of court fees and confined his arguments only to the question as to whether the court fees should be levied under iv of the <ORG> Fees Act For these reasons the contention raised by the respondents on this score must be overruled In the peculiar circumstances of this case and in view of somewhat uncertain position of the state of law we make no order as to costs
