Licences have been issued to the two petitioners under Chapter VIII of the Central Excise Rules for manufacturing cotton yarn cotton fabrics polyester yarn and polyester fabrics After the yarn is subjected to the further processes like sizing bleaching etc The affidavit in reply filed on behalf of <ORG> makes it clear that in the weaving department yarn is put on beams for length wise use and bobbins are used for weft and thus with the warp and the weft that is length wise and width wise use of yarn through machinery cotton fabric is prepared The question which the petitioners in these petitions have raised is whether in law the central excise authorities can collect excise duty on the yarn which comes into existence at the intervening stage during the course of manufacturing cloth if such yarn is not removed out of the factory premises but is used for consumption within the factory premises for manufacturing the end product namely cotton fabrics or polyester carbonised fabrics It is the contention of the petitioners that looking to the Scheme of the Central Excises and Salt Act and the Central Excise Rules framed under the Central Excises and Salt Act hereafter referred to as the Act the respondents have authority in law to collect excise duty only at the time of removal of the goods from the factory premises and if the goods are shown not to have been removed from the factory premises the central excise authorities have no authority in law to collect excise duty on such goods which are only removed at the intermediate stage from one part of the factory to another part within the factory of the petitioners In order to appreciate the rival contentions in this case it is necessary to refer to some of the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunler Under Section of the Act excisable goods are defined to mean goods specified in the First Schedule as being subject to a duty of excise and includes salt Prescribed means prescribed by rules made under the Act Under Section of the Act there shall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India and a duty on salt manufactured in or imported by land into any part of India as and at the rates set forth in the First Schedule Under Sub section of Section <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette fix for the purpose of levying the said duties tariff values of any article enumerated either specifically or under general headings in the First Schedule as chargeable with duty ad valorem and may alter any tariff values for the time being in force and under Sub section of Section different tariff Values may be fixed for different classes or description of the same articles Section deals with a situation where excise duty is chargeable ad valorem that is where under the Act duty of excise is chargeable on any excisable goods with reference to the value of such goods In the context of Section where excise duty is chargeable ad valorem the value has to be fixed with reference to the place of removal and under Section for the purposes of Section the place of removal means i a factory or any other place or premises for production or manufacture of excisable goods There is no dispute that excise duty as provided in the third column of the First Schedule which lays down the rate of duty is payable in respect of cotton fabrics and polyester fabrics But the main question is whether excise duty is payable on yarn which in the case of each of these two petitioners is an intermediate product which comes into existence in the factory premises and since in each of these two cases the factory is a composite textile mill the entire yarn production of each of the petitioner is utilised for the purpose of manufacturing cotton fabrics or polyester fabrics as the case may be in their weaving departments and both the spinning section where yarn is manufactured and the weaving section where the yarn is woven into fabrics are both located in the premises of the same factory In paragraph of Special Civil Application No of and also in the other petition it has been emphasized that there is no sale of yarn as such All yarn manufactured by the respective petitioner mill is used for the weaving section in the mills and there is no removal of yarn outside the factory premises In exercise of the powers conferred by Sections and of the Act for the purpose of providing for assessment and collection of duty Imposed by the Act and to apply in the adapted form stated below certain provisions of the Sea Customs Act Rules have been framed called The Central Excise Rules Sub rule of Rule provides that no excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the Collector in this behalf whether for consumption export or manufacture of any other commodity in or outside such place until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed in these Rules or as the Collector may require and except on presentation of an application in the proper form and on obtaining the permission of the proper office on the form Sub rule of Rule provides that payment of duty shall not be required in respect of excisable goods made in a factory until they are about to be issued out of the place or premises specified under Rule or are about to be removed from a storeroom or other place of storage approved by the Collector under Rule Rule provides for clearance on payment of duty and lays down that when the manufacturer desires to remove goods on payment of duty either from the place or premises under Rule or from a store room or other place of storage approved by the Collector under Rule he shall make an application in triplicate unless otherwise by rule or order required to the proper officer in the proper Form and shall deliver it to the officer at least twelve hours or such other period as may be elsewhere prescribed or as the Collector may in any particular case require or allow before it is intended to remove the goods The officer shall thereupon assess the amount of duty due on the goods and on production of evidence that this sum has been paid into the <ORG> or into to the account of the Collector in <ORG> or <ORG> or has been despatched to the <ORG> by money order shall allow the goods to be cleared The original copy shall be produced by the carrier on demand by any Central Excise Officer while the goods are in route to such destination from the factory Provided that in respect of removal of excisable goods consumed within the factory for manufacture of other goods in a continuous process the manufacturer may make out a single gate pass at the end of the day Rule which is part of the Chapter prescribing for removal of excisable goods on determination of duty by producers manufacturers and private warehouse licensees prescribes what is known as self removal process and under Rule and procedure to be followed by an assessee when this special procedure is permitted has been laid down Under Sub rule every assessee shall keep an account current with the Collector separately for each excisable goods falling under different Items of the First Schedule to the Act in such form and manner as the Collector may require of the duties payable on the excisable goods and in particular such account and also the account in Form if the assessee is availing of the procedure prescribed in Rule shall be maintained in triplicate by using indelible pencil and double sided carbon and the assessee shall periodically make credit in such account current by cash payment into the treasury so as to keep the balances in such account current sufficient to cover the duty due on the goods intended to be removed at any time and every such assessee shall pay the duty determined by him for each consignment by debit to such account current before removal of the goods The proviso i to Section is in these terms Provided that the duty on the goods consumed within the factory in a continuous process may be paid at the end of the factory day except that in the case of cotton yarn in respect of which duty is payable in accordance with the provisions of Sub rule of Rule the duty may be paid by the manufacturer in accordance with the provisions of the said rule Rule provides for the procedure for obtaining licence and lays down that every person referred to in Rule shall make an application for the grant or renewal as the case may be of licence at the time and in the manner provided for in Rule to the authority who shall be such officer as <ORG> may authorise in this behalf From what we have stated hereinabove regarding the rules it is obvious that under Rule referred to above removal of excisable goods from the place where they are produced or manufactured is not permitted except until the excise duty leviable on them has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed in the rules The law relating to intermediate products manufactured in the course of production of a final end produce when the intermediate product is also an excisable article has been clearly laid down by two decisions of <ORG> Mr <NAME> is therefore right in his contention that the fact that the substance produced by them at an intermediate stage is not put in the market would not make any difference If from the raw material has been brought into existence a new substance by the application of processes one or more of which are with the aid of power and that substance is the same as refined oil as known to the market an excise duty may be leviable under Item the present Item In that case it was pointed out in paragraph by <NAME> speaking for <ORG> as follows The Act charges duty on manufacture of goods The word manufacture implies a change but every change in the raw material is not manufacture There must be such a transformation that a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use The duty is levied on goods As the Act does not define goods the legislature must be taken to have used that word in its ordinary dictionary meaning The dictionary meaning is that to become goods it must be something which can ordinarily come to the market to be bought and sold and is known to the market in Item of the First Schedule This Court held that if a new substance was brought into existence from raw materials and that substance was the same as refined oil as known to the market it would be subject to duty That larger question which was sought to be argued before us can so far as the present judgment is concerned be left open Under Rule it is clear that excise duty must be paid before the goods are removed from the place where they are produced or manufactured and in the light of Rule and the provisions as to licences it is clear that in the case of each excisable article a separate licence has to be taken specifying the particular place where the excisable goods in question are to be manufactured Unless the place is specified in the licence it is not open to the manufacturer of any excisable goods to carry on manufacturing activity and for the purposes of Rule it is the place specified in the licence concerned that is the place where the goods produced or manufactured and it is the removal from the place thus specified in the licence in question that is the place referred to in Rule Once this position is clearly appreciated in the light of the licensing procedure and it is borne in mind that each licence has to specify under the rules the place where excisable goods are to be manufactured it is obvious that it is removal from the place mentioned in the licence which is material and not removal from the larger compound of the factory where excisable goods are consumed for production of further articles which may or may not be excisable goods But the question that we have to ask ourselves is whether removal which is spoken of in Rule is removal from the spinning sections which are licensed premises as shown in the affidavits before us where yarn an excisable article is produced or manufactured and in respect of which licence to produce yarn either cotton or polyester is issued to each of the petitioners or whether it is only removal of cotton fabrics from the factory as such is the event which will attract collection of excise duty In our opinion it is obvious from the scheme of the rules and particularly in the light of the language of Rule read in the context of licensing procedure and rules relating to licences issued to manufacturers of excisable goods that excise duty has to be collected and paid by the manufacturer concerned at the time so far as yarn is concerned when yarn is removed from the spinning department to the weaving department It was found as a fact that calcium carbide manufactured by the company was not known to the market as calcium carbide and one of the contentions which was also urged before <ORG> was that calcium carbide was not removed from the factory of the petitioner and the passage of calcium carbide from the plant where calcium carbide was manufactured to the plant where acetylene gas was manufactured both plants being located in the same factory was not tantamount to removal from the factory to any other place It is obvious from what we have stated in connection with the two cases of <ORG> referred to above that since calcium carbide which was produced by the manufacturer before <ORG> did not amount to a marketable commodity known to the market as such excise duty was not payable on the intermediate product in that particular case Now as we have stated in the course of this judgment Section applies in those cases where excise duty is leviable ad valorem and the provisions of Section provide how value has to be determined for the purpose of levying and collection of ad valorem duty In the case before us where excise duty has to be paid on the basis of weight of yarn the question of invoking Section does not arise and whatever has been said by <ORG> in the context of the provisions of Section will therefore not apply in the instant case The definition covers the present case because the calcium carbide is manufactured in one part of the factory while the acetylene gas is manufactured in another part thereof It cannot be said therefore that the so called calcium carbide made by the petitioner is removed from the factory in which it is made Rule applies to place where is able goods are manufactured and not a factory and if the question of intermediate product which is by itself an excisable article arises for consideration it is always a part of the larger factory where intermediate product will be manufactured if it is manufactured in the same larger premises of the factory That rule provided for collection of duty on cellulosic spun yarn or cotton yarn along with duty on fabrics
