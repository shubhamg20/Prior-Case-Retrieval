A The issues raised in this petition are of vital importance as they relate to maintenance of approved stand ards of drugs in general the writ petition involves the claim for withdrawal of fixed dose combinations and withdrawal of licences of manufacturers engaged in manufac ture of about drugs which have been licensed by <ORG> the issues that fall for consideration are not only relating to technical and specialised matters relating to therapeutic value justification and harmful side effect of drugs but also involve examination of the ectness of action taken by the respondents and on the basis of advice the matter also involves the interest of manufacturers and traders of drugs as also the interest of patients who require drugs for their treatment The techni cal aspects which arise for consideration in a matter of this type cannot be effectively handled by a <ORG> Similar ly the question of policy which is involved in the matter is also one for the Union <ORG> keeping the best of interests of citizens in view to decide There is yet another situation which must be taken note of as human knowledge expands and marches ahead In his application as amended on th February under Article of the Costitution he has asked for directions in public interest banning im port manufacture sale and distribution of such drugs which have been recommended for banning by <ORG> and has also asked for cancellation of all li cences authorising import manufacture sale and distribu tion in respect of such drugs He has also asked for a direction to <ORG> to constitute a high powered <ORG> to go into the hazards suffered by people of the country on account of such drugs being in circulation and suggest remedial meas ures including award of compensation The act was amended in and the definition of drug was amended and sections A and A were inserted into the Act conferring power on <ORG> to prohibit import of drugs and cosmetics in public interest as also to prohibit manu facture sale or distribution thereof The amended Act came into force with effect from st February but on account of proceedings taken in Court by manufacturers challenging the vires of Section A of the Act and interim directions given by the Courts the benefit of the new power conferred on <ORG> is not yet available According to him the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder confer sufficient legislative authority and power on the <ORG> Government as also the <ORG> Drugs Controller to effectively operate in the field These respondents have taken the further stand that reports regarding prevalence of standard drugs as stated in the Writ Petition have come to light as a result of action taken by <ORG> Accordingly a decision was taken that combina tions of Oestrogens and Progestins may be continued for pregnancy test but a warning to the following effect was asked to be put on the package as also in any other promo tional literature regarding the drugs Warning There is some evidence to show that hormonal preparations when used during preg nancy may lead to foetal abnormalities and as such these should not be used during pregnancy or for pregnancy diagnosis The issues in this petition are of vital importance as they relate to maintenance of approved standards of drugs in general the writ petition involves the claim for withdrawal of fixed dose combinations and withdrawal of licences of manufacturers engaged in manufacture of about drugs which have been licensed by <ORG> the issues that fall for consideration are not only relating to technical and specialised matters relating to therapeutic value justification and harmful side effect of drugs but also involve examination of the ectness of action taken by the respondents and on the basis of advice the matter also involves the interest of manufacturers and traders of drugs as also the interest of patients who require drugs for their treatment There is perhaps force in the contention of the petitioner that <ORG> too was not one which could be considered as an authoritative body competent to reach definite conclusions This Court in Band hua Mukti Morcha Union of India SCC aptly observed It is the fundamental right of everyone in this country assured under the interpretation given to Article by this <ORG> in <NAME> case SCC to live with human dignity free from exploitation This right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article derives its life breath from the Directive Principles of State Policy and particularly clauses and of Article and Articles and and at the least therefore it must include protection of the health and strength of the workers men and women and of the tender age of children against abuse opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity educational facilities just as humane condi tions of work and maternity relief These are the minimum requirements which must exist in order to enable a person to live with human dignity and no State neither <ORG> has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic essentials While endorsing what has been said above we would refer to Article in Part IV of the Constitution The technical aspects which arise for consideration in a matter of this type cannot be affectively handled by a court Similarly the question of policy which is involved in the matter is also one for <ORG> keeping the best of interests of citizens in view to decide Yet there are certain contentions raised by the petitioner which deserve serious consideration and we would now proceed to deal with them There is yet another situation which must be taken note of as human knowledge expands and marches ahead We have already taken note of the position that <ORG> was of the view that a fixed number of formulations were enough to meet the demand Law must be provided with sufficient biting teeth and there must be genuine apprehension in the mind of every person engaged in the trade that any infraction would be visited with exemplary punishment There is therefore sufficient scope for research on the basis of our own knowl edge There is however no scope for complacency in this field and constant and regular attention has to be bestowed in order that the flow into the market may be only of ac ceptable drugs It appears to us that there is an immediate need for a central enforcement machinery in the interest of community at large We hope and expect that every State Government would cooperate with <ORG> in this regard and <ORG> would take a lead to establish such an authority which would have jurisdiction all over the country with a view to regulating manufacture and punishing defaults and lapses Section provides for the setting up of <ORG> and its statutory purpose is to advise <ORG> the State Governments and <ORG> on any matter tending to secure uniformity throughout India in the administration of the Act We have no doubt that the existing <ORG> is a useful body but <ORG> should consider whether it requires to be broad based and confined with larger scope of operation or it is necessary to consti tute another high powered authority as prayed for by the petitioner so that such a vital matter like public health does not go without adequate attention At one point of time we were thinking of making an order dissolving the interim directions but that would have necessitated impleading these parties in this case and hearing them We sincerely hope that when any such application is moved before the <ORG> where a dispute of this type is pending the <ORG> would make every endeavour to expedite the disposal of the proceedings and have the same disposed of as early as possible and preferably within a period of two months from the date when it is approached so that the dispute may end If there be any difficulty in giving effect to this part of the judgment <ORG> has leave of this Court to make an appropriate application for directions We however hope that <ORG> shall take into consideration the objec tions raised by the petitioner and have the same referred to <ORG> or to such other body as it con siders expedient for immediate examination and a decision in that regard shall be taken not later than six months We direct <ORG> of <ORG> to deposit a sum of Rs Rupees Five Thousand only in this Court within two months hence which the petitioner will be at liberty to withdraw
