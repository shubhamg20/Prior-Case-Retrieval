The first respondent then filed a writ petition in <ORG> which was allowed The <ORG> appealed It was contended on behalf of the appellant <ORG> that i <ORG> in dealing with a petition under Art of the Constitution ought not to have proceeded to determine disputed questions of fact ii order refixing the date of birth of the respondent was an administrative order and <ORG> had no power to sit in appeal over the decision of the <ORG> authorities of the Constitution <ORG> is not precluded from entering upon a decision on questions of fact raised by the petition The person concerned must be informed of the case of the <ORG> and the evidence in support thereof and must be given a fair opportunity to meet the case before an adverse decision is taken The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The first respondent who holds the degree of of <ORG> the Diploma in Gynecology and Obstetrics from <ORG> and the Diploma in Obstetrics from <ORG> of London was appointed on June The first respondent then applied to <ORG> for a writ declaring that the order of retirement passed by the <ORG> Government was contrary to law and against the Constitution and principles of natural justice and that in any event the order was passed maliciously by the Government to the prejudice of the first respondent and for a writ of mandamus or certiorari quashing the order passed on June and declaring the respondent to be entitled to continue in service till April The first respondent claimed that the order made by the <ORG> amounted to an order of compulsory retirement contrary to the rules governing her service and was violative of the principles of natural justice that the same was arbitrary and mala fide that the order of retirement amounted to punishment involving consequences such as loss of pay status and deprivation of service and since it was not made in consonance with Art of the Constitution and since the first respondent was not given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to her the order was invalid <ORG> did not expression opinion on the plea of <NAME> as it raised questions of fact Which could not in the view Counsel for the <ORG> raised two contentions in support of this appeal that the petition raised disputed questions of fact and <ORG> should not have decided those questions in a writ petition and that the order refixing the age of the first respondent was an administrative order and the High Count had no power to sin in appeal over the decision of the <ORG> authorities refixing the age of the first respondent The first respondent held office in <ORG> She as holder of that office had a right to continue in service according to the rules framed under Art The rule that a party to whose prejudice an order is intended to be passed is entitled to a hearing applies to judicial tribunals and bodies of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil consequences It is one of the fundamental rules of our constitution setup that every citizen is protected against exercise of arbitrary authority by the <ORG> or its officers Duty to act judicially would therefore arise from the very nature of the function intended to be perform it need not be shown to be super added If there is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of a person duty to act judicially is implicit in the exercise of such power That is a basic concept of the rule of law and importance thereof transcends the significance of a decision in any particular case The <ORG> has undoubtedly authority to compulsorily retire a public servant who is superannuated But when that person disputes the claim he must be informed of the case of the <ORG> and the evidence in support thereof and he must have a fair opportunity of meeting that case before a decision adverse to him is taken The first respondent submitted her explanation stating that she did not recollect if she had ever attended <ORG> Thereafter on September there was a notice from the Secretary in <ORG> stating that according to the school Admission Register her date of birth was August and according to <ORG> it was April and it was intended to treat the latter date as the date of her birth and the first respondent was called upon to show cause why that date should not be accepted It may be recalled that there were four different dates before the <ORG> authorities the entry in <ORG> showing the date of birth as August the entry in the Admission Register of the First Year Class showing the date of birth as some date in April the report of the Principal <ORG> Delhi showing the date of birth as April as recorded in <ORG> and the first respondent statement supported by her father statement at the time when she joined the service in giving her date of birth as April It is true that the order is administrative in character but even an administrative order which involves civil consequences as already stated must be made consistently with the rules of natural justice after informing the first respondent of the case of the <ORG> the evidence in support thereof and after giving an opportunity to the first respondent of being heard and meeting or explaining the evidence
