I had the advantage of reading the well written judgment of my learned brother <NAME> Regretfully but respectfully I am unable to persuade myself to concur with the findings recorded and the exposition of law expressed by my learned brother In order to discernly state the reasons for my expressing a contrary view and dismissing the appeals of the appellants on merits it has become necessary for me to state the facts as well as the law in some detail It has been necessitated for the reason that complete facts as they appear from the record and the facts which were brought to the notice of the <ORG> during the course of hearing by the respondents supported by the official records duly maintained by them in normal course of their business have not in their entirety and correctly been noticed in the judgment I am also of the considered view that in fact the questions framed particularly question in the judgment by my learned brother neither so comprehensively arise in the facts and circumstances of the present case nor were argued in that manner and to that extent before the <ORG> Be that as it may I consider it necessary to restate the facts deal with different legal aspects of the case and then record the conclusions which would even provide answers to the questions framed by my learned brother at the very beginning of his judgment Before I proceed to do so let me briefly but inter alia state the reasons for my taking a view contrary to the one recorded in the judgment of my learned brother I I have already stated that complete and correct facts in their entirety as they emerge from the records produced before the <ORG> including the trial court record as well as the documents referred to during the course of arguments by the respondents have not been correctly noticed These documents have been executed inter se various institutions departments including the Collector office who discharges quasi judicial functions under the Act Thus I with respect would prefer to follow the larger <ORG> judgment rather than ignoring the same for the reasons stated by my learned brother in his judgment do not apply in the facts of the present case The golden rule of interpretation is the rule of plain language while preferring the interpretation which furthers the cause of the Statute rather than that which defeats the objects or purposes of the Act The judgment by my learned brother does not consider the judgments of the <ORG> the larger <ORG> and even the equi <ORG> which have to some extent a direct bearing on the matters in issue before us The land of the appellant admeasuring about Bighas situated in Village Haldauni Tehsil and Pargana Dadri District Gautam Budh Nagar which is an abadi land was sought to be acquired by the appropriate <ORG> under a notification dated th April issued under Section read with Sections and of the Act It also stated that after expiry of days from the date of the publication of the notification possession of the acquired land shall be taken under sub section of Section of the Act The appellants also alleged in the petition that despite inordinate delay they were neither paid per cent of the estimated compensation in terms of Section A of the Act at the time of taking of possession nor had the Collector passed an award within two years of making the declaration under Section as required by Section A of the Act To this writ petition the respondents had filed a counter affidavit in <ORG> denying that the acquired land was in fact a part of the abadi land Aggrieved by the said order of <ORG> the appellants have filed the present appeal impugning the judgment dated th August As such there is complete compliance with the provisions of Section A of the Act by the authority concerned Vide the same notification the emergent provisions contained in Section of the Act specifically Section were also invoked intimating the public at large that the provisions of Section A of the Act shall not be applicable It was also felt necessary by the framers to restructure the legislative framework for acquisition of land so that it is more adequately informed by this objective of servicing the interests of the community in harmony with the rights of the individual Various amendments were made and certain new provisions added to the Act by Amendment Act of which took effect from th September In its recommendations <ORG> also expressed a view that individuals and institutions who are unavoidably deprived of their property rights need to be adequately compensated for their loss keeping in view the sacrifice they have had to make in the larger interests of the community By introducing the provisions of Section A of the Act to the normal course of acquisition proceedings greater responsibility was intended to be fastened upon the concerned authorities whereby they were obliged to make an award within two years of the declaration made under Section of the Act Despite the fact that Right to Property in terms of Article of the Constitution stood deleted from Chapter III of the Constitution vide th Constitutional Amendment Article A of the Constitution was added by the same Constitutional Amendment mandating that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law Firstly such acquisition has to be by the authority of law in other words it has to be in accordance with the law enacted by the competent legislature and not by mere executive action If I may put it in rather simple language the object of the legislation was to create greater balance between the exercise of power of eminent domain by the <ORG> and the owner deprivation of his property by way of compulsory acquisition and the greater acceptability of acquisition proceedings amongst land owners Whether the provisions of Sections A and A of the Act are mandatory or directory and to what effect Let us first examine the general principles that could help the <ORG> in determining whether a particular provision of a statute is mandatory or directory The meaning and intention of the legislation must govern and these are to be ascertained not only from the phraseology of the provision but also by considering its nature its design and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other For ascertaining the real intention of the <ORG> points out <NAME> the court may consider inter alia the nature and design of the statute and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other the impact of the other provisions whereby the necessity of complying with the provisions in question is avoided the circumstances namely that the statute provides for a contingency of the non compliance with the provisions the fact that the non compliance with the provisions is or is not visited by some penalty the serious or the trivial consequences that flow therefrom and above all whether the object of the legislation will be defeated or furthered No universal rule said Lord <NAME> can be laid down for the construction of statutes as to whether mandatory enactments shall be considered directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for disobedience the Court stated the precepts which can be summed up and usefully applied by this Court as follows a While determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory somewhat on similar lines as afore noticed the Court has to examine the context in which the provision is used and the purpose it seeks to achieve To find out the intent of the legislature it may also be necessary to examine serious general inconveniences or injustices which may be caused to persons affected by the application of such provision Whether the provisions are enabling the <ORG> to do some things and or whether they prescribe the methodology or formalities for doing certain things As a factor to determine legislative intent the court may also consider inter alia the nature and design of the statute and the consequences which would flow from construing it one way or the other It is also permissible to examine the impact of other provisions in the same statute and the consequences of non compliance of such provisions Physiology of the provisions is not by itself a determinative factor Reference can be made to the following paragraphs of May George supra AIR SC this Court observed that law which creates public duties is directory but if it confers private rights it is mandatory When the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty and at the same time would not promote the main object of legislature it has been the practice of the Courts to hold such provisions to be directory only the neglect of them not affecting the validity of the acts done For ascertaining the real intention of the <ORG> the <ORG> may consider inter alia the nature and the design of the statute and the consequences which would follow from construing it the one way or the other the impact of other provisions whereby the necessity of complying with the provisions in question is avoided the circumstance namely that the statute provides for a contingency of the non compliance with the provisions the fact that the non compliance with the provisions is or is not visited by some penalty the serious or trivial consequences that flow therefrom and above all whether the object of the legislation will be defeated or furthered Equally it is settled law that when a statute is passed for the purpose of enabling the doing of something and prescribes the formalities which are to be attended for the purpose those prescribed formalities which are essential to the validity of such thing would be mandatory The general rule of interpretation would require the word to be given its own meaning and the word shall would be read as must unless it was essential to read it as may to achieve the ends of legislative intent and understand the language of the provisions It is difficult to lay down any universal rule but wherever the word shall is used in a substantive statute it normally would indicate mandatory intent of the legislature <ORG> on Statutory Construction has specifically stated that language of the provision is not the sole criteria but the <ORG> should consider its nature design and the consequences which could flow from construing it one way or the other Where a statute imposes a public duty and proceeds to lay down the manner and timeframe within which the duty shall be performed the injustice or inconvenience resulting from a rigid adherence to the statutory prescriptions may not be a relevant factor in holding such prescription to be only directory It is said that the purpose of criminal law is to permit everyone to go about their daily lives without fear of harm to person or property and it is in the interests of everyone that serious crime be effectively investigated and prosecuted These principles have been applied with approval by different courts even in India It is a recognized rule that they should be interpreted if possible so as to respect such rights and if there is any ambiguity the construction which is in favour of the freedom of the individual should be adopted The <ORG> has also taken the view that even in cases of directory requirements substantial compliance with such provision would be necessary If I analyze the above principles and the various judgments of this <ORG> it is clear that it may not be possible to lay down any straitjacket formula which could unanimously be applied to all cases irrespective of considering the facts legislation in question object of such legislation intendment of the legislature and substance of the enactment The <ORG> will still have to examine another aspect even after holding that a particular provision is mandatory or directory as the case may be i whether the effect or impact of such non compliance would invalidate or render the proceedings void ab initio or it would result in imposition of smaller penalties or in issuance of directions to further protect and safeguard the interests of the individual against the power of the <ORG> Section of the Act vests the appropriate <ORG> with special powers to be exercised in cases of urgency The distinguishing features of normal acquisition are that after the issuance of notification under Section of the Act the <ORG> must provide an opportunity to the owners of the land to object to the acquisition in terms of Section A of the Act issue a declaration under Section of the Act issue notice under Section of the Act and determine compensation by making an award under Section of the Act However under the scheme of Section of the Act the <ORG> can take possession of the property on the expiration of days from publication of notice mentioned in Section of the Act Furthermore the provisions of Section of the Act i the right of the owner to file objection can be declared to be inapplicable In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any land needed for a public purpose xxxxxx xxxxxx A Before taking possession of any land under sub section or sub section the Collector shall without prejudice to the provisions of sub section a tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to the person interested entitled thereto and pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in section sub section and where the Collector is so prevented the provisions of section sub section except the second proviso thereto shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation under that section The amount paid or deposited under section A shall be taken into account for determining the amount of compensation required to be tendered under section and where the amount so paid or deposited exceeds the compensation awarded by the Collector under section the excess may unless refunded within three months from the date of Collector award be recovered as an arrear of land revenue In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under section sub section Section A of the Act makes it obligatory on the part of the authority concerned to tender pay per cent of the compensation for the acquired land as estimated by the Collector to the persons interested and entitled thereto unless prevented by any of the contingencies mentioned under Section of the Act This clearly shows that there is statutory obligation upon the authorities concerned to tender to the interested persons compensation in accordance with law The amount so deposited or paid in terms of Section A of the Act will be taken into account for determining the amount of compensation required to be tendered under Section of the Act and provides for the recovery of amounts if it exceeds the awarded amount This is in complete contradistinction to the provisions contained in Sections and A of the Act In the present case also there is hardly any justification for the courts to take any contrary view So even if it is argued that there is no specific time contemplated for payment deposit of per cent of the estimated compensation even then the claimants would be entitled to receive the amount expeditiously and in any case within very reasonable time Delhi Reported Journal whilst quashing the notification issued under Section read with Section of the Act on the ground of factual lack of urgency for acquisition held that there was non compliance to the provisions of Section A of the Act Of course <ORG> took the view that the notification issued under Section read with Section of the Act was not maintainable and while quashing the said notification it also held that there was violation of provisions of Section A of the Act and in fact no urgency existed There was no direct discussion as to whether the provisions of Section A of the Act are mandatory or directory a part of the acquisition was challenged and writ petitions had been filed for quashing the notification dated th March issued under Section and Section of the Act by <NAME> and other owners of the acquired lands Now suppose there is state of emergency as contemplated in Section of the Act and the compensation is not given could the whole acquisition come to a naught It would entail serious consequences The Court held that there was then no question of application of even Section A Commenting upon Section A it was held that that the Section could not be so construed as to leave the <ORG> holding title or the land without an obligation to determine the compensation make an award and pay to the owner the difference between the amount of the award and the amount of the of the estimated compensation The three Judge Bench of the Court took the view that even where of the estimated compensation was not paid to the landowners it did not mean that the possession was taken illegally or that the land did not vest in the <ORG> In that case <ORG> for which the possession was made sought to escape from the liability to make the payment In the instant case even that of the estimated compensation was not paid to the appellants although Section A required that it should have been paid before possession of the said land was taken but that does not mean that the possession was taken illegally or that the said land did not thereupon vest in the first respondent It is at any rate not open to the third respondent who as the letter of the Special Land Acquisition Officer dated shows failed to make the necessary monies available and who has been in occupation of the said land ever since its possession was taken to urge that the possession was taken illegally and that therefore the said land has not vested in the first respondent and the first respondent is under no obligation to make an award The Court took the view that once the possession was taken under Section of the Act the Government could not withdraw from that position under Section and even the provisions of Section A were not attracted Therefore even on the sixth question there is no necessity of any reference As is obvious from the above paragraphs there is an indefeasible obligation on the part of the <ORG> to make the payment in terms of Section A of the Act but non compliance thereto could not result in vitiation of the acquisition proceedings The observations made by this Court in the case of <NAME> supra in paragraph suggest that the Government was required to hold title to the acquired land coupled with its obligation to determine the compensation make the award and then to pay to the owner the difference between the amount of per cent of the estimated compensation and the amount finally determined The <ORG> even went to the extent of observing that non payment of per cent of the estimated compensation per se does not mean that possession was taken illegally or that the said land did not thereupon vest in the <ORG> This decision does provide any reasoning and conclusions which support the view that Section A of the Act is not a mandatory provision The <ORG> dealing with the matter did use the expression mandatory requirements including deposit of per cent of the compensation amount but there was no discussion or reasoning of the effects and consequences of such default anywhere in the judgment before it has been concluded that the said provisions are mandatory Consistent with the view expressed by this <ORG> in the cases referred supra I am of the considered view that the provisions of Section A of the Act are not mandatory Once the land has vested in the Government non compliance with the obligation of payment of per cent of estimated compensation would not render the possession taken under Section as illegal There is no ambiguity in this requirement The legislature has even taken care of providing higher rates of interest where the possession of the land has already been taken and compensation has not been paid or deposited within the specified time or in the manner prescribed under Section of the Act The expression before taking possession of the land has been used in Section read with Section A and in Section as well It will be unfair if the Government takes possession of the property within days of the notice issued under Section as is contemplated under Section of the Act and does not make payment of compensation for a long period with no additional liability whatsoever It appears to me that this is not the legislative intent that the Government would not be liable to pay higher rate of interest where it has taken possession of the land in exercise of its powers under Section of the Act It will be unfair if the liability to pay higher rate of interest in terms of Section would arise only after a period of one year from the date of possession even in cases of emergent acquisition For these reasons I am of the considered view that the statutory benefit contained in Section of the Act should be made applicable to the provisions of Section read with Section A in the manner that it would give the requisite benefit to the owners claimants of the land rather than deprive them of both their land and income without any additional benefit despite non compliance of the provisions of the Act In computing the period of two years referred to in this section the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration is stayed by an order of a <ORG> shall be excluded Wherever the award under Section of the Act has not been made within two years from the date of publication of the declaration the entire proceedings for acquisition of land shall lapse Explanation to Section A of the Act further excludes from this period any period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the said declaration is stayed by an order of a <ORG> which had been in force Thus the statute imposes a duty upon the <ORG> to act within time and also provides for consequences that shall ensue in the event of default It is clear from the substance of the language and from the intention of the legislature that the right created in favour of the citizen and the duties imposed on the <ORG> should be construed strictly In number of cases including the case of <ORG> State of Maharahtra this Court has already held that Section A of the Act is mandatory Answering the question in the negative the <ORG> stated that the <ORG> could not withdraw from the acquisition under Section of the Act and claim the benefit of its own default in not making an award within the period of two years Ordinarily the <ORG> can take possession of the land proposed to be acquired only after an award of compensation in respect thereof has been made under Section When Section is applied by reason of urgency <ORG> takes possession of the land prior to the making of the award under Section and thereupon the owner is divested of the title to the land which is vested in the <ORG> Section states so in unmistakable terms Clearly Section A can have no application to cases of acquisitions under Section because the lands have already vested in the <ORG> and there is no provision in the said Act by which land statutorily vested in the <ORG> can revert to the owner Section A cannot be so construed as to leave the <ORG> holding title to the land without the obligation to determine compensation make an award and pay to the owner the difference between the amount of the award and the amount of per cent of the estimated compensation The counsel on verification had stated that the award was not made within two years from the commencement of the Amendment Act namely The notification under Section and declaration under Section do not lapse due to failure to make an award within two years from the date of the declaration The impugned order is set aside and the writ petition filed by Respondent No is dismissed with cost quantified at Rs Let me analyze this judgment to appreciate the contention raised by the counsel appearing for the appellants In this case the appellants were occupants of the lands sought to be acquired by the State of Gujarat for the purposes of establishing <ORG> and notification under Section of the Act in respect of the said land was issued on th May An interim order restraining the State from taking possession was granted by the <ORG> As the award had not been made the appellants therein had made a representation to the Government that the award had not been made within the period of two years mentioned under Section A of the Act and therefore the acquisition proceedings had lapsed The appellants filed an application challenging the said decision praying for a declaration that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed The Division Bench of <ORG> took the view that the explanation to Section A is not confined to stay of making of the award pursuant to notification under Section but it is widely worded and covers in its sweep the entire period during which any matter or proceedings due to be taken are stayed by a competent <ORG> While rejecting the view taken to the contrary by a Single Judge of the Kerala High <ORG> this <ORG> made a reference to taking of possession under Section of the Act and held In the first place as held by the learned Single Judge himself where the case is covered by Section the possession can be taken before an award is made and we see no reason why the aforesaid expression in the Explanation should be given a different meaning depending upon whether the case is covered by Section or otherwise The benefit is that the award must be made within a period of two years of the declaration failing which the acquisition proceedings would lapse and the land would revert to the landholder It is obvious from a bare reading of the above observation that the question of applicability of Section A to acquisition proceedings under Section was not in issue before the <ORG> The learned counsel attempted to argue that the expression whether the case is covered by Section or otherwise unequivocally states the principle of law that Section A is applicable to the present case The argument raised on behalf of the appellants is therefore misplaced A half hearted attempt was also made by the learned counsel for the appellants to advance the argument that there is difference of opinion by equi Benches of this Court in the case of <NAME> supra on the one hand and <NAME> supra on the other and therefore this matter should be referred to a larger Bench There is no conflict I can squarely answer the questions of law arising in the present case with reference to the settled principles and therefore have no hesitation in rejecting this request made on behalf of the appellants Let me also examine the other reasons which will support the view taken by this Court in <NAME> supra and followed in subsequent cases referred above Section of the Act uses the expression though no such award has been made After publication of a notification under Section read with Sections and of the Act the authority is obliged only to publish a notice under Section of the Act and comply with the provisions of Section A before it can take possession within the stipulated period We have to give the language of Section its plain meaning within the field of its operation Another reason in support of taking such a view is that once such possession is taken and the land is so vested the Act does not make any provision for re vesting of land in the owners persons interested The amount of per cent of the estimated compensation deposited under Section A of the Act is to be finally adjusted against the award made under Section in terms of Section of the Act Another point which would support the view that I am taking is with reference to the provisions of Section of the Act Where the Government withdraws from such an acquisition it is its duty to determine the amount of compensation for the damages suffered by the owners as a consequence of the notice or any other proceeding taken thereunder which amounts have to be paid as per provisions of Part III Section thus is a clear indication that the power of the Government to withdraw the acquisition is subject to the limitation stated under Section itself The scheme of Section can be summarized as follows A Except in cases provided under Section the Government has the power to withdraw from the acquisition of any land Provided the possession of such land had not been taken <ORG> is liable to pay compensation for the damages suffered by the owner as a consequence of notice or any proceeding thereunder which have to be computed in accordance with the provisions of Part III There is no ambiguity in the language of Section of the Act to give it any other interpretation except that the <ORG> is not vested with the power of withdrawing from the acquisition of any land of which the possession has been taken If the <ORG> has no power to withdraw from acquisition of any land the possession of which has been taken then by no stretch of imagination can it be held that the <ORG> will have the power to withdraw from the acquisition of any land where the land has vested in the <ORG> or the land has been subsequently transferred in favour of an authority for whose development activity the lands were acquired <NAME> SCC this Court took the view that once the notification under Section of the Act is issued and land accordingly vested with the <ORG> the notification can neither be cancelled under Section of the General Clauses Act nor can it be withdrawn in exercise of powers conferred by the <ORG> under Section of the Act It is clearly implicit in the observations that after possession has been taken pursuant to a notification under Section the land is vested in the <ORG> and the notification cannot be cancelled under Section of the General Clauses Act nor can the notification be withdrawn in exercise of the powers under Section of the Land Acquisition Act Any other view would enable the State <ORG> to circumvent the specific provision by relying upon a general power When possession of the land is taken under Section the land vests in the <ORG> There is no provision by which land statutorily vested in the <ORG> reverts to the original owner by mere cancellation of the notification These were challenged on the ground that there was no urgency and so the provisions of Section A of the Act could not be dispensed with and that there were structures on the land which could not have been acquired Reading the letter as a whole it cannot but be said that the possession of the land was taken by the government and was also delivered to <ORG> The question of reverting acquired land had not arisen in this case directly as the <ORG> was primarily concerned with the contention that the notification issued under Section was liable to be quashed Only Section gives power to withdraw from acquisition that too before possession is taken The possession of the land in question was taken in the year after the passing of the award by the Land Acquisition Officer Thereafter the land vested in the <ORG> which was then transferred to <ORG> predecessor in interest of the appellant After the vesting of the land and taking possession thereof the notification for acquiring the land could not be withdrawn or cancelled in exercise of powers under Section of the Land Acquisition Act Power under Section of the General Clauses Act cannot be exercised after vesting of the land statutorily in the State <ORG> Rejecting the contention of the State in paragraph of the judgment the Court stated that it is a well settled proposition of law that in the event the possession of the land in respect whereof a notification had been issued had been taken over the State would be denuded of its power to withdraw from the acquisition in terms of Section of the Act The aforesaid observations that the <ORG> may issue a notification under Section and this notification may be published in the <ORG> withdrawing from the acquisition are nothing but an obiter of the <ORG> without any discussion thereto The question whether the acquisition proceedings lapse or that the notification cancelling acquisition could be issued after the possession is taken where the land has vested in the <ORG> did not arise in that case What was the effect of possession of land subsequent to notification issued under Section of the Act For all the above reasons I hold that Section A of the Act has no application to the acquisition proceedings under the provisions of Section of the Act There is no dispute in the present case that the provisions of Section A of the Act have not been complied with Admittedly the notification under Section read with Section was published on th April declaration under Section was made on nd August and the possession of the property was taken on th February However the most pertinent question that arises for consideration is whether the provisions of Section A of the Act are applicable to the acquisition of land under Section of the Act The main thrust of submissions on behalf of the appellants is that the provisions of Section A of the Act would be attracted even to the acquisition proceedings undertaken by the appropriate Government in exercise of powers vested in it under Section of the Act The other provisions like publication of notification under Section declaration under Section notice under Sections and and passing of award under Section of the Act are argued to be essential features of an acquisition made under Section of the Act as well Thus it is submitted that the provisions of Section A of the Act would also apply to an acquisition made under Section of the Act If an award is not made within two years from the date of declaration under Section of the Act the acquisition proceedings should lapse irrespective of whether the acquisition had commenced under Section by invoking powers of urgency or otherwise It is argued that there is no justification whatsoever for excluding the application of Section A of the Act from acquisitions made under Section of the Act On the contrary the contention on behalf of the respondents is that provisions of Section A of the Act have no application to the provisions of Section of the Act In fact there is an apparent though limited conflict between these provisions Thereafter the owners persons interested have to be given an opportunity to file objections as contemplated under Section A of the Act and after granting them hearing a declaration under Section of the Act has to be published In these proceedings the possession of the land remains with the claimant owners of the land and it is only when the award becomes final in terms of Section of the Act possession of the land is taken and the acquired land vests in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances under Section of the Act Where the lands are acquired in exercise of emergent powers of the State under Section of the Act a notification under Section of the Act is issued and the notification itself refers to the provisions of Section as well as Section of the Act Therefore there is no obligation upon the Collector authority concerned to invite and decide upon objections in terms of Section A of the Act prior to publication of a declaration under Section of the Act However notice under Section of the Act has to be published to completely and fully invoke the powers vested in the <ORG> for taking possession of the land in terms of Section of the Act Thus there is no occasion for the <ORG> to read into Section the language of Section A of the Act which has not been provided by the <ORG> more so when doing so would destroy or frustrate the very object of the urgent acquisition Once the development activity has been completed in the entire sector will it be equitable to release the lands from acquisition Even if for the sake of argument it is assumed that there is some merit in the contention raised on behalf of the appellant the answer has to be in the negative While the notification under Section read with Sections and of the Act was issued on th April and possession taken on th February the writ petitions in question were filed in August i more than four years subsequent to the issuance of the notification under Section Even if that be so still there is an unexplained and undue delay of more than two years in approaching the <ORG> This has to be decided keeping in view the facts and circumstances of a given case Not only this it is informed during the course of hearing that the award was finally made by the authorities on th June and has been accepted by nearly per cent of the owners whose lands were acquired vide the said notification It will be unjust and unfair to uproot such a developed sector on the plea raised by the present appellants This <ORG> settled the point of law holding that it is not appropriate for the <ORG> to quash the acquisition proceedings at the instance of one or two land owners where the development had taken place and majority of the land owners had not challenged the acquisition The first issue which requires consideration is whether the order passed by this <ORG> in <NAME> case has the effect of nullifying the acquisition in its entirety So far as <NAME> is concerned he did not even make a prayer before the High <ORG> for quashing the preliminary notification issued under Section of the Act This is evident from the prayer made by him in Writ Petition No of which reads as under For the reasons stated in the accompanying affidavit it is most respectfully prayed that <ORG> may be pleased to issue a writ of certiorari or any other proceeding or any other appropriate writ or direction or order in the nature of a writ to call for the records of the first respondent relating to GOMs No Housing and Urban Development Department dated published in the Tamil Nadu Government Gazette Extraordinary dated in Part II Section on pp From the above reproduced prayer clause it is crystal clear that the only relief sought by <NAME> was for quashing the notification issued under Section insofar it related to the land falling in Survey Nos and in Mogapperi Village No Block Saidapet Taluk and in the absence of a specific prayer having been made in that regard neither the High <ORG> nor this <ORG> could have quashed the entire acquisition This appears to be the reason why <ORG> of the High <ORG> while disposing of Writ Appeals Nos of and of observed that quashing of acquisition by this <ORG> was only in relation to the land of the petitioner of that case and at this belated stage we are not inclined to declare that order dated passed by this <ORG> had the effect of nullifying the entire acquisition and that too by ignoring that <ORG> has already utilised portion of the acquired land for housing and other purposes <ORG> also did not examine the correctness or otherwise of the order passed by the learned Single Judge and allowed the appeals preferred by the respondents simply by relying upon order dated passed in Writ Appeal No of and that too without even making an endeavour to find out whether the two cases were similar In our view the direction given by <ORG> to <ORG> to reconvey the acquired land to the respondents is per se against the plain language of Section of the Act in terms of which only the <ORG> can transfer the acquired land if it is satisfied that the same is not required for the purpose for which it was acquired or for any other public purpose As a matter of fact <ORG> could not have issued such direction even to the <ORG> because the acquired land had already been transferred to <ORG> and the latter had utilised substantial portion thereof for execution of the housing scheme and other public purposes There is one more reason why the impugned judgment deserves to be set aside Undisputedly the land of the respondents forms part of large chunk which was acquired for execution of the housing scheme The report sent by the appellant Board to <ORG> shows that the purpose for which the land was acquired is still subsisting The respondents had neither pleaded before <ORG> nor was any material produced by them to show that the report which formed basis of the Government decision not to entertain their prayer for reconveyance of the land was vitiated by mala fides or that any extraneous or irrelevant factor had influenced the decision making process or that there was violation of the rules of natural justice It need no emphasis that in exercise of power under Section of the Act the Government can release the acquired land only till the same continues to vest in it and that too if it is satisfied that the acquired land is not needed for the purpose for which it was acquired or for any other public purpose Firstly there is no merit in the contentions of law raised by the appellants which I have already rejected Before I part with this file I cannot ignore one very important aspect which has come to my notice during the hearing of the case and which as stated at the <ORG> is an often repeated default on the part of the Government Departments causing undue inconvenience harassment hardship and ultimately resulting in the acquisition itself being inequitable against the land owners persons interested therein This I am only noticing subject to my finding that there is unequivocal statutory obligation upon the respondents to pay the amount prior to taking possession of the land in question These authorities are instrumentalities of the <ORG> and the officers are empowered to exercise the power on behalf of the <ORG> The well established precepts of public trust and public accountability are fully applicable to the functions which emerge from the public servants or even the persons holding public office The doctrine of full faith and credit applies to the acts done by the officers There is a presumptive evidence of regularity in official acts done or performed and there should be faithful discharge of duties to elongate public purpose in accordance with the procedure prescribed This Court had occasion to express its concern in different cases from time to time in relation to such matters It was breach of statutory and governance obligation of the <ORG> officers officials to pay the amount to the claimants after more than five years Imperatively it must follow that the Central <ORG> and all <ORG> <ORG>s must issue appropriate directions to ensure that there is no harassment hardship or inequality caused to the owners persons interested in the lands acquired by the <ORG> in exercise of its powers of eminent domain under Section of the Act Wherever the payments are not made within time and appropriate steps are not taken to finalize the acquisition of the land the concerned <ORG> should take appropriate disciplinary action against the erring officers officials involved in and responsible for the process of acquisition It is therefore necessary to issue the following directions i The Government acquiring authority shall be liable to pay interest at the rate of per cent per annum with reference to or alike the provisions of Section of the Act after the expiry of days from issuance of notification under Section of the Act and from the date on which the possession of the land is taken till the amount of per cent of the estimated compensation is paid to the claimants Where the amounts have been paid beyond the period as stated in Section A the claimants still would be entitled to the rate of interest afore indicated iii Wherever the Government exercises its power under Section of the Act and there is default in deposit of the amount in terms of Section A of the Act as explained in this judgment the concerned Government shall take appropriate disciplinary action against the erring officers officials including making good the loss caused to the Government revenue on account of the liabilities towards interest or otherwise because of such undue delay on the part of such officers officials iv In this case the claimants would be entitled to the cost of Rupees one lakh only which shall be deposited at the first instance by <ORG> and then would be recovered from the salaries of the defaulting erring officers officials in accordance with law The facts giving rise to the present appeal are simple and fall within a narrow compass However they raise questions which are of public importance and legal significance Thus it will be appropriate for us to state the questions of law at the very threshold A When the Government in exercise of its emergency powers under Section of the Land Acquisition Act for short the Act acquires lands which have since vested in the <ORG> can such an acquisition proceeding lapse and consequently the land can be transferred to the owners persons interested in the event of default by the <ORG> in complying with the provisions of Section A of the Act Whether the provisions of Section A of the Act are mandatory or directory In either event would non compliance with this Section have the effect of invalidating or vitiating the entire acquisition proceedings even where the land has vested in the <ORG> in terms of Section of the Act Whether with the invoking of the emergency provisions which have the effect of dispensing with the provision of hearing under Section A of the Act the <ORG> is entitled to construe the emergency provisions strictly being drastic provisions in an exproprietory law and consider the safeguards inbuilt in Section A against such drastic provisions as conditions precedent and mandatory for a valid exercise of emergency provisions Whether having regard to the principle of reasonableness being a basic component of fundamental rights under the Constitution this Court has to construe the provisions of the said Act a pre constitutional law in consonance with reason and justice the fundamental tenets of Article and thus arrive at a balanced interpretation of the interest of the <ORG> as against the rights of citizens or land owners The appellant land admeasuring about Bighas situated in Village Haldauni Tehsil and Pargana Dadri District Gautam Budh Nagar which is abadi land was sought to be acquired by the appropriate <ORG> under a notification dated th April issued under Section read with Sections and of the Act Aggrieved by the said order of <ORG> the appellants have filed the present appeal impugning the judgment dated th August In the counter affidavit filed before this Court by NOIDA the stand in the counter filed before <ORG> has been reiterated with an additional fact that the sector in question was designated as industrial area and after development activity was completed allotment has been made and possession of these industrial plots has also handed over to such entrepreneurs allottees It has also been stated at the Bar by the State Counsel on the basis of the record without filing an affidavit despite directions given to that effect by this Court on that per cent of the estimated compensation was deposited by <ORG> with the State <ORG> even prior to the date of the notification under Section read with Section of the Act issued by the <ORG> on The remaining per cent of the estimated compensation had been allegedly deposited vide cheque dated th July amounting to approximately Rs As such it is claimed there is compliance with the provisions of Section A of the Act Assuming there has been deposit of of the compensation amount by <ORG> with the state authorities that does not satisfy the requirement of Section A of the Act Vide the same notification the emergency provisions contained in Section of the Act specifically Section of the Act were also invoked intimating the public at large that the provisions of Section A of the Act shall not be applicable In the counter affidavit filed before this Court by <ORG> it has been stated that the Award was finally made and published on th June Article is quoted below existing law means any law Ordinance order bye law rule or regulation passed or made before the commencement of this Constitution by any <ORG> authority or person having power to make such a law Ordinance order bye law rule or regulation Article of the Constitution makes it clear that notwithstanding the provision of the Article but subject to the other provisions of the Constitution all laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of the Constitution shall continue in force until altered or repealed or amended by a competent <ORG> or other competent authority Article is set out laws in force includes laws passed or made by a <ORG> or other competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas The individual and institutions who are unavoidably to be deprived of their property rights in land need to be adequately compensated for the loss keeping in view the sacrifice they have to make for the larger interests of the community It is clear from the aforesaid objects and reasons that by introducing the provisions of Section A and A by way of amendment to the Act greater responsibility was fastened upon the concerned <ORG> authorities whereby they were obliged to make an award within two years of the declaration made under Section of the Act Despite the fact that Right to Property in terms of Article of the Constitution stood deleted from Chapter III of the Constitution vide th Constitutional Amendment Article A of the Constitution was added by the same Constitutional Amendment mandating that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law This indicates that the Constitution still mandates that right to property may have ceased to be a fundamental right but it is still protected by the Constitution and is a Constitutional right The right to enjoy property without unlawful deprivation no less than the right to speak or the right to travel is in truth a personal right whether the property in question be a welfare check a home or a savings account In <NAME> supra this Court held that the expression procedure established by law in Article means a procedure established by a just reasonable and fair law The concept of sub silentio has been explained by <NAME> on Jurisprudence th Edition as follows A decision passes sub silentio in the technical sense that has come to be attached to that phrase when the particular point of law involved in the decision is not perceived by the <ORG> or present to its mind The <ORG> may consciously decide in favour of one party because of point A which it considers and pronounces upon In such circumstances although point was logically involved in the facts and although the case had a specific outcome the decision is not an authority on point Point is said to pass sub silentio The aforesaid passage has been quoted with approval by the three Judge Bench in <NAME> supra This Court in <NAME> supra in order to illustrate the aforesaid proposition further relied on the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> of <ORG> reported in All England Reports The Court found that no consideration was given to the question whether a garnishee order could be passed Therefore a point in respect of which no argument was advanced and no citation of authority was made is not binding and would not be followed This Court held that such decisions which are treated having been passed sub silentio and without argument are of no moment The Court further explained the position by saying that one of the chief reasons behind the doctrine of precedent is that once a matter is fully argued and decided the same should not be reopened and mere casual expression carry no weight Court should not place reliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits in with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed Therefore the casual observation in para page in Jain supra to the effect of taking possession of land under emergency provision and without making the payment mandated under Section A is a valid mode of taking possession is in clear violation of Section A and be regarded made per incuriam and does not have the effect of a binding precedent If I look at the emergency provisions of the statute which empowers the <ORG> to acquire land by dispensing with the provisions of making an enquiry it is clear that the said provision is a drastic provision This Court held that the right of hearing which is given under Section A of the Act and which is taken away in view of the emergency acquisition is a very valuable right and is akin to a fundamental right Section A figures very prominently as part of the statutory mechanism in Section of the Act which confers special powers in cases of urgency Section has four sub sections and all these sub sections comprise a composite mechanism and are closely intertwined In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any land needed for a public purpose Whenever owing to any sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency it becomes necessary for any Railway administration to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the maintenance of their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river side or ghat station or of providing convenient connection with or access to any such station or the appropriate <ORG> considers it necessary to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the purpose of maintaining any structure or system pertaining to irrigation water supply drainage road communication or electricity the Collector may immediately after the publication of the notice mentioned in sub section and with the previous sanction of the appropriate <ORG> enter upon and take possession of such land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances Provided that the Collector shall not take possession of any building or part of a building under this sub section without giving to the occupier thereof at least forty eight hours notice of his intention so to do or such longer notice as may be reasonably sufficient to enable such occupier to remove his movable property from such building without unnecessary inconvenience In every case under either of the preceding sub sections the Collector shall at the time of taking possession offer to the persons interested compensation for the standing crops and trees if any on such land and for any other damage sustained by them caused by such sudden dispossession and not excepted in section and in case such offer is not accepted the value of such crops and trees and the amount of such other damage shall be allowed for in awarding compensation for the land under the provisions herein contained A Before taking possession of any land under sub section or sub section the Collector shall without prejudice to the provisions of sub section a tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to the persons interested entitled thereto and pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in section sub section and where the Collector is so prevented the provisions of section sub section except the second proviso thereto shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation under that section The amount paid or deposited under sub section A shall be taken into account for determining the amount of compensation required to be tendered under section and where the amount so paid or deposited exceeds the compensation awarded by the Collector under section the excess may unless refunded within three months from the date of the Collector award be recovered as an arrear of land revenue In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under section in respect of the land at any time after the date of publication of the notification under section sub section Sub section of Section runs thus If they shall not consent to receive it or if there be no person competent to alienate the land or if there be any dispute as to the title to receive the compensation or as to the apportionment of it the Collector shall deposit the amount of the compensation in the Court to which a reference under section would be submitted Provided that any person admitted to be interested may receive such payment under protest as to the sufficiency of the amount Provided also that no person who has received the amount otherwise than under protest shall be entitled to make any application under section Provided also that nothing herein contained shall affect the liability of any person who may receive the whole or any part of any compensation awarded under this Act to pay the same to the person lawfully entitled thereto It is well settled as a canon of construction that a statute has to be read as a whole and in its context The learned Law Lord further said that in understanding the meaning of the provision the <ORG> must take into consideration not only other enacting provisions of the same statute but its preamble the existing state of the law other statutes in pari material and the mischief which I can by those and other legitimate means discern that the statute was intended to remedy page of the report Power to take possession When the Collector has made an award under section he may take possession of the land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances But the intention of the legislature is that even though the award is not made payment mandated under Section A must be made before possession is taken either under Section and Therefore this provision relating to payment under Section A is a condition precedent to the vesting of land under Section and In the later part of this judgment I shall discuss some authorities which have opined that when possession is illegally taken over without following the conditions precedent for taking such possession vesting of a property in law does not take place in the authority which thus illegally enters upon the property <ORG> has quoted the above opinion of the Lord Chancellor and further dealt with this aspect of the matter at page of the book wherein the learned author said Where the promoters of a public undertaking have authority from <ORG> to interfere with private property on certain terms any person whose property is interfered with by virtue of that authority has a right to require that the promoters shall comply with the letter of the enactment so far as it makes provision on his behalf Again at page the learned author has stressed the above position very strongly to the following effect If no consent has been given and the promoters have not complied with the statutory conditions as to entry on lands they can be proceeded against as trespassers by any owner who has an interest in the lands And again at page the learned author opines It must be borne in mind that promoters have no powers other than those comprised in their special Acts and the Acts therewith incorporated to enter upon or take lands against the wish of the owners whenever in pursuance of law the property of an individual is to be divested by proceedings against his will a strict compliance must be had with all the provisions of law which are made for his protection and benefit or the proceeding will be ineffectual In the case of <ORG> <NAME> AIR SC this court while dealing with the power of <ORG> to purchase the property of the licensee held that right can be exercised only in the manner provided in the act and not in any other way As pointed out in Halsbury Law of England that when <ORG> has authorized the compulsory acquisition of land it is almost invariably provided for payment of a money compensation to the person deprived of his interest in it This is clear from the opening words of Section A namely before taking possession of any land either under sub section or Collector shall tender payment In both the cases the law would mean a validly enacted law Insofar as Article is concerned it is a Fundamental Right whereas in Article A it is a constitutional right which has been given a status of a basic human right <NAME> speaking for the majority opinion observed para The court will interpret a statute as far as possible agreeably to justice and reason and that in case of two or more interpretations one which is more reasonable and just will be adopted for there is always a presumption against the law maker intending injustice and unreason In an avowedly democratic polity statutory provisions ensuring the security of fundamental human rights including the right to property will unless the contrary mandate be precise and unqualified be construed liberally so as to uphold the right The State is at liberty to recover the same from the erring officials The appeal is thus allowed with costs as aforesaid Respondents In view of the divergence of opinion on conclusions and also on various legal questions discussed in two separate judgments by us the matter is required to be placed before the Hon ble the Chief Justice of India for reference to a larger Bench to resolve the divergent views expressed in both the judgments and to answer the questions of law framed
