I do not propose to set out in detail the facts as to which there is no dispute for they appear sufficiently from the plaint The simple question is whether <NAME> had power to dispose of his own right of worship and the turn or pala which he had enjoyed in favour of the plaintiff to the exclusion of the defendants who would in ordinary course have succeeded to such right of worship and pala by inheritance along with the plaintiff There are no longer any emoluments attached to the offices and it here fore only the bare right of service which is in dispute A large number of oases were cited by counsel relating to religious endowments but it was frankly conceded that there was no direct authority for or against the proposition which the plaintiff lays before the <ORG> It would therefore serve no good purpose to discuss those authorities in detail It is obvious that cases of relinquishment stand in a different footing for there is no exclusion of some third person In the second case cited it is not stated what were the terms of that particular endowment and the learned Judges expressed their opinion in somewhat qualified terms There was in this case also a suit and the matter was settled by arrangement Under these circumstances it appears i that this disposition in Lalit Mohan is not in accordance with the wishes and intentions of the foundress and ii that there is no established usage or practice in the family which could justify it
