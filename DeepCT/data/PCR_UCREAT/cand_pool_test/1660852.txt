DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH SAGHIR AHMAD WADHWA JUDGMENT JUDGMENT SCR The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <ORG> was granted leave to appeal under Article of the Constitution against judgment dated September of <ORG> of <ORG> in writ appeal upholding the order of the learned single Judge dismissing the writ petition By the Award the <ORG> had directed the <ORG> to reinstate <NAME> a clerk working in the Cottonpet Branch of the <ORG> The Award arose out of following question which was referred to the Tribunal for adjudication Whether the action of the management of <ORG> in terminating the services of Sri <NAME> Clerk Cottonpet Branch of <ORG> is justified If not to what relief the workman is entitled to We may now narrate the circumstances which led <ORG> to make the reference of the industrial dispute aforesaid On June <ORG> sent him a registered notice advising him to report for duty within three days and also requiring him to submit his explanation for his unauthor ised absence <NAME> sent a leave letter requesting to treat his absence as leave on health grounds and he assured he would report for duty on July Subsequently <NAME> withdrew his resignation and requested the <ORG> to allow him to continue in the service on humanitarian grounds Now the <ORG> called upon <NAME> to show cause for his continued absence and to report back for work by December failing which he would be deemed to have been voluntarily retired from the services of the <ORG> for his continued absence from April This notice was sent by registered post to <NAME> but it was returned with the report of the postal authority that he refused to receive the same This Clause of the Bipartite Settlement we reproduce Where an employee has not submitted any application for leave and absents himself from work for a period of or more consecutive days without or beyond any leave to his credit or absents himself for or more consecutive days beyond the period of leave originally sanctioned or subsequently extended or where there is satisfactory evidence that he has taken up employment in India or the management is satisfied that he has no present intention of joining duties the management may at any time thereafter give a notice to the employ ee last known address calling upon the employee to report for duty within days of the notice stating inter alia the grounds for the management coming to the conclusion that the employee has no intention of joining duties and furnishing necessary evidence where available Unless the employee reports for duty within days or unless he gives an explanation for his absence satisfying the manage ment that he has not taken up another employment or avocation and that he has no intention of not joining duties the employee will be deemed to have voluntarily retired from the <ORG> service on the expiry of the said notice In the event of the employee submitting a satisfactory reply he shall be permitted to report for duty thereafter within days from the date of the expiry of the aforesaid notice without prejudice to the <ORG> right to take any action under the law or rules of service He was told that he had abandoned his services with effect from April and there was no question of his now joining the duty Industrial dispute was raised by the first respondent which led <ORG> to make the reference to <ORG> During the course of evidence of the Manager of the <ORG> relevant registered covers and the notices sent to <NAME> were brought on record However <ORG> was of the view that since the <ORG> did not examine the postman that <NAME> in fact refused to receive the notice it could not be said that there was service of notice to <NAME> The I party stated that he met with an accident and he was continuously ill It filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution in <ORG> which as noted above was dismissed by the learned single Judge by order dated June Learned single Judge observed it was not in dispute that the worker had absented and within a span of days he had worked only for days and further the worker had not been able to establish that he had any justifiable cause for his unauthorised absence Likewise at the same time one cannot forget that there are certain circumstances which indicate that the worker has indicated that he was not interested in the job In the absence of such materials one cannot infer that there was an intention express or implied expressed by the employee to abandon the employment This takes us to the question as to what should be the relief to be granted Back wages cannot be awarded as there is some evidence that he would have been otherwise employed There is no gain saying that the absence was unauthorised He said rules of natural justice were inbuilt in clause of Bipartite Settlement and law laid by this Court in <NAME> case was not applicable The workman not reporting for duty within calendar days as mentioned above shall be deemed to have automatically abandoned the services and lost his lien on his appointment This Court said that the principle of natural justice and duty to act in just fair and reasonable manner must be read into the Standing Orders When it is interpreted that the colour and content of procedure established by law must be in conformity with the minimum fairness and processual justice it would relieve legislative callousness despising opportunity of being heard and fair opportunities of defence It is thereby conclusively held by this <ORG> that the principles of natural justice are part of Article and the procedure prescribed by law must be just fair and reasonable At this we may as well refer to other judgments cited at the <ORG> Next day an FIR was lodged against him and others under Section read with Section Workman approached <ORG> which set aside the order of the Corpo ration and directed reinstatement of the workman with per cent back wages We consider that in view of this concession made by the learned counsel on behalf of the appellant Corporation that the said Rule must be read and given effect to subject to the compliance of the principles on natural justice it cannot be said that the Rule is arbitrary or unreasonable or ultra vires Article of the Constitution In other words before taking action under the said clause an opportunity should be given to the employee to show cause against the action proposed and if the cause shown by the employees is good and acceptable it follows that no action in terms of the said clause will be taken This Court was thus of the view that there was no good reason for <ORG> to interfere with the impugned order of the appellant Corporation dated January Disciplinary action taken on the basis of a vitiated enquiry does not stand on a better footing than a disciplinary action with no enquiry The right of the employer to adduce evidence in both the situations is well recognised Two principles emerge from the decision principles of natural justice and duty to act in just fair and reasonable manner have to be read in Certified Standing Orders which have statutory force These can be applied by <ORG> and <ORG> even to relations between management and workman though based on contractual obligation and where domestic inquiry was not held or it was vitiated or some reason the <ORG> or <ORG> adjudicating an industrial dispute can itself go into the question raised before it on the basis of the evidence and other material on record It was thereafter that the <ORG> served a notice on him calling upon to report for duty within days of the notice stating therein the grounds for the <ORG> to come to be conclusion that <NAME> had no intention of joining duties On the expiry of the notice period <ORG> passed orders that <NAME> had voluntarily retired from the service of the <ORG> Now what are the requirements of principles of natural justice which are required to be observed These are workman should know the nature of the complaint or accusation an opportunity to state his case and the management should act in good faith which means that the action of the management should be fair reasonable and just Yet the <ORG> held that no notice was given to <NAME> as postman was not produced by the <ORG> Unfortunately <ORG> did not go into this question at all There are two essential elements of natural justice which are a no man shall be judge in his own cause and no man shall be condemned either civilly or criminally without being afforded an opportunity of being heard in answer to the charge made against him It rightly held that <NAME> had voluntarily retired from the service of the <ORG> An inquiry would have been necessary if <NAME> had submitted his explanation which was not acceptable to the <ORG> or contended that he did report for duty but was not allowed to joint by the <ORG> Assuming for a moment that inquiry was necessitated evidence led before the <ORG> clearly showed that notice was given to <NAME> and it is he who defaulted and offered no explanation of his absence from duty and did not report for duty within days the notice as required in Clause of the Bipartite Settlement It was not a case where the <ORG> should have given any relief to <NAME> and yet the <ORG> was directed to reinstate him with continuity of service and mercifully the latter part of the relief <ORG> struck down There was no occasion for the <ORG> to direct that <NAME> be reinstated in service or for <ORG> not to have exercised its jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution to set aside the Award We therefore allow the appeal set aside the impugned judgment of <ORG> and also the Award dated September of <ORG> Even though we have set aside the order of the <ORG> we direct that the wages so far paid to Dayananda be neither recorded nor adjusted by the <ORG>
