HEADNOTE The respondent was appointed a Sub Inspector on probation in <ORG> He submitted his explanation and asked for opportunity to cross examine certain witnesses The respondent contended that the order was invalid on two grounds i that he was not given a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the proposed action within the meaning of Art He had no right to the post held by him and under the terms of his appointment he was liable to be discharged at any time during the period of his probation The notice given to the respondent was under Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules which made it obligatory to give such notice before terminating the services of a probationer The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> respondent was appointed in the year a Sub Inspector on probation in the Orissa Police force By his explanation the respondent submitted that action had already been taken against him by the Superintendent of Police in respect of instances of neglect of duty set out in the notice and no further action in respect thereof could on that account be taken against him because to do so would amount to imposing double punishment He denied the charge relating to misconduct and submitted that it was based on the uncorroborated statements of witnesses who were inimical to him He also asked for an opportunity to cross examine those witnesses of the Constitution in <ORG> Orissa challenging the validity of the order passed and praying for the issue of a writ in the nature of certiorari or any other writ quashing the order of discharge Inter alia the respondent urged that the order of discharge was invalid since he was not given a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him within the meaning of Art In the view of <ORG> the Deputy Inspector General of Police had taken into consideration allegations of corruption in passing the impugned order and also that he had refused to give to the respondent an opportunity to cross examine witnesses on whose statements the charge of misconduct was made Against the order issuing the writ quashing the order discharging the respondent from service this appeal has been preferred by special leave Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules in so far as it is material provides Where it is proposed to terminate the employment of a probationer whether during or at the end of the period of probation for any specific fault or on account of his unsuitability for the service the probationer shall be apprised of the grounds of such proposal and given an opportunity to show cause against it before orders are passed by the authority competent to terminate the employment Notice to show cause whether the employment of the respondent should be terminated was by made obligatory The Deputy Inspector General of Police by his order which ha been set out hereinbefore expressly observed that he had in considering the case of the respondent for confirmation to take into account the reports received by him The formal order communicated to the respondent also stated that the respondent was discharged from service for unsatisfactory work and conduct The reasons given in the order clearly indicate that the notice served upon the respondent was under of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules for ascertaining whether he should be confirmed or his employment terminated Prima facie the order is one terminating employment of the respondent as a probationer and it is not an order dismissing him from service The respondent has not appeared before us to support the judgment of <ORG> but the learned Solicitor General who appeared in support of the appeal has very fairly invited our attention to all the materials on the record and the relevant authorities which have a bearing on the case of the respondent concerned was served with a notice to show cause in respect of three specific items of misdemeanor as a public servant to which he submitted his explanation In an appeal against the order dismissing the petition this court held that the order compulsorily retiring the public servant involved no element of charge or imputation and did not amount to dismissal or removal within the meaning of Art of the Constitution and the order of the President was not liable to be challenged on the ground that the public servant had not been afforded full opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him <NAME> who disagreed with the majority observed that the real test was whether evil consequences over and above those that ensued from a contractual termination were likely to ensue as a consequence of the impugned order if they were Art of the Constitution would be attracted even though such evil consequences were not prescribed as penalties under the Rules Like wise the termination of service by compulsory retirement in terms of a specific rule regulating the conditions of service is not tantamount to the infliction of a punishment and does not attract Art In short if the termination of service is founded on the right flowing from contract or the service rules then prima facie the termination is not a punishment and carries with it no evil consequences and so Art But even if the <ORG> has by contract or under the rules the right to terminate the employment without going through the procedure prescribed for inflicting the punishment of dismissal or removal or reduction in rank the <ORG> may nevertheless choose to punish the servant and if the termination of service is sought to be founded on misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualification then it is a punishment and the requirements of Art As already stated if the servant has got a right to continue in the post then unless the contract of employment or the rules provide to the contrary his services cannot be terminated otherwise than for misconduct negligence inefficiency or other good and sufficient cause for it operates as a forfeiture of his right and he is visited with the evil consequences of loss of pay and allowances It puts an indelible stigma on the officer affecting his future career But the mere fact that the servant has no title to the post or the rank and the <ORG> has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to reduce him to a lower post does not mean that an order of reduction of a servant The real test for determining whether the reduction in such cases is or is not by way of punishment is to find out if the order for the reduction also visits the servant with any penal consequences The use of the expression terminate or discharge is not conclusive In spite of the use of such innocuous expressions the court has to apply the two tests mentioned above namely Whether the servant had a right to the post or the rank or Whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore referred to If the case satisfies either of the two tests then it must be held that the servant has been punished and the termination of his service must be taken as a dismissal or removal from service The respondent had no right to the post held by him Again mere termination of employment does not carry with it any evil consequences such as forfeiture of his pay or allowances loss of his seniority stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion etc If a confirmed public servant holding a substantive post is discharged the order would amount to dismissal or removal from service but an order discharging a temporary public servant may or may not amount to dismissal Where under the rules governing a public servant holding a post on probation an order terminating the probation is to be preceded by a notice to show cause why his service should not be terminated and a notice is issued asking the public servant to show cause whether probation should be continued or the officer should be discharged from service the order discharging him cannot be said to amount to dismissal involving punishment Undoubtedly the Government may hold a formal enquiry against a probationer on charges of misconduct with a view to dismiss him from service and if an order terminating his employment is made in such an enquiry without giving him reasonable opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken against him within the meaning of Art The third proposition set out in the judgment is as follows But instead of terminating such a person service without any enquiry the employer chooses to hold an enquiry into his alleged misconduct or inefficiency or for some similar reason the termination of service is by way of punishment because it puts a stigma on his competence and thus affects his future career In such a case he is entitled to the protection of Art The order was not one merely discharging a probationer following upon an enquiry to ascertain whether he should be continued in service but it was an order as observed by the court clearly by way of punishment There is in our judgment no real inconsistency between the observations made in parshottam What is decisive is whether the order is by way of punishment in the light of the tests laid down in Parshottam <NAME> case In that view of the case this appeal will be allowed and the petition for a writ dismissed
