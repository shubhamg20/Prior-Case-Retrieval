We had adjourned the matter on the earlier occasion till today to provide an opportunity to <ORG> to place before us its clear stand as to whether the Notification dated August was being implemented or not Government wants to assure the <ORG> that it would utilise the time given to it for undertaking full and effective consultations with all concerned in the interest of evolving a generally acceptable solution Mr <NAME> raises serious objections to any adjournment of hearing of the cases by filing a counter memorandum indicating therein that all the points which have arisen for argument would still exist as issues requiring attention of the <ORG> even if that is proposed by <ORG> is done In these circumstances we adjourn the matter to September but we would suggest to <ORG> to take appropriate steps as early as possible so that the proposed decision is taken and in case it is finalised at any time prior to September we would like the learned Additional Solicitor General to mention that fact to this Court so that the hearing may be appropriately preponed
