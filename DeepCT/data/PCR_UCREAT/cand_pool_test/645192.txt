Respondents Petition under Article of the Constitution of India praying for the issue of a Writ of Certiorarified <ORG>andamus calling for the entire records ending with the orders dated made in A SA No of SA No of on the file of <ORG> Chennai on the file of <ORG> at Chennai and quashing the same in so far as it relates to the following finding viz As the Lease Agreeement for the period through which the petitioners were in possession of the premises on the date of taking of possession by the Advocate Commissioner is an unregistered document it has to be concluded that the lease is not in conformity with the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and therefore in view of this it has to be held that the authorized officer is well within his powers to exercise his right of taking physical possession of the premises as per the provisions of the SARFAESI Act and the rules made thereunder For disposal of both the writ petitions we refer to the following facts as culled out from the respective affidavits filed in support of the writ petitions <ORG> <ORG> had availed certain financial facilities from the bank amounting to a sum of Rs under open cash credit facility and packing credit facility under the sanction ticket dated Those financial facilities were duly secured by creating equitable mortgage over the immovable properties belonging to one Mr <NAME> and Mr Bharat <NAME> situate at Laxmi Narain Towers at Door Nos Wallajah Road Triplicane Chennai <ORG> <ORG> committed default in repayment of the financial facilities and therefore the bank invoked the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act hereinafter called as the SARFAESI Act and the asset of <ORG> <ORG> was classified as Non Performing Asset and the bank issued notice dated under Section of the SARFAESI Act In spite of the said notice and within the period of sixty days <ORG> <ORG> did not clear the dues which resulted in the bank issuing a notice dated under Section for taking possession A similar notice under Section was also issued to the tenant in respect of the portions of the property under their occupation The said appeal was dismissed by the <ORG> in its order dated As the bank could not take physical possession it filed an application under Section of the SARFAESI Act before the learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate <NAME> in which the tenant was arrayed as the third respondent The learned Chief Metropolitan Magistrate passed the following order dated and the relevant portions read as under Thereafter the tenant filed No of seeking for an order prohibiting the bank from taking possession of the entire ground floor and shop numbers in the basement at the premises in Door Nos Wallajah Road Chennai This Court also observed that the tenant is entitled to approach <ORG> on the question as to the applicability of Section of the SARFAESI Act and in such event the <ORG> would consider the said question as well By order dated though the <ORG> refused to grant interim relief for restoring the possession of the schedule mentioned property granted interim order restraining the bank as well as the Advocate Commissioner from removing the equipments and other materials stored in the business premises of the tenant The following issues were framed by the <ORG> in A No of i Whether the applicants are lawful tenants in occupation of that portion of schedule mentioned property under the ii Whether the applicant which is admittedly a partnership firm has been registered and if so whether they can sue the iii Whether the bank is entitled to take physical possession of the schedule mentioned property by executing the warrant issued by the Hon ble Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Chennai overlooking the fact that the tenancy of the applicant is years prior to the creation of mortgage by in favour of the iv Whether the applicants are entitled to the relief sought for in the application So far as the first issue is concerned the <ORG> found that the respondent no namely the tenant was lawful tenant in occupation of the premises It was further found that by virtue of that sale the bank became the owner of the premises and therefore it was no more the holder of the asset as a secured creditor We have heard Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel for the bank Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel for the tenant and Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the employees of the tenant Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the bank has submitted that the lease commenced only from on which date the lease deed was executed for a period of years upto and in terms of Section of the Transfer of Property Act the lease deed should be compulsorily registered The learned senior counsel would also submit that Section of the SARFAESI Act has overriding effect on any other law muchless the <ORG> law In view of Article of the Constitution of India in case of inconsistency between the laws made by the <ORG> and the Legislature of the <ORG> the law made by the <ORG> shall prevail On the date when the mortgage was created in favour of the bank on the tenant was in occupation on the strength of a lease deed though not registered We have carefully considered the above submissions In view of the rival contentions the following points arise for our consideration i Can a lessee tenant in bona fide occupation of a secured asset for more than a period of one year could claim the benefit of the lease under Section of the SARFAESI Act in the event there was no registration of the lease deed as required under Section of the Transfer of Property Act If so whether the tenant is entitled to invoke the provisions of Section on the facts of this case ii Whether in terms of Section the SARFAESI Act will override the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease Rent Control Act to enable the bank to evict a tenant and take physical possession of the secured asset either by invoking Section or Section of the SARFAESI Act iii Whether an unregistered partnership firm is entitled to maintain an application before <ORG> in view of the bar under Section of the Partnership Act According to the tenant since it is a bona fide lessee under the borrower even before the mortgage was created during the year the proceedings initiated under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act are wholly without jurisdiction and therefore the entire proceedings are vitiated On the other hand Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the bank would contend that Section of the SARFAESI Act has no application to the facts of the present case inasmuch as the lease in question is not a registered lease as required under Section of the Transfer of Property Act for short the TP Act and there was no lease in legal sense The TN Rent Control Act has received the assent of the President and therefore in the event if there is any inconsistency between the provisions of TN Rent Control Act and the provisions of TP Act to the extent of inconsistency the TN Rent Control Act shall prevail over the Central Act and shall have overriding effect Under section of the Transfer of Property Act a lease of immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent can be made only by a registered instrument Section deals with the rights and liabilities of lessors and lessees The topic of Transfer of Property other than agricultural land is covered by Entry of List III to the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution For better appreciation it is necessary to have a look into the provisions of the TP Act as well as the TN Rent Control Act and to see as to whether there is any inconsistency between Section of the TP Act and Section of the TN Rent Control Act Though to create a valid lease of immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one year or reserving a yearly rent a registered instrument is necessary under Section of the TP Act there is no such legal requirement as per the provisions of the TN Rent Control Act In Section of the TN Rent Control Act the term tenant has been defined as follows any person by whom or on whose account rent is payable for a building and includes the surviving spouse or any son or daughter or the legal representation of a deceased tenant who i in the case of a residential building had been living with the tenant in the building as a member of the tenant family upto the death of the tenant and ii in the case of a non residential building had been in continuous association with the tenant for the purpose of carrying on the business of the tenant upto the death of the tenant and continues to carry on such business thereafter and a person continuing in possession after the termination of the tenancy in his favour but does not include a person placed in occupation of a building by its tenant or a person to whom the collection of rents or fees in a public market cart stand or slaughter house or of rents for shops has been framed out or leased by <ORG> or <ORG> or <ORG> or <ORG> The tenant has also paid the rents which were accepted by the bank as well This leads us to the next question as to whether in the given case the tenant can claim the benefit of Section of the SARFAESI Act Provisions of this Act not to apply in certain cases In this context we may also refer to Section of the SARFAESI Act defining financial assistance In the instant case security interest over the property in question has been created not by the lease in favour of the tenant but by means of mortgage executed by the owners of the land in favour of the bank The provisions of this Act to override other laws The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law The power to make laws by the <ORG> and <ORG> flows from Article of the Constitution By virtue of the non obstante clause contained in Article of the Constitution <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I of Seventh Schedule By virtue of the non obstante clause contained in Article of the Constitution <ORG> and subject to clause the <ORG> of any <ORG> shall have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III of Seventh Schedule Likewise by virtue of Article of the Constitution subject to clauses and the <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws for such <ORG> or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II of Seventh Schedule Article of the Constitution is a mechanism to reconcile a law made by the <ORG> and a law made by the <ORG> in the event there is inconsistency The scope and ambit of Article of the Constitution came up for consideration before <ORG> on various occasions It would be seen that so far as clause of Article is concerned it clearly lays down that where there is a direct collision between a provision of law made by <ORG> with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of clause the <ORG> law would be void to the extent of the repugnancy First regarding the matters contained in List I i the Union List to the Seventh Schedule <ORG> alone is empowered to legislate and the <ORG> Legislatures have no authority to make any law in respect of the Entries contained in List I Secondly so far as the Concurrent List is concerned both <ORG> and the <ORG> Legislatures are entitled to legislate in regard to any of the Entries appearing therein but that is subject to the condition laid down by Article discussed above It is therefore obvious that in such matters repugnancy may result from the following circumstances Where the provisions of a Central Act and a State Act in the Concurrent List are fully inconsistent and are absolutely irreconcilable the Central Act will prevail and the State Act will become void in view of the repugnancy Where however a law passed by the <ORG> comes into collision with a law passed by <ORG> on an Entry in the Concurrent List the <ORG> Act shall prevail to the extent of the repugnancy and the provisions of the Central Act would become void provided the <ORG> Act has been passed in accordance with clause of Article Where a law passed by <ORG> while being substantially within the scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the Entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and large the law falls within the four corners of the State List an entrenchment if any is purely incidental or inconsequential Where however a law made by <ORG> on a subject covered by the Concurrent List is inconsistent with and repugnant to a previous law made by <ORG> then such a law can be protected by obtaining the assent of the President under Article of the Constitution The result of obtaining the assent of the President would be that so far as the <ORG> Act is concerned it will prevail in the <ORG> and overrule the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to the <ORG> only Such a state of affairs will exist only until <ORG> may at any time make a law adding to or amending varying or repealing the law made by <ORG> under the proviso to Article <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I notwithstanding anything contained in clauses and of Article The non obstante clause under Article indicates the predominance or supremacy of the law made by <ORG> in the event of an overlap of the law made by <ORG> with respect to a matter enumerated in List I and a law made by <ORG> with respect to a matter enumerated in List II of the Seventh Schedule If there is a repugnancy due to overlapping found between List II on the one hand and List I and List III on the other the State Law will be ultra vires and shall have to give way to the Union Law However if it could be shown that the core area and the subject matter of the legislation is covered by an entry in the State List then any incidental encroachment upon an entry in the Union List would not be enough so as to render the State Law invalid and such an incidental encroachment will not make the legislation ultra vires the Constitution The Lists enumerate elaborately the topics on which either of the legislative constituents can enact In a case of overlapping the <ORG>s have taken the view that it is advisable to ignore an encroachment which is merely incidental in order to reconcile the provisions and harmoniously implement them The question to be considered is as to whether there is any overlapping between the two enactments It was under those circumstances two committees were constituted and the said committees recommended to the Government that even the intervention of the tribunal may not be necessary and instead the banks themselves can be given power to directly recover the debts due to the banks by following certain procedures The Act does not create any substantive right in the bank There can be no difficulty in taking such possession of the secured assets either under Section or under Section of the SARFAESI Act if the secured asset is in the possession of the borrower or guarantor as the case may be Though the function of Chief Metropolitan Magistrate District Magistrate is only ministerial the provision of Section confers drastic power to take possession even by use of force The difficulty arises only in cases where the possession of the property is in the hands of the tenant lessee Only in the event the SARFAESI Act contains a provision to enable the bank to take possession of a secured asset from a lessee then only it can be held that there is conflict between the SARFAESI Act and the TN Rent Control Act in which case the TN Rent Control Act should give way for the SARFAESI Act to have overriding effect However there is no such provision in the SARFAESI Act enabling the bank to take possession from the lessee though the Act speaks of the right of the bank to take possession of the secured asset When there is no such overlapping or repugnancy between these two provisions in respect of taking possession from the lessee it has to be held that physical possession of the secured assets from the lessee tenant can be taken only by invoking the provisions of the TN Rent Control Act If the provisions of the DRT ACT and Securitisation Act are interpreted keeping in view the background and context in which these legislations were enacted and the purpose sought to be achieved by their enactment it becomes clear that the two legislations are intended to create a new dispensation for expeditious recovery of dues of banks financial institutions and secured creditors and adjudication of the grievance made by any aggrieved person qua the procedure adopted by the banks financial institutions and other secured creditors but the provisions contained therein cannot be read as creating first charge in favour of banks etc If <ORG> intended to give priority to the dues of banks financial institutions and other secured creditors over the first charge created under State legislations then provisions similar to those contained in Section A of the Workmen Compensation Act Section of the EPF Act Section of the Estate Duty Act Section of the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act Section of the Gift Tax Act and Section A of the Companies Act would have been incorporated in the DRT Act and Securitisation Act The Court could have given effect to the non obstante clauses contained in Section of the DRT Act and Section of the Securitisation Act vis a vis Section of the Bombay Act and Section of the Kerala Act and similar other State legislations only if there was a specific provision in the two enactments creating first charge in favour of the banks financial institutions and other secured creditors but as the <ORG> has not made any such provision in either of the enactments the first charge created by the State legislations on the property of the dealer or any other person liable to pay sales tax etc In the above case <ORG> found that since there was no specific provision creating first charge in respect of the amount due to the bank in the SARFAESI Act such provision contained in the <ORG> enactment creating first charge in respect of the dues to the Government shall not indicate any conflict or inconsistency or overlapping between the same In the case on hand as we have already stated there is no specific provision in the SARFAESI Act in respect of taking possession from the hands of the tenant Thus they are traceable to two different entries in their respective fields and there is neither any conflict nor repugnancy or overlapping In such view of the matter there is no difficulty in holding that the bank cannot take physical possession from the tenant protected under Tamil Nadu Rent Control Act by invoking the provisions of Sections and of the SARFAESI Act in the event the tenant is in bona fide occupation Effect of non registration No suit to enforce a right arising from a contract shall be instituted in any Court by or on behalf of a firm against any third party unless the firm is registered and the persons suing are or have been shown in the Register of Firms as partners in the firm In order to make the said provision applicable the following requirements are necessary i A firm that sues a third party must be a registered firm and should seek to enforce a right arising from a contract As far as the facts of this case are concerned materials were placed before <ORG> only to show that as on the firm was registered and thereafter it is the claim of the tenant that there were entries made upto the year As there was no change of partners subsequently the registration was not renewed In order to apply the said provision an application against a third party should be to enforce the right arising from a contract The provisions of sub section of Section are not applicable in the event the application is not for enforcement of the right arising from a contract The issue before <ORG> was in respect of the meaning of the expression other proceedings employed in sub section of Section and consequently whether an application filed under Section of the Arbitration Act can be regarded as a proceeding to enforce the right arising from a contract falling under Section of the Indian Partnership Act After considering the contentions <ORG> found that the expression other proceedings would also cover an application filed under Section of the Arbitration Act since such an application seeks to enforce the right arising from a contract In the present case when the possession was sought to be taken in respect of the premises under occupation by invoking the provisions of Section of the SARFAESI Act the tenant filed an application before <ORG> challenging such an action of the bank First of all there is no contract between the bank and the tenant Secondly in the appeal the question of enforcement of the right arising from a contract does not arise In paragraph of the judgment <ORG> has specifically observed that sub section similarly prohibits a suit by or on behalf of the firm against a third party for the purpose of enforcement of right arising from a contract unless the firm is registered and the partners suing are or shown in the register of firms as the partners in the firm The above judgment does not lay down the law to hold that even in case of a suit which does not relate to the enforcement of the right arising from a contract between the parties it is barred under sub section of Section of the Indian Partnership Act In that judgment also <ORG> has held that an application under Section of the Arbitration Act should be treated as a suit as it is filed to enforce the right arising from a contract The judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> case was also referred to by Their Lordships in the judgment and even from that judgment we could only read that where a suit is instituted by an unregistered firm to enforce the right arising from a contract it is barred under sub section of Section and not otherwise In fact the very same question came up for consideration before <ORG> in the judgment in Purushotham <ORG> wherein <ORG> has held that the test to find out the applicability of the bar under sub section of Section of the Partnership Act is as to whether the suit was arising from a contract and was in the course of business dealings with the third party defendant In the given case the question is as to whether a bona fide tenant in occupation much prior to the mortgage could be evicted without following the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease Rent Control Act and that application was not to enforce the right arising from a contract It could not create in favour of the defendant the right of a tenant for a period of fifteen years But in support of the plea that his possession was that of a tenant the defendant was entitled to rely upon the recitals contained in that agreement of lease A document required by law to be registered if unregistered is inadmissible as evidence of a transaction affecting immovable property but it may be admitted as evidence of collateral facts or for any collateral purpose that is for any purpose other than that of creating declaring assigning limiting or extinguishing a right to immovable property A lease of immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one year or reserving an yearly rent can be made only by a registered instrument The second inhibition as pointed out by <ORG> is Section of the Registration Act which states that where a lease of immovable property from year to year or for any term exceeding one year or reserving an yearly rent such document should be compulsorily registered Section contemplates that no document required by Section or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act to be registered shall be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring such power unless it has been registered Having regard to the above three inhibitions <ORG> has held that insofar as the instrument of lease is concerned there is no scope for holding that the appellant is a lessee by virtue of the said instrument When lease is a transfer of a right to enjoy the property and such transfer can be made expressly or by implication the mere fact that an unregistered instrument came into existence would not stand in the way of the court to determine whether there was in fact a lease otherwise than through such deed <ORG> further went on to add that when the landlord intended to put the tenant into possession of the building and the tenant was paying monthly rent or had agreed to pay the rent in respect of the building the legal character of the appellant possession should be attributed as a jural relationship between the parties In the given case the lease deed which is sought to be relied upon by the tenant in a proceeding initiated by the bank under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act to contend that in the wake of the provisions of Section and it being a tenant in bona fide occupation the bank cannot take possession of the premises in question from the tenant under the provisions of SARFAESI Act
