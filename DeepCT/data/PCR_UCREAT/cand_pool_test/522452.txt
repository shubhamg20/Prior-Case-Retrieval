HEADNOTE Section of the East Punjab General Sales Tax Act provided that no tax shall be payable on the sale of goods specified in the Schedule to the Act and that no dealer shall charge sales tax on the sale of goods which were declared tax free from time to time The Judgment of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> delivered a separate judgment Ch by which <ORG> had given notice as required by law of its intention to add the said item in the schedule of exemptions The Press Note reads as follows There is some misapprehension in the minds of dealers in manufactured tobacco as to whether sales tax is also chargeable in respect of manufactured tobacco after the st April in addition to the license fees under the Tobacco Vend Fees Act On January the appellants received a notice from <ORG> Rohtak calling upon them to produce their account books The appellants as well as other dealers of manufactured tobacco similarly affected made representations on the basis of the Press Note of August but without success The appellants then filed on February a petition under Art was heard by a learned Single Judge of <ORG> who held that the orders of Government were entirely in accordance with law that the East Punjab Sales Tax Act in so far as it related to the sale of manufactured tobacco was not repealed by the Tobacco Vend Fees Act and that sales tax on manufactured tobacco was payable from April to September in view of the fact that the exemption was made on September and would operate from the latter date <ORG> which heard the appeal agreed with the judgment appealed from and dismissed the appeal Two contentions were raised in the forefront before <ORG> by the appellants No repeal can be implied unless there is an express repeal of an earlier Act by the later Act or unless the two Acts cannot stand together The question which is now raised and of which there is but a trace in <ORG> is the real one to decide and it may be formulated thus Did the exemption in the Notification issued on September have effect from that date or from the beginning of the financial year We are not concerned with the question whether in the absence of rules and forms the Punjab Tobacco Vend Fees Act could operate from April Taking the Notification by itself it cannot be said that it comes into force from an earlier date The liability for sales tax in this appeal is for two quarters ending June and September There is no dispute that after September sales tax could not be levied in view of the inclusion of item in the schedule exempting manufactured tobacco from the operation of the Act We must now examine those provisions of the Act which are claimed by the rival parties to indicate the moment of time from which the exemption granted by the Notification began to operate Section provides for exemptions on the sale of goods which are specified in schedule to the Act Under <ORG> has been given the power to add to or delete from that schedule Section empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act Sub section says that every dealer who is liable to pay tax under the first sub section shall be liable to pay it on the expiry of days after the date on which his gross turnover first exceeds the taxable quantum Sub sections and deal with the continuance of the liability of the dealer under certain circumstances and are not relevant here Section which deals with the rate of tax is made subject to the other provisions of the Act and the first sub section says that there shall be levied on the taxable turnover every year of a dealer a tax at such rates not exceeding two pice in a rupee as <ORG> may by notification direct No tax shall be payable under this Act on the sale of goods specified in the first column of the Schedule subject to the conditions and exceptions if any set out in the corresponding entry in the second column there of and no dealer shall charge Sales Tax on the sale of goods which are declared tax free from time to time under this section Rule reads Every registered dealer other than those referred to in rules and shall furnish returns in Form VIII or XXIII if so permitted quarterly within thirty days from the expiry of each quarter Rule Notwithstanding the provisions of rules and the appropriate <ORG> may for reasons to be recorded in writing fix monthly returns for a dealer who would otherwise be required to furnish quarterly or annually under these rules It is thus possible that some dealers pay tax annually some quarterly and some monthly There is no doubt that the tax is a yearly tax Those who are paying the tax annually would get exemption for the whole year but those who are paying it quarterly or monthly would get benefit in the quarter or the month of the Notification but not for earlier quarters or months In the present case the Notification did not fix the date from which the exemption was to operate probably because the Act omitted to make such provision enabling the <ORG> to do so and the exemption must therefore operate for the whole year during which it was granted The majority view on that occasion pointed out that it was not possible to divide the assessment year in two portions in which the tax was levied at one rate in one part and another rate in another part The case was confined to a dealer who had elected to pay the tax for a year different from that in which the exemption was granted KAPUR The facts of this case have been set out in the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> which I have had the advantage of reading and as I am unable to agree with the conclusion that the effect of the exemption given by Notification No CH dated September issued under of the Punjab General Sales Tax Act Act of hereinafter called the Act on unmanufactured tobacco becomes effective as from the beginning of the financial year I proceed to give my reasons for the same Previous to the issuing of the notification of September <ORG> issued a notification required under of the Act for the purpose of information of persons likely to be affected thereby and to give them an opportunity to file any objections or suggestions in regard to the same Section of the Act gives definitions and cl defines a dealer as a person Subject to the provisions of this Act there shall be levied on the taxable turnover every year of a dealer a tax at such rates not exceeding two pice in a rupee as the State Government may by notification direct Provided that Government may by notification in the Official Gazette declare that in respect of any goods or class of goods the dealer may pay such lump sum by way of composition of the tax payable under this Act as the Government may notify from time to time iii Section which makes provision for giving exemption is as follows No tax shall be payable under this act on the sale of goods specified in the first column of the Schedule subject to the conditions and exceptions if any set out in the corresponding entry in the second column thereof and no dealer shall charge Sales Tax on the sale of goods which are declared tax free from time to time under this section Section is the section dealing with assessments Section gives the <ORG> the power to make rules Under the rule making power rules have been framed by <ORG> and reference may be made to Rules and Under the latter <ORG> is given the power to tax the returns to be made monthly in the case of a dealer who would otherwise be required to furnish them quarterly or annually It was also argued that if the exemption of the turnover was to operate for the quarter in which the exemption was notified the consequence will be absurd as those who pay the tax on quarterly returns or monthly returns will not be able to get the advantage of the exemption whereas those who pay on yearly returns will be so entitled Similarly in subsection of where sales tax is levied on the taxable turnover of a dealer the use of the word during any period is again repeated and in cl a of that section reference is made to deduction from his turnover during that period of the sale of goods declared tax free under and that is for a good reason because itself mentions the declaration of tax free goods from time to time indicating that whenever during the year or at any time during the year when goods are notified to be tax free If the contention of the appellants is correct then after all the returns have been filed the amount of sales tax according to the returns assessed and payments made there will have to be proceedings for reassessment remission or refund as the case may be in regard to those periods if any goods are added to the schedule exempting them from sales tax after the assessment or any goods are deleted from the schedule thus making them liable for sales tax and that will be for the periods of which the assessment had already been completed and finished I would therefore dismiss this appeal with costs
