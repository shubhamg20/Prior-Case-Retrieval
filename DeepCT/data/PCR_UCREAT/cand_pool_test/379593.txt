There are two appeals before us from a common judgment of <NAME> by which the learned Judge dismissed both of two applications which the parties had made before him against each other in a suit in which one of them is the plaintiff and the other the defendant Clause of the agreement provided that in addition to other remedies the producer would have the right to terminate the agreement summarily and forfeit all sums paid to him by the distributors in the case of breach or non performance of any of the conditions or in the case of default in making the stipulated payments or submitting statements of accounts On the th of May there was a letter from the distributors to the producer which referred to that agreement and set out the instalments newly agreed to In the letter they stated that they had entered into the agreement on the representation made to them that one of the pictures would deal with a historical theme another would deal with a social subject and the third would be a fantasy An enquiry into damages and a decree for such Sum as might be found due were also prayed for On the st August <NAME> made an application in <ORG> for an injunction restraining <ORG> from proceeding with their suit in Calcutta so long as the Bombay suit was not disposed of <ORG> held that Clause would apply only when the parties wanted to litigate their rights under the agreements If the two suits were based on the same cause of action the defendant in the subsequently instituted suit might seek his remedy under Section of the Civil Procedure Code but if the causes of action were different and consequently Section did not apply there would be no reason for the <ORG> to restrain the prosecution of a different and subsequent suit brought on a different cause of action On the th November <NAME> made an application for an injunction restraining <NAME> from proceeding with the Bombay suit The decision of <NAME> compris es three orders an order refusing to issue an injunction against <NAME> restraining him from prosecuting the Bombay suit an order refusing to revoke the leave granted under Clause of the Letters Patent and an order refusing to stay the Calcutta suit under Section of the Civil Procedure Code A preliminary objection was taken in Appeal No of that no appeal lay under Clause of the Letters Patent from either of the last two orders In Appeal No of it was contended that no appeal lay from the first order either I do not consider it necessary to decide whether an appeal lies against the order refusing to issue an injunction against <NAME> restraining him from proceeding with the Bombay suit I agree entirely with the learned Judge that there is no ground whatsoever for treating the earlier suit of <NAME> as a mala fide suit Like the learned trial Judge I see no trace whatsoever of any mala fides in <NAME> suit in Bombay and no reason to restrain its further prosecution by an injunction Unfortunately there is even no mention of the prayer for revocation of leave in the learned Judge judgment although it was the first prayer in the Notice of Motion It was not contended by the respondents that the prayer had been abandoned There is no similar difficulty about the prayer for a stay of the suit which was dealt with by the learned Judge at length and refused To take the order under Section of the Civil Procedure Code first it is not an order granting a stay of a suit but an order refusing to stay it On the other hand in <NAME> <ORG> of A A ILR Rang AIR Hang <ORG> held that an order under Section of the Code staying the hearing of a suit was not appealable but it preferred to reserve its opinion as to whether an appeal would lie from an order refusing stay If one wanted to ascertain what the framers of the Letters Patent had really in mind when they used the word judgment one would perhaps have to make a search in the vocabulary of old English lawyers as appearing in contemporary rules and judicial decisions The test according to the <NAME> decision is that in order to be a judgment a decision must affect the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability although it may be either a final judgment determining the whole cause or suit or a preliminary or interlocutory judgment determining only a part of it leaving other matters to be determined If the order is made on an independent proceeding which is ancillary to the suit and aims at rendering the judgment effective in case a judgment is obtained such as an application for an interim injunction or for the appointment of a Receiver then such an order also will be a judgment It will be seen that the second type of order admitted by the Madras test into the category of judgments will not terminate the Suit or proceeding nor can it strictly be said that it will affect the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability as required by the <NAME> test On a strict construction of the <NAME> test the right or liability must mean some right or liability which is a subject matter of controversy in the suit or proceeding but in its application to individual cases that strict construction has not been adhered to and was indeed often departed from by <NAME> himself who was the author of the test Orders concerning the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to entertain a suit as distinguished from matters of the actual dispute between the parties were held by him to come within the category of judgments The <ORG> refrained from giving ah exhaustive definition of the word judgment as used in Clause of the Letters Patent They dealt only with the order before them and held that no appeal lay from it for three reasons It appears to me that since the Supreme <ORG> did not frame an exhaustive definition of the word judgment which would be applicable in all cases it would not be correct to hold that no order can be a judgment if any of the negative reasons given by the Supreme <ORG> for holding the order before them to be not appealable applies But it appears to me that at least where a question of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to entertain or proceed with a suit or proceeding is involved and a decision on that question is given such decision affects the merits of the controversy between the parties It is true that it does not touch the actual dispute regarding the respective rights and liabilities which is the subject matter of the suit or proceeding but whether those rights and liabilities can be adjudicated on by a particular <ORG> at all or adjudicated on at the time is also a matter of controversy between the parties To be entitled to have one suit or proceeding decided by a particular <ORG> or to be entitled to object that a suit or proceeding brought by one adversary cannot be tried or tried for the time being by the <ORG> in which it has been brought is it seems to me also a matter of right To refuse to stay a suit under Section is to uphold the right of the plaintiff to have his suit tried without interruption in the forum of his choice and to negative the defendant claim to have the subject matter tried by the other <ORG> where he has brought his own suit In any event such an order affects the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to try the suit although the bar created may be temporary But an order refusing a stay also involves assumption of jurisdiction and in so far as it negatives the defendant contention that the Suit cannot be proceeded with and upholds the plaintiffs claim that the suit must proceed it seems to me that it affects the merits of a part of the controversy between the parties the particular controversy being a controversy in the suit as to where the subject matter should be tried I have already pointed out that the test laid down by the <NAME> decision has always been regarded as flexible at least to this extent that besides orders affecting merits of the disputes between the parties orders concerning the jurisdiction of a <ORG> to entertain or try a dispute has always been held to be judgments In Beaumont observed as follows It appears to me that a decision of the Judge either to allow or to refuse a stay under that section is a decision which in fact goes to the jurisdiction of the <ORG> Therefore the decision of the Judge under Section really determines the rights of the plaintiffs to sue in this <ORG> and it seems to me that such a decision is a judgment within Clause of the Letters Patent and the authorities under that clause and that such a decision is not a mere order relating to procedure in the suit These reasons were adopted or similar reasons were given in the other decisions to which I have referred where it was held that an order under Section of the Code was a judgment An order staying a suit under Section of the Code can be said to affect even the actual dispute between the parties on the merits because it compels the plaintiff to take the decision of the other <ORG> on the questions in controversy however they may be decided instead of the decision of the <ORG> of his choice which might well have been different In <NAME> case the jurisdiction of the <ORG> of institution was certainly affected by the order of transfer but there was no question of the decision of one <ORG> operating as res judicata as to the questions in controversy before another <ORG> nor any question of conflicting decision on the merits The head note stating that the order appealed from was an order granting leave is wrong as will appear from pp In holding that an appeal lay from the order <NAME> with whom <NAME> agreed observed as follows It is not a mere formal order merely regulating the procedure in a suit but one that has the effect of giving a jurisdiction to the <ORG> which it otherwise would not have and it may fairly be said to determine some right between them viz the right to sue in a particular <ORG> and to compel the defendants who are not within its jurisdiction to come in and defend the suit or if they do not to make them liable to have a decree passed against them in their absence In <NAME> case <ORG> had occasion to refer to orders of leave granted under Clause of the Letters Patent and orders refusing to revoke such leave and in that context they referred to this decision As to the general question regarding orders under Clause of the Letters Patent <NAME> observed as follows Leave granted under Clause of the Letters Patent constitutes the very foundation of the suit which is instituted on its basis If such leave is rescinded the suit automatically comes to an end and there is no doubt that such an order would be a judgment If on the other hand an order is made dismissing the Judge summons to show cause why the leave should not be rescinded the result is as Sir <NAME> pointed out <NAME> <NAME> ILR Bom that a decision on a vital point adverse to the defendant which goes to the very root of the suit becomes final and decisive against him so far as the Court making the order is concerned This brings the order within the category of a judgment as laid down in the Calcutta cases It was contended on behalf of the appellant that <ORG> were approving of what they set out as the view of Sir <NAME> because they used the expression the result is as Sir <NAME> pointed out and therefore they were quoting what Sir <NAME> had said with approval The words as Sir <NAME> pointed out merely mean according to Sir <NAME> or as it has been put by Sir <NAME> Otherwise too I find nothing in the principles laid down in <ORG> judgment which requires or authorises me to dissent from the earlier decision in Beng LR I which was also a decision of <ORG> and with the reasoning of which I respectfully agree In the Madras Full Bench case of the following observation about the judgment of <ORG> occurs in the judgment of <NAME> It also held that an order refusing to rescind leave to sue granted under Clause of the Letters Pa tent was hot a judgment under Clause of the Letters Patent As regards the order made under Section it appears to me if I may say so If Clause of the agreements was not attracted there was no reason to injunct the Calcutta plaintiff against proceeding with his suit on the ground that he had brought it in breach of the agreement It is also not clear how two persons quarrelling over the same transaction and bringing separate suits with respect to it against each other can have the same cause of action It was argued on behalf of the Bombay plaintiff that the Calcutta suit would fall under Section and the Bombay plaintiff might undoubtedly invoke the aid of that section but he might also ask for relief from <ORG> by way of an injunction against the Calcutta plaintiff issued in the exercise of the <ORG> inherent jurisdiction But he did not refuse an injunction on the finding that the Bombay plaintiff had an alternative remedy in Section of the Code as thought by the learned Judge holding thereby that the subject matter of the two suits or their causes of action were identical but he did so on the ground that the Calcutta suit was a subsequent suit and therefore it could not be stayed by an injunction and he added that the plaintiff might seek his relief in Calcutta under Section if that section applied It is true that no written statement has yet been filed in the Calcutta suit but what the defence in the Calcutta suit will be is fairly clear from the plaint in the Bombay suit itself as also the application made to this <ORG> by <NAME> The learned Judge has also given it as a reason for refusing to stay the suit before him under Section that there is an additional party in that suit No allegation is made against the company except that some money was paid to it and that it was a party to and knew of the misrepresentations made by <NAME> As to the prayer for revocation of leave I see no reason to grant it
