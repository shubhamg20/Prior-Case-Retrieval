This is a suit to recover a temple office which is alleged to be hereditary in the plaintiff family and which was purchased at a <ORG> auction by the defendant in execution of a decree against a previous holder of the office The view that the auction purchaser may be treated as the representative of the decree holder in oases arising between him and the judgment debtor was no doubt taken in <NAME> <NAME> I Mad In the present case we must reverse the decree of the lower Appellate <ORG> and restore that of the District Munsif with costs here and in the lower Appellate <ORG> The decree was executed against the plaintiff after the death of his father and it must be taken that due notice was issued to the plaintiff of the proceedings in execution The defendant who purchased the office in execution obtained possession of it in November The plaintiff institutes the present suit for the surrender by the defendant of the <ORG> office on the ground that the sale was null and void The plaintiff having obtained a decree in <ORG> the defendant has preferred this Second Appeal The plaintiff was a party to the execution proceedings and the only mode in which he can impeach the sale is by an application to the executing Court to set aside the sale It is argued for the plaintiff that the sale is a nullity because the decree did not direct the sale of the office and the office was inalienable There was a personal decree against the plaintiff father and even assuming that the office was not charged with the liability it could be proceeded against in execution of the money decree Supposing that the office was inalienable on which do not express an opinion it was competent to the executing Court to deal with the question whether the office was saleable No exception having been taken in execution to the sale we must take it that the sale was rightly held The defendant cannot he ousted from possession until the sale is duly set aside No attempt having been made by the plaintiff to impeach the sale in execution and the sale having been confirmed it is not competent to the plaintiff to disturb the possession of the auction purchaser by suit See <NAME> <NAME> I Mad But this latter view appears to me to be erroneous This mistake arises from a confusion between two ideas It is perhaps unnecessary to discuss the question whether Section is a bar to the present suit though I have no hesitation in expressing my concurrence in the decision in <NAME> <NAME> I Mad It seems to me that the view upheld in <NAME> <NAME> I Mad which was the case of a purchaser from the decree holder who purchased in execution of his own decree is different from the ease of a stranger purchaser It is difficult to see how a stranger purchasing in execution of a money decree can ever be treated as the representative of the decree holder He purchased the rights of the judgment debtor in the property attached and not those of the decree holder between whom and himself there is no privity of estate It may sometimes be that the purchase carries more than the interest of the judgment debtor as for example when the judgment debtor has done something with the property in fraud of the decree holder It appears to me that <NAME> <NAME> I Mad
