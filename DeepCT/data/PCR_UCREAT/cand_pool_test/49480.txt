The first appellant filed Execution Application No in which the respondent filed five unsuccessful objections Appeals Nos and by the impugned order dated February allowed the applications and granted ad interim injunction restraining the appellants from taking possession of the residential portion Order Rule provides that temporary injunction may be granted where in any suit it is proved by the affidavit or otherwise that the defendant threatens to dispossess the plaintiff or otherwise cause injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit the court may by order grant a temporary injunction to restrain such act or make such other order for the purpose of staying and preventing or dispossession of the plaintiff or otherwise causing injury to the plaintiff in relation to any property in dispute in the suit as the court thinks fit until the disposal of the suit or until further orders Earlier thereto there was no express power except the inherent power under Section to grant ad interim injunction against dispossession In other words the court in exercise of the power of granting ad interim injunction is to preserve the subject matter of the suit in the status quo for the time being The exercise thereof is subject to the court satisfying that there is a serious disputed question to be tried in the suit and that an act on the facts before the court there is probability of his being entitled to the relief asked for by the plaintiff defendant the court interference is necessary to protect the party from the species of injury Therefore the burden is on the plaintiff by evidence aliunde by affidavit or otherwise that there is a prima facie case in his favour which needs adjudication at the trial Prima facie case is not to be confused with prima facie title which has to be established on evidence at the trial Only prima facie case is a substantial question raised bona fide which needs investigation and a decision on merits Satisfaction that there is a prima facie case by itself is not sufficient to grant injunction The <ORG> further has to satisfy that non interference by the <ORG> would result in irreparable injury to the party seeking relief and that there is no other remedy available to the party except one to grant injunction and he needs protection from the consequences of apprehended injury or dispossession Irreparable injury however does not mean that there must be no physical possibility of repairing the injury but means only that the injury must be a material one namely one that cannot be adequately compensated by way of damages The third condition also is that the balance of convenience must be in favour of granting injunction The <ORG> while granting or refusing to grant injunction should exercise sound judicial discretion to find the amount of substantial mischief or injury which is likely to be caused to the parties if the injunction is refused and compare it with that it is likely to be caused to the other side if the injunction is granted Undoubtedly in a suit seeking to set aside the decree the subject matter in the earlier suit though became final the <ORG> would in an appropriate case grant ad interim injunction when the party seeks to set aside the decree on the ground of fraud pleaded in the suit or for want of jurisdiction in the <ORG> which passed the decree This case demonstrates we are not expressing any opinion on the plea of fraud or their relative merits in the case or the validity of the decree impugned suffice to state that the conduct of the respondent militates against the bona fides The High <ORG> without adverting to any of these material circumstances held that balance of convenience lies in favour of granting injunction with the following observations keeping in mind the history various facts which have been brought to my notice and looking to the balance of convenience and irreparable loss I think it will be in the interest of justice to allow these appeals and grant temporary injunction that the appellants may not be dispossessed from the suit property The order of <ORG> is set aside and that of <ORG> is confirmed It is made clear that any observations made either by <ORG> or <ORG> or of this Court should be taken to be not relevant at the trial on merits The parties are directed to bear their own costs
