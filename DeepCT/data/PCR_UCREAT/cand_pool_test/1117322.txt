The order against which the Revision Petition has been presented is an order made by the District Judge of Tanjore under the powers conferred by Section of the Religious Endowments Act of On the th April the District Judge made an order calling on the managing members to show cause why the election should not be treated as invalid and restraining <NAME> from taking any part in the proceedings of the committee It is obvious as it seems to me that the Judge did not intend to appoint <NAME> It is sought to impeach this order on the ground that the procedure by election was bad and that if so the Judge had no power either to accept him as a member of the committee in pursuance of the election or to appoint him There was an appeal to <ORG> and the ground of appeal was that the person appointed was not a suitable person for the office <ORG> held that there was no right of appeal from that order from <ORG> to <ORG> Their Lordships of <ORG> say There is nothing in the Act which would suggest it unless it is to be found in Section They declined to consider the question whether there might not be a serious mischief without a remedy by reason of the fact that there was no appeal Theysay There is force in this arguments but whether a person so improperly appointed could as has been suggested be removed by proceedings equivalent to proceedings by quo warranto in England or whether upon a full consideration of the merits the appellant could be considered as a person improperly appointed are questions upon which their Lordships are not called upon to express an opinion They express no opinion on the question whether proceedings by way of revision would lie although it would appear from the argument of Mr <NAME> who contended that there was a right of appeal that reference was made amongst other enactments to Section the revision section of the old Code of Civil Procedure In <ORG> case there was no question of jurisdiction or of the powers under the Act and no question of the construction of any section of the Act There the question arose under Section of the Religious Endowments Act My attention was called to the <ORG> decision and it is scarcely necessary for me to say that if I had been of opinion that the principle of the <ORG> decision applied to the facts of that case There the question arose with reference to a section of the Bombay District Municipal Act Amendment Act of That enactment contains a section Section providing that where the validity of any election of a Municipal Commissioner is brought in question the District Judge after such inquiry as he deems necessary may make an order confirming the election or setting it aside It seems to me that under the Act in question the District Judge is a persona designata for a specific purpose and not an officer exercising judicial functions under the Act As regards the Religious Endowments Act it is clear that for the purpose of several sections of the Act <ORG> is not a persona designata but <ORG> exercising jurisdiction under the Act It seems to me it would be inconvenient if for certain purposes the District Judge is <ORG> exercising judicial functions under the Act and for other purposes under the Act he is a persona designata not exercising judicial functions My learned brother calls my attention to Section which provides No suit shall be entertained under this Act without a preliminary application being first made to the court for leave to institute such suit When an application is made to the court under Section the District Judge who constitutes the court is asked to adjudicate judicially and not to exercise his discretion as a persona designata I am told by my learned brother he speaks from experience as a District Judge that it is the practice of <ORG> to entertain revision petitions from orders made under Section of the Act All I desire to say is that the order made in this case seems to me to be an order which might be impeached by way of a revisfon petition The only other point is the argument in connection with Section of the new Civil Procedure Code which corresponds to Section of the old code It seems to me for the reasons I have already stated that the Judge in dealing with this matter was <ORG> and there the matter was a case In the first instance a vacancy is to be filled up by election and provision is made for the time within which and the manner in which the election is to be held The object of the section would seem to be to prevent a dead lock when the committee do not do their duty and arrange for an election by providing that where an election has not been held within the prescribed time the <ORG> may make the appointment if it thinks fit or if it does not think fit to do so may order the remaining members of the committee to appoint The section does not say either expressly or as it seems to me by implication that the remaining members of the committee are to hold an election before they appoint It is not necessary to empower the <ORG> to make such an order as a condition precedent if it is not complied with to the <ORG> appointing as the <ORG> already has the power to appoint if it thinks fit to exercise it without reference to the committee It is to be observed that the rules made by <ORG> for the election of <ORG> members make no provision for the holding of an election after three months have elapsed since the vacancy occurred The procedure prescribed by the rules would seem to apply only to an election held under paragraphs Nos and of the Section For the reasons I have stated I find myself unable to agree with the learned Judges as regards the construction of the Section In their judgment they observe that the construction which appears to me to be the right construction which would give the committee the power of taking advantage of their own default in not giving the notice and taking the action which under the section they are bound to take and that it is reasonable enough to say that if the committee abstain from acting the appointment may be made by the Judge but that it is quite another thing to confer this power on the committee as a result of their omission to comply with the law I do not think this question of construction was discussed in Stanthaiya <NAME> I but in my judgment in that case I made an observation to the effect that the surviving members of the committee must act so that the date of the election should be fixed not later than three months from the date of the vacancy and that if they did not so act their powers of election were gone It occurred to us that if we were satisfied that the remaining members of the committee would appoint <NAME> if they were given an opportunity of doing so it might not be necessary for us to interfere with the order of <ORG> We make no order as to the costs of the petitions to <ORG> or of the revision petition to this Court
