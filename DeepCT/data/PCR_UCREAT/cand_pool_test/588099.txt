The disputes arising therefrom between the parties were referred to the arbitrator named in the agreement He made three awards allowing claim Nos a and preferred by the appellant aggregating to Rs lakhs under the several heads mentioned therein Upon these awards an application was made before the court for passing decrees in terms thereof The trial court took the view that it could not adjudi cate upon the justification for the conclusions arrived at by the arbitrator unless such awards were the result of corruption fraud or there were errors apparent on the face of the award that it was not necessary for the arbitrator to give reasons for his award that there was no jurisdic tion to investigate into the merits of the case and to examine the documentary and oral evidence for the purpose of finding out whether or not the arbitrator had committed an error of law or fact that the arbitrator had not incorpo rated in the award any materials for his conclusion nor did he incorporate the terms of the contract between the par ties Under such circumstances the award could not be set aside especially when there was no error apparent on the face of it and there was nothing to show that the arbitrator had misconducted the proceedings or that the award had been improperly procured In appeal before <ORG> it was contended for the respon dents that there were errors apparent on the face of the award that the arbitrator had misconducted himself and travelled beyond the terms of the contract and that the claims allowed were beyond and contrary to the agreement between the parties whereas for the appellants it was contended that the award was a non speaking award and therefore it was not open to the court to go into the correctness or reasonableness of the award <ORG> set out the claims noted the rival contentious and referred to the various clauses and the conditions of the contract though the contract itself was made no part of the award and concluded that there were errors apparent on the face of the award that the arbitrator had misconducted himself and travelled beyond his power It had no jurisdiction to examine the different items awarded clause by clause by the arbitrator and to hold that under the contract these were not sustainable in the facts found by the arbitrator Once there is no dispute as to the contract what is the interpretation of that contract is a matter for the arbitrator and on which the court cannot substitute its own decision Where there are errors apparent on the face of the award it can only be set aside if in the award there is any proposition of law which is apparent on the face of the award namely in the award itself or any document incorpo rated in the award An award can also be set aside if the arbitrator had misconducted himself or the proceedings An award may be remitted or set aside on the ground that the arbitrator in making it had exceeded his jurisdic tion and evidence of matters not appearing on the face of it will be admitted in order to establish whether the jurisdic tion had been exceeded or not be because the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside the award whatever might be said about it in the award or by the arbitrator However there is a distinction between disputes as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that jurisdiction should be exercised There may be a conflict as to the power of the arbitrator to grant a particular remedy The court look into the reasoning only in a speak ing award It is not open to the court to probe the mental process of the arbitrator and speculate where no reasons are given by the arbitrator as to what impelled the arbi trator to arrive at his conclusion Furthermore in any event reasonableness of the reasons given by the arbitrator cannot be challenged From the Judgment and Order dated of <ORG> in A Nos and of These appeals arise from the judgment and order of <ORG> dated th May of Kerala against the judgment and decree dated th Sep tember passed by the principal Sub Judge <NAME> in Arbitration Cases Nos and of by which the learned Sub Judge had upheld the awards by the arbitrator on the ground that it was not open to the court to sit in appeal over the decision of the arbitrator and the court could not adjudicate upon the justification for the conclusions arrived at by the arbitrator unless such awards were the result of corruption fraud or when there were errors apparent on the face of the award The learned Sub Judge further held that there was no error apparent on the face of the record and there was no allegation of corruption or fraud The questions involved in these appeals are how should the court examine an award to find out whether it was a speaking award or not and if it be a non speaking award how and to what extent the court could go to determine whether there was any error apparent on the face of the award to be liable for interference by the court The other question that arises in this case is to what extent can the court examine the contract in question though not incorpo rated or referred to in the award The arbitrator passed the awards dated th th and rd April which were filed before the Sub Judge and the appellant prayed for passing of decree in terms of the awards The respondents filed petitions seeking to set aside the awards <ORG> held that there was no merit in the contention regard ing limitation and that the claims under the award were not barred by limitation It was further held by the learned Trial Judge that the arbitrator had not incorporated in the award any material for his conclusion nor had he incorporat ed the terms of contract between the parties Under such circumstances the award could not be set aside especially when there was no error apparent on the face and that there was nothing to show that the arbitrator had mis conducted the proceedings or that the award had been improperly pro cured <ORG> by the impugned judgment dated set aside the awards and the decree of <ORG> on the ground that there were errors of law apparent on the face of the awards It was noted by the arbitrator that there was a prayer by the appellant for inspection of the site and the same was in spected on It was contended on behalf of the claimant that the site of work was situated on the Western Ghats far away from human habitation in dense forest infected with wild animals at an elevation of about and subject to heavy precipitation of upto cms Another important point on which considerable stress was laid was the compensation for losses occasioned to them on account of the unsatisfac tory law and order situation coupled with labour unrest stoppages and threats and even physical violence on the agents of the appellant Regarding interruptions in power supply the respondents case was that such interrup tions were not unexpected at a site to which the power lines passed through virgin reserve area and at any rate the claimants were not assured by the respondents of uninter rupted power and there was hardly any items of machinery belonging to the appellant which had remained idle for want of power It was further stated that the various extra items of works including the work on the quarries had been adequately paid for by them and no further payments were due to the appellant that there was no serious deterioration of the law and order situation and that the losses were due to the conduct of the claimant and the materials left over by the claimant at the end of the second working seasons that had been taken over by them duly accounted for and the credit thereof given in the final bill It was further reiterated by the respondent that the work was not completed within the period agreed and therefore the respondent issued notice to resume the work and on the failure of the claimant to re start the work there was no other alternative except to terminate the contract as the work itself was part of a time bound programme and they had to make alternate arrangements and that would have cost Rs lakhs additionally which was sought to be recovered from the appellant appropriating the retention money and security deposit There was another award dated th April which was with regard to the dispute that arose for controlling the work of Siruvani Drinking Water Supply Project Construct ing a Masonry dam across Siruvani River Block Nos I II and III from Ch to up to level metres and Block No III from ch to upto level metres Regarding the counter claims it was reiterated by the arbitrator that the respondents were entitled to arrange for the balance work in any manner they deemed fit on the termi nation of the contract by them There was a third award dated which was in respect of the sum due to Blocks Nos In respect of interruptions in power supply the case of the respondent was that such interruptions were not unexpected at a site through which the power lines passed through virgin reserve forest and that the claimants had not been assured by the respondents of uninterrupted power and in any case there was hardly any item of machinery belonging to the claimant which could have remained idle for want of power In respect of the medical facilities it was submitted by the respondents that according to the terms of the contract it was the primary duty of the appellant to provide for medical assistance to their work force Claim No An amount of rupees fifty thou sand only Rs shall be paid to the claimants in settlement of the final claims on the work in addition to the specified items as per this award About the counter claims it was also stated that the claimants would not be responsible to carry out the balance work which the respondents might arrange in any manner they thought fit on termination of the contract but it should not be at the risk of the claimants Upon these awards an application was made before <ORG> Judge <NAME> for passing decrees in terms of the award He further held that it was not necessary for the arbitrator to give reasons for his award and that there was no provision under the law which required that the arbitrator should furnish reasons for the award In the statement of defence filed by the respondents it was more or less conceded that the claim for extra works would lie and stated that the actuals should be accounted and paid along with the final bill The learned judge noted that the arbitrator could only give a lump sum award with respect to various claims and that he need not quantify the sum awarded under each claim separately It was contended before the learned Sub Judge that in respect of claim No there was no evidence to support the claim Therefore according to the learned judge it was not correct to say that there was no evidence at all for allowing claim No Further it was held that there was no jurisdiction to investigate into the merits of the case and to examine the documentary and oral evidence for the purpose of finding out whether or not the arbitrator had committed an error of law or fact Under such circumstances the award could not be set aside espe cially when there was no error apparent on the face of it and there was nothing to show that the arbitrator had mis conducted the proceedings or that the award had been improp erly procured Being aggrieved thereby the respondent preferred appeals before <ORG> Before <ORG> the main contention which succeeded was that there were errors apparent on the face of award and further that the arbitrator had misconducted himself and travelled beyond the terms of the contract On behalf of the appellant however it was contended that the award was a nonspeaking award and hence it was not open for the court to go into the correctness of the reasons of the award The submissions were made on behalf of the respondents It was held by the learned Sub Judge that the court could set aside an award only when it was the result of corruption fraud or there were errors apparent on the face of the award According to the learned Sub Judge there was no error apparent on the face of the award and there was no allegation of fraud It was contended before <ORG> on behalf of the respondents that there were errors apparent on the face of the award and that the arbitrator had misconducted himself and travelled beyond the terms of the contract The first contention urged on behalf of the respondents however was that the award was a non speaking award and there fore it was not open to the court to go into the correct ness or reasonableness of the award <ORG> held that when the arbitrator was constituted the sole and final judge of all questions both of law and of facts normally his decision should stand final and it was only when there was any error apparent on the face of the award either because a question of law arose on the face of the award or upon some paper accompanying or forming part of the award it could be interfered with Thereafter <ORG> in para of its judgment observed that in the light of several decisions it could say that there were any errors apparent on the face of the award and that the arbitrator had mis conducted himself and had travelled beyond his power In this connection reference was made by <ORG> to several decisions namely Attorney General for Manitoba <NAME> and <NAME> It was also argued that as per clause of Form No Notice inviting tender which formed part of the agree ment every tenderer was expected to inspect the site of the proposed work and quarries and satisfy himself about the quality and availability of materials <ORG> held that the award on this aspect was beyond the provisions of the agreement and therefore there were errors apparent on the face of the award Similarly in respect of the claim for Rs under claim No it was contended on behalf of the respondents that this was beyond the powers of the arbitrator and as such there were errors apparent on the face of the award Therefore in awarding the amount as the arbitrator did on this head there was error apparent on its face and such award was liable to be set aside With regard to claim No it was contended that the claim was beyond the powers of the arbitrator and reference was made to clause of the General Specification and Special Conditions which stated that the <ORG> was not responsible for supply of uninterrupted electric supply so any damage on that basis was also unwarranted Similarly in connection with claim No there was a claim for Rs towards expenses for providing a perma nent doctor It was held by <ORG> that it was the duty of the contractor to remove the sheds and materials brought by him and therefore the award allowing such claim was definitely against the provision of the contract Regarding claim No for an additional amount of Rs it was held that it was unsustainable and due to the misconduct of the arbitrator that it was awarded The first question therefore that arises for consideration in this case is whether the award in question was a speaking award or not An award can also be set aside if the arbitrator had misconducted himself or the proceedings or had proceeded beyond his jurisdiction These are separate and district grounds for challenging an award Where there are errors apparent on the face of the award it can only be set aside if in the award there is any proposition of law which is apparent on the face of the award namely in the award itself or any document incorporated in the award It was held that an award of arbitration can be set aside on the ground of error of law apparent on the face of the award only when in the award or in a document incorporated with it as for instance a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reasons for his decision there is found some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which is erroneous In that case the appellants had sold cotton to the respondents by a contract which contained a submission to arbitration of disputes as to quality and a further clause submitting to arbitration all other disputes arising out of the contract The appellants claimed damages for the rejec tion and upon that dispute being referred to arbitration under the further clause were awarded damages It was held by <ORG> that the award could not be set aside the terms of the contract were not so incorporated with the award as to entitle the <ORG> to refer to them as showing either that the award was wrong in law or that under them the contract and therefore the jurisdiction of the arbitrators were terminated The next question on this aspect which requires consid eration is that only in a speaking award the court can look into the reasoning of the award It is not open to the court to probe the mental process of the arbitrator and speculate where no reasons are given by the arbitrator as to what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at his conclusion Furthermore in any event reasonableness of the reasons given by the arbitrator cannot be challenged An arbitra tion award might be set aside on the ground of an error on the face of it when the reasons given for the decision either in the award or in any document incorporated with it are based upon a legal proposition which is erroneous supra this <ORG> reiterated that an award by an arbitrator is conclusive as a judgment between the parties and the court is entitled to set aside an award if the arbitrator has misconducted himself in the proceeding or when the award has been made after the issue of an order by the <ORG> superseding the arbitration or after arbitration proceedings have become invalid under section of the Arbitration Act or where an award has been improperly pro cured or is otherwise invalid under section of the Act An award may be set aside on the ground of error on the face of the award but an award is not invalid merely because by a process of inference and argument it may be demonstrated that the arbitrator has committed some mistake in arriving at his conclusion In that case the arbitrator in working out net profits for years took into account depreciation of immov able property For this reason he must be held to have exceeded his jurisdiction and it is not a question of his having merely interpreted the partnership agreement for himself as to which the Civil <ORG> could have had no say unless there was an error of law on the face of the award Therefore it appears to us that there are two different and distinct grounds involved in many of the cases One is the error apparent on the face of the award and the other is that the arbitrator exceeded his jurisdiction The appellant filed an application under section of the Arbitration Act challenging the validity of the award on the question Allowing the appeal it was held by this <ORG> that the appellant application for setting aside the award could succeed only if there was any error of law on the face of the award There it was found that the umpire had made a speaking award and there was no question of the construction of any document incorporated in or appended to the award If it was transparent from the award that a legal proposition which forms its basis is erroneous the award is liable to be set aside An award may be remitted or set aside on the ground that the arbitrator in making it had exceeded his jurisdiction and evidence of matters not appearing on the face of it will be admitted in order to establish whether the jurisdiction had been exceeded or not because the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside award whatever might be said about it in the award or by the arbitrator This in our opinion the court had no jurisdiction to do namely substitution of its own evalua tion of the conclusion of law or fact to come to the conclu sion that the arbitrator had acted contrary to the bargain between the parties It has to be determined that there is a distinction between disputes as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that jurisdiction should be exercised Our attention was also drawn to the said decision by the counsel for the respondents that if an arbitrator or the umpire travels beyond his jurisdiction and arrogates jurisdiction that does not vest in him that would be a ground to impeach the award It may be mentioned that in so far as the decision given that it was possible for the court to construe the terms of the contract to come to a conclusion whether an award made by the arbitrator was possible to be made or not in our opinion this is not a correct proposi tion in law and the several decisions relied by the learned Judge in support of that proposition do not support this proposition Once there is no dispute as to the contract what is the interpretation of that contract is a matter for the arbitrator and on which court cannot substitute its own decision It was held that under the words all loss there was jurisdiction to award to the plaintiff not only sums actually expended but also a sum estimated as being necessary to make good the defects and that extrinsic evidence was not admissible to show that the sum allowed to the defendants as set off had been reduced in respect of defective work for which they had also been debited The judgment and order of <ORG> are set aside and the orders of the learned Sub Judge are restored In the facts and the circum stances of the case however the parties will bear their own costs
