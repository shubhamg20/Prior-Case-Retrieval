DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> NATWARLAL BENCH <NAME> NATWARLAL DAS SUDHI RANJAN SINHA BHUVNESHWAR CITATION AIR SCR ACT Indian Companies Act Act VII of as amended by Act XXII of The words or any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties of the Company added in the section Whether legislature intended to make alteration in the low as respects sales effected by secured creditor Secured creditor Whether outside the winding up Construction Presumption against implied alteration of law HEADNOTE The secured creditor is outside the winding up and can realism his security without the leave of the winding up <ORG> though if he files a suit or takes other legal proceedings for the realisation of his security he is bound under of the Indian Companies Act to obtain the leave of the winding up <ORG> before he can do so although such leave would almost automatically be granted Held therefore that having regard to the context in which the words any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties added in by the amending Act XXII of have been used in juxtaposition with any attachment distress or execution put into force without leave of the <ORG> against the estate or effects it would be a legitimate construction to be put upon them that they refer only to sales held through the intervention of the <ORG> and not to sales effected by the secured creditor outside the winding up and without the intervention of the <ORG> and that the amendment was not intended to bring within the sweep of the general words sales effected by the secured creditor outside the winding up The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI This appeal with a certificate under article of the Constitution is directed against the judgment of <ORG> at Madras dismissing the appeal of the Appellants and refusing to set aside a sale effected by Respondent of certain properties belonging to <ORG> hereinafter called the <ORG> above the ground at Vepery Madras and Mylapore including the machinery cars etc The <ORG> was incorporated in England with its principal office situated at No Rundalls Road Vepery Madras and was running <ORG> in Madras with licence issued to it by the <ORG> under the Tramways Act He took possession as such Receiver from the midnight of th April of all the assets of the <ORG> including moneys in the bank to the credit of the <ORG> and after that date <ORG> was suspended and still remains suspended One <NAME> one of the Directors of the Company filed No of as the duly constituted Attorney of the Company for winding up the Company on the ground that it was unable to pay its debts and that it bad ceased to carry on its business During the pendency of the said suits Respondent gave an undertaking in Application No of in Civil Suit No of that he would not without the orders of <ORG> dispose of any of the assets of the <ORG> which were in his possession till the disposal of the suit No of This application was based on a report of the Official Receiver in which after setting out the relevant facts he submitted that even though under section of the Indian Companies Act the Company which was admittedly insolvent was governed by rules prevailing with regard to the respective rights of the secured and unsecured creditors and to debts provable and valuation of annuities governing the administration in insolvency and secured creditors generally stood outside the liquidation and were entitled to have the remedy of realising the security and proving before him for the deficiency if the properties of the Company could be sold for a price higher than the amount due to the Trustees of the debenture holders there was a possibility of a surplus coming into his bands for the benefit of the unsecured creditors If the Respondent proved before him for any deficiency due to the secured creditors it would certainly affect the rights of unsecured creditors and moreover though the secured creditors might realise the security it will be in the interests of the unsecured creditors to see that a fair and proper price was obtained Respondent filed an affidavit in reply in August contending inter alia that the offer by the Respondent was the highest that he had received and that this had been accepted bona fide that in the advertisement the condition as to the previous sanction of the <ORG> was inserted because of the undertaking that be had given to the <ORG> in No of and that this undertaking lapsed with the dismissal of the said suit on the th March that he had been advised by the Solicitors in England for the debenture trustees that it was unnecessary for him to obtain the sanction of the <ORG> and that he had been instructed not to apply for such sanction and that the sale was bona fide and he had secured as good a price as could be obtained This appeal also was dismissed by <ORG> with costs on the th September <ORG> differed from the finding of <ORG> and held that due publicity had not been given to the intended sale and observed that if the matter rested merely on a decision of that point they would have allowed the appeal and set aside the sale <ORG> further held that a secured creditor had a right to realise his security without seeking the assistance of the court and remaining outside the winding up The bona fides of the Respondent in the matter of the sale were not challenged either in the <ORG>s below or before us and there were concurrent findings of fact that the price obtained by Respondent was the best price available under the circumstances It was however urged by the learned Solicitor General for the Appellants I that <ORG> having found that due publicity had not been given to the intended sale ought not to have allowed the Respondent at that stage to raise the question as to whether the <ORG> had any power or jurisdiction to set aside the sale except on the ground that it was vitiated by fraud or for want of bona fides and that the sale by Respondent being a sale held without leave of the winding up <ORG> was void under section of the Indian Companies Act The High <ORG> bad allowed the Respondent to raise the question even at that late stage inasmuch as it was a pure question of law and the learned Solicitor General therefore rightly did not press the first contention before us The decision of this question turns upon the true construction of section of the Indian Companies Act which runs as under I Where any company is being wound up by or subject to the supervision of the <ORG> any attachment distress or execution put in force without leave of the <ORG> against the estate or effects or any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties of the company after the commencement of the winding up shall be void Nothing in this section applies to proceedings by the Government It may be noted that the words or any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties underlined above were inserted by Act XXII of section When a winding up order has been made or a provisional liquidator has been appointed no suit or other legal proceeding shall be proceeded with or commenced against the company except by leave of the <ORG> and subject to such terms as the <ORG> may impose and Section In the winding up of an insolvent company the same rules shall prevail and be observed with regard to the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors and to debts provable and to the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities as are in force for the time being under the law of insolvency with respect to the estates of persons adjudged insolvent and all persons who in any such case would be entitled to prove for and receive dividends out of the assets of the company may come in under the winding up and make such claims against the company as they respectively are entitled to by virtue of this section which correspond respectively to sections and of the English Companies Act of The secured creditor is thus outside the winding up and can realise his security without the leave of the winding up <ORG> though if he files a suit or takes other legal proceedings for the realisation of his security he is bound under section corresponding with section of the Indian Companies Act to obtain the leave of the winding up <ORG> before he can do so although such leave would almost automatically be granted The corresponding provisions of the Indian Companies Act have been almost bodily incorporated from those of the English Companies Act and if there was nothing more the position of the secured creditor here also would be the same as that obtaining in England and he would also be outside the winding up and a sale by him without the intervention of the <ORG> would be valid and could not be challenged as void under section of the Indian Companies Act It was however urged that the addition of the words or any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties had changed the position of the secured creditor and even though the secured creditor realised the security without the intervention of the <ORG> such sale if effected by him without the leave of the winding up <ORG> was void It was pointed out that these words did not find their place in the corresponding section of the English Companies Act and therefore even though any attachment distress or execution put in force without leave of the <ORG> against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up was void under the terms of the section as it originally stood the words or any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties of the company were wide enough to include not only a sale held through the intervention of the <ORG> but also a sale effected by the secured creditor without the intervention of the <ORG> whether the sale was by private treaty or by public auction It was contended on the other hand on behalf of the contesting Respondent Respondent that the amendment was made in order to get over the decision of the Allahabad High <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> and that in any event on a true construction of section as amended the words any sale held had reference in the context only to sales held by or effected through the intervention of the <ORG> and not sales effected by the secured creditor without the intervention of the <ORG> There was an earlier decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> in which a contrary decision had been reached exactly under similar circumstances The amendment of section inserted by Act XXII of was designed to prevent such sales as were upheld by the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> and it would be permissible to refer to that portion of the statement of objects and reasons for the purpose of ascertaining the extent and urgency of the evil which was sought to be remedied by introducing the amendment <NAME> amendment could not have been intended to bring within the sweep of the general words or any sale held without the leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties sales effected by the secured creditor outside the winding up Prior to the amendment the law was well settled both in England and in India that the secured creditor was outside the winding up and he could realise his security without the intervention of the <ORG> by effecting a sale of the mortgaged premises by private treaty or by public auction It was only when the intervention of the <ORG> was sought either by putting in force any attachment distress or execution within the meaning of section as it stood before the amendment or proceeding with or commencing a suit or other legal proceedings against the company within the meaning of section that leave of the <ORG> was necessary and if no such leave was obtained the remedy could not be availed of by the secured creditor The sale of the mortgaged premises was also brought by the amendment on a par with the attachment distress or execution put in force at the instance of the secured creditor and having regard to the context such sale could only be construed to be a sale held through the intervention of the <ORG> and not one effected by the secured creditor outside the winding up and without the intervention of the <ORG> Having regard therefore to the context in which these words any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties have been used in juxtaposition with any attachment distress or execution put into force without leave of the <ORG> against the estate or effects it would be a legitimate construction to be put upon them that they refer only to sales held through the intervention of the <ORG> and not to sales effected by the secured creditor outside the winding up and without the intervention of the <ORG> There is also a presumption against implicit alteration of law and that is enunciated by <NAME> on Interpretation of Statutes th Edition at page in the following terms One of these presumptions is that the legislature does not intend to make any substantial alteration in the law beyond what it explicitly declares either in express terms or by clear implication or in other words beyond the immediate scope and object of the statute If the construction sought to be put upon the words or any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties by the Appellants were accepted it would effect a fundamental alteration in the law as it stood before the amendment was inserted in section by Act XXII of Whereas before the amendment the secured creditor stood outside the winding up and could if the mortgage deed so provided realise his security without the intervention of the <ORG> by effecting a sale either by private treaty or by public auction no such sale could be effected by him after the amendment and that was certainly a fundamental alteration in the law which could not be effected unless one found words used which pointed unmistakably to that conclusion or unless such intention was expressed with irresistible clearness Such a great and sudden change of policy could not be attributed to the <ORG> and it would be legitimate therefore to adopt the narrower interpretation of those words of the amendment rather than an interpretation which would have the contrary effect put into force without the leave of the <ORG> against the estate and effects of the company and also of any sale held without the leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties of the company after the commencement of the winding up Section also has reference to legal proceedings in much the same way as legal proceedings envisaged by section of the Act and the attachment distress or execution put in force or the sale held are all of them legal proceedings which can only be resorted to through the intervention of the <ORG> The word held in connection with the sales contemplated within the terms of the amended section also lends support to this conclusion and this conclusion is further fortified by the terms of section which says that nothing in this section applies to proceedings by the <ORG> thus in effect indicating that what are referred to in section are proceedings within the meaning of that term as used in section of the Act In particular we would refer to section The position was rightly summed up by <ORG> as under We thus reach the position that no leave of Court was needed before the Receiver appointed by the mortgagee debenture holders exercised the power of sale and that as there is no allegation of want of bona fides or recklessness or fraud against the Receiver in exercising such a power it would follow that the sale held by the Receiver is valid and effectual to convey title to the purchaser and that such a sale cannot be avoided on the ground either of want of due notice given by the Receiver before effecting the sale or on the ground of undervalue
