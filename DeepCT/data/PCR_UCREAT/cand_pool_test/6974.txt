The suit out of which this appeal arises was brought by the plaintiffs appellants against the defendant <NAME> described as the ojha or high priest of the temple of Baidyanath for the recovery of the sum of Rs The Court below has held that the charao or offerings are debutter property and cannot be charged with liability for the plaintiff claim that the ekrar executed by the defendant is not binding on his successors in office but that the defendant is personally liable under it that no part of the claim is barred by limitation and that interest is claimable for the last three years before suit and it has accordingly given the plaintiffs a decree against the defendant personally for the greater portion of the claim disallowing only interest in part Against that decree the plaintiffs have preferred this appeal and the defendant has filed a cross appeal valued at Rs And in the cross appeal it is contended First that a part of the claim was barred by limitation Secondly that there was no personal covenant to pay nor any valid and legal consideration for the ekrar and that no personal decree ought to have been made against the defendant and Thirdly that the claim for interest ought to have been disallowed altogether He further urged that the cross appeal could not be heard unless the respondent paid the fee payable on the amount at which it was valued as required by Section of the <ORG> Fees Act On the other hand it was argued for the respondent that as the declaratory decree asked for by the appellants would not amount to a mere declaration but must necessarily carry with it some consequential relief the fee payable on the appeal was the ad valorem fee on the amount decreed as required by Article of Schedule I of the Act and if that was paid no additional fee would be payable by the respondent under Section For the learned Judges say The defendants appealed against so much of the decree as declared the liability of their property and in order to be released from the decree the suit was brought by a judgment creditor to establish the right of his judgment debtor to certain property and the liability of that property to attachment in execution of his decree after the property had been released from attachment on the claim of a third party and a Full Bench of <ORG> held that the proper stamp on the plaint was Rs We shall now proceed to the determination of the appeal and the cross appeal taking the appeal first and then the cross appeal and we shall consider the grounds urged in each in the order in which they have been stated above The first contention of the appellants namely that the <ORG> below ought to have declared that the amount decreed was realisable by the attachment of the charao or offerings involves some of the most important questions raised and discussed in the argument In dealing with the first ground of appeal therefore we may confine our attention to the two questions whether by the general Hindu law the surplus of the offerings belongs to the high priest and whether by the special custom of the shrine they belong to him or are chargeable by him with the maintenance of members of his family I meagre in its provisions relating to religious endowments a fact which may perhaps be accounted for on the supposition that the high reputation for piety and purity of character justly enjoyed for the most part by the priestly classes of ancient India who had the management of the shrines was deemed a sufficient safeguard against breach of duty so as to render detailed rules of law to regulate their conduct unnecessary In the later Commentaries and Digest there are it is true whole chapters devoted to religious gifts and endowments see for instance Hemadri Chaturvarga Chintamani Danakhanda and Raghunandana Digest Matha Pratishtha Tattwa but they relate mostly to matters of ritual and to the spiritual merit of different sorts of gifts There is one passage in the last mentioned work namely a text quoted from the Matsya Sukta which has some bearing on the present question and which runs thus Having made offerings to a god the sacrificial fee also should be given to the god If it were necessary to give reasons in favour of a view so amply supported by authority we should add that the opinion of <NAME> goes merely to show that an idol can be the owner of property only in a figurative sense possession being held by a manager or trustee and that dedication of property to an idol is only a mode of creating a trust for religious purposes in perpetuity which is allowed by law see <NAME> <NAME> Moore I A We are therefore clearly of opinion that there is nothing in the general Hindu law to support the appellants contention It is admitted by the plaintiff <NAME> in his deposition and it could not very well have been denied upon the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs themselves see <ORG> letter of Ex The only evidence adduced to show that the temple was either built by some ancestor of the ojhas or was made over to him by the king of Gidhaur consists of the Assistant Commissioner Report of Ex But considering the whole of the evidence adduced on the point and all the circumstances connected with it we do not think there are sufficient materials upon which it can be safely affirmed that the temple as distinguished from the portico was either built by some ancestor of the ojhas or was made over to him by some one who had built it But though that may account for the right to the managership of the temple being vested in the family of the present ojha it can afford no safe basis for any inference that the offerings made to the shrine which has been in existence as a place of public worship from before became the private property of the priest It is argued for the appellants that the mode in which the offerings have all along been appropriated by the ojha proves that they belong to him On the other side it is contended that such appropriation even if established will only show abuse of trust on the part of the ojha but instances of former abuse of trust cannot be pleaded against a trustee who is now seeking to prevent a repetition of abuse and the case of <NAME> <NAME> Moore I A is cited in support of this contention This passage of the judgment clearly shows that the present question did not properly arise in the former suit and what was said with reference to it may therefore be treated as an obiter dictum There are two important facts proved in the case which make the correctness of the view we take clear beyond doubt The consideration of the second ground need not detain us long It is true that the defendant denies this in his written statement but the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs see the deposition of the plaintiff <NAME> and of their witness <NAME> shows that the office is not a strictly hereditary one The plaintiffs cannot therefore have any right to recover the money decreed from the defendant successors in office A former abuse of trust such as is shown by the stipulation in the ekrar charging the offerings with the allowance to the plaintiffs cannot be set up against a party who seeks to prevent repetition of such abuse in future The grounds urged before us therefore all fail and the appeal must consequently be dismissed with costs If it were otherwise and if these words were taken literally it would lead to this anomalous result that a Hindu servant of a Christian or a Mahomedan to whom his master may have granted maintenance by a deed in consideration of his past services would be entitled to twelve years limitation in respect of his claim while a servant of the master own nationality and creed would be entitled only to six years or three years in respect of a similar claim according as the deed in his favour was or was not registered As a further reason for his decision that no pact of the claim is barred the learned Subordinate Judge adds that the plaintiffs have the right to appropriate the payment in satisfaction of the earlier arrears that they have in fact made such appropriation in the account annexed to the plaint and that even if they have not done so the <ORG> can allow such appropriation to be made now It is a running account in which every year the amount due at the end of the last preceding year is added to the amount due for the year and the payment made during the year is deducted from the same without any specification as to whether the payment is deducted from the former amount or the latter and the payment cannot now be applied under Section of that Act to the discharge of earlier arrears which are now barred by limitation With reference to the second ground of cross appeal it is argued in the first place that as the <ORG> in question contains no personal covenant to pay but only creates a charge on the offerings which is invalid no personal decree ought to have been made and in support of this argument the case of <NAME> <NAME> I Cal It is next contended that even if there was a personal contract it cannot be enforced as there was no valid and legal consideration for the contract We are of opinion that the admission of the defendant should be taken in its entirety and that it is open to the defendant to contest his liability for any sum in excess of that admitted to be due upon any ground that he may think fit to urge provided no new case is made in appeal and the other side is not taken by surprise We shall therefore examine the argument advanced In support of the second branch of the argument the preamble of the <ORG> is relied upon and it is urged that upon the death of <NAME> the last ojha either the defendant was entitled to the office in which case the plaintiffs gave up nothing and so there was no consideration for the <ORG> or he was not and one of the plaintiffs was in which case it was a sale of the office or a bargaining for it and the consideration was illegal such sale of or bargaining for a public office like that of the high priest of a public shrine being opposed to public policy no doubt recites that both the plaintiffs and the defendant tried to obtain the post of the high priest on the death of <NAME> and that this dispute concerning the succession was settled by that document it also recites that <NAME> had by an ekrar dated the th Baisakh granted to the plaintiffs and their heirs in succession an annuity of Rs while affirming the invalidity of an alienation of the office of sebait to a stranger upholds an alienation made in favour of a member of the founder family standing in the line of succession and to the same effect is the case of <NAME> Sitaram Ganesh Bom The agreement before us obviously does not infringe this second principle as there was no sale of the office of <ORG> here As far as the first mentioned principle goes that can hold good only in those cases in which the office is of such a nature that no one has more claim to it than what his personal fitness gives him and no one has any right to question in <ORG> the correctness of the decision of the person or persons in whose gift the office is When however as in the case before us the only persons who can have any claim to the office are members of a family group and the nature of the office is such that claims to it must be ultimately determined by the decision of <ORG> and bond fide claimants to the office compromise their claims by an agreement for a pecuniary consideration the propriety of the agreement has to be judged of not merely with reference to the above mentioned principles but with reference to various other considerations besides In fact conflicting considerations arise in such cases It remains only to consider the last ground of cross appeal namely that relating to the claim for interest The claim is one for a certain sum payable by virtue of a written instrument at a time certain that is at the end of each Bengali year within the meaning of Act XXXII of and the rate at which interest has been awarded namely per cent per annum may fairly be regarded as not exceeding the current rate that being the rate allowed by the <ORG> in certain oases Act VIII of Section The result then is that the appeal is dismissed with costs and the cross appeal allowed with proportionate costs in both <ORG>s to this extent namely that the sum of Rs being the portion of the amount decreed that is barred by limitation shall be deducted from that amount and the appellants are entitled to costs in this cross appeal in proportion to the amount disallowed but the order made in the cross appeal will be subject to the condition that the respondent shall pay within one month from this date the additional <ORG> fee payable on the memorandum of cross appeal under Section of the <ORG> Fees Act that is the sum of Rs
