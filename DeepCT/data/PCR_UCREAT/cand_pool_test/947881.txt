The <ORG> found that the bus was driven at an excessive speed and there was negligence on the part of the driver and that the appellants were liable for the same The questions for consideration were whether the accident was due to any negligence on the part of the driver whether the courts below were right in awarding compensation under of the Act for pecuniary loss sustained by the widow and the sons of the deceased and whether the sum awarded as damages under of the Act for loss of expectation of life should go towards the reduction of the compensation awarded for pecuniary loss sustained under of the Act as otherwise it would be duplication of damages in respect of the same wrong Held that where on the basis of the evidence and on broad probabilities it is found that the speed at which the bus was driven was excessive having regard to the nature of the ground on which the accident happened there is a presumption that the accident was caused by the negligence of the driver If a person taking benefit under both the sections was the same he cannot be permitted to recover twice over for the same loss in the instant case under of the Act the sum of com pensation was arrived at by taking into consideration inter alia the reasonable provision the deceased if alive would have made for his widow and sons Under the figure for damages awarded for the loss to the estate represents the damages for the mental agony suffering and loss of expectation of life thus there was no duplication in awarding damages under both the heads The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by certificate is directed against the judgment of <ORG> dated January modifying the decree of <ORG> <NAME> in No of a suit filed by the respondents for compensation under the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act XIII of The appellant <ORG> hereinafter called the <ORG> was engaged in the business of transporting passengers by bus between Dharapuram and Palni among other places in the State of Madras <NAME> died of the injuries received in the accident on September They alleged in the plaint that the driver who was in charge of the bus was incompetent and inexperienced that he was guilty of rash and negligent conduct in the driving of the bus and that the accident was the result of his incompetence and negligence The learned Subordinate Judge came to the conclusion that there was no proof that the bus was driven at a reckless speed at the scene of the accident but the fact that the accident occurred on the off side of the road was itself evidence of his negligence and it had not been rebutted by the defendants Against the said decree the defendants preferred an appeal to <ORG> and it came to be disposed of by a division bench of that court <ORG> on a review of the entire evidence held that the speed at which the bus was driven was excessive having regard to the nature of the ground on which the accident happened that there was negligence on the part of the driver and that the appellants were liable therefore On the question of damages <ORG> confirmed the amount of compensation awarded to the plaintiffs to both under ss and of the Act but in regard to the first plaintiff it reduced the compensation awarded to him from Rs with this modification the appeal was dismissed with costs Learned counsel for the appellants raised before us the following points The finding of <ORG> that the bus was driven at an excessive speed at the place where the accident occurred based on probabilities was erroneous A clear picture of the topography and the physical condition of the locality where the accident took place would to a large extent help us in deciding the said question The accident took place at Puliampatti where the road passed over a culvert and then took a sharp bend with a downward gradient On the basis of such a calculation it was contended that the speed would have been less than miles per hour but it is not possible to deduce the speed from such a calculation as the witnesses were speaking of the time only approximately and not with reference to any watch It must therefore be held that there was negligence on the part of the driver Apart from the positive evidence in the present case the accident took place not on the main road but on the off side uprooting the stone at the drain and attacking a tamarind tree feet away from the said stone with such a velocity that its bark was peeled off and the bus could stop only after travelling some more distance from the said tree The said facts give rise to a presumption that the accident was caused by the negligence of the driver <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> neatly summarizes the principles applicable as to onus of proof in the following short propositions i If the defendants omnibus leaves the road and falls down an embankment and this without more is proved then the res ipsa loquitur there is a presumption that the event is caused by negligence on the part of the defendants and the plaintiff succeeds unless the defendants can rebut this pre sumption at para thus An exception to the general rule that the burden of proof of the alleged negligence is in the first instance on the plaintiff occurs wherever the facts already established are such that the proper and natural inference immediately arising from them is that the injury complained of was caused by the defendant negligence or where the event charged as negligence tells its own story of negligence on the part of the defendant the story so told being clear and unambiguous Where therefore there is a duty on the defendant to exercise care and the circumstances in which the injury complained of happened are such that with the exercise of the requisite care no risk would in the ordinary course of events ensue the burden is in the first instance on the defendant to disprove his liability The said principles directly apply to the present case Here the events happened tell their own story and there is a presumption that the accident was caused by negligence on the part of the appellants Every such action or suit shall be for the benefit of the wife husband parent and child if any of the person whose death shall have been so caused and shall be brought by and in the name of the executor administrator or representative of the person deceased and in every such action the <ORG> may give such damages as it may think proportioned to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought and the amount so recovered after deducing all costs and expenses including the costs not recovered from the Defendant shall be divided amongst the before mentioned parties or any of them in such shares as the <ORG> by its judgment or decree shall direct There Lord <NAME> of Killowen stated the general rule at thus The general rule which has always prevailed in regard to the assessment of damages under the Fatal Accidents Act is well settled namely that any benefit accruing to a dependent by reason of the relevant death must be taken into account <NAME> wife dying earlier if the husband had lived the full span of life and it should also be taken into account that there is the possibility of the widow remarrying much to the improvement of her financial position Both the courts below found on the evidence the following facts The family owned a building worth Rs It was engaged in the business of manufacturing Indian patent medicines from drugs and had been running <ORG> at <ORG> for a period of years and had also branches in Colombo and Madras The last contention raises an interesting point It was contended that this amount should go in reduction of Rs The second proviso to of the Act reads Provided that in any such action or suit the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for and recover any pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act neglect or default which sum when recovered shall be deemed part of the assets of the estate of the deceased While under damages are recoverable for the benefit of the persons mentioned therein under compensation goes to the benefit of the estate whereas under damages are payable in respect of loss sustained by the persons mentioned therein under damages can be claimed inter alia for loss of expectation of life Prima facie as the two claims are to be based upon different causes of action the claimants whether the same or different would be entitled to recover compensation separately under both the heads Though in that case it was held that the father was entitled under both the Acts Lord <NAME> made the following observations which are appropriate to the present case I should add that I see no difficulty as to the alleged duplication of damages under the Act of and the Fatal Accidents Act If those who benefit under the last mentioned Acts also benefit under the will or intestacy of the deceased personally the damages under those Acts will be affected It was held that as the husband was the claimant under both the Acts credit should be given in assessing the damages under the Fatal Accidents Act for what was given to him under the Law Reform Act So too in <NAME> <NAME> where the parents of an infant who had been negligently killed in an accident claimed damages under both the Acts <NAME> reaffirmed the view that where the parties who would benefit from the damages awarded under the Fatal Accidents Act were the same as those who would benefit from the damages awarded under the Law Reform Act the damages under the Fatal Accidents Act must be reduced by the amount given as loss under the Law Reform Act But inasmuch as the basis of both causes of action may be the same namely negligence of a third party which has caused the deceased death it was natural to provide that the rights of action should be without prejudice the one to the other Conversely if they got compensation under representing the amount that the deceased would have spent on them if alive to that extent there should be deduction in their claim under of the Act in respect of compensation for the loss caused to the estate If a person taking benefit under both the sections is the same he cannot be permitted to recover twice over for the same loss courts gave compensation to plaintiffs to in a sum of Rs This sum was arrived at by taking into consideration inter alia the reasonable provision the deceased if alive would have made for them Under both the courts awarded damages for the loss to the estate in a sum of Rs That figure represents the damages for the mental agony suffering and loss of expectation of life There was no duplication in awarding damages under both the heads
