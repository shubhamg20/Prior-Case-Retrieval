The suit was therefore dismissed on that ground Subsequent cases have made it clear that the widow of a gotraja sapinda takes the property in her own right as an heir and not only as representing her husband On <ORG> death therefore <NAME> would inherit it not as the property of her husband <NAME> but as the property of her husband nephew <ORG> and the question is whether the bar which applies to the case of a widow inheriting her husband property could also be extended to a case where the widow inherits the property not belonging to her husband but belonging to her husband nephew It has been contended by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the plaintiff appellant that the bar should be held as also applicable to the case of a widow inheriting property as the widow of a gotraja sapinda because she inherits it from her husband family and that too only in our <ORG> by reason of usage In the recent Hindu Women Rights to Property Act XVIII of the bar of unchastity seems to have been removed even with regard to the widow inheriting her husband property because it says that its provisions shall apply notwithstanding any rule of Hindu law or custom to the contrary and as observed in Mayne Hindu Law th edn at as the Act confers upon the widow a right of succession notwithstanding any rule of Hindu law an unchaste widow will not be disqualified from inheritance The result is that the bar of unchastity has now been removed even in the case of a widow inheriting her husband property and it would indeed be incongruous to hold that it applies to the case of a widow inheriting the property of any person other than her husband when she can now inherit her husband property in spite of her unchastity The position therefore is that there is no authority for the proposition that any widow inheriting any kind of property must be chaste that the bar was confined to only one particular case namely the widow inheriting her husband property and even that bar is now removed by legislation The decision of the lower appellate Court is therefore correct and the appeal is dismissed with costs
