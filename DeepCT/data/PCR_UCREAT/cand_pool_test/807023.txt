The appellants filed two separate appeals before <ORG> of Patna which dismissed the appeals and affirmed the convictions as also the sentences passed against the appellants As however both the appeals arise out of the same judgment we propose to decide these appeals by one judgment <NAME> is said to have assaulted <NAME> Singh with a bhala in his abdomen and when he fell down he was assaulted with lathis by <NAME> and <NAME> The defence of <NAME> and <NAME> was that the two deceased persons and <NAME> had trespassed into their plantain orchard and were cutting away a number of plants and leaves and when <NAME> protested he was assaulted by <NAME> and others and thereafter in the mutual fight the two deceased were assaulted in exercise by the accused and others who had assembled nearby Thus a very significant factor which we find in this case is that there are two groups of accused who are totally unrelated to one another In view of the peculiar feature of this case we have to approach the evidence of the eye witnesses with very great caution because they would undoubtedly be interested in implicating the group of the accused headed by <NAME> We have it from the evidence of PW No independent witness had been examined by the prosecution to support the assault In fact PW <NAME> has admitted that when he reached the place of occurrence he found to persons of the village and yet none of them have been examined to corroborate the evidence of the interested or inimical witnesses examined by the prosecution to clearly shows that they gave graphic description of the assault with regard to the order the manner and the parts of the body with absolute consistency which gives an impression that they have given a parrot like version acting under a conspiracy to depose to one set of facts and one set of facts only It was strongly contended by counsel for the appellants that PWs The most important fact which reinforces this conclusion is that the accused headed by <NAME> had absolutely no motive no reason and no concern with the deceased or their relations and there was absolutely no earthly reason why they should have made a common cause with <NAME> and <NAME> over what was a purely domestic matter between <NAME> and his cousins There are other infirmities in the prosecution case also which throw a serious doubt on the prosecution case Dr Jaiswal who had examined <NAME> deceased and had conducted the postmortem of the deceased had also examined the accused <NAME> whom he identified in the Court on April Having regard to the circumstances of the case there can be no doubt that <NAME> must have received these injuries in the course of the assault because it has not been suggested or contended that the injuries could be self inflicted nor it is believable It is well settled that fouler the crime higher the proof and hence in a murder case where one of the accused is proved to have sustained injuries in the course of the same occurrence the non explanation of such injuries by the prosecution is a manifest defect in the prosecution case and shows that the origin and genesis of the occurrence had been deliberately suppressed which leads to the irresistible conclusion that the prosecution has not come out with a true version of the occurrence Under these circumstances the prosecution had a duty to explain those injuries In our judgment the failure of the prosecution to offer any explanation in that regard shows that evidence of the prosecution witnesses relating to the incident is not true or at any rate not wholly true Further those injuries probabilise the plea taken by the appellants This <ORG> clearly pointed out that where the prosecution fails to explain the injuries on the accused two results follow that the evidence of the prosecution witnesses is untrue and that the injuries probabilise the plea taken by the appellants <ORG> in the pre sent case has not correctly applied the principles laid down by this <ORG> in the decision referred to above In <NAME> <ORG> decided on April which was also a murder case this <ORG> while following an earlier case observed as follows In State of Gujarat <NAME> Criminal Appeal No of decided on March one of us <NAME> <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed as follows In a situation like this when the prosecution fails to explain the in juries on the person of an accused depending on the facts of each case any of the three results may follow That the accused had inflicted the injuries on the members of the prosecution party in exercise of the right of self defence It seems to us that in a murder case the non explanation of the injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of the occurrence or in the course of altercation is a very important circumstance from which the Court can draw the following inferences That the prosecution has sup pressed the genesis and the origin of the occurrence and has thus not presented the true version that the witnesses who have denied the presence of the injuries on the person of the accused are lying on a most material point and therefore their evidence is unreliable that in case there is a defence version which explains the injuries on the person of the accused it is rendered probable so as to throw doubt on the prosecution case The omission on the part of the prosecution to explain the injuries on the person of the accused assumes much greater importance where the evidence consists of interested or inimical witnesses or where the defence gives a version which competes in probability with that of the prosedition one We must hasten to add that as held by this <ORG> in State of Gujarat Bai Fatima Criminal Appeal No of decided on March Reported in there may be cases where the non explanation of the injuries by the prosecution may not affect the prosecution case This principle would obviously apply to cases where the injuries sustained by the accused are minor and superficial or where the evidence is so clear and cogent so independent and disinterested so probable consistent and credit worthy that it far outweighs the effect of the omission on the part of the prosecution to explain the injuries As the appellant <NAME> had a grievous injury it cannot be said that the accused had no right off private defence It is well settled that it is not necessary for the defence to prove its case with the same rigour as the prosecution is required to prove its case and it is sufficient if the defence succeeds in throwing a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case which is sufficient to enable the <ORG> to reject the prosecution version There is yet another important circumstance which completely falsifies the evidence of the eye witnesses Yet the medical evidence of Dr <NAME> shows that there was only one solitary injury on the person of the deceased <NAME> and that was on the abdomen If this matter is false there is no guarantee that the other assault deposed to by the eyewitnesses was also not false Similarly so far as deceased <NAME> is concerned the evidence of the witnesses shows that he had received to lathi blows at the hands of his assailants but the medical evidence of Dr <NAME> shows that he had one lacerated wound on the scalp a swelling and three scratches There is no evidence to show that there was bad blood between <NAME> and <NAME> on the one hand and their cousins <NAME> and <NAME> on the other It is difficult to believe that even if <NAME> and <NAME> would raise any objection they would do so on the day on which Chauthari ceremony of the marriage of <NAME> was held It was however contended by the <ORG> that there was no reason to disbelieve the evidence with respect to <NAME> and <NAME> even if the other five appellants be acquitted Thus in view of the inherent improbabilities the serious omissions and infirmities the Intrrested or inimical nature of the evidence and other circumstances point ed out by us we are clearly of the I opinion that the prosecution has miserably failed to prove the case against the appellants beyond reasonable doubt In fact <ORG> has hardly made any real attempt to analyse or discuss the evidence and has merely affirmed the finding of the Sessions Judge by narrating the evidence relied upon by it For these reasons therefore we think there are special circumstances in the present case which have compel led us to interfere in this appeal by special leave The appeals are accordingly allowed the convictions and sentences passed on the appellants are set aside and all the appellants are acquitted of the charges framed against them
