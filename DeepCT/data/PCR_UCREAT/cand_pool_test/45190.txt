As stated in the preamble of the Act itself the relations of a person whose death was caused by the wrongful act of another were not prior to its enactment entitled to claim compensation on account of the death The right to claim compensation in respect of such a death was created by the Act That the word is not equivalent to heirs seems clear from the fact that in Act XII of which was passed on the same day as Act XIII and which deals with a cognate subject the right is given to bring a Suit against heirs or representatives of the deceased wrong doer Nor do we think that there is any reason for limiting the meaning of representative in the narrow way suggested by the Advocate General These persons are the representatives of the deceased in the sense that they are the persons taking the place of the deceased in obtaining reparation for the wrong done In cases where the deceased is represented by an executor or an administrator such an executor or administrator is given the power to sue for the compensation for the benefit of the specified relations Where there is no executor or administrator or where there is one and he fails or is unwilling to sue then in our opinion the suit may be instituted by and in the name of the representative of the person deceased But one suit only is allowed to enforce the claims of all the persons beneficially entitled it being provided that the rights of each and every one of them shall be adjudged and adjusted by the <ORG> in such suit The right of each beneficiary is only to receive compensation in proportion to the loss occasioned to him by the death of his deceased relative In short the beneficiaries entitled to compensation under Act XIII of are not persons entitled to claim compensation jointly but are parties entitled to relief severally in respect of the same cause of action which is enforceable at the suit of all or any one of them suing for himself and the rest If this is the correct view of the statutory right given to persons in the position of the plaintiffs in these cases it is clear that Section of the Limitation Act has no application to suits such as the present since in each case there is a widow of the accused who was under no disability and who could have sued and therefore all the persons entitled to the compensation and capable of instituting the suit were not minors or otherwise inoapable of suing within the period of one year prescribed by Article where it was held that the time with reference to an application for the execution of a decree passed in favour of several persons jointly ran against all the decree holders notwithstanding the minority of some of the decree holders and notwithstanding that any one of them might with the permission of the <ORG> have executed the whole decree on behalf of all Of course persons having claims such as those sought to be enforced here are not joint creditors and unless they can be held to be joint claimants of the kind mentioned in the section the benefit thereof cannot be claimed by them From the language of the whole section it is obvious that the term joint claimants is used with reference to persons whose substantive right is joint or to put it otherwise with reference to more than one individual possessing the same identical substantive right Whether when the words and that every such action shall be brought within calendar months after the death of such deceased persons in Section of Act XIII of were repealed and Article of the second schedule to Indian Limitation Act was introduced there was an intention to make a real change in the law it is not easy to say It is not improbable that the repeal of the provision as to limitation contained in Act XIII of as it stood before the amendment and the enactment of Article in lieu of it were merely for the sake of symmetry as urged by the learned Advocate General still the mere absence of evidence that the legislature intended to effect a real change in the law would not justify the <ORG> in holding that the present suits are barred by limitation if the language of Section or was grammati cally capable of application to them
