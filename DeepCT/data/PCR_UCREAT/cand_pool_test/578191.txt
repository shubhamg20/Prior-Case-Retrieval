HEADNOTE The appellants are a partnership firm carrying on business as dealers in shrimps prawns and lobsters and other sea food products The appellants filed their statement of monthly turnover for the month of April before the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Mangalore and claimed total exemption from tax in respect of the purchase turn over of shirmps prawns and lobsters under the Karnataka Sales Tax Act The appellants thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging all the said orders and notices of demand and sought appropriate direction order or writ restraining the respondents from imposing or collecting purchase tax on purchase turn over of shrimps prawns and lobsters under the Karnataka Sales Tax Act Allowing the appeal the <ORG> HELD In order to attract the applicability of sub section of section of the Central Sales Tax Act it is necessary that the goods which are purchased by an assessee for the purpose of com plying with the agreement or order for or in relation to export must be the same goods which are exported out of the territory of India The test which has to be applied for the purpose of determining whether a commodity subjected to processing retains its original character and identity is as to whether the processed commodity is regarded in the trade by those who deal in it as distinct in identity from the original commodity or it is regarded commercially and in the trade the same as the original commodity The nature and extent of processing may vary from one case to another and indeed there may be several stages of processing and perhaps different kinds of processing at each stage But it is only when the change or a series of changes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but instead is recognised as a new and distinct commodity that it can be said that a new commodity distinct from the original The shrimps prawns and lobsters purchased by the appellants did not lose their original character and identity when they were subjected to processing for the purpose of export The fact that they undergo a certain degree of processing or frozen for the purpose of preservation and transfer to other places including far off countries in the world makes no difference in character or identity as the original shrimps prawns and lobsters Further the question whether raw shrimps prawns and lobsters after suffering processing retain their original character or identity or become a new commodity has to be determined not on the basis of a distinction made by <ORG> for the purpose of exigibility to State Sales Tax because even where the commodity is the same in the eyes of the persons dealing in it <ORG> may make a classification for determining liability to sales tax JUDGMENT CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No NT of From the Judgment and order dated th November of <ORG> in Writ Petition No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI The short question that arises for determination in this appeal by certificate is whether shrimps prawns and lobsters subjected to processing like cutting of heads and tails peeling deveining cleaning and freezing cease to be the same commodity and become a different commodity for the purpose of the Central Sales Tax Act Can they still go under the description of shrimps prawns and lobsters or in other words when we use the words shrimps prawns and lobsters do they mean only raw shrimps prawns and lobsters as caught from the sea or do they also include processed and frozen shrimps prawns and lobsters This question which falls for determination in the present appeal arising out of the following facts The appellants are a partnership firm carrying on business as dealers in shrimps prawns and lobsters and other sea food products The appellants filed their statement of monthly turn over for the month of April before the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Mangalore and in this statement of monthly turn over they claimed total exemption from tax in respect of the purchase turn over of shrimps prawns and lobsters on the ground that the same had been purchased in the course of export The appellants relied on sub section of section of the Central Sales Tax Act which reads as follows Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section the last sale or purchase of any goods preceding the sale or purchase occasioning the export of those goods out of the territory of India shall also be deemed to be in the course of such export if such last sale or purchase took place after and was for the purpose of complying with the agreement or order for or in relation to such export The appellants contended that since the purchases of shrimps prawns and lobsters had been made by them for the purpose of complying with the orders for export such purchases of shrimps prawns and lobsters must be deemed to be in the course of export and they were accordingly not taxable under the Karnataka Sales Tax Act This contention of the appellants was rejected by the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and on th July an order was made by the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes for the month of April under section of the Karnataka Sales Tax assessing the appellants to purchase tax and other incidental taxes in respect of the purchases of shrimps prawns and lobsters made by them during the said period The appellants thereupon filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging the assessment orders and the notices of demand issued against them and sought appropriate direction order or writ restraining the respondents from imposing or collecting purchase tax on purchase turn over of shrimps prawns and lobsters under the Karnataka Sales Tax Act It is clear on a plain reading of sub section of Section of the Central Sales Tax Act that in order to attract the applicability of that provision it is necessary that the goods which are purchased by an assessee for the purpose of complying with the agreement or order for or in relation to export must be the same goods which are exported out of the territory of India The question which therefore arises for consideration is as to what happens when shrimps prawns and lobsters purchased by the assessee are subjected to the process of cutting of heads and tails peeling deveining cleaning and freezing before export Do they cease to be the original commodity and become commercially a new commodity or do they still retain their original identity as shrimps prawns and lobsters Before we proceed to consider this question it is necessary to refer to certain provisions of the Karnataka Sales Tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Karnataka Act which came into force on st October Section of the Karnataka Act which enacts the charging section provides for levy of tax on sales and purchases of various commodities described in the Schedules to the Act The Third Schedule to the Karnataka Act as originally enacted enumerated the commodities on which a single point tax was leviable under sub section of section and there were entries in this Schedule There was another amendment made in the Karnataka Act in by the Karnataka Sales Tax Amendment Act and section of this Amending Act made certain amendments in Entry a with retrospective effect so that from st April Entry a included in the Third Schedule shrimps prawns and lobsters other than processed or frozen shrimps prawns and lobsters and the Explanation to Entry a provided that processing shall include all or any of the following namely cutting of head or tail peeling deveining cleaning or freezing The test which has to be applied for the purpose of determining whether a commodity subjected to processing retains its original character and identity is as to whether the processed commodity is regarded in the trade by those who deal in it as distinct in identity from the original commodity or it is regarded commercially and in the trade the same as the original commodity The nature and extent of processing may vary from one case to another and indeed there may be several stages of processing and perhaps different kinds of processing at each stage But it is only when the change or a series of changes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but instead is recognised as a new and distinct commodity that it can be said that a new commodity distinct from the original has come into being There is no essential difference between raw shrimps prawns and lobsters and processed or frozen shrimps prawns and lobsters Equally it makes no difference in character or identity when shrimps prawns and lobsters are frozen for the purpose of preservation and transfer to other places including far off countries in the world This view finds ample support from the decision of <ORG> of the United States in <ORG> <ORG> Ed But it is no more drastic a change than the change which takes place in milk from pasturising homogenizing adding vitamin concentrates standardising and bottling there is hardly less difference between cotton in the field and cotton at the gin or in the bale or between cottonseed in the field and cottonseed at the gin than between a chicken in the pen and one that is dressed The argument was that when <ORG> itself made a distinction between these categories of commodities by making purchases of one category amenable to sales tax under Entry a and leaving out of the scope of taxation under Entry a the other category how could it be said that both these categories represent the same commodity and there is no difference in character and identity between the two The question whether raw shrimps prawns and lobsters after suffering processing retain their original character or identity or become a new commodity has to be determined not on the basis of a distinction made by <ORG> for the purpose of exigibility to State Sales Tax because even where the commodity is the same in the eyes of the persons dealing in it <ORG> may make a classification for determining liability to sales tax This question for the purpose of the Central Sales Tax Act has to be determined on the basis of what is commonly known or recognised in commercial parlance Here in the present case it was not disputed on behalf of <ORG> that the purchases of raw shrimps prawns and lobsters were made by the appellants for the purpose of fulfilling existing contracts for export and after making such purchases the appellants subjected raw shrimps prawns and lobsters purchased by them to the process of cutting of heads and tails peeling deveining cleaning and freezing and exported such processed and frozen shrimps prawns and lobsters in fulfilment of the contracts for export The only argument raised on behalf of <ORG> was that the goods which were exported were not the same as the goods purchased by the appellants because raw shrimps prawns and lobsters after processings ceased to be the same commodity and became a new distinct commodity The shrimps prawns and lobsters purchased by the appellants did not lose their original character and identity when they were subjected to processing for the purpose of export We accordingly allow the appeal set aside the judgment of <ORG> as also the Orders made by the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes and direct that the purchases of raw shrimps prawns and lobsters made by the appellants for the purpose of fulfilling the existing contracts for export shall not be included in the tax able turnover of the appellants The respondents will pay the costs of the appeal to the appellants
