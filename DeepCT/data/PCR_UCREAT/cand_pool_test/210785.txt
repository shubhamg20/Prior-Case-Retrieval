The respondents filed their objections claiming that the proceedings were not legally maintainable It was further contended that imposed an unreasonable restriction on girls and women leading a life of prostitution and hence it violated Art In the circumstances it is not possible to say that uncanalized power is conferred on the Magistrate as an executive authority to decide the fate if the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia and the said differentia has rational relation to the object to be achieved by the said law There are pronounced and real difference between a woman who is a prostitute and one who is not and between a prostitute who does not demand in public interest any restriction on her movements and a prostitute whose action in public places call for the imposition of restriction on her movement and even deportation The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> six appeals filed by certificates granted by <ORG> at Allahabad raise the question of the vires of of the Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act hereinafter called the Act Thereafter the respondents preferred revisions to <ORG> at Allahabad and the said <ORG> allowed the revision petitions and set aside the proceedings pending against the respondents in <ORG> Kanpur A Magistrate on receiving information that any woman or girt residing in or frequent <NAME> ing any place within the local limits of his jurisdiction is a prostitute may record the substance of the information received and issue a notice to such woman or girl requiring her to appear before the Magistrate and show cause why she should not be required to remove herself from the place and be prohibited from re entering it The Magistrate shall after the service of the notice referred to in sub section proceed to inquire into the truth of the information received and after giving the woman or girl an opportunity of adducing evidence take such further evidence as he thinks fit and if upon such inquiry it appears to him that such woman or girl is a prostitute and that it is necessary in the interests of the general public that such woman or girl should be required to remove herself therefrom and be prohibited from re entering the same the Magistrate shall by order in writing communicated to the woman or girl in the manner specified therein require her after a date to be specified in the order which shall not be less than seven days from the date of the order to remove herself from the place to such place whether within or without the local limits of Ms jurisdiction by such route or routes and within such time as may be specified in the order and also prohibit her from re entering the place without the permission in writing of the Magistrate having jurisdiction over such place There is an essential distinction between an investigation and arrest in the matter of offences and information to the Magistrate the former when dealing with women has potentialities for grave mischief and therefore entrusted only to specific officers while mere giving of information Would It is stated that the power conferred on the Magistrate under of the Act is an uncanalized and uncontrolled one that he acts thereunder in his executive capacity that the said section enables him to discriminate between prostitute and prostitute in the matter of restricting their movements and deporting them to places outside his jurisdiction and that it also enables him on flimsy and untested evidence to interfere with the lives of respectable women by holding them to be prostitutes and therefore it violates Art The short title of the Act says that the Act may be called The Suppression of Immoral Traffic in Women and Girls Act There are provisions in the Act for punishing men who run brothels and who procure girls and women for prostitution for punishing women and girls who seduce or solicit for the purpose of Prostitution in public places for placing the rescued women and girls in detention in protections in protection home for closure of brothels and eviction of offenders from premises for restricting the movements of prostitutes and even for deporting them to places outside the Jurisdiction of the Magistrate Section provides for the punishment of a prostitute if she carries on prostitution in any premises Which are within a distance of two hundred yards or any place of public religious worship educational institution hostels hospitals nursing home or such other public place or any kind notified in that behalf by the Commissioner of Police or the District Magistrate as the casec it may be The following procedural steps are laid down in of the Act the enquiry is initiated by a Magistrate on his receiving the requisite information that a woman a girl is a prostitute he records the substance of the information he sends along with the notice a copy of the record he shall give the woman or girl an opportunity to adduce evidence on two points namely i whether she is a prostitute and ii whether in the interests of the general public she should be required to remove herself from the place where she is residing or which she is frequenting the Magistrate shall give his findings on the said questions and on the basis thereof he makes the appropriate order and the disobedience of the order entails punishment of fine It is argued that the enquiry is not in respect of of fences though disobedience of an order made thereunder may entail punishment of fine and therefore the order is one made in an administrative capacity The enquiry starts on infor mation notice along with a copy of the record is given to the alleged prostitute she is given an opportunity to adduce evidence which necessarily implies a right to have a public enquiry to engage an Advocate to ask for the examination of the informant or informants and to cross examine them and to adduce her evidence both oral and documentary When the <ORG> conferred Jurisdiction on a Magistrate to decide the question of imposing restrictions on such a right by following judicial procedure it is reasonable to hold that it conferred jurisdiction on him as a court unless the clear provisions of the Act compel us to hold otherwise There are many proceedings under the Code of Criminal Procedure such as those under ss and which do not deal with offences but still it is never suggested that a Magistrate in making an enquiry in respect of matters thereunder is not functioning as a court The said sections confer ample authority on the courts mentioned therein to set right improper orders passed by a Magistrate in appropriate cases In the circumstances it is riot possible to say that uncanalised power is conferred on the Magistrate as an executive authority to decide the fate of an alleged prostitute in an arbitrary manner classification is founded on an intelligible differentia and the said differentia has a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the said law So too there are obvious differences between a prostitute who is a public nuisance and one who is not A prostitute who carries on her trade on the sly or in the unfrequented part of the town or in a town with a sparse population may not be so dangerous to public health or morals as a prostitute who lives in a busy locality or in an overcrowded town or in a place within the easy reach of public institutions like religious an educational institutions There are therefore pronounced and real differences between a woman who is a prostitute and one who is not and between a prostitute who does not demand in public interests any restrictions on her movements and a prostitute whose actions in public places call for the imposition of restrictions on her movements and even deportation We shall therefore briefly notice the decisions which have a direct bearing on of the Act of the Constitution though it held that the provisions of of the Act which enable a Magistrate to direct a prostitute to remove herself from the place where she is residing to a place without the local limits of his jurisdiction was an unresonable restriction upon the fundamental right guaranteed under Art of the Constitution but we cannot accept the view expressed by it in respect of Art We shall consider this aspect at a later stage Under of the Act the Magistrate can compel her to remove herself from place where she is residing or which she is frequenting to places within or without the local limits of his jurisdiction by such route or routes and within such time as may be specified in the order and prohibit her from re entering the place without his permission in writing Therein the learned Chief justice observed thus It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness wherever prescribed should be applied to each individual statute impugned and no abstract standard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases If we may say so with respect this passage summarized the law on the subject fully and precisely If in a particular locality the vice of prostitution isendemic degrading those who live by prostitutionand demoralising others who come into contact with them the <ORG> may have to impose severe restrictions on the right of the prostitute to move about and to live in a house of her choice The first argument also has no force Once it is held that the activities of a prostitute in a particular area having regard to the conditions obtaining therein are so subversive of public morals anti so destructive of Public health that it is necessary in public interest to deport her from that place we do not see any reason why the restrictions should be held to be unreasonable Whether deportation out of the jurisdiction of the Magistrate is necessary or not depends upon the facts of each case and the degree of the demoralizing influence a particular prostitute is exercising in a particular locality We therefore hold that the provisions of of the Act are reasonable restrictions imposed in public interest within the meaning of of the Constitution and therefore do not infringe the fundamental rights of the respondents under Art
