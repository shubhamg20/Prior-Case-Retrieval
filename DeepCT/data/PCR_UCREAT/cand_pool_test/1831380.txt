The plaintiff instituted the suit for declaration of his title to the suit site in the village of Kalasapakkam and for possession <NAME> contended that the property in question had been in his possession for over years and accepting this contention the <ORG> issued an order dated recognising his rights The plaintiff filed applications before the <NAME> of Polur and the Revenue Divisional Officer Tiruvannamalai complaining about the trespass committed by defendants and and the <NAME> of Polur directed the plaintiff to establish his righted in a civil court The present suit has been filed after the issue of the requisite notice to the <ORG> for declaration of his title to the suit site and for possession The th defendant the State of Madras filed a separate written statement contending that the suit site was not conveyed to any one that it was shown as unoccupied waste in the village site plan that defendants and had encroached on it that they had been suitably dealt with under the Land Encroachment Act and that the title to the suit site was still in the <ORG> The trial court dismissed the suit holding that the order passed by the <NAME> of Polur dated did not relate to the suit property that there is no proof of plaintiff acquiring title by prescription and adverse possession and that the plaintiff was never in possession much less in possession within years prior to the suit The plaintiff filed A of in <ORG> Vellore and the appellate Court allowed the appeal holding that the plaintiff had acquired title to the suit site by prescription even as against the <ORG> and that the plaintiff has proved his possession within years prior to the suit Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the appellants in A of contends that the plaintiff has no title to the suit property on the following grounds Secondly the documents relied on by the plaintiff to establish his continuous possession and enjoyment of the suit property namely Exs We shall first take up the second question for consideration The suit site is situate south of three houses belonging to <NAME> and his two Pangalis <NAME> and <NAME> the other portion in the house was sold by her to the second defendant under the original of Ex Before dealing with the case law on the point we shall examine the relevant provisions of the Indian Evidence Act relating to the admissibility of recitals as to boundaries in documents not inter partes Regarding Section of the Act which also deals with relevancy of facts there is a distinction between the existence of a fact and a statement as to its existence Two other sections which have to be considered in this connection are Ss and When the executant of the document containing recitals as to boundaries upon which reliance is placed is himself a witness in the case the recitals can be put to him under Section as a former statement corroborating the desposition and he can be also confronted with the recitals under Section We shall now consider the decisions of our court on the question whether the recitals as to boundaries in a document not inter partes are admissible in evidence In <NAME> <NAME> Mad WN AIR Mad a Division Bench consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> considered the question with reference to the admissibility of recitals as to boundaries in a document not inter partes under Section a of the Act It is not admissible under Section a and I agree with my learned brother following In Re Poddapaneri Narayanappa Mad WN that it cannot be treated as an admission against interest In that case the other learned Judge <NAME> observed The more difficult question for consideration is whether they can be admitted under Section of the Evidence Act There is no authority for the position that the recital in order that it may be admissible must have been made by a party to the suit or by a person through whom he claims It must however be pointed out that Section does not make all previous statements admissible to corroborate the testimony of a witness but only two classes of statements a statement made by a witness relating to the same fact at or about the time when the facts took place and a statement made before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact But can it be said that a recital of a boundary in a mortgage deed is a statement made at or about the time when the fact took place With some hesitation I think that it can One cannot of course speak of a boundary as a fact which took place at one time or another But what is to be got from this statement is not really the effect of the boundary but the fact that land on the boundary was at a particular time in the possession of a particular individual and the statement in the mortgage deed that so and so was in possession of the land on such and such a boundary is in my opinion a former statement made at the time when the fact of possession was taking place a contemporaneous statement regarding the occupation of land on the boundary We shall now refer to some of the decisions of other <ORG> AIR Pat FB a Full Bench of <ORG> dealing with the identical question held that such documents between strangers containing recitals regarding boundaries are inadmissible under Sections and of the Evidence Act As pointed out by <NAME> in AIR Mad the only method by which recitals in a document not inter partes could be admitted in evidence is by examinations of the executant of the document are found We shall take up the first question for consideration A Applying the presumption under Illustration to Section of the Evidence Act the lower appellate court came to the conclusion that the plaintiff has established his claim to the suit site by adverse possession from We see no reason to differ from the conclusion of the lower appellate court We shall now take up the third question for consideration inasmuch as the two second appeals are referred to us for decision We have to see whether there is other sufficient evidence to justify the finding of the lower appellate court that the plaintiff has established his claim to the suit site by adverse possession as against the <ORG> also The learned Subordinate Judge relied upon the oral evidence of <NAME> who is aged about years who stated that there is a <NAME> on the suit site belonging to <NAME> and his son <NAME> was having the <NAME> in the suit site We agree with the view of the learned subordinate Judge and hold that this evidence is sufficient to support the finding of the lower appellate court that the plaintiff has established his claim to the suit site against the <ORG> also by adverse possession
