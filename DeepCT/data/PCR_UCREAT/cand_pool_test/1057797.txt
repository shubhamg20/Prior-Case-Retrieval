When a law is impugned on the ground that it is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it what has to be ascertained is the true character of the legislation To do that one must have regard to the enactment as a whole to its objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions If on such examination it is found that the legislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature then it must be held to be valid in its entirety even though it might incidentally trench on matters which are beyond its competence Even assuming that the law in America that a presumption of guilt would offend the requirement of the equal protection of laws unless there is a rational connection between the act proved and the ultimate fact presumed could have application to the Indian Constitution on a proper reading of the sections there is a reasonable relation between the presumption raised in and the offences under Section omitting what is not material runs as follows Whoever a imports exports transports or possesses liquor or any intoxicating drug or uses keeps or has in his possession any materials still utensil implement or apparatus whatsoever for the tapping of toddy or the manufacture of liquor or any intoxicating drug or consumes or buys liquor or any intoxicating drug or allows any of the acts aforesaid upon premises in his immediate possession shall be punished Provided that nothing contained in this sub section shall apply to any act done under and in accordance with the provisions of this Act or the terms of any rule notification order licence or permit issued thereunder It shall be presumed until the contrary is shown a that a person accused of any offence under clauses a to of sub section has committed such offence in respect of any liquor or intoxicating drug or any still utensil implement or apparatus whatsoever for the tapping of toddy or the manufacture of liquor or any intoxicating drug or any such materials as are ordinarily used in the tapping of toddy or the manufacture of liquor or any intoxicating drug for the possession of which he is unable to account satisfactorily and that a person accused of any offence under clause of sub section has committed such offence if an offence is proved to have been committed in premises in his immediate possession in respect of any liquor or intoxicating drug or any still utensil implement or apparatus whatsoever for the tapping of toddy or the manufacture of liquor or any intoxicating drug or any such materials as are ordinarily used in the tapping of toddy or the manufacture of liquor or any intoxicating drug Section confers on certain officers power to search and seize articles even without a warrant under certain circumstances Section confers authority on a Prohibition Officer or any officer of the <ORG> or <ORG> to arrest without warrant any person found committing any offence under He was also charged under a on the allegation that though he was a permit holder he was in possession of more units than were allowed under the permit and that by reason of the proviso to that section he had committed an offence under a Immediately after service of summons the appellants filed an application unders of the Criminal Procedure Code wherein they contended that ss and to of the Act were repugnant to the provisions of the Constitution and were therefore void and prayed that the above question might be referred for the decision of <ORG> Against this judgment the appellants have preferred the present appeals under Art Subsection of which is the relevant provision runs as follows If any provision of a Provincial law is repugnant to any provision of a Federal law which the Federal legislature is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing Indian law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent Legislative List then subject to the provisions of this section the Federal law whether passed before or after the Provincial law or as the case may be the existing Indian law shall prevail and the Provincial law shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void The declared object of the enactment as stated in the preamble to it is to bring about the prohibition of the production manufacture possession export import transport purchase sale and assumption of intoxicating liquors And this is carried out in which enacts prohibition in respect of the above matters and imposes penalties for breach of the same He contends that a enacting as it does a presumption to be drawn by the court on certain facts being established deals with what is purely a matter of evidence and it is therefore not a law on intoxicating liquors but evidence Likewise he argues the provisions in ss to deal with matters pertaining to Criminal Procedure such as warrants seizure and arrest and have no connection with intoxicating liquors It is accordingly contended that ss and to are legislation under Entries and of List III and that their validity must be tested under But then it must be remembered that we are construing a federal Constitution It is of the essence of such a Constitution that there should be a distribution of the legislative powers of the Federation between the <ORG> and the Provinces The scheme Of distribution has varied with different Constitutions but even when the Constitution enumerates elaborately the topics on which the <ORG> and the States could legislate some overlapping of the fields of legislation is inevitable The British North America Act which established a federal Constitution for Canada enumerated in ss and the topic on which the Dominion and the Provinces could respectively legislate Notwithstanding that the lists were framed so as to be fairly full and comprehensive it was not long before it was found that the topics enumerated in the two sections overlapped and <ORG> had time and again to pass on the constitutionality of laws made by the Dominion and Provincial legislatures That is to say if a statute is found in substance to relate to a topic with in the competence of the legislature it should be held to be intra vires even though it might incidentally trench on topics not within its legislative competence The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond its competence may be an element in determining whether the legislation is colourable that is whether in the guise of making a law on a matter within it competence the legislature is in truth making a law on a subject beyond its competence But where that is not the position then the fact of encroachmen does not affect the vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment The principles laid down in the above decisions have been applied in deciding questions as to the vires of statutes passed by the Indian legislatures under the Government of India Act It was held by <ORG> that the pith and substance of the impugned legislation being money lending it was valid notwithstanding that it incidentally encroached on a field of legislation reserved for the <ORG> under Entry There the question related to the validity of Ordinance No IV of promulgated by the Governor of Bihar Then the Ordinance provided for preventive detention imposition of collective fines control of processions and public meetings and there were special provisions for arrest and trial for offences under the Act It is true that violation of the provisions of the Ordinance or of orders passed under it have been made criminal offences but offences against laws with respect to matters specified in List that it is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it what has to be ascertained is the true character of the legislation To do that one must have regard to the enactment as a whole to its objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions If on such examination it is found that the legislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature then it must be held to be valid in its entirety even though it might inci dentally trench on matters which are beyond its competence Neither the presumptions in section nor the provisions contained in sections to have any operation apart from offences created by the Act and must in our opinion be held to be wholly ancillary to the legislation under Entry in List II He relied in support of this contention on the following observations of <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> As to the presumptions of course the legislatures may go a good way in raising one or in changing the burden of proof but there are limits The law on this subject is thus stated by <NAME> on Constitutional Law Edition at page The power of a legislature to prescribe rules of evidence is universally recognised but it is equally well established that due process limits it in this matter It may establish rebuttable presumptions only if there is a rational connection between what is proved and what is permitted to be inferred therefrom The law would thus appear to be based on the due process clause and it is extremely doubtful whether it can have application under our Constitution The presumption in is that if it is found in the possession of a person he should be presumed to have committed the offence under a unless he could give satisfactory explanation therefor as for example that it must have been foisted in the place without his knowledge Under a if a person is found to be in possession of materials or other things mentioned in the sub section there is a presumption that he has committed an offence under but it is open to him to account satisfactorily therefor Both the contentions urged on behalf of the appellants having failed these appeals are dismissed
