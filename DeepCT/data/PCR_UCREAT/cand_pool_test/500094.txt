Up to the bonuses paid to <NAME> were allowed by the taxing department but from when the bonuses went up to Rs It also took the view that the emoluments were not reasonable under Section It further took the view that even if the deduction claimed fell under Section xv the basis for decision under Section xv was the same as the basis for decision under Section and the <ORG> held that even under Section xv the amount spent was not a reasonable amount Section deals with a special case where a sum is paid to an employee over and above his salary as bonus or commission for services rendered Section xv deals with a case where an expenditure is laid out or expended wholly or exclusively for the purpose of business and according to well established canons of construction when a statute deals with a special case it is not permissible to contend that the special case would also fall under the general provision in the statute When an expenditure falls under Section in the sense that it is an expenditure in the nature of bonus or commission paid to an employee for services rendered then its validity can only be determined by the test laid down in Section and not the test laid down in Section xv Perhaps Mr <NAME> is right that the question of reasonableness does not arise in the case of Section xv It was attempted to be argued by Mr <NAME> that Section only deals with cases where a payment is made to an employee ex gratia but when there is a legal obligation to pay then the case docs not fall under Section and he points out that in this case <NAME> was entitled to his emoluments not ex gratia but under an agreement But even so it is difficult to understand why Section does not apply to a case where a bonus or commission is payable under an agreement It is used in the sense in which it is now understood viz Instead of an employer paying to an employee a fiat bonus he may agree to pay a certain commission on profits or on production or on sales or whatever the agreement may be The <ORG> has made it clear that in determining the reasonableness of the bonus or commission all the three factors should be at the same time taken into consideration and it is after such a consideration that a determination must be arrived at as to the reasonableness of the bonus or commission We find from the statement of the case that at different places the <ORG> has considered the pay of the employee it has considered the profits of the business for the year in question and it has considered the general practice in similar businesses But unfortunately the <ORG> has taken the view which is clearly stated in the order that what is reasonable has to be determined not with reference to each one of the considerations mentioned in Clauses a and of Section It may be that considering the factor referred to in Clauses a the commission or bonus may be unreasonable it may be that taking the factor mentioned in Clause again the commission or bonus may be unreasonable but if the <ORG> Were at the same time to consider the factor mentioned in Clause and pay attention to all the factors at the same time under Clauses a and the <ORG> may come to the conclusion that the bonus or commission or any portion of it was a reasonable bonus or commission and therefore it is not a proper legal approach to determine the reasonableness of the commission or bonus by considering one or two of the three factors mentioned by the <ORG> separately without considering all of them together We would therefore ask them to decide what is the proper remuneration which should be allowed to <NAME> taking into consideration all the factors mentioned in Clauses a and of Section
