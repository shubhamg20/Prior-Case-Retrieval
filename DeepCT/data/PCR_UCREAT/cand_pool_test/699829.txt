HEADNOTE The appellant instituted a suit against the third respondent inter alia for a declaration that she was his lawfully married wife alleging that though the fact of her marriage was known to all who knew him he was trying to suppress the facts in such a way that the members of his family should conclude that she was not his <NAME> wife that he refused to openly acknowledge her as his legally wedded wife and that this conduct on his part had cast a cloud on her status as such wife and was affecting the rights of the issue of the marriage her three daughters In such suits the court is not bound to grant the declaration prayed for on a mere admission of the claim by the defendant if the court has reasons to insist upon clear proof apart from the admission There is nothing in the pleadings to suggest that respondents and were denying the appellant status as wife of the third respondent and the court ought not to compel the plaintiff to add parties to the suit where on the face of the pleadings plaintiff has no cause of action against them Under the Mohammedan law a man is entitled to have four wives at one and the same time and consequently as the third respondent has admitted that the appellant was married to him respondents i and have no locus standi to make any representation in the suit that there was collusion between the appellant and the third respondent During the lifetime of the third respondent neither the appellant nor her children on the one hand nor respondents i and on the other have any rights in his estate under the Mohammedan law Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> in Civil Revision Petition No of arising out of the order dated July of <ORG> <ORG> Hyderabad <ORG> made on the application under <NAME> appeal by special leave is directed against the concurring judgments and orders of the courts below allowing the intervention of respondents I and and adding them as defendants and in the suit instituted by the appellant against her alleged husband now respondent who was the sole defendant in the suit as originally framed The plaintiff also averred that the issue of the marriage were three daughters aged and years that the fact of the marriage was known to all persons acquainted with the Prince that there was a prenuptial agreement whereby the Prince agreed to pay Rs On these allegations she asked for the following two declarations That the plaintiff be declared to be the legally wedded wife Mankuha of the defendant That a decree be passed in favour of this plaintiff against the defendant declaring her to be entitled to receive from the defendant On June the plaintiff made an answer to the petition for intervention filed by respondents I and aforesaid She also founded her objection on the ground that having regard to the admission of the defendant in his written statement there is no serious controversy in the suit The court after discussing all the contentions raised on behalf of the parties observed that there were indications in the record of a possible collusion between the plaintiff and the defendant that the relief claimed under of the Specific Relief Act being discretionary could not be granted as of right that the presence of the interveners would help the court in unravelling the mysteries of the litigation and that there was force in the contention put forward on behalf of the interveners that under of the Specific Relief Act any declaration given in favour of the plaintiff will be binding upon the interveners <ORG> in a wellconsidered judgment after discussing the points raised for and against the addition of the parties and noticing almost all the authorities quoted before us refused to interfere with the discretion exercised by the trial court and dismissed the revisional application It came to the conclusion that the first respondent the admitted wife of the defendant and the second respondent the admitted son by her are interested in denying the status claimed by the plaintiff and have some rights against the estate of the rd respondent The learned Judge of <ORG> further observed When so much sanctity is attached to the status of marriage it would indeed be strange that persons who are so intimately related to the rd respondent as wife and son should be denied the opportunity of contesting the status of the petitioner as his lawfully married wife It cannot be that the petitioner is seeking any empty relief carrying with it the stamp of futility and it is difficult to assume that she is fighting a vain or purposeless litigation Against the judgment of <ORG> refusing to set aside the order passed by the learned trial judge the plaintiff moved this Court and obtained special leave to appeal In the forefront of his arguments in support of the appeal the learned Attorney General submitted that the court had no jurisdiction to add the first two respondents as defendants in the suit He rightly pointed out and there was no controversy between the parties before us that the added defendants do not come within the purview of the words who ought to have been joined which apparently have reference to necessary parties in the sense that the suit cannot be effectively disposed of without their presence on the record But it was contended on behalf of the appellants that whether the narrower or the wider view of the interpretation of sub In the leading case of <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> has held that a party who is not directly interested in the issues between the plaintiff and the defendant but is only indirectly or commercially affected cannot be added as a defendant because the court has no jurisdiction under the relevant rule to bring him on the record even as a proper party the subject matter of the litigation and all that could have been said on behalf of the party intervening was that the judgment against the defendant would affect his interest commercially <NAME> who agreed with <ORG> in that case observed that the relevant rule of <ORG> on its proper construction authorized the court to add only such persons as would be bound by the judgment to be given in the action but did not authorize the court to add any persons who would not be so bound and whose interest may only indirectly be affected in a commer cial sense The <ORG> held that in order that a party may be added as a defendant in the suit he should have a legal interest in the subject matter of the litigation legal interest not as distinguished from an equitable interest but an interest which the law recognizes no jurisdiction to add a person as a party to the litigation if he had no legal interest in the issue involved in the case But in that case also the party added as defendant was interested in the subject matter of the litigation though there was no impediment to the court determining the issues between the parties originally before the court The learned Judge on a discussion of the English and Indian cases on the subject came to the conclusion that a material question common to all the parties to the suit and to third parties should be tried once for all At the <ORG> stage <ORG> was added as a party to the litigation at the instance of the Advocate General with a view to enabling the <ORG> to come up in appeal to <ORG> in order to obtain a more authoritative pronouncement on the vales of the Act <NAME> noticed the two Madras decisions referred to above but assumed that there was jurisdiction in the <ORG> in a proper case to do so and therefore did not express his considered opinion in view of the fact that his two colleagues <NAME> and <NAME> had agreed though for different reasons in the view that the <ORG> had jurisdiction to implead the <ORG> though it was only indirectly interested in the litigation <NAME> was inclined to take the view that there was a discretion in the <ORG> to add the <ORG> as a party He took the view that the <ORG> as the guardian of the public interest should not be called upon to show some pecuniary or proprietary interest or interest in public revenue in the questions involved to be added as a party Discussing the question whether it was a matter of discretion or of Jurisdiction in the court to make an order adding a party the learned Judge made the following observations In my opinion there is no case here of defect of jurisdiction in the sense in which it is said that consent cannot cure a defect of jurisdiction But as the antithesis shows the learned apparently had in mind the difference between the decision of the question of joinder on the interpretation of a rule of law and a direction given by the lower court in the exercise of its discretion because in the latter case the court of appeal would generally be reluctant to interfere Each case has to be determined on its own facts and it has to be recognized that no decided cases have been brought to our notice which Ch cannot be the least doubt that it is firmly established as a result of judicial decisions that in order that a person may be added as a party to a suit he should have a direct interest in the subject matter of the litigation whether it raises questions relating to moveable or immoveable property Hence all the cases cited at the bar laying down that a person who has no present interest in the subjectmatter cannot be added are cases which were con cerned with property rights Any person entitled to any legal character or to any right as to any property may institute a suit against any person denying This section recognizes the right in any person to have a declaration made in respect of his legal character or any right to property There is no clear averment in the plaint that the defendant had ever denied the legal character in question namely the status of the plaintiff as his wife At this stage it is convenient to deal with the other contention raised on behalf of the appellant namely that in view of the unequivocal admission of the plaintiffs claim by the <NAME> in his written statement and repeated as aforesaid in his counter to the application for intervention by respondents I and no serious controversy now survives Reading all these provisions together it is manifest that the court is not bound to grant the declarations prayed for even though the facts alleged in the plaint may have been admitted In the absence of such a situation there is no justiciable controversy and the case must be characterized as one asking for an advisory opinion and as being academic rather than justiciable i there must be an actual controversy of justiciable character between parties having adverse interest Hence if the court in all the circumstances of a parti cular case takes the view that it would insist upon the burden of the issue being fully discharged and if the court in pursuance of the terms of of the Specific Relief Act decides in a given case to insist upon clear proof of even admitted facts the court could not be said to have exceeded its judicial powers That the plaintiff herself or her legal advisers did not take the view contended for on her behalf is shown by the fact that a few days after the filing of the written statement of the Prince on April <NAME> the Mujtahid who is alleged to have solemnized the marriage was examined in court and he gave his statement on oath in support of the plaintiff claim It was stated before us on behalf of respondents and that there were pieces of documentary evidence apart from certain alleged admissions made by or on behalf of the plaintiff which seriously militate against the plaintiff case and the statement of the witness referred to above At this stage we are only concerned with the question whether in adding respondents I and as defendants in the action the courts below have exceeded their powers This naturally leads us to a discussion of the effect of of the Specific Relief Act which goes with and is an integral part of the scheme of declaratory decrees which form the subject matter of Ch VI of the Act On behalf of the appellant it was contended by the learned Attorney General that the declaration of status sought in this suit by the plaintiff will be binding only upon her and the <NAME> and being a rule of res judicata will bind only the parties to the suit and their privies The argument proceeds thus Section lays down a rule of res judicata in a modified form and it was so framed as to make it clear beyond all doubt by the use of the word only that a declaration under is binding on the parties to the suit and on persons claiming through them respectively If any question arises in the future after the inheritance to the estate of the <NAME> opens out it could not be said that the plaintiff and respondents and were claiming through different persons under a conflicting title which was the core of the rule of res judicata In this connection reliance was placed upon the decision of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> the third respondent supported the appellant by raising a further point that the words claiming through mean the same thing as claiming under in of the Code of Civil Procedure laying down the rule of res judicata and that those words are not apt to refer to a declaration of a more personal status and that they mean the same thing as pi ivy in estate is understood under the common law and In the law of estoppel one person becomes privy to another by succeeding to the position of that other as regards the Subject of the estoppel by holding in subordination to that other But it should be noticed that the ground of privity is property and not personal relations To make a man a privy to an action he must have acquired an interest in the subject matter of the action either by inheritance succession or purchase from a party subsequently to the action or he must hold property sub ordinately He also drew our attention to similar observations in Casperz on Estoppel In this connection it has to be remarked that the discretion vested in a court to grant a merely declaratory relief as distinguished from a judgment which is capable of being enforced by execution derives its utility and importance from the objects it has in view namely to prevent future litigation by removing existing causes of controversy to quiet title and to perpetuate testimony as also to avoid multiplicity of proceedings The contention raised on behalf of the appellant which was strongly supported by the third respondent through Mr <NAME> as stated above is that a declaratory judgment would not bind anyone other than the party to the suit unless it affects some property in other words unless the parties were privy in estate This is another indication of the sound rule that the court in a particular case where it has reasons to believe that there is no real conflict may in exercise of a judicial discretion refuse to grant the declaration asked for for oblique reasons As a result of these considerations we have arrived at the following conclusions That the question of addition of parties under of I of the Code of Civil Procedure is generally not one of initial jurisdiction of the court but of a judicial discretion which has to be exercised in view of all the facts and circumstances of a particular case but in some cases it may raise controversies as to the power of the court in contra distinction to its inherent jurisdiction or in other words of jurisdiction in the limited sense in which it is used in of the Code That in a suit relating to property in order that a person may be added as a party he should have a direct interest as distinguished from a commercial interest in the subject matter of the litigation Where the subject matter of a litigation is a declaration as regards status or a legal character the rule of present or direct interest may be relaxed in a suitable case where the court is of the opinion that by adding that party it would be in a better position effectually and completely to adjudicate upon the controversy The cases contemplated in the last proposition have to be determined in accordance with the statutory provisions of ss and of the Specific Relief Act In cases covered by those statutory provisions the court is not bound to grant the declaration prayed for on a mere admission of the claim by the defendant if the court has reasons to insist upon a clear proof apart from the admission The result of a declaratory decree on the question of status such as in controversy in the instant case affects not only the parties actually before the court but generations to come and in view of that consideration the rule of I present interest as evolved by case law relating to disputes about property does not apply with full force and The rule laid down in of the Specific Relief Act is not exactly a rule of res judicata Applying the propositions enunciated above to the facts of the instant case we have come to the conclusion that the courts below did not exceed their power in directing the addition of respondents I and as parties defendants in the action There is nothing in the pleadings of the appellant and respondent which discloses that respondents I and have any cause of action against the appellant Respondents and however filed an application under of the Code of Civil Procedure before the Judge of <ORG> Hyderabad praying that they should be added as parties to the suit filed by the appellant The Judge of <ORG> allowed the application and his decision was affirmed by <ORG> Independent of this a court has jurisdiction under to substitute or add as plaintiff any person whom it considers necessary for the determination of the real matters in dispute the court has the power to strike off a party who has been improperly joined whether as plaintiff or defendant and to join as plaintiff or defendant any person who ought to have been joined or whose presence before the court may be necessary in order to enable it effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit It is quite obvious from the contents of the plaint and the written statement of respondent that there was no occasion for the appellant to have joined respondents I and as defendants in the suit Unless the court is justified in adding respondents and as defendants in the suit the suggestion made by them that there is collusion between the appellant and respondent should be ignored by the court on the simple ground that respondents and have no locus standi to make any such representation in the present case The only issue in the suit filed by the appellant is whether she was married to respondent and whether there was a contract by the latter to pay her Rs If respondents I and are added as parties questions relating to right of inheritance in the estate of respondent would arise for determination in addition to the only issue stated above in the case It was urged that if the appellant is given the declaration which she seeks the judgment of the court would be in the exercise of matrimonial jurisdiction and it would be a judgment in rem as stated in of the Indian Evidence Act During the lifetime of respondent neither the appellant nor her children on the one hand nor respondents and on the other have any right whatsoever in his estate under the Mohammedan law During the lifetime of respondent respondents I and would have the right to be maintained by him and if the appellant is also his wife then she and her children would also have the right to be maintained by him The appellant and respondent would also have rights arising out of a contract if any between them and respondent It was said however that the right to inherit is a present right in respondents and and if the appellant is declared to be the wife of respondent then that right to inheritance is affected This contention is erroneous and there is no legal basis to support it Under the Mohammedan law they have no such rights It was urged however that unless respondents and are now given an opportunity to show that there was no valid marriage between the appellant and respondent a declaration that there was a marriage between these two persons would be binding on them by virtue of the provisions of of the Specific Relief Act It is somewhat doubtful having regard to the terms of that such a declaration in the present suit would be binding on respondents I and as they would not be claiming their right to inheritance through the appellant and respondent respectively If the submission has any substance it might as well be said by any one that he should be impleaded as a party to a suit and should be allowed to contest the suit although there was no cause of action against him because the decree in the suit would bind him on the ground of res judicata There is no cause of action now left to the appellant which can be the basis for the present suit Under of the Code of Civil Procedure the court has the power to pass orders regarding the adding of parties or striking off the name of a party The court ought not to compel a plaintiff to add a party to the suit where on the face of the plaint the plaintiff has no cause of action against him Under of the Specific Relief Act a suit may be instituted against any person denying or interested to deny the plaintiffs legal character or right to any property There is no danger of multiplicity of suits during the lifetime of respondent I would accordingly allow the appeal as both the courts below were in error in supposing that this was a case in which the provisions of
