I may give a few facts in Writ petition No of to show how the question arises in this petition He prayed that the provisions of the Kerala Land Reforms Act Act of as amended by the Kerala Land Reforms Amendment Act Act of be declared unConstitutional ultra vires and void During the pendency of the writ petition the Kerala Land Reforms Amendment Act Kerala Act No of was passed which received the assent of the President on August The petitioner filed an application for permission to urge additional grounds and to impugn the Constitutional validity of the Kerala Land Reforms Amendment Act Kerala Act No of When the case was placed before the Constitutional bench it referred this case to a larger bench to determine the validity of the impugned Constitutional amendments However as I see it the question whether <NAME> case was rightly decided or not does not matter because the real issue is different and of much greater importance the issue being what is the extent of the amending power conferred by Article of the Constitution apart from Article on <ORG> But however grave the issues may be the answer must depend on the interpretation of the words in Article read in accordance with the principles of interpretation which are applied to the interpretation of a Constitution given by the people to themselves The bill in the present case having been admittedly amended in several particulars during its passage through the <ORG> the Amendment Act cannot be said to have been passed in conformity with the procedure prescribed in Article Fifthly the Amendment Act in so far as it purports to take away or abridge the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution falls within the prohibition of Article The fact that the said article refers to the two Houses of the <ORG> and the President separately and not to the <ORG> does not lead to the inference that the body which is invested with the power to amend is not the <ORG> but a different body consisting of the two Houses The words all the powers conferred by the provisions of this Constitution on <ORG> in Article are not confined to such powers as could be exercised by the provisional <ORG> consisting of a single chamber but are wide enough to include the power to amend the Constitution conferred by Article The <ORG> further held The view that Article is a complete code in itself in respect of the procedure provided by it and does not contemplate any amendment of a Bill for amendment of the Constitution after it has been introduced and that if the Bill is amended during its passage through the <ORG> the Amendment Act cannot be said to have been passed in conformity with the procedure prescribed by Article and would be invalid is erroneous Although law must ordinarily include Constitutional law there is a clear demarcation between ordinary law which is made in the exercise of legislative power and Constitutional law which is made in the exercise of constituent power In the context of Article law must be taken to mean rules or regulations made in exercise of ordinary legislative power and not amendments to the Constitution made in the exercise of constituent power with the result that Article does not affect amendments made under Article The only contention before the <ORG> was that since it appears that the powers prescribed by Article are likely to be affected by the intended amendment of the provisions contained in Part III the bill introduced for the purpose of making such an amendment must attract the proviso and as the impugned Act has admittedly not gone through the procedure prescribed by the proviso it is invalid According to <NAME> that raised the question about the construction of the provisions contained in Article and the relation between the substantive part of Article with its proviso The Chief Justice came to the conclusion that as a matter of construction there is no escape from the conclusion that Article provides for the amendment of the provisions contained in Part III without imposing on <ORG> an obligation to adopt the procedure prescribed by the proviso He further held that when Article confers on <ORG> the right to amend the Constitution it can be exercised over all the provisions of the Constitution Even in their absence if any of the fundamental rights was infringed by any legislative enactment the <ORG> has always the power to declare the enactment to the extent it transgresses the limits invalid He was of the view that even though the relevant provisions of Part III can be justly described as the very foundation and the cornerstone of the democratic way of life ushered in this country by the Constitution it cannot be said that the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens are eternal and inviolate in the sense that they can never be abridged or amended He observed as follows It is true that there is no complete definition of the word law in the article but it is significant that the definition does not seek to exclude Constitutional amendments which it would have been easy to indicate in the definition by adding but shall not include an amendment of the Constitution It does not make any grant of power but it gives a direction and purpose to the Constitution which is reflected in Parts III and IV He further observed I would require stronger reason than those given in <NAME> case to make me accept the view that Fundamental Rights were not really fundamental but were intended to be within the powers of amendment in common with the other parts of the Constitution and without the concurrence of the States The only difference in respect of an amendment of the Constitution is that the Bill amending the Constitution has to be passed by a special majority here I have in mind only those amedments which do not attract the proviso to Article The result of a legislative action of a legislature cannot be other than law and therefore it seems to me that the fact that the legislation deals with the amendment of a provision of the Constitution would not make its result any the less a law But it would indeed be strange that rights which are considered to be fundamental and which include one which is guaranteed by the Constitution vide Article should be more easily capable of being abridged or restricted than any of the matters referred to in the proviso to Article some of which are perhaps less vital than fundamental rights It is possible as suggested by my learned brother that Article merely lays down the procedure to be followed for amending the Constitution and does not confer a power to amend the Constitution which I think has to be ascertained from the provision sought to be amended or other relevant provisions or the preamble He posed a further question by observing It is also a matter for consideration whether making a change in a basic feature of the Constitution can be regarded merely as an amendment or would it be in effect rewriting a part of the Constitution and if the latter would it be within the purview of Article He then stressed the prime importance of the preamble The Constitution indicates three modes of amendments and assuming that the provisions of Article confer power on <ORG> to amend the Constitution it will still have to be considered whether as long as the preamble stands unamended that power can be exercised with respect to any of the basic features of the Constitution are there could any of the rights enumerated in Articles to and be taken away If they cannot it will be for consideration whether they can be modified But I think that if upon a comparison of the preamble with the broad features of the Constitution it would appear that the preamble is an epitome of those features or to put it differently if these features are an amplification or concretisation of the concepts set out in the preamble it may have to be considered whether the preamble is not a part of the Constitution Coming now to <NAME> case the petitioner had challenged the validity of the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act which included in the Ninth Schedule among other acts the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act Act of and the Mysore Land Reforms Act Act of as amended by Act of <NAME> speaking for himself and other judges summarised the conclusions at page as follows The aforesaid discussion leads to the following results The power of the <ORG> to amend the Constitution is derived from Articles and of the Constitution and not from Article thereof which only deals with procedure Amendment is law within the meaning of Article of the Constitution and therefore if it takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III thereof it is void On the application of the doctrine of prospective over ruling as explained by us earlier our decision will have only prospective operation and therefore the said amendments will continue to be valid We declare that the <ORG> will have no power from the date of this decision to amend any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights enshrined therein It must be borne in mind that these conclusions were given in the light of the Constitution as it stood then i while Article subsisted in the Constitution <NAME> as he then was came to the following conclusions at page i that the Fundamental Rights are outside the amendatory process if the amendment seeks to abridge or take away any of the rights ii that <NAME> case and <NAME> case which followed it conceded the power of amendment over Part III of the Constitution on an erroneous view of Articles and <NAME> <NAME> held Article not only prescribes the procedure but also gives the power of amendment Article gives the power of amending each and every provision of the Constitution and as Article is a part of the Constitution it is within the reach of the amending power Article is not controlled by Article and the prohibitory injunction in Article is not attracted against the amending power Constitutional amendment under Article is not a law within the meaning of Article The scale of value embodied in Parts III and IV is not immortal Constition makers could not have intended that the rights conferred by Part III could not be altered by giving effect to the policies of Part IV The Seventeenth Amendment has not derogated from the sovereignty the republican form of government and the federal structure and the question whether they can be touched by amendment does not arise for decision There were no implied limitations on the amending power and all articles of the Constitution were amendable either under the proviso of Article or under the main part of the article In some parts they have clearly a narrow meaning First it uses the expression if such amendment seeks to make any change in it does not add the words change of or omit in and say seeks to change instead of the expression seeks to make any change in Article provides that there shall be a President of India and Article vests the executive power of the <ORG> in the President and provides how it shall be exercised Another article which has been included in the proviso to Article is Article which deals with the extent of executive powers of the Union But what is remarkable is that when we come to Part VI of the Constitution which deals with the States the only provision which is mentioned in the proviso to Article is Article which deals with the extent of executive power of States Chapter I of Part XI is included and this deals with <ORG> and the <ORG>s but Chapter II of Part XI which deals with Administrative Relations between the Union and the <ORG>s and various other matters in which the <ORG>s would be interested are not included This analysis of the provisions contained in Clauses a and of the proviso to Article shows that the reason for including certain articles and excluding certain other from the proviso was not that all articles dealing with the federal structure or the status of the States had been selected for inclusion in the proviso Were not the States interested in the fundamental rights of their people The omission may perhaps be understandable because of the express provision of Article which provided that States shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void assuming for the present that Article operates on Constitutional amendments Few words in the English language have a natural or ordinary meaning in the sense that they must be so read that their meaning is entirely independent of their context Sentences are not mere collections of words to be taken out of the sentence defined separately by reference to the dictionary or decided cases and then put back again into the sentence with the meaning which you have assigned to them as separate words so as to give the sentence or phrase a meaning which as a sentence or phrase it cannot bear without distortion of the English language The question then is one of construction and in the ultimate resort must be determined upon tht actual words used read not in vacuo but as occurring in a single complex instrument in which one part may throw light on another The Constitution has been described as the federal compact and the construction must hold a balance between all its parts In some articles the word amendment in the context has a wide meaning and in another context it has a narrow meaning In Article which deals with legislative procedure Clause provides that subject to the provisions of Articles and a Bill shall not be deemed to have been passed by <ORG> unless it has been agreed to by both <ORG> either without amendment or with such amendments only as are agreed to by both <ORG> The opening of Article reads Any law referred to in Article or Article shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the First Schedule and the Fourth Schedule as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of the law Here the word amendment has a narrower meaning Article reads Any law referred to in Clause shall contain such provisions for the amendment of this Constitution as may be necessary to give effect to the provisions of the law and may also contain such supplemental incidental and consequential provisions as <ORG> may deem necessary Here also the word amendment has a narrow meaning Here the word amend has been expanded by using the expression by way of addition variation or repeal but even here it seems to me the amendments will have to be in line with the whole Constitution which repeats the phraseology of para of the Fifth Schedule it seems to me the amendments will have to be in line with the Constitution According to Mr <NAME> the power of amendment given by Article read with Articles and Article Fifth Schedule and Sixth Schedule is a limited power limited to certain provisions of the Constitution while the power under Article is not limited If after a Bill has been so passed for the second time by <ORG> and transmitted to <ORG> a the Bill is rejected by the <ORG> or more than one month elapses from the date on which the Bill is laid before the <ORG> without the Bill being passed by it or the Bill is passed by the Council with amendments to which <ORG> does not agree the Bill is passed by <ORG> does not agree the Bill shall be deemed to have been passed by the <ORG> in the form in which it was passed by <ORG> for the second time with such amendments if any as have been made or suggested by <ORG> and agreed to by <ORG> Similar language is used in Article whereby existing laws continue to be in force until altered or repealed or amended by a competent <ORG> or other competent authority In the original Article in conferring power on the President to make regulations for the peace and good government of the territories in part of the First Schedule it is stated that any regulation so made may repeal or amend any law made by <ORG> Here the two words together give the widest power to make regulations inconsistent with any law made by <ORG> Any Act so passed by <ORG> may be amended or repealed by an Act of <ORG> passed or adopted in like manner but shall not as respects any State to which it applies be amended or repealed by an Act of the Legislature of that State In the proviso to Article which deals with the inconsistency between laws made by <ORG> and laws made by the Legislatures of States it is stated Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent <ORG> from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to amending varying or repealing the law so made by <ORG> State In expounding the Constitution of the United States every word must have its due force and appropriate meaning for it is evident from the whole instrument that no word was unnecessarily used or needlessly added Reference was made to Section of the Indian Independence Act in which the last three lines read and the powers of the <ORG> of each Dominion include the power to repeal or amend any such Act order rule or regulation in so far as it is part of the law of the Dominion So there is no doubt from a perusal of these provisions that different words have been used to meet different demands In view of the great variation of the phrases used all through the Constitution it follows that the word amendment must derive its colour from Article and the rest of the provisions of the Constitution There is no doubt that it is not intended that the whole Constitution could be repealed The Constitution opens with a preamble which reads WE THE PEOPLE OF INDIA having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens JUSTICE social economic and political LIBERTY of thought expression belief faith and worship EQUALITY of status and of opportunity and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of the Nation IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this Twenty sixth day of November do HEREBY ADOPT ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION This Preamble and indeed the Constitution was drafted in the light and direction of the Objective Resolutions adopted on January which runs as follows THIS CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY declares its firm and solemn resolve to proclaim India as an Independent Sovereign Republic and to draw up for her future governance a Consti wherein the territories that now comprise British India the territories that now form the Indian States and such other parts of India as are outside British India and the States as well as such other territories as are willing to be constituted into the Independent Sovereign India shall be a <ORG> of them all and wherein the said territories whether with their present boundaries or with such others as may be determined by <ORG> and thereafter according to the law of the Constitution shall possess and retain the status of autonomous units together with residuary powers and exercise all powers and functions of government and administration save and except such powers and functions as are vested in of assigned to the <ORG> or as are inherent or implied in the <ORG> or resulting therefrom and wherein all power and authority of <ORG> its constituent parts and organs of government are derived from the people and wherein shall be guaranteed and secured to all people of India justice social economic and political equality of status of opportunity and before the law freedom of thought expression belief faith worship vocation association and action subject to law and public morality and wherein adequate safeguards shall be provided for minorities backward and tribal areas and depressed and other backward classes and whereby shall be maintained the integrity of the territory of the Republic and its sovereign rights on land sea and air according to justice and the law of civilized nations and this ancient land attains its rightful and honoured place in the world and makes its full and willing contribution to the promotion of world peace and the welfare of mankind After examining the implications of partition the sub<ORG>committee thought that the question of making changes in the Objectives Resolution could appropriately be considered only when effect had actually been given to the June Plan In a statement circulated to members of the <ORG> on July <NAME> inter alia observed that the Preamble was covered more or less by the Objectives Resolution which it was intended to incorporate in the final Constitution subject to some modification on account of the political changes resulting from partition Once the transfer of power had taken place the question of British <ORG> subsequent approval which was visualised in <ORG> original plan of May could no longer arise The sovereign character of the Constituent <ORG> thus became automatic with the rapid march of events without any controversy and the words in the Preamble give to ourselves this Constitution became appropriate Regarding the use which can be made of the preamble in interpreting an ordinary statute there is no doubt that it cannot be used to modify the language if the language of the enactment is plain and clear Berubari Union and Exchange of Enclaves this was said about the Preamble There is no doubt that the declaration made by the people of India in exercise of their sovereign will in the preamble to the Constitution is in the words of <NAME> a key to open the mind of the makers which may show the general purposes for which they made the several provisions in the Constitution but nevertheless the preamble is not a part of the Constitution and as <NAME> has observed about the preamble to the American Constitution it has never been regarded as the source of any substantive power conferred on <ORG> or any of its departments It is urged in the written submission of Mr <NAME> that there is a distinction between the Indian Constitution Statute and the Constitution of India There is something to be said for his contention but in my view it is not necessary to base my decision on this distinction as it is not necessary to decide in the present case whether Article enables <ORG> to amend the Preamble They have been put there as a matter of public policy and the doctrine of waiver can have no application to provisions of law which have been enacted as a matter of Constitutional policy The Kerala Education Bill <NAME> while considering the validity of the Kerala Education Bill observed In order to appreciate the true meaning import and implications of the provisions of the Bill which are said to have given rise to doubts it will be necessary to refer first to certain provisions of the Constitution which may have a bearing upon the questions under consideration and then to the actual provision of the Bill It was held that as a matter of construction of the Act there was nothing in the Act or its preamble interpreted in the light of the earlier relevant statutes capable of controlling and limiting the plain and ordinary meaning of the material words of the enacting provisions and that the class of lineal descendants born or hereafter to be born meant the class of such descendants in all degrees without any limit as to time There is a sharp conflict of opinion in Australia respecting the question whether an amendment can be made which would be inconsistent with the Preamble of the Constitution Act referring to the indissoluble character and the sections which refer to the Federal nature of the Constitution I am not called upon to say which view is correct but it does show that in Australia there is a sharp conflict of opinion as to whether the Preamble can control the amending power The people therein declare that their design in establishing it comprehended six objects To form a more perfect union to establish justice to insure domestic tranquillity to provide for the common defence to promote the general welfare to secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity While statements of principles contained in the Declaration of Independence do not have the force of organic law and therefore cannot be made the basis of judicial decision as to the limits of rights and duties yet it has been said that it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence and the courts sometimes refer to the Declaration in determining Constitutional questions It seems to me that the Preamble of our Constitution is of extreme importance and the Constitution should be read and interpreted in the light of the grand and noble vision expressed in the Preamble The States and the territories thereof shall be the States and their territories specified in Parts A and of the First Schedule This applies to existing laws as well as laws made after the coming into force of the Constitution The fundamental rights conferred by the Constitution include right to equality before the law Article prohibition of discrimination on grounds of religion race caste sex or place of birth Article equality of opportunity in matters of public employment Article right to freedom of speech and expression to assemble peaceably and without arms to form association or unions to move freely throughout the territory of India to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business Reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the rights under Article in respect of various matters Article protects a person from being convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an offence or to be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence It further provides that no person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once and no person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself Article provides that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law Article gives further protection against arrest and detention in certain cases Article provides that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice Article provides that every person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate Article provides that subject to public order morality and health and to the other provisions of this Part all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right freely to profess practise and propagate religion Article gives protection to minorities and provides that any section of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language script or culture of its own shall have the right to conserve the same Article provides that no person shall be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them Article gives further rights to minorities whether based on religion or language to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Article prohibits the <ORG> from discriminating against any educational institution in granting aid to educational institutions on the ground that it is under the management of a minority whether based on religion or language As originally enacted it dealt with the right to property and prevented deprivation of property save by authority of law and then provided for compulsory acquisition for public purposes on payment of compensation It had three significant provisions which show the intention of the Constitution makers regarding property rights The fundamental rights were considered of such importance that right was given to an aggrieved person to move the highest court of the land i <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this part and this right was guaranteed Article confers very wide powers on <ORG> to issue directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part Article further provides that the right guaranteed by this article shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by this Constitution Article enables <ORG> by law to determine to what extent any of the rights conferred by this Part shall in their application to the members of <ORG> or the <ORG> charged with the maintenance of public order be restricted or abrogated so as to ensure the proper discharge of their duties and the maintenance of discipline among them Article specifically provides that the provisions contained in this Part shall not be enforceable by any court but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the <ORG> to apply these principles in making laws The <ORG>s could not for instance issue a mandamus directing the <ORG> to provide adequate means of livelihood to every citizen or that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community be so distributed as best to subserve the common good or that there should be equal pay for equal work for both men and women In other words ran <ORG> abrogate the fundamental rights in order to give effect to some of the directive principles Article which gives particular directions to the <ORG> reads thus The State shall in particular direct its policy towards securing a that the citizens men and women equally have the right to an adequate means of livelihood that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment that there is equal pay for equal work for both men and women that the health and strength of workers men and women and the tender age of children are not abused and that citizens are not forced by economic necessity to enter avocations unsuited to their age or strength that childhood and youth are protected against exploitation and against moral and material abandonment Articles deals with the right to work to education and to public assistance in certain cases Article direct that the <ORG> shall endeavour to secure by suitable legislation or economic organisation or in any other way to all workers agricultural industrial or otherwise work a living wage conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities and in particular the <ORG> shall endeavour to promote cottage industries on an individual or cooperative basis in rural areas Although there is a sharp conflict of opinion whether respect for human dignity and fundamental human rights is obligatory under the Charter see Oppenheim International Law th ed footnote it seems to me that in view of Article of the directive principles this <ORG> must interpret language of the Constitution if not intractable which is after all a municipal law in the light of the United Nations Charter and the solemn declaration subscribed to by India Article provides that <ORG> shall not be subject to dissolution but as nearly as possible one third of the members thereof shall retire as soon as may be on the expiration of every second year in accordance with the provisions made in that behalf by <ORG> by law Article gives power to the President to promulgate ordinances during recess of <ORG> Chapter IV deals with <ORG> Article confers legislative powers on the Governor during the recess of <ORG> by promulgating ordinances We need only notice Article which provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law Part XIII deals with Trade Commerce and Intercourse within the Territory of India Part XIV deals with Services under the Union and the States Part XVI contains special provisions relating to certain classes the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes etc Article makes special provisions for Anglo Indian community in certain services and Article makes special provisions in respect of educational grants for the benefit of Anglo Indian community If the President is satisfied that a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India or of any part of the territory thereof is threatened whether by war or external aggression or internal disturbance he may by Proclamation make a declaration to that effect The effect is that the executive power of the <ORG> shall be extended to the giving of directions to any State as to the manner in which the executive power thereof is to be exercised and the <ORG> gets the power to make laws with respect to any matter including the power to make laws conferring powers and imposing duties etc While a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation nothing in Article shall restrict the power of the <ORG> as defined in Part III to make any law or to take any executive action which the <ORG> would but for the provisions contained in that Part be competent to make or to take but any law so made shall to the extent of the incompetency cease to have effect as soon as the Proclamation ceases to operate except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have effect Where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation the President may by order declare that the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the order and all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned shall remain suspended for the period during which the Proclamation is in force or for such shorter period as may be specified in the order I may here notice an argument that the enactment of Articles and showed that the fundamental rights were not treated as inalienable rights Sub section of Section reads The legislature of each of the new Dominions shall have full power to make laws for that Dominion including laws having extraterritorial operation In clarifying this statement Sir <NAME> at a Press Conference dated May stated But in order to give these minorities and particularly the smaller minorities like the Indian Christians and the Anglo Indians and also the tribal representatives a better opportunity of influencing minority provisions we have made provision for the setting up by the Constitution making body of an influential advisory <ORG> which will take the initiative in the preparation of the list of fundamental rights the minority protection clauses and the proposals for the administration of tribal and excluded areas the abolition of untouchability and the mandatory requirements that the enforcement of any disability arising out of untouchability should be made an offence punishable according to law freedom to profess practise and propagate one religion the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes the right to be governed by one personal law the right to use one mother<ORG>tongue and establish denominational communal or language schools etc They cover a very wide range of the rights of minorities which give them ample protection and yet there are certain political safeguards which have got to be specifically considered It seems to me that in the context of the British Plan the setting up of Minorities Sub<ORG>Committee <ORG> and the proceedings of these Committees as well as the proceedings in <ORG> mentioned above it is impossible to read the expression Amendment of the Constitution as empowering <ORG> to abrogate the rights of minorities It is however a sound rule of construction that speeches made by members of a legislature in the course of debates relating to the enactment of a statute cannot be used as aids for interpreting any of provisions of the statute <NAME> speaking for the Court observed It remains only to point out that the use made by the learned Judges below of the speeches made by the Members of <ORG> in the course of the debates on the draft Constitution is unwarranted The reason behind the rule was explained by one of us in <NAME> case thus A speech made in the course of the debate on a bill could at best be indicative of the subjective intent of the speaker but it could not reflect the inarticulate mental process lying behind the majority vote which carried the bill <NAME> at observed Before concluding this judgment I must refer to some of the speeches made by the members of <ORG> in the course of debates on the draft Constitution There is an additional reason for not referring to debates for the purpose of interpretation The Constitution as far as most of the Indian States were concerned came into operation only because of the acceptance by the Ruler or <NAME> It seems to me that when a Ruler or Rajpramukh or the people of the State accepted the Constitution of India in its final form he did not accept it subject to the speeches made during the <ORG> debates I have come to the conclusion that every provision is liable to be amended subject to certain limitations and this argument does not affect my conclusion as to implied limitations Indeed it is not referred to by the minority in its judgments and <NAME> makes only a passing reference to it Section deals with the power of <ORG> to make laws It reads Subject to the provisions of this Order <ORG> shall have power to make laws for the peace order and good government of the Island Provided however that the preceding provisions of this subsection shall not apply to any law making provision for relating to or connected with the election of Members of <ORG> to represent persons registered as citizens of Ceylon under the Indian Pakistani Residents Citizenship Act Any law made in contravention of Sub section of this section shall to the extent of such contravention be void In the exercise of its powers under this section <ORG> may amend or repeal any of the provisions of this Order or of any other Order of Her Majesty in Council in its application to the Island Provided that no Bill for the amendment or repeal of any of the Provisions of this Order shall be presented for the Royal Assent unless it has endorsed on it a certificate under hand of the Speaker that the number of votes cast in favour thereof in <ORG> amounted to not less than twothirds of the whole number of members of the <ORG> including those not present According to Mr <NAME> Section corresponds to Articles and and Section corresponds to Article of our Constitution and Sections and correspond to Article of our Constitution read with fundamental rights Section of the Ceylon Constitution provided for the appointment of the Chief Justice and Puisne Judges of <ORG> Section provided for the appointment of other Judicial Officers They found that there was a plain conflict between Section of the Constitution and Section of the Bribery Amendment Act under which the panel was appointed Mr <NAME> in reply submitted that the word entrenched meant nothing else that than these provisions were subject to be amended only by the procedure prescribed in Section of the Ceylon Constitution But I am unable to accept this interpretation because in that sense other provisions of the Constitution were equally entrenched because no provision of the Ceylon Constitution could be amended without following the procedure laid down in Section There the legislature having full power to make laws by a majority except upon one subject that was not in question passed a law which conflicted with one of the existing terms of its Constitution Act I have no doubt that <ORG> held that the provisions of Section in the Ceylon Constitution were unamendable Why did <ORG> say that the provisions of Section were unalterable under the Constitution or fundamental in the sense of being beyond change There is nothing in the language of Section to indicate any limitations on the power of <ORG> It could amend or repeal any provision of the Constitution which included Section and Section itself These passages show clearly that the <ORG> in <NAME> case took the view which commends itself to the <ORG> in the present case that a legislature has no power to ignore the conditions of law making that are imposed by the instrument which itself regulates its powers to make law But the proposition which is not acceptable is that a legislature once established has some inherent power derived from the mere fact of its establishment to make a valid law by the resolution of a bare majority which its own constituent instrument has said shall not be a valid law unless made by a different type of majority or by a different legislative process There the legislature having full power to make laws by a majority except upon one subject that was not in question passed a law which conflicted with one of the existing terms of the Constitution Act Since such alterations even if express can only be made by laws which comply with the special legislative procedure laid down in Section the Ceylon legislature has not got the general power to legislate so as to amend its Constitution by ordinary majority resolutions such as the Queensland legislature was found to have under Section of its Constitution Act but is rather in the position for effecting such amendments that that legislature was held to be in by virtue of its Section namely compelled to operate a special procedure in order to achieve the desired result In my view that meaning would be appropriate which would enable the country to achieve a social and economic revolution without destroying the democratic structure of the Constitution and the basic inalienable rights guaranteed in Part III and without going outside the contours delineated in the Preamble I come to the same conclusion by another line of reasoning I may first consider the doctrine that enables <ORG> to have power to deal with ancillary and subsidiary matters which strictly do not fall within the legislative entry with respect to which legislation is being undertaken <NAME> in A short Treatise on Canadian Constitutional Law page puts the matter thus But when it is <ORG> is legislating upon the enumerated Dominion subject matters of Section of the Federation Act it is held that <ORG> by necessary implication intended to confer on it legislative power to interfere with deal with and encroach upon matters otherwise assigned to the provincial legislatures under Section so far as a general law relating to those subjects may affect them as it may also do to the extent of such ancillary provisions as may be required to prevent the scheme of such a law from being defeated For instance in the Constitution of the United States Clause of Section expressly grants incidental powers The <ORG> shall have power to make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States or in any department or officer thereof Per <NAME> Union of India SCR at The existence of a public purpose is undoubtedly an implied condition of the exercise of compulsory powers of acquisition by the State iii <ORG> has laid down that there is an implied limitation on legislative power the <ORG> cannot delegate the essentials of the legislative functions iv On the power confered by Articles and of the Constitution to form a new State and amend the Constitution for that purpose limitation has been implied that the new State must conform to the democratic pattern envisaged by the Constitution and the power which the <ORG> may exercise is not the power to over ride the Constitutional scheme The point at issue was whether <ORG> in the exercise of its power under Section ii of the Constitution subject to the Constitution to make laws with respect to taxation but so as not to discriminate between States or parts of States may include the <ORG> in right of a State in the operation of a law imposing a tax or providing for the assessment of a tax Another point at issue was the status of the Commonwealth and the States under the Constitution and the extent to which <ORG> may pass laws binding on the States considered generally and historically and with particular reference to the question whether there is any implied limitation on Commonwealth legislative power There was difference of opinion among the Judges Chief Justice <NAME> held as follows The basic principles of construction of the Constitution were definitively enunciated by the <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> the Engineers case Lord <NAME> language in Reg According to the Chief Justice the <ORG> in <NAME> case unequivocally rejected the doctrine that there was an implied prohibition in the Constitution against the exercise in relation to a State of a legislative power of the Commonwealth once ascertained in accordance with the ordinary rules of construction a doctrine which had theretofore been entertained and sought to be founded upon some supposed necessity of protection as it were against the aggression of some outside and possibly hostile body On the other hand reliance is placed by Mr <NAME> on <NAME> judgment Does the fact that the Constitution is federal carry with it implications limiting the law making powers of <ORG> with regard to the States To this question I have no doubt both on principle and on authority that an affirmative answer must be given It is in the latter sense that in my view of the matter implications have a place in the interpretation of the Constitution and I consider it is the sense that <NAME> intended when in <ORG> The <ORG> he said at We should avoid pedantic and narrow constructions in dealing with an instrument of government and I do not see why we should be fearful about making implications The position that I take is this The several subject matters with respect to which the Commonwealth is empowered by the Constitution to make laws for the peace order and good government of the Conmmon wealth are not to be narrowed or limited by implications But implications arising from the existence of the States as parts of the Commonwealth and as constituents of the federation may restrict the manner in which the <ORG> can lawfully exercise its power to make laws with respect to a particular subject matter The relevant passages which bear out the second proposition are I take the Constitution of a legislature as the term is here used to mean the composition form or nature of <ORG> where there is only one <ORG> or of either <ORG> if the legislative body consists of two <ORG>s Probably the representative character of the legislature is a basic condition of the power relied on and is preserved by the word such but that being maintained I can see no reason for cutting down the plain natural meaning of the words in question so as to exclude the power of a self governing community to say that for <ORG> purposes one <ORG> is sufficient as its organ of legislation And in this respect the Statute of Westminster does not confer any new power of amendment indeed it is expressly provided that nothing in the statute shall be deemed to confer any power to repeal or alter the Constitution of the Constitution Act otherwise than accordance with existing law It is part of that protection that <ORG> can legislate only on the subject matters referred to it by Section and that each Province can legislate exclusively on the subject matters referred to it by Section After referring to the actual decision of that case he referred to the observations of Lord <NAME> which I have set out later while dealing with the Initiative Referendum case and then held The British North America Act divides legislative jurisdiction between <ORG> and <ORG> and there is no way in which these bodies may agree to a different division He referred to a number of authorities which held that neither the Dominion nor the Province can delegate to each other powers they do not expressly possess under the British North America Act This is the system of government by which the Fathers of Confederation intended and their intentions were implemented in the Act to protect the diversified interests of the several provinces and secure the efficiency harmony and permanency in the working of the union In the case just referred to <ORG> of Canada implied a limitation on the power of <ORG> and <ORG> to delegate legislative power to the other although there was no express limitation in terms in Sections and of the Canadian Constitution But I will refer to this aspect in greater detail later when I refer to the case In re the Initiative and Referendum Act <ORG> referred to the Ceylon Independence Act and the Legislative Power of Ceylon and observed These liberating provisions thus incorporated and enlarged the enabling terms of the Act of and it is clear that the joint effect of the Order in Council of and the Act of was intended to and did have the result of giving to <ORG> the full legislative powers of a sovereign independent State see <NAME> The Queen A Section of the Constitution says Subject to the provisions of this Order <ORG> shall have power to make laws for the peace order and good government of the Island In conclusion <ORG> held that there was interference with the functions of the judiciary and it was not only the likely but the intended effect of the impugned enactments and that was fatal to their validity This was in reply to the argument that the <ORG> had no such general intention to absorb judicial powers and it had pased the legislation because it was beset by a grave situation and it took grave measures to deal with it thinking one must presume that it had power to do so and was acting rightly Apart from the questions of interpretation of Sub section Section of the Industrial Arbitration Act and the construction of the <ORG> which was issued the main question that was debated before <ORG> and the <ORG> was whether <ORG> could amend a provision of the Constitution of Queensland without enacting a legislative enactment directly amending the Constitution The appellants on the other hand had contended that <ORG> has power by ordinary enactment passed by both houses and assented to by the Governor in the name of the <ORG> to alter the Constitution of Queensland including the judicial institutions of the State and the tenure of the judges All the laws applying to Queensland which it is competent to <ORG> to alter can be altered in the same manner by ordinary enactment There was difference of opinion in <ORG> Nor is a Constitution debarred from being reckoned as an uncontrolled Constitution because it is not like the British Constitution constituted by historic development but finds its genesis in an originating document which may contain some conditions which cannot be altered except by the power which gave it birth Mr <NAME> sought to deduce the following propositions from this case Firstly Unless there is a special procedure prescribed for amending any part of the Constitution the Constitution was uncontrolled and could be amended by an Act in the manner prescribed for enacting ordinary laws and therefore a subsequent law inconsistent with the Constitution would pro tanto repeal the Constitution Secondly A Constitution largely or generally uncontrolled may contain one or more provisions which prescribe a different procedure for amending them than is prescribed for amending an ordinary law in which case an ordinary law cannot amend them and the procedure must be strictly followed if the amendment is to be effected Thirdly Implications of limitation of power ought not be imported from general concepts but only from express or necessarily implied limitations i implied limitation without which a Constitution cannot be worked and Fourthly The British <ORG> in granting the colonial legislatures power of legislation as far back as Section refused to put limitations of vague character like general principles of law but limited those limitations to objective standards like statutes and provisions of any Act of <ORG> or order or regulation made under the Acts of <ORG> I agree that the first and the second propositions are deducible from <NAME> case but I am unable to agree with the learned Counsel that the third proposition enunciated by him emerges from the case It appears from the judgment of <NAME> and the <ORG> that two South Australia Judges had earlier held that the legislation must be with the object of altering the Constitution of the legislature I shall examine a little later more cases in which limitations on lawmaking power have been implied both in Australia A and in Canada <ORG> shall not be abolished nor subject to the provisions of Sub section of this section shall its Constitution or powers be altered except in the manner provided in this section That Sub section of Section A of the Constitution Act is void because a <ORG> has no power to shackle or control its successors the New South Wales Constitution being in substance an uncontrolled Constitution It is repugnant to Section of the Constitution Statute of It is repugnant to Section of the Colonial Laws Validity Act That the only possible limitations of this plenary power were a it must be exercised according to the manner and form prescribed by any Imperial or colonial law and the legislature must continue a representative legislature according to the definition of the Colonial Laws Validity Act It is necessary to bear in mind the relevant part of Section which reads as follows Section Every colonial legislature and every representative legislature shall in respect to the colony under its jurisdiction have and be deemed at all times to have had full power to make laws respecting the Constitution powers and procedure of such legislature provided that such laws shall have been passed in such manner and form as may from time to time be required by any Act of Parliament letters patent Order in Council or colonial law for the time being in force in the said colony <ORG> interpreted Section as follows Reading the section as a whole it gives to the legislatures of New South Wales certain powers subject to this that in respect of certain laws they can only become effectual provided they have been passed in such manner and form as may from time to time be required by any Act still on the statute book The proviso in the second sentence of Section of the Act of states a condition which must be fulfilled before the legislature can validly exercise its power to make the kind of laws which are referred to in that sentence There is no doubt that in the case before us the impugned Constitutional amendments have been passed according to the form and manner prescribed by Article of our Constitution After mentioning express limitations imposed by the Constitution upon the <ORG> power to tax <NAME> on Constitutional Limitations page states but there are some others which are implied and which under the complex system of American government have the effect to exempt some subjects otherwise taxable from the scope and reach according to circumstances of either the <ORG> power to tax or the power of the several States <NAME> sums up the position broadly at Broadly speaking the immunity which remains is limited to activities of the Government itself and to that which is explicitly created by statute that granted to federal securities and to fiscal institutions chartered by <ORG> Each of these several agencies is confined to its own sphere and all are strictly subordinate to the Constitution which limits them and independent of other agencies except as thereby made dependent There is nothing in the Constitution of the United <ORG> which can be made to admit of any interference by <ORG> with the secure existence of any <ORG> authority within its lawful bounds It has therefore been held that the law of <ORG> requiring judicial process to be stamped could not Constitutionally be applied to the process of the <ORG> courts since otherwise <ORG> might impose such restrictions upon the <ORG> courts as would put and end to their effective action and be equivalent practically to abolishing them altogether It seems to me that four cases are directly in point It seems to me that reading the Preamble the fundamental importance of the freedom of the individual indeed its inalienability and the importance of the economic social and political justice mentioned in the Preamble the importance of directive principles the non inclusion in Article of provisions like Articles and various other provisions to which reference has already been made an irresistible conclusion emerges that it was not the intention to use the word amendment in the widest sense In view of the above reasons a necessary implication arises that there are implied limitations on the power of <ORG> that the expression amendment of this Constitution has consequently a limited meaning in our Constitution and not the meaning suggested by the respondents The respondents who appeal fervently to democratic principles urge that there is ho limit to the powers of <ORG> to amend the Constitution He said that the Constitution makers had discarded the concept of due process in order to have something certain and they substituted the words by authority of law in Article The Constitution itself has used words like reasonable restrictions in Article which do not bear an exact meaning and which cannot be defined with precision to fit in all cases that may come before the courts it would depend upon the facts of each case whether the restrictions imposed by the <ORG> are reasonable or not It seems to me that the concept of amendment within the contours of the Preamble and the Constitution cannot be said to be a vague and unsatisfactory idea which Parliamentarians and the public would not be able to understand In connection with the question of abrogation of fundamental rights Mr <NAME> boldly asserted that there was no such thing as natural or inalienable rights because the scheme of Part III itself shows that non citizens have not been given all the fundamental freedoms for example Article speaks of only citizens He says that if there were natural rights why is it that they were not conferred on non citizens The answer seems to be that they are natural rights but our country does not think it expedient to confer these fundamental rights mentioned in Article on non citizens Other rights have been conferred on non citizens because the Constitution makers thought that it would not be detrimental to the interests of the country to do so He then said that even as far as citizens are concerned there is power to modify those rights under Article of the Constitution which enables <ORG> to modify rights in their application to <ORG> He also relied on the words rights conferred in Article and enforcement of any rights conferred by this Part to show that they were not natural or inalienable and could not have been claimed by them There is no question of the sovereign people claiming them from an outside agency There can be no doubt that the people of India have in exercise of their sovereign will as expressed in the Preamble adopted the democratic ideal which assures to the citizen the dignity of the individual and other cherished human values as a means to the full evolution and expression of his personality and in delegating to the legislature the executive and the judiciary their respective powers in the Constitution reserved to themselves certain fundamental rights so called I apprehend because they have been retained by the people and made paramount to the delegated powers as in the American Model emphasis supplied I have no doubt that the framers of our Constitution drew the same distinction and classed the natural rights or capacity of a citizen to acquire hold and dispose of property with other natural rights and freedoms inherent in the status of a free citizen and embodied them in Article emphasis supplied For all these reasons I am of opinion that under the scheme of the Constitution all those broad and basic freedoms inherent in the status of a citizen as a free man are embodied and protected from invasion by the <ORG> under Clause of Article emphasis supplied iii The people however regard certain rights as paramount because they embrace liberty of action to the individual in matters of private life social intercourse and share in the Government of the country and other spheres The people who vested the three limbs of Government with their power and authority at the same time kept back these rights of citizens and also sometimes of noncitizens and made them inviolable except under certain conditions emphasis supplied <ORG> has described them as follows iv man has certain natural or inalienable rights and that it is the function of the <ORG> in order that human liberty might be preserved and human personality developed to give recognition and free play to those rights Suffice it to say that they represent a trend in the democratic thought of our age I am of the view that the doctrine of natural rights affords nothing but a foundation of shifting sand for building up a thesis that the doctrine of waiver does not apply to the rights guaranteed in Part III of our Constitution held that there could be no waiver not only of fundamental rights enshrined in Article but also of any other fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution How would this test be operative vis a vis the Constitutional amendments made hitherto It seems to me that the amendments made by the Constitution First Amendment Act in Articles and and insertion of Article A apart from the question whether there was delegation of the power to amend the Constitution and apart from the question as to abrogation and the amendment made by the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act in Article would be within the amending power of <ORG> under Article There is no question of such a change being one in the character of that <ORG> from a democratic to a non democratic system Before parting with this topic I may deal with some other arguments addressed to us <ORG> and this <ORG> in this connection have followed the principles enunciated by <ORG> in interpreting Sections and of the Canadian Constitution It must be shown either that the words taken in their natural sense lead to some absurdity or that there is some other clause in the body of the Act inconsistent with or repugnant to the enactment in question construed in the ordinary sense of the language in which it is expressed It is no doubt well established that in construing the words of a statute susceptible of more than one meaning it is legitimate to consider the consequences which would result from any particular construction for as there are many things which the <ORG> is presumed not to have intended to bring about a construction which would not lead to any one of these things should be preferred to one which would lead to one or more of them If the language of a statute be plain admitting of only one meaning the <ORG> must be taken to have meant and intended what it has plainly expressed and whatever it has in clear terms enacted must be enforced though it should lead to absurd or mischievous results <ORG> first observed It was rightly contended on behalf of the appellant that <ORG> and the <ORG> have no concern with the wisdom of the <ORG> whose Bill is attacked and it was urged that it would be a dangerous precedent to allow the views of members of the <ORG> as to the serious consequences of excessive taxation on banks to lead to a conclusion that the Bill is ultra vires Then their Lordships made the following observations on the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> A That case seems to have occasioned a difficulty in the minds of some of the learned Judges in <ORG> It must however be borne in mind that the Quebec Act in that case was attacked on two specific grounds first that the tax was not taxation with the Province and secondly that the tax was not a direct tax I agree with the observations of Lord <NAME> in Queen Judge of <ORG> cited by him In my opinion the rule has always been this if the words or an Act admit of two interpretations then they are not clear and if one interpretation leads to an absurdity and the other does not the <ORG> will conclude that the legislature did not intend to lead to an absurdity and will adopt the other interpretation He then relied on the observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> Ch There is one rule I think which is very clear and this brings me back to where I started the doctrine of absurdity that although the absurdity or the non absurdity of one conclusion as compared with another may be of assistance and very often is of assistance to the court in choosing between two possible meanings of ambiguous words it is a doctrine which has to be applied with great care remembering that judges may be fallible in this question of an absurdity and in any event must not be applied so as to result in twisting language into a meaning which it cannot bear it is a doctrine which must not be relied upon and must not be used to re write the language in a way different from that in which it was originally framed If however two constructions are possible then the court must adopt that which will ensure smooth and harmonious working of the Constitution and eschew the other which will lead to absurdity or give rise to practical inconvenience or make well established provisions of existing law nugatory It is one of the well established rules of construction that if the words of a statute are in themselves precise and unambiguous no more is necessary than to expound those words in their natural and ordinary sense the words themselves in such case best declaring the intention of the legislature If <ORG> has power to pass the impugned amendment acts there is no doubt that I have no right to question the wisdom of the policy of <ORG> In the absence of some other indication that the harsh or ridiculous effect was actually intended by the legislature there is little reason to believe that it represents the legislative intent If anything these observations are against them for when I come to the question of interpretation of the th amendment I may well approach the interpretation keeping those observations in mind Mr <NAME> on the other hand relied on some <ORG> decisions in support of his submissions It is <ORG> a federal legislature which is given the power to amend the Constitution except in matters which are mentioned in the proviso Can we say that an amendment made by <ORG> is an amendment made by the people This is one of the matters that has to be borne in mind while considering the proper meaning to be given to the expression amendment of this Constitution in Article as it stood before its amendment by the th Amendment There are express limitations on amending power Apart from the above broad differences in Article as compared to Article the Constitution of India is different in many respects which has a bearing on the extent of the power of <ORG> to amend the Constitution The Court further held that the power to ratify a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution had its source in the Federal Constitution and the act of ratification by the state derived its authority from the Federal Constitution to which the state and its people had alike assented The conclusions which may have some relevance for us are conclusion and and for the reasons given by the learned Judge in <ORG> but impliedly rejected by the Supreme <ORG> by reversing the decision The respondents urged that there was a difference in the kind of amendments as mere changes in the character of federal means or machinery on the one hand and matters affecting the liberty of the citizen on the other There was no question as to ambit of the power of amendment In other words there was no question that the subject matter of amendment namely prohibition fell within Article of the Constitution They deliberately made the grant of power to <ORG> in respect to the choice of the mode of ratification of amendments On the plain language of the article the <ORG> came to the conclusion that the choice of the method of ratification had been entrusted to the <ORG> The question whether the people may by the terms of the Constitution delegate their power to amend to others for example to a Constitutional convention is one on which there is a notable lack of authority This footnote brings out the futility of referring to decisions to interpret a Constitution wherein power to amend has been delegated to <ORG> That there is a distinction between the power of the people to amend a Constitution and the power of the legislature to amend the same was noticed by <ORG> in Ex Parte Mrs <NAME> A one of the cases cited before us by the respondent by the people who have the unqualified right to act in the matter I have had the advantage of very elaborate and able arguments on both sides and I must apply my own mind to the interpretation Apart from the decisions of the Courts in United States there are no judicial decisions to guide us as to the meaning of the amending clauses in these Constitutions Amendments of this Constitution within the terms of the Scheduled Treaty may be made by the <ORG> but no such amendment passed by both Houses of the <ORG> after the expiration of a period of eight years from the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution shall become law unless the same shall after it has been passed or deemed to have been passed by the said two Houses of the <ORG> have been submitted to a Referendum of the people and unless a majority of the voters on the register shall have recorded their votes on such Referendum and either the votes of a majority of the voters on the register or two thirds of the votes recorded shall have been cast in favour of such amendment At the same time there was no question of any guarantee to any religious or other minorities in Ireland It was described in its long title as an Act to amend the Constitution by inserting therein an Article making better provision for safeguarding the rights of the people and containing provisions for meeting a prevalence of disorder But there is no doubt that it affected various human rights which were granted in the Irish Constitution Can the power of amendment given to the <ORG> be lawfully exercised in such a manner as to violate these principles which as principles the <ORG> has no power to change He then approached the validity of the th Amendment in these words Was then the Amendment No lawfully enacted by Act No of There are two principal grounds for impeaching its validity the first the taking away whether validly or not in any case the effective removal from use of the Referendum and the right to demand a Referendum the second that the Amendment No is not within the scope of the power of amendment and therefore the <ORG> was incompetent to enact it He thought The <ORG> therefore which owes its existence to the Constitution had upon its coming into being such and only such power of amendment if any as had been given it by <ORG> in the Constitution that is to say the express power set out in Article and amendments of the Constitution could only be validly made within the limits of that power and in the manner prescribed by that power He held that it was apt competent for the <ORG> to remove from the power granted to it by <ORG> the requisites for its exercise attached to it in the very terms of donation of the power Regarding the substitution of sixteen years for the words eight years he said If this amendment is good there is no reason why the <ORG> should not have inserted or should not even yet insert a very much larger term of years or indeed delete the whole of Article from the words by the <ORG> in the second line to the end of the Article He then repelled the argument that Section conferred the power to amend the Article itself His reasons for this conclusion are summarised thus at page In my opinion on the true interpretation of the power before us upon a consideration of express prohibition limitations and requirements of the clause containing it the absence of any express authority the donation of the effective act in the exercise of the power to the people as a whole the relevant surrounding circumstances to which I have already referred and the documents and their tenor in their entirety there is not here either expressly or by necessary implication any power to amend the power of amendment itself He gave various reasons which I have referred to above <NAME> held that the word amendment was wide enough to include a power to amend or alter or repeal and there is no express prohibition in Article itself that any article of the Constitution including Article could not be amended He observed I see no ground for holding that either of these Articles could not have been amended by the <ORG> subject to a Referendum of the people after the period of eight years and if so it follows that the same amendment the deletion of the word no in Article could be made by way of ordinary legislation within that period or within sixteen years after eight had been altered to sixteen It is true that <ORG> said that Mr <NAME> rightly conceded this point but we do not know the reasons which impelled <ORG> to say that the concession was rightly made Mr <NAME> challenged the validity of Act No of by urging The Constitution derived its existence not from any legislature of <ORG> but solely from the operations of an Irish body <ORG> which is called in Ireland <ORG> Now I may deal with the question whether the Constitution Twenty Fourth Amendment Act is valid It reads thus In Article of the Constitution after Clause the following clause shall be inserted namely Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article before Clause as so re numbered the following clause shall be inserted namely Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution <ORG> may in exercise of its constituent power amend by way of addition variation or repeal any provision of this Constitution in accordance with toe procedure laid down in this article in Clause as so re numbered for the words it shall be presented to the President for his ascent and upon such assent being given to the Bill the words it shall be presented to the President who shall give his attest to the Bill and thereupon shall be substituted after Clause as so re numbered the following shall be inserted namely Nothing in Article shall apply to any amendment made under this article It has expressly provided by amendments in Article and that the bar in Article against abridging or taking away any of the fundamental rights should not apply to any amendment made under Article No doubt <ORG> had the power to amend Article itself but that does not mean that <ORG> could so amend Article as to change its own amending power beyond recognition The power of amendment cannot possibly embrace the power to enlarge that very power of amendment or to abrogate the limitations inherent or implied in the terms on which the power was conferred It is contended on behalf of the respondents that the th Amendment does enlarge the power of <ORG> to amend the Constitution if <NAME> case limited it and as Article clearly contemplates amendment of Article itself <ORG> can confer additional powers of amendment on it Reliance was placed on <NAME> Irish Reports case and <NAME> A case It seems to me that it is not legitimate to interpret Article in this manner Article as existing previous to the th Amendment as interpreted by the majority in <NAME> case prevented legislatures from taking away or abridging the rights conferred by Article After the amendment now a law which has the effect of merely abridging a right while remaining within the limits laid down would not be liable to be struck down Section of the Constitution Twenty fifth Amendment Act enacted as follows a for Clause the following clause shall be substituted namely No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for acquisition or requisitioning of the property for an amount which may be fixed by such law or which may be determined in accordance with such principles and given in such manner as may be specified in such law and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate or that the whole or any part of such amount is to be given otherwise than in cash <BLOCKQUOTE Provided that in making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority referred to in Clause of Article the State shall ensure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause after Clause A the following clause shall be inserted namely Nothing in Sub clause of Clause of Article shall affect any such law as is referred to in Clause Whereas before the amendment Article required the law providing for acquisition to make provision for compensation by either fixing the amount of compensation or specifying the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation should be determined after the amendment Article requires such a law to provide for an amount which may be fixed by the law providing for acquisition or requisitioning or which may be determined in accordance with such principles and given in such manner as may be specified in such law the word amount has the following meaning Amount amount sb Let us then see if the other part of the article throws any light on the word amount In this connection it must be borne in mind that Article is still a fundamental right Then what is the change that has been brought about by the amendment It is no doubt that a change was intended it seems to me that the change effected is that a person whose property is aquired can no longer claim full compensation or just compensation but he can still claim that the law should lay down principles to determine the amount which he is to get and these principles must have a rational relation to the property sought to be acquired I have already held that <ORG> has no power under Article to abrogate the fundamental rights but can amend or regulate or adjust them in its exercise of amending powers without destroying them Reference may be made to two cases that show that if discretion is conferred it must be exercised reasonably The following observations of Lord <NAME> are pertinent It appears to me for the reasons I have given that they cannot have brought into account the consideration which they say influenced them and that they did not base their decision upon the ground that the reward for work is the value of the work reasonably and even generously measured but that they took an arbitrary principle and fixed an arbitrary sum which was not a real exercise of the discretion imposed upon them by the statute A discretion does not empower a man to do what he likes merely because he is minded to do so he must in the exercise of his discretion do not what he likes but what he ought <ORG> observed it seems to their Lordships to be quite plain that an illusory award such as this an award intended to be unreal and unsubstantial though made under guise of exercising discretion is at best a colourable performance and tantamount to a refusal by the <ORG> to exercise the discretion entrusted to them by <ORG> Notwithstanding anything contained in Article no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in Clause or Clause of Article shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article Article or Article and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy Provided that where such law is made by the legislature of a State the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent It will be noticed that the article provides that if the law contains a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy it shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy In other words once a declaration is given no court can question the law on the ground that it has nothing to do with giving effect to the policy whether it gives effect to some other policy is irrelevant Further a law may contain some provisions dealing with the principles specified in Clauses or of Article while other sections may have nothing to do with it yet on the language it denies any court power or jurisdiction to go into this question In the face of the declaration this <ORG> would be unable to test the validity of incidental provisions which do not constitute an essential and integral part of the policy directed to give effect to Article and Article If there are other provisions made by the Act which are subsidiary incidental or helpful to the operation of the monopoly they do not fall under the said part and their validity must be judged under the first part of Article It was held that the words incite and encourage are wide enough to include incitement and encouragement by words and speeches and also by acts and the words used in the section are so wide and vague that the clause must be held to be void in its entirety If a similar provision were inserted in the impugned Kerala Acts making it a criminal offence to criticise frustrate or defeat the policy of the Acts the provisions would be protected under Article Notwithstanding anything contained in Article no law providing for a the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights or the taking over of the management of any property by the <ORG> for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property or the amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of any of the corporations or the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing agents secretaries and treasurers managing directors directors or managers of corporations or of any voting rights of shareholders thereof or the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease or licence for the purpose of searching for or winning any mineral or mineral oil or the premature termination or cancellation of any such agreement lease or license shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article Article or Article Provided that It would be difficult to resist the contention of the <ORG> that each provision in the law has been taken for the purpose of giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> It was suggested that if the latter part of Article dealing with declaration is regarded as unConstitutional the <ORG> will be entitled to go into the question whether there is any nexus between the impugned law and Article and Article Even if there is a statement of policy in the Preamble it would not control the substantive provisions if unambiguous But assuming that there is a clear statement it would be for the <ORG> legislature to decide whether a provision would help to secure the objects Further as I have pointed out above this question is not justiciable if the law contains a declaration that it is for giving effect to such a policy According to Mr <NAME> Article has four features of totalitarianism There is no equality It seems to me that in effect Article enables <ORG>s to adopt any policy they like and abrogate Articles and of the Constitution at will It is true that the <ORG> law would derive authority from Article but the difference between delegated legislation and the <ORG> law made under Article is this It is permissible within limits for a legislature to delegate its functions and for the delegate to make law It will be recalled that Article deals not only With the right to property but it guarantees various rights freedom of speech and expression right to assemble peaceably and without arms right to form associations or unions right to move freely throughout the territory of India right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business I am unable to appreciate the reason for giving such powers to the <ORG> legislature to abrogate the above freedoms I have no doubt that the State legislatures and <ORG> in its ordinary legislative capacity will not exercise this new power conferred on them fully but I am concerned with the amplitude of the power conferred by Article and not with what the legislatures may or may not do under the powers so conferred It has been urged before us that Section of the th amendment Act is void as it in effect delegates the constituent amending power to State legislatures The question arises whether Article enables <ORG> to delegate its function of amending the Constitution to another body It seems to me clear that it does not In this case <ORG> was concerned with the interpretation of Section head of the British North America Act which empowers <ORG> to amend the Constitution of the Province excepting as regards the office of the Lieutenant Governor which report is not available to me but the summary of the reasons of the learned Judges of <ORG> are given at page of A as follows The British North America Act declared that for each Province there should be a <ORG> in which Section vested the power of law making the legislature could not confer that power upon a body other than itself The proposed Act also violated the provisions of Section inconjunction with Section as to money bills The first para of the head note in <NAME> A case gives in brief the actual decision of <ORG> as follows Section of the Criminal Code of Canada if and so far as it is intended to prevent the King in Council from giving effective leave to appeal against an order of <ORG> in a criminal case is invalid If what has been done is legislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited in which category would of course be included any Act of <ORG> at variance with it it is not for any <ORG> of Justice to inquire further or to enlarge constructively those conditions and restrictions Reference was also made to the observations of one of us in Delhi Municipality Mills A I at where I had observed as follows Apart from authority in my view <ORG> has full power to delegate legislative authority to subordinate bodies There is however one restriction in this respect and that is also contained in Article To all intents and purposes it seems to me that it is <ORG> legislation that effects an amendment of the Constitution It is the operation that the bill will have upon becoming law which gives it its Constitutional character not any particular label which may be given to it A bill described as one for the amendment of the Constitution which contained no operative provision to amend the Constitution would not require the prescribed formalities to become a valid law whereas a bill which upon its passing into law would if valid alter the Constitution would not be valid without compliance with those formalities It seems to me that Article cannot be read to be an implied amendment of Article because it opens with the words notwithstanding anything contained in Article and Article does not say that notwithstanding anything contained in Article What Article does is that it empowers legislatures subject to the condition laid down in Article itself to take away or abridge rights conferred by Articles and At any rate if it is deemed to be an amendment of Article it is beyond the powers conferred by Article itself For the aforesaid reasons I hold that Section of the Constitution Twenty fifth Amendment Act is void as it delegates power to legislatures to amend the Constitution Validation of certain Acts and Regulations Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in Article A none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part and notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent <ORG> to repeal or amend it continue in force Under Article A as inserted by the First Amendment a law was protected even if it was inconsistent with or took away or abridged any rights conferred by any provisions of Part III He held that the decision in <NAME> case afforded no useful analogy In this connection I may deal with the argument that the device of Article and the Ninth Schedule has uptill now been upheld by this Court and it is now too late to impeach it Broadly speaking Constitutional amendments hitherto made in Article and Article and the agrarian laws enacted by various States furnish illustrations of reasonable abridgement of fundamental rights in the public interest If a petition is filed in <ORG> or a suit is filed in a subordinate court or a point raised before a magistrate challenging the validity of an enactment it takes years before the validity of an enactment is finally determined There are other ways available to the <ORG> to expedite the decision Section of the Constitution Twenty fifth Amendment Act is void as it delegates power to legislatures to amend the Constitution The parties will bear their own costs according to which it was held by majority that Article of the Constitution was applicable to Constitutional amendments made under Article and that for that reason the fundamental rights in Part III could not be abriged in any manner or taken away The issues that have been raised travel far beyond that decision and the main question to be determined now is the scope ambit and extent of the amending power conferred by Article Therefore the amending power does not extend to alteration or destruction of all or any of the essential features basic elements and fundamental principles of the Constitution which power it is said vests in the Indian people alone who gave the Constitution to themselves as is stated in its Preamble It is claimed that it has the full constituent power which a legal sovereign can exercise provided the conditions laid down in Article are satisfied The content and amplitude of the power is so wide that if it is so desired all rights contained in Part III Fundamental Rights such as freedom of speech and expression the freedom to form associations or unions and the various other freedoms guaranteed by Article as also the right to freedom of religion as contained in Articles to together with the protection of interests of minorities to mention the most prominent ones can be abrogated and taken away Similarly Article which confers the right to move this <ORG> if any fundamental right is breached can be repealed or abrogated Even the Preamble which declares that the People of India gave to themselves the Constitution to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic for securing the great objectives mentioned therein can be amended indeed it can be completely repealed There were a great deal of difficulties owing to the differences between the approach of <ORG> and <ORG> led by Mr <NAME> As a mult of that declaration certain changes took place in <ORG> Parts III and IV which embody the fundamental rights and directive principles of state policy have been described as the conscience of the Constitution The Indian Constitution by <NAME> The legislative power distributed between <ORG> and the <ORG> Legislatures cannot be so exercised as take away or abridge the fundamental rights contained in Part III All the legislatures have plenary powers but these are controlled by the basic concepts of the Constitution itself and they function within the limits laid down in it Per <NAME> in Special Reference No of at India is a secular State in which there is no State religion It reads We THE PEOPLE OF INDIA having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens JUSTICE social economic and political LIBERTY of thought expression belief faith and worship EQUALITY of status and of opportunity and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of the Nation IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEBMLY this twenty sixth day of November do HEREBY ADOPT ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION The provisions contained in that Part are not enforceable by any court but the principles therein laid down are nevertheless fundamental in the governance of the country and it shall be the duty of the <ORG> to apply these principles in making laws Article enjoins the <ORG> to direct its policy towards securing amongst other things that the citizens men and women equally have the right to an adequate means of livelihood It amended Article of the Constitution for the first time It became therefore necessary to provide expressly that <ORG> has the power to amend any provision of the Constitution including the provisions contained in Part III iv In Clause as renumbered for the words it shall be presented to President for his assent and upon such assent being given to the Bill the words it shall be presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill and thereupon have been substituted A new Clause has been inserted namely Nothing in Article shall apply to any amendment made under this article It is Nothing in this Article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article On behalf of the petitioners Mr <NAME> stated that he need not for the purposes of this case dispute the th Amendment in so far as it leads to the following results i The insertion of the express provision in Article that the source of the amending power is the Article itself iii The express provision in Article and that the bar in the former Article against abridging or taking away any of the fundamental rights should not apply to an amendment made under the latter Article In the judgment of Chief Justice <NAME> with whom four learned judges agreed in <NAME> case the source of the amending power was held to reside in Article read with entry of List I to the Seventh Schedule The real attack therefore is directed against the validity of the th Amendment in so far as the three results mentioned above are concerned The position taken up on behalf of the respondents is that so far as Article is concerned the th Amendment has merely clarified the doubts cast in the majority judgment in <NAME> Therefore the crux of the matter is the determination of the true ambit scope and width of the amending provisions contained in Article before the changes and alterations made in it by the th Amendment If the Article conferred the power of the amplitude now covered by the th Amendment nothing new has been done and the amendment cannot be challenged Let us first analyse the scheme of Article itself as it stood before the th Amendment It is noteworthy that Article which provides that there shall be a President of India and Article which vests the power of the Union in the President and provides how it shall be exercised are not included in Clause a Another Article which is mentioned in Clause a is Article which deals with the extent of the executive power of the Union So far as the Vice President is concerned there is no mention of the relevant Articles relating to him vi The next Article mentioned in Clause a is which deals with the extent of the executive power of the States ix Chapter I of Part XI which deals with legislative relations between the Union and the States is included in Clause of the proviso but Chapter II of that Part which deals with Administrative Relations between the Union and the States and various other matters in which the States would be vitally interested are not included The net result is that the provisions contained in Clauses a and of the proviso do not throw any light on the logic sequence or systematic arrangement in respect of the inclusion of those Articles which deal with the whole of the federal structure These clauses demonstrate that the reason for including certain Articles and excluding other from the proviso was not that all Articles dealing with the federal structure or the States had been selected for inclusion in the proviso In some articles these words in the context have a wide meaning and in another context they have a narrow meaning The group of articles which expressly confer power on the <ORG> to amend are five including Article It relates to laws made under Articles and to provide for amendment of the First and the Second Schedules and supplemental incidental and consequential matters The third and the fourth provisions are paras and of the th and th Schedules respectively which have to be read with Article and which deal with the administration of Scheduled Areas and Tribal Areas The expression used in Articles and is amendment <ORG> has been empowered to make these amendments by law and it has been expressly provided that no such law shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purpose of Article The argument that if it be assumed that <ORG> is invested with wide powers under Article it may conceivably exercise power to abolish the legislative and the judicial organs of the <ORG> altogether was refuted by this Court by saying that a <ORG> cannot be formed admitted or set up by law under Article by the <ORG> which does not conform to the democratic pattern envisaged by the Constitution <NAME> and Anr Similarly any law which contains provisions for amendment of the Constitution for the purpose of abolition or creation of legislative councils in <ORG>s is only confined to that purpose and the word amendment has necessarily been used in a narrow sense was proposed by Mr <NAME> and it was as follows Any provision of this Constitution may be amended whether by way of variation addition or repeal in the manner provided in this article Mr <NAME> had moved another amendment in draft Article to substitute the words it shall upon presentation to the President receive his assent On behalf of the petitioners a great deal of reliance has been placed on the contrast between the use of the word amendment in Article and and paras and of the th and th Schedules which use the composite expression amend by way of addition variation or repeal It is pointed out that in Article it is only the word amendment which has been used and if the Constitution makers intended that it should have the expanded meaning then there was no reason why the same phraseology would not have been employed as in paras and or as has been inserted now by the th amendment The steps in this argument are i The contrast in the language employed in the different provisions of the Constitution in respect of amendment ii conferment of the wider power for the purpose of the th and th Schedules which empower the <ORG> to alter and repeal the provisions of those Schedules relating to the institutions contemplated by them the law making authority set up under them and the fundamental basis of administration to be found in the two Schedules The learned Advocate General of Maharashtra who appears for respondent No has laid a great deal of emphasis on the fact that Article is the only Article which is contained in a separate Part having the title Amendment of the Constitution It has been urged that the expression amendment of this Constitution has acquired substantive meaning over the years in the context of a written Constitution and it means that any part of the Constitution can be amended by changing the same either by variation addition or repeal The scheme of the amending provisions outlined by Dr <NAME> seems to indicate that the Constitution makers had in mind only one distinction between the amending power conferred by the other Articles and Article No such distinction was present to their mind of the nature suggested by the learned Advocate General that the amending power conferred by Articles other than Article was of a purely subordinate nature In one sense the power contained in the first group of Articles can be said to be subordinate in those Articles themselves could be amended by the procedure prescribed by Article It appears that the statement in the articles and provisions containing the amending power other than Article that any amendment made under those articles would not amount to an amendment under Article merely embodied the distinction emphasised by Dr <NAME> that one category could be amended by the <ORG> by a bare majority and all the other articles could be amended by the said body but only by following the form and manner prescribed by Article Although prima facie it would appear that the Constitution makers did not employ the composite expression in Article for certain reasons and even rejected Mr <NAME> amendment which pointedly brought to their notice that it was of material importance that the expanded expression should be used it may not be possible to consider this aspect as conclusive for the purpose of determining the meaning of the word amendment in Article The argument of the Attorney General is that the amending power in Article as it stood before the th amendment and as it stands now has always been and continues to be the constituent power the power to deconstitute or reconstitute the Constitution or any part of it It has been pointed out that in the Constitution First Amendment Act which was enacted soon after the Constitution of India came into force certain provisions were inserted others substituted or omitted and all these were described as amendments of the article mentioned therein In the context of the Constitution amendment reaches every provision including the Preamble and there is no ambiguity about it which may justify having resort to either looking at the other Articles for determining the ambit of the amendatory power or taking into consideration the Preamble or the scheme of the Constitution or other permissible aids to construction A good deal of reliance has been placed on behalf of the respondents on Article of the Constitution of the United States hereinafter called the American Constitution which deals with amendment and its interpretation by the American courts We propose to refer to the decision from other countries including those of <ORG> of the United States later In India <ORG> is certainly representative of the people but so are similar institutions in the countries mentioned above and yet there is a provision for ratification by convention or referendum or submission of the proposed law to electors directly This word or expression has several meanings and we shall have to determine its true meaning as used in the context of Article by taking assistance from the other permissible aids to construction We shall certainly bear in mind the Well known principles of interpretation and construction particularly of an instrument like a Constitution A broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret it <NAME> In Re The observations of Lord <NAME> in fames Commonwealth of Australia A at were also quoted in the aforesaid judgment of <ORG> at page The question then is one of construction and in the ultimate resort must be determined upon the actual words used read not in a vacuo but as occurring in a single complex instrument in which one part may throw light on another The Constitution has been described as the federal compact and the construction must hold a balance between all its parts pointed out that the words should never be interpreted in vacuo because few words in the English language have a natural or ordinary meaning in the sense that they must be so read that their meaning is entirely independent of their context The Constitution makers gave to the preamble the pride of place Meanwhile important developments had taken place in regard to the Indian States In order to appreciate how the preamble will assist us in discovering the meaning of the word amendment employed in Article we may again notice the argument presented by the respondents that the amending body can alter vary or repeal any provision of the Constitution and enact it and apply that process to the entire Constitution short of total repeal and abrogation It is maintained on behalf of the Respondents that by virtue of the amending power even the preamble can be varied altered or repealed Mr <NAME> however relics a great deal on the preamble for substantiating the contention that amendment does not have the widest possible meaning as claimed by the respondents and there are certain limitations to the exercise of the amending power and therefore the expression amendment should be construed in the light of those limitations It was so referred in <NAME> at case It is unnecessary to multiply citations from judgments of this Court in which the preamble has been treated almost as sacrosanct and has been relied on or referred to for the purpose of interpreting legislative provisions In <NAME> <NAME> Attorney General of the Province of Quebec Canada at <ORG> <NAME> relied on the observations of <NAME> in an earlier decision in Re Alberta Statutes Canada which was affirmed in Attorney General for Alberta Attorney General for Canada A that view being that the preamble of the British North America Act showed plainly enough that the Constitution of the Dominion was to be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom It has been seen that it is impossible to point to any document or instrument giving to or imposing upon the Constitution of Queensland this quality before the year Yet their Lordships discern nowhere in the preamble the least indication that it is intended for the first time to make provisions which are sacrosanct or which at least can only be modified by methods never previously required A preamble to the Constitution serves as a key to open the minds of the makers and shows the general purposes for which they made the several provisions in the Constitution It is not a source of the several powers conferred on government under the provisions of the Constitution On behalf of the respondents reliance has been placed on this case for the proposition that no limitation was read by virtue of the preamble It is further argued that The Constitution statute of India consist of two parts one the preamble and the other the Constitution The preamble is a part of the Constitution statute but is not a part of the Constitution There is a clear recital in the preamble that the people of India gave to themselves this Constitution on the th day of November Even if the preamble was actually adopted by <ORG> at a later date no one can question the statement made in the Preamble that the Constitution came into force on the date mentioned therein To our mind it hardly makes any substantial difference whether the preamble is a part of the Constitution or not Next it contains the enacting clause which brings into force the Constitution In the third place it declares the great rights and freedoms which the people of India intended to secure to all citizens and the basic type of government and polity which was to be established From all these if any provision in the Constitution had to be interpreted and if the expressions used therein were ambiguous the preamble would certainly furnish valuable guidance in the matter particularly when the question is of the correct ambit scope and width of a power intended to be conferred by Article The stand taken up on behalf of the respondents that even the preamble can be varied altered or repealed is an extraordinary one It may be true about ordinary statutes but it cannot possibly be sustained in the light of the historical background the Objectives Resolution which formed the basis of the preamble and the fundamental position which the preamble occupies in our Constitution While analysing the scope and width of the power claimed by virtue of a Constitutional provision it is wholly immaterial whether there is a likelihood or not of such an eventuality arising there are cases in which consequences of a particular construction are in and of themselves conclusive as to the correct solution of the question While most cherished freedoms and rights have been guaranteed the government has been laid under a solemn duty to give effect to the Directive Principles Before reference is made to the Objectives Resolution adopted in January it must be borne in mind that the post war period in Europe had witnessed a fundamental orientation in juristic thinking particularly in West Germany characterized by a farewell to positivism under the influence of positivist legal thinking will require a more detailed discussion in view of the elaborate arguments addressed on both sides based on it But for the present all that need be pointed out is that the above language is borrowed mainly from the judgment of Lord <NAME> who after setting out Section of the Ceylon Constitutional Order which gave <ORG> the power to make laws for the peace order and good government of the island said with regard to Clause according to which no law could prohibit or restrict the free excrcise of any religion There follow and which set out further entrenched religious and racial matters which shall not be the subject of legislation Reliance has been placed on Professor <NAME> statement in his book Federal Government th Edn It is pointed out on behalf of the petitioners that the scheme of Article itself contains intrinsic pieces of evidence to give a limited meaning to the word amendment It is not any <ORG> which has the amending power but only that <ORG> which has been created by the Constitution It has been suggested that on every occasion the procedure is followed as laid down in Article by the two Houses of <ORG> and the assent of the President is given there is the reproduction of the functions of <ORG> Indisputably <ORG> specially convened for the purpose would have the power to completely revise repeal or abrogate the Constitution Even assuming that there is reference on the nature of power between enacting a law and making an amendment both the powers are derived from the Constitution It can only exercise those powers with which it has been invested The respondents have taken up the position that even if the power was limited to some extent under Article as it originally stood that power could be enlarged by virtue of Clause of the proviso To say as has been said on behalf of the respondents that there are only two categories of Constitutions rigid or controlled and flexible or uncontrolled and that the difference between them lies only in the procedure provided for amendment is an over simplification The true distinction between a controlled and an uncontrolled Constitution lies not merely in the difference in the procedure of amendment but in the fact that in controlled Constitutions the Constitution has a higher status by whose touch stone the validity of a law made by the legislature and the organ set up by it is subjected to the process of judicial review Where there is a written Constitution which adopts the preamble of sovereignty in the people there is firstly no question of the law making body being a sovereign body for that body possesses only those powers which are conferred on it The relief sought in each case was an injunction against the execution of that Act In the dissenting opinion of Mr Justice <NAME> it was said that the Constitutional validity of the th amendment had also been attacked and although he dissented in certain other matters he agreed that the th amendment was a part of the Constitution of the United States Now it is significant that most of the justices including the Chief Justice who delivered judgments dealt only with the questions which had nothing to do with the meaning of the word amendment However the following observations are noteworthy and have been relied upon in support of the case of the petitioners that according to the United States Constitution it is the people who get involved in the matter of amendments All that it establishes for the purpose of meaning of amendment is that one must look to the plain language of the Article conferring the power of amendment and not travel outside it Article it was said contained procedural provisions for Constitutional change by amendment without any present limitation whatsoever except that no <ORG> might be deprived of equal representation in the <ORG> without its consent stated in categorical terms that the Constitution prescribes the method of alteration by amending process in Article and while the procedure for amending it is restricted there is no restraint on the kind of amendment that may be offered the question raised was whether there was any conflict between Article of the Constitution which gave power to the <ORG> to provide whether the ratification should be by <ORG> <ORG> or <ORG> and the Constitution of Ohio as amended Though the law making power of a <ORG> was derived from the people the power to ratify a proposed amendment to the Federal Constitution had its source in that Constitution Therefore in order to find out the authority which had the power to ratify it was Article to which one had to turn and not to the <ORG> Constitution On behalf of the respondents it is claimed that these decisions establish that the power of amendment conferred by Article was of the widest amplitude This argument loses sight of the fact that under the American theory of government power is inherent in the people including the right to alter and amend the organic instrument of government So far as Article of the American Constitution is concerned out of the alternative methods provided for amendment there is only one in which the people cannot get directly associated whereas in the others they are associated with the amending process proposal of amendment by two thirds of both Houses of <ORG> and its ratification by conventions in three fourths of the States or a proposal of amendment by a convention called on the application of two thirds of the State <ORG> and its ratification by either convention in three fourths of the States or by the <ORG> of the same number of States The meaning of the words amendment of this Constitution as used in Article must be such which accords with the true intention of the Constitution makers as ascertainable from the historical background the Preamble the entire scheme of the Constitution its structure and framework and the intrinsic evidence in various Articles including Article Several decisions of our court of <ORG> Irish courts Canadian and Australian courts have been cited in support of the contention advanced by him They fall in two categories In one category are those cases where limitations have been spelt out of Constitutional provisions the second category consists of such decisions as have laid down that there is an implied limitation on legislative power The power conferred by Articles and of the Constitution to form a new <ORG> and amend the Constitution for that purpose has been stated to contain the implied limitation that the new <ORG> must conform to the democratic pattern envisaged by the Constitution and the power which <ORG> can exercise is not the power to override the Constitution <NAME> and Anr It may be mentioned that so far as Article is concerned there seems to have been a good deal of debate in <NAME> case on the question whether there were any inherent or implied limitations Dealing with the argument that in exercise of the power of amendment <ORG> could not destroy the structure of the Constitution but it could only modify the provisions thereof within the framework of its original instrument for its better effectuation <NAME> observed that there was no necessity to express any opinion on this all important question owing to the view which was being taken with regard to the meaning of the word law in Article But it was recognised that the argument had considerable force <NAME> as he then was considered the question of implied limitations at some length but felt that if any implied limitation that basic features of the Constitution cannot be changed or altered were to be put on the power of amendment the result would be that every amendment made in the Consitution would involve legal wrangle The cases which fall in the second category are decidedly numerous It has been consistently laid down chat there is an implied limitation on the legislative power the legislature cannot delegate the essentials of the legislative function Before we go to cases decided by the courts in other countries it may be useful to refer to some of the Constitutional provisions which are illustrative of the concept of implications that can be raised from the language and context thereof Article declares that the executive power of the Union shall be vested in the President Article provides for a council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister to aid and advise the President in exercise of his functions The Advocate General of Maharashtra laid much stress on the principle enunciated in <NAME> <NAME> A at pp If what has been done is legislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited it is not for any court of justice to inquire further or to enlarge constructively those conditions or restrictions There were no such words in express or affirmative terms which conferred such a power Indeed in <NAME> case there was a sharp divergence of opinion on this point In The Initiative and Referendum Act A the position briefly was that the British North America Act Section head I which empowered <ORG> to amend the Constitution of the Province excepting as regards the office of the Lieutenant Governor excluded the making of a law which abrogated any power which the <ORG> possessed through the Lieutenant Governor who directly represented the <ORG> This case is more in point for consideration of validity of that part of the th Amendment which inserted Article but it illustrates that an implied limitation was spelt out from the Constitutional provisions of the British North America Act which conferred legislative power on the legislatures of provinces as constituted by that Act <NAME> The <NAME> A was another case involving Constitutional questions The legislature of Queensland Australia had power to include in an Act a provision not within the express restrictions contained in the Order in Council of But inconsistent with the term of the Constitution of Queensland without first amending the term in question under the powers of amendments given to it the Industrial Arbitration Act of contained provisions authorising the Government in Council to appoint any Judge of <ORG> to be a Judge of <ORG> Their Lordships could observe nowhere in the preamble the least indication that it was intended for the first time to make provisions which were sacrosanct or which at least could only be modified by methods never previously required The Advocate General of Maharashtra has sought to deduce the following propositions from the dissenting judgment of <NAME> and <NAME> of <ORG> which was approved by <ORG> in the above case Unless there is a special procedure prescribed for amending any part of the Constitution the Constitution is uncontrolled and can be amended by the manner laid down for enacting ordinary law and therefore a subsequent law inconsistent with the Constitution would pro tanto repeal the Constitution A Constitution largely or generally uncontrolled may contain one or more provisions which prescribe a different procedure for amending them As regards the third and fourth proposition all that need be said is that implied limitation which was sought in <NAME> case by counsel for the respondents was that the Queensland legislature should first amend the Constitution and then pass an Act which would otherwise have been inconsistent for the Constitution had not been amended Reference was made to Section of the Colonial Laws Validity Act which conferred on the <ORG> of the State full power to make laws inter alia in respect of the Constitution in such manner and form as might from time to time be provided by any Act of Parliament Letters Patent Colonial law in force in the colony etc A number of contentions were raised out of which the following may be noted a <ORG> was given by the Imperial Statutes plenary power to alter the Constitution powers and procedure of such <ORG> <NAME> case supra fully illustrates how <ORG> enforced such limitations even though they were of a procedural nature which had been provided in a Constitutional statute relating to the form and manner in which any such statute could be altered or repealed Section of the Ceylon Constitution Act provided by Sub section that subject to the provisions of the Order the <ORG> had the power to make laws for the peace order and good government of the island By Sub section any law made in contravention of Sub section was to be void to the extent of such contravention Sub section may be reproduced below In the exercise of its powers under this section <ORG> may amend or repeal any of the provisions of this Order or of any other Order of Her Majesty in Council in its application to the Island Provided that no Bill for the amendment or repeal of any of the provisions of this Order shall be presented for the Royal Assent unless it has endorsed on it a certificate under the hand of the Speaker that the number of votes cast in favour thereof in <ORG> amounted to not less than two thirds of the whole number of Members of the <ORG> including those not present The Bribery Amendment Act had not been enacted in accordance with the provisions contained in Sub section of Section of the Ceylon Constitution Act The point which engaged the serious attention of <ORG> was that when a sovereign <ORG> had purported to enact a Bill and it had received the Royal Assent could it be a valid Act in course of whose passing there was a procedural defect or was it an invalid Act which <ORG> had no power to pass in that manner A distinction was made while examining the appellant arguments between Section which expressly made void any Act passed in respect of the matters entrenched in and prohibited by Section whereas Section made no such provisions but merely couched the prohibition in procedural terms It was held that such alterations even if expressed could only be made by laws which complied with the special legislative procedure laid down in Section It is claimed that this decision supports the position taken up on behalf of the respondents that it is only the form and manner which is material in a controlled Constitution and that the above decision is an authority for the proposition that in exercise of the amending power a controlled Constitution can be converted into an uncontrolled one Ibid portions to Secondly the Ceylon Constitution authorised the <ORG> to amend or repeal the Constitution which power is far wider than the power of amendment simpliciter conferred by Article Don <NAME> The Queen A is another decision on which strong reliance has been placed on behalf of the petitioners <ORG> passed an Act which substantially modified the Criminal Procedure Code inter alia by purporting to legalise an ex post facto detention for days of any person suspected of having committed an offence against the State Reference was made to the provisions in the Constitution for appointment of Judges by <ORG> and it was pointed out that these provisions manifested an intention to secure in the judiciary a freedom from political legislative and executive control It was beset by a grave situation and it took grave measures to deal with it thinking one must presume that it had power to do so and was acting rightly It also contained a provision that in the event of inconsistency with existing law the Act should prevail The appellant challenged the validity of that Act on the ground that it was inconsistent with the Constitution and was usurpation of the judicial power The Constitution of Ceylon was a controlled Constitution and the Act was an inconsistent law the Act was to be regarded as amending the Constitution unless some provisions denying the Act Constitutional effect was to be found in the Constitutional restrictions imposed on the power of amendment Apart from the proviso to Section of the Constitution Act there was no reason for not construing the words amend or repeal in that provision as extending to amendment or repeal by inconsistent law But it does not support any suggestion as has been made on behalf of the respondents that judicial power could by an amendment of our Constitution be transferred to the legislature <NAME> cautioned that although the words of the Constitution are to be interpreted on the same principles of interpretation as are applied to any ordinary law these very principles of interpretation compel us to take into account the nature and scope of the Act to remember that it is a Constitution a mechanism under which laws are to be made and not a mere Act which declares what the law is to be Two contentions were raised in that case that the impugned Act was not a law on banking within Section xiii because it was not a law with respect to banking and that the grant of power in Section xiii must be read subject to limitations in favour of the <ORG> because it appears in a federal Constitution so that even if Section could be treated as a law with respect to banking it was stall invalid since its operation interfered with the states in the exercise of their governmental functions <NAME> held that the Constitution expressly provided for the continued existence of the <ORG>s and that therefore any action on the part of the <ORG> in purported exercise of its Constitutional powers which would prevent a <ORG> from continuing to exist or function as such was necessarily invalid because of inconsistency with the express provisions of the Constitution The same contention was raised in a recent case of Victoria The Commonwealth A where the Pay roll Tax Act and the Pay roll Tax Assessment Act were impugned The question raised for decision was about the Constitutional validity of the Act in so far as it purported to impose upon the State of Victoria an obligation to payroll tax rated to the amount of salaries and wages paid to its public servants employed in certain department named in its statement of claim The contention raised by the <ORG> of Victoria as summarised by <NAME> was that though the impugned Act fell under the enumerated power of taxation in Section of the Constitution Act that section did not authorise the imposition of a tax upon the <ORG> in the right of a <ORG> because there was an implied Constitutional limitation upon that <ORG> power operating universally that is to say as to all the activities of a <ORG> that the legislative power with respect to taxation did not extend to authorise the imposition of a tax upon any essential governmental activity of a <ORG> and therefore at the least the power under Section did not authorise a tax upon the <ORG> in respect of wages paid to its civil servants In other words such a limitation whether of universal or of limited operation was derived by implication from the federal nature of the Constitution and therefore to levy a tax rated to the wages paid to its servants employed in departments of governments so trenched upon the governmental functions of the <ORG> as to burden impair and threaten the independent exercise of those functions All the seven judges agreed firstly that the Act was valid and secondly upon the proposition laid down in the <ORG> case Supra as also in certain other decisions that where a power was granted to the <ORG> by a specific provision such as Section ii the <ORG> could pass a law which would bind the <ORG>s as it would bind individuals <NAME> and <NAME> were of the view that a law which in substance takes a <ORG> or its powers or functions of government as its subject matter is invalid because it cannot be supported upon any granted legislative power but there is no implied limitation on a <ORG> legislative power under the Constitution arising from its federal nature However <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <ORG> held in categorial terms that there is an implied limitation on <ORG> legislative power under the Constitution on account of its federal nature <NAME> rejected the contention that it was inconsistent with the principles of construction laid down in <ORG> case that the ambit of power with respect to enumerated subject matter should be restricted in any way otherwise than by an express provision specially imposing some defined limitation upon it and observed there is a substantial body of authority for the proposition that the federal nature of the Constitution does give rise to implications by which some limitations are imposed upon the extent of the power of <ORG> to subject the States to its legislation Although nothing was expressly mentioned either in Section or Section of the British North America Act a limitation was implied on the power of <ORG> and <ORG> to delegate legislative power <NAME> after referring to various decisions of <ORG> as also the <ORG> of Canada See in particular the observation of <NAME> in Alberta Statutes Case SCR Canada at pages said that the Canada Election Act the provisions of the British North America Act which provided for <ORG> meeting at least once a year and for the election of a new <ORG> at least every five years and the Senate and <ORG> were examples of enactments which made specific statutory provisions for ensuring the exercise of the right of public debate and public discussion <ORG> that under Section of the Constitution which provided for Constitutional amendment by ordinary legislation during the first period of years which was subsequently extended to years an ordinary law inconsistent with the provisions of the Constitution had the effect of amendment of the Constitution caused considerable debate The Constitution is more rigid than its predecessor though Article permits the <ORG> to amend the Constitution during the first three years by ordinary legislation may not afford much assistance in determining the question about implied limitation to the amending power in a Constitution because they deal with the question mostly of repugnancy of ordinary legislation to Constitutional provisions The Court observed that where the intention was clear there was no room for construction and no excuse for interpolation or addition and it had been repeatedly and consistently declared in earlier decisions that the choice of mode rested solely in the discretion of the <ORG> The reply of Mr <NAME> is that if the Constitution is supreme as it is it necessarily follows that there must be limitation on the amending power because if there are no limitations the legislature would be supreme and not the Constitution If the legislature power of amending Constitution were coextensive with the judicial power of invalidating laws made under the Constitution the legislature can bend the Constitution to its wheel in every way which will lead to a result contrary to what has been provided in the Constitution namely that there are three great departments of the <ORG> and no one can have supremacy over the other There is ample evidence in the Constitution itself to indicate that it creates a system of checks and balances by reason of which powers are so distributed that none of the three organs it sets up can become so pre dominant as to disable the others from exercising and discharging powers and functions entrusted to them He has also relied greatly on the decision in <NAME> case and other similar decisions The argument that there are no implied limitations because there are no express limitations is a contradiction in terms Implied limitations can only arise where there are no express limitations We are equally unable to hold that in the light of the Preamble the entire scheme of the Constitution the relevant provisions thereof and the context in which the material expressions are used in Article no implied limitations arise to the exercise of the power of amendment It has been strongly urged on behalf of the respondents that a citizen cannot have any dignity if he is economically or socially backward In Article of the Constitution a for Clause the following clause shall be substituted namely No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for acquisition or requisitioning of the property for a amount which may be fixed by such law or which may be determined in accordance with such principles and given in such manner as may be specified in such law and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate or that the whole or any part of such amount is to be given otherwise than in cash Provided after Clause A the following clause shall be inserted namely Nothing in Sub clause of Clause of Article shall affect any such law as is referred to in Clause It was also provided that Article shall not apply to any law relating to acquisition or requisitioning of property for a public purpose The law must provide for an amount which may be i fixed by such law or ii which may be determined in accordance with such principles as may be specified in such law The law shall not be questioned in a Court on the ground i The amount so fixed or determined is not adequate or ii the whole or any part of such amount is to be given otherwise than in cash <NAME> case did not lay down different principles This is particularly so as we find no reason for departing from the well settled rule that in such circumstances the <ORG> made the amendment knowing full well the ratio of the earlier decisions He however gave an unusual explanation that in the <ORG> system of government it is for the government to determine the amount or specify such principles as it choses to do It is wholly incomprehensible how there can be any legislative judgment or decision unless there is room for debate and discussion both by members of the ruling party and the opposition There can be no basis if there is no standard or norm Whatever the subject or the nature of legislation it always proceeds on a principle it is based on legislative policy It is true that the amount to be paid to an owner may not be the market value For there can be no power which permits in a democratic system an arbitrary use of power If an aggrieved owner approaches the court alleging that he is being deprived of that right on the grounds now open to him the <ORG> cannot decline to look into the matter It will have to be satisfied that the amount has reasonable relationship with the value of the property acquired or requisitioned and one or more of the relevant principles have been applied and further that the amount is neither illusory nor it has been fixed arbitrarily nor at such a figure that it means virtual deprivation of the right under Article As to the mode of payment there is nothing to indicate in the amended Article that any arbitrary manner of payment is contemplated As regards Clause inserted in Article which makes Article inapplicable there is no reason for assuming that a procedure will be provided which will not be reasonable or will be opposed to the rules of natural justice Section of the th amendment can be sustained on the construction given to it above We now come to the most controversial provision of th Amendment namely Section which inserted the following Article Notwithstanding anything contained in Article no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in Clause or Clause of Article shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes way or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article Article or Article and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy Provided that where such law is made by <ORG> the provisions of this Article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent According to the Statement of Objects and Reasons contained in Bill No of the new Article has been introduced to provide that if any law is passed to give effect to the Directive Principles contained in Clauses and of Article and contains a declaration to that effect such law shall not be deemed to be void on the ground that it takes away or abridges any of the rights contained in Articles or and shall not be questioned on the ground that it does not give effect to these principles For this provision to apply in case of laws made by State legislatures it is necessary that the relevant Bill should be reserved for the consideration of the President and receive his assent It can well be said that the directive principles prescribed the goal to be attained and the fundamental rights laid down the means by which that goal was to be achieved He says that there is a vital distinction between two cases a where fundamental rights are amended to permit laws to be validly passed which would have been void before the amendment and the fundamental rights remain unamended but the laws which are void as offending those rights are validated by a legal fiction that they shall not be deemed to be void He further points out that on the analogy of Article it would be permissible to have an omnibus Article that notwithstanding anything contained in the Constitution no law passed by <ORG> or any State legislature shall be deemed to be void on any ground whatsoever Article according to him gives a blank charter not only to <ORG> but all the State Legislatures to amend the Constitution If Article A is valid there is no reason or justification for saying that Article suffers from all the vices pointed out by Mr <NAME> According to the Solicitor General Article protects only law and not mere executive action The question of the validity of Article to our mind has to be examined mainly from two points of view the first is its impact on the various freedoms guaranteed by Article the abrogation of the right of equality guaranteed by Article and the right to property contained in Article The power of enacting Constitution breaking laws has been entrusted even to a small majority in <ORG> Such legislation cannot be challenged as Article a will not apply and Article permits deprivation of personal liberty according to procedure established by law It was struck down by this Court as violative of Article a If Article is Constitutional such a provision made in a law enacted under it relating to matters falling within Article a and would be valid As a matter of fact no cogent or convincing explanation has been given as to why it was necessary to take away all the freedoms guaranteed by Article and for the abrogation of the prized right of equality under Article of which has been described as the basic principle of republicanism As regards the question of delegation of amending power it is noteworthy that no amendment has been made in Article itself to enable delegation of constituent power If the courts are debarred from going into the question whether the laws enacted are meant to give effect to the policy set out in Article and the <ORG> will be precluded from enquiring even into the incidental encroachment on rights guaranteed under Articles and Although on behalf of the respondents it is said that the <ORG> can examine whether there is any nexus between the laws made under Article and Article and there would hardly be any law which can be held to have no nexus with Article and the ambit of which is so wide The purpose sought to be achieved by Article may be highly laudable as pointed out by the learned Solicitor General but the same must be achieved by appropriate laws which can be Constitutionally upheld We have no option in view of what has been said except to hold that the validity of Article cannot be sustained The discussion on the th Amendment leads to the result that a the said amendment does no more than to clarify in express language that which was implicit in the unamended Article and that it does not or cannot add to the power originally conferred thereunder though the power to amend cannot be narrowly construed and extends to all the Articles it is not unlimited so as to include the power to abrogate or change the identity of the Constitution or its basic features even if the amending power includes the power to amend Article a question not decided in <NAME> the power is not so wide so as to include the power to abrogate or take away the fundamental freedoms and the th Amendment Act read as aforesaid is valid Clause of Article as substituted by Section of the th Amendment does not abrogate any basic element of the Constitution nor does it denude it of its identity because a the fixation or determination of amount under that Article has to be based on some norm or principle which must be relevant for the purpose of arriving at the amount payable in respect of the property acquired or requisitioned the amount need not be the market value but it should have a reasonable relationship with the value of such property the amount should neither be illusory nor fixed arbitrarily and though the courts are debarred from going into the question of adequacy of the amount and would give due weight to legislative judgment the examination of all the matters in a and above is open to judicial review As regards Clause inserted in Article which makes Article inapplicable there is no reason to suppose that for determination of the amount on the principles laid down in the law any such procedure will be provided which will be unreasonable or opposed to the rules of natural justice In these writ petitions questions of great Constitutional importance have arisen for consideration Herein we are called upon to decide the Constitutional validity of the th th th and th Amendments to the Constitution We have had the advantage of hearing long and illuminating arguments covering over working days We have been referred to numerous decisions of this <ORG> and of the courts in England United States Canada Australia Germany Ireland and Ceylon That question can be conveniently considered later after this bench decides certain fundamental questions of law arising for decision In order to decide the validity of the Amendments referred to earlier it is necessary to go into the scope of the power conferred on <ORG> under Article of the Constitution as it stood prior to its amendment by the th Amendment Act which came into force on November Article as it stood before its amendment it was impermissible for <ORG> to take away or abridge any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution We shall first take up the question whether by the exercise of the power of amendment conferred by Article as it originally stood <ORG> could have taken away any of the Fundamental Rights conferred by Part III According to Mr <NAME> Article as it stood before its amendment merely laid down the procedure for amendment the power to amend the Constitution must be found somewhere else in the Constitution the power to be exercised by <ORG> under Article in legislative in character and the resulting product is law hence such a law in view of Article which says The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void cannot validly take away or abridge any of the Fundamental Rights The Counsel urged there is no reason why a different meaning should be given to the word law in Article In this connection he drew our attention to Articles Paragraph of the Vth Schedule and Paragraph of the VIth Schedule They further contended that the word law in Article must be harmoniously construed with Article and if it is so construed there is no room for doubt that the expression law in Article does not include a Constitutional law They repudiated the contention of Mr <NAME> that there was any Constitutional law as such in force when the Constitution came into force The question whether Fundamental Rights can be abridged by <ORG> by the exercise of its power under Article in accordance with the procedure laid down therein came up for consideration before this Court very soon after the Constitution came into force This Court rejecting the contention of the petitioners therein that it was impermissible for <ORG> to abridge any of the Fundamental Rights under Article held that although law must ordinarily include Constitutional law there is a clear demarcation between ordinary Jaw which is made in exercise of legislative power and Constitutional law which is made in exercise of constituent power This Court held that in the context of Article law must be taken to mean rules or regulations made in exercise of ordinary legislative power and not amendments to the Constitution made in exercise of constituent power with the result that Article does not affect the amendments made under Article In the case this Court also opined that the power to amend the Constitution was explicitly conferred on <ORG> by Article and the requirement of a different majority was merely procedural It rejected the contention that Article is a complete code by itself and upheld the contention of the Government that while acting under Article <ORG> can adopt the procedures to be adopted except to the extent provided in Article in enacting other legislative measures Whether the amendment of the Constitution in so far as it purported to take away or abridge the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution was within the prohibition of Article and Whether Articles A and as amended by the th Amendment Act sought to make changes in Article Article and Article or any of the Lists in the VIIth Schedule and therefore the conditions prescribed in the proviso to Article had to be satisfied On both those questions Chief Justice <NAME> speaking for himself and <NAME> and <NAME> concurred with the view taken by this <ORG> in <NAME> case But <NAME> as he then was and <NAME> doubted the correctness of that decision on the first question but concurred with the view taken by the majority of judges on the second question In that case by a majority of six to five this Court came to the conclusion that <NAME> case as well as <NAME> case were not correctly decided They declined to infer such a power by implication in Article as they thought it was not necessary since <ORG> has under Article read with Item of List I of the VIIth Schedule plenary power to make any law including the law to amend the Constitution subject to the limitations contained therein They observed that the power of <ORG> to amend the Constitution may be derived from Article Article and Article read with Item of List I The remaining six judges held that the power of amendment is not derived from Article read with Entry of List I of the VIIth Schedule <NAME> as he then was and <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> held that the power to amend is to be found in Article and <NAME> held that Article confers on <ORG> the right power to amend the Constitution <NAME> as he then was held that Article outlines a process which if followed strictly results in the amendment of the Constitution that article gives the power to no particular person or persons and that the power of amendment if it can be called a power at all is a legislative power but it is sui generis and exists outside the three Lists in Schedule VII of the Constitution Now turning back to the contentions advanced on behalf of the parties we shall first deal with the contention of the <ORG> and some of the States that once the form and manner prescribed in Article are complied with the Constitution stands amended and thereafter the validity of the amendment is not open to challenge Hence the primary question is whether <ORG> has power to abridge or take away any of the Fundamental Rights prescribed in Part III of the Constitution In order to find out whether <ORG> has the power to take away or abridge any of the Fundamental Rights in exercise of its power under Article we must first ascertain the true scope of that Article The same view was taken by the majority of judges in <NAME> case as well as in <NAME> case It is difficult to accept the view expressed by <NAME> and the learned judges who agreed with him that the power to amend the Constitution is not to be found even by necessary implication in Article but must be found elsewhere We have no doubt in our minds that Article to Article as well as the Lists in the VIIth Schedule merely deal with the legislative power and not with the amending power It should have much less importance in construing a Constitutional provision Hence we need not call into aid any of the rules of construction about which there was great deal of debate at the hearing The next question is whether the power conferred under Article is available for amending each and every provision of the Constitution We find nothing in that Article to restrict its scope As seen earlier the two judges in <NAME> case as well as the majority of judges in <NAME> case opined that law in Article also includes Constitutional law i law which amends the Constitution and we see no substance in the contention that the amendment of a Constitution is not law The amendment of a Constitution is initiated by a Bill and it goes through the procedure laid down in Article supplemented wherever necessary by the procedure prescribed in Article see <NAME> case The same view was taken by all the judges in <NAME> case and also by most of the judges in <NAME> case In understanding the meaning of the word law in Article we should bear in mind the scope of Article The expression law may mean one of two things namely either those measures which are enumerated in Article as well as statutes passed by legislatures or in addition thereto Constitutional laws amendments as well Further when we speak of law we ordinarily refer to the exercise of legislative power <NAME> speaking for himself and on behalf of two other judges in <NAME> case held that on the day the Constitution came into force no Constitutional law was in force In that connection he referred to the treaties and agreements entered into between the former Rulers of the Indian States and <ORG> as well as to certain other measures which were in force when the Constitution came into force which according to him are Constitutional law and on that basis he contended that certain Constitutional laws were in force on the day when the Constitution came into force The laws which were continued under Article after the Constitution came into force did not operate on their own strength For their validity they had to depend on Article and that Article made it clear that those laws will continue to be in force subject to the other provisions of the Constitution It refers to laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution That is because of the express exclusion of the application of Article to the amendments made under those provisions It is true that the power conferred under the aforementioned provisions is amending power but those provisions make it clear that the exercise of the power under those provisions shall not be deemed to be the amendment of the Constitution for the purpose of Article This brings us to a consideration what exactly is the intent of the expression No such law as aforesaid shall be deemed to be an amendment of this Constitution for the purpose of Article Once this position is accepted any law made under those provisions takes the character of an ordinary law and that law becomes subject to the other provisions of the Constitution including Article Counsel either side took us through the debates of <ORG> relating to Article Naturally each one of them relied on those passages from the speeches of the various members who took part in the debate and in particular on the speeches of late Prime Minister <NAME> and the then Law Minister Dr <NAME> which supported their contention Hence we need not go into the question at this stage whether it is permissible for us to place reliance on those speeches for finding out the true scope of Article It is seen from <ORG> records that when <ORG> was considering the provision which resulted in Article Mr <NAME> one of the members of <ORG> moved an amendment to make it clear that the expression law in Article does not include an amendment of the Constitution under draft Article present Article and that the amendment was accepted by <NAME> Chairman of <ORG> When this matter went before <ORG> consisting of emient lawyers they redrafted the clause thus The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of contravention be void There is no need to delve into the intention of the Constitution makers Up till now we have merely confined our attention to the question as to the scope and reach of Article It has given no less imporotance to some of the Directive Principles set out in Part IV Therefore to implement the duties imposed on the States under Part IV it may be necessary to abridge in certain respects the rights conferred on the citizens or individuals under Part III as in the case of incorporation of Clause in Article to benefit the backward classes and Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes and the amendment of Article with a view to maintain effectively public order and friendly relations with foreign States Both on principle as well as on the language of Article we are unable to accede to the contention that no right guaranteed by Part III can be abridged As seen earlier there are already conflicting decisions as to the scope of Article As far back as in <NAME> case this <ORG> took the view that the power of amendment conferred under Article included within itself the power to abridge and take away the Fundamental Rights incorporated in Part III of the Constitution The same view was taken in <NAME> case One other circumstance of great significance is that the st Amendment to the Constitution was carried out by the provisional <ORG> which consisted of the very members who were the members of <ORG> We now come to the second contention of Mr <NAME> that the word amendment has a limited meaning and Article does not permit any damage to or destruction of the basic or fundamental features or essential elements of the Constitution In support of his contention he invited our attention to the various meanings given to the word amendment or amend in several dictionaries He further urged that in construing the meaning of the word amendment in Article we must take into consideration the donee to whom the power to amend the Constitution is granted the atmosphere in which the Constitution came to be enacted the consequences of holding that power is unlimited in scope as well as the scheme of the Constitution On the other hand it was contended on behalf of the Union of India State of Kerala as well as the other States that the power of amendment conferred under Article is of the widest amplitude They knew that in a changing world there can be nothing permanent and therefore in order to attune the Constitution to the changing concepts of politics economics and social ideas they provided in Article a machinery which is neither too flexible nor too rigid and makes it possible to so reshape the Constitution as to meet the requirements of the time But if the language employed is reasonably capable of more meanings than one then the <ORG> will have to call into aid various well settled rules of construction and in particular the history of the legislation to find out the evil that was sought to be remedied and also in some cases the underlying purpose of the legislation the legislative scheme and the consequences that may possibly flow from accepting one or the other of the interpretations because no legislative body is presumed to confer a power which is capable of misuse The power to amend a Constitution in certain context may include even a power to abrogate or repeal that Constitution It has no precise meaning It takes its colour from the context in which it is used Few words in English language have a natural or ordinary meaning in the sense that they must be so read that their meaning is entirely independent of the context It also imposes duties on those authorities The power conferred under Article is only one such power Unless it is plain from the Constitutional scheme that the power conferred under Article is a super power and is capable of destroying all other powers as contended on behalf of the <ORG> and the States the various parts of the Constitution must be construed harmoniously for ascertaining the true purpose of Article In some Articles they are used to confer a narrow power a power merely to effect changes within prescribed limits see Articles and That power includes power to amend by way of addition variation or repeal It is true that the power to amend conferred under the Fifth and Sixth Schedules is merely a power to amend those Schedules but if the Constitution makers were of the opinion that the word amendment or amend included within its scope unless limited otherwise a power to add vary or repeal there was no purpose in mentioning in those Articles or parts amend by way of addition variation or repeal From these circumstances there is prima facie reason to believe that our Constitution makers made a distinction between a mere power to amend and a power to amend by way of addition modification or repeal It is one of the accepted rules of construction that the courts should presume that ordinarily the legislature uses the same words in a statute to convey the same meaning If different words are used in the same statute it is reasonable to assume that unless the context otherwise indicates the legislature intended to convey different meanings by those words Now that we have come to the conclusion that the word amendment in Article is not a word of precise import and has not been used in the various Articles and parts of the Constitution to convey always the same precise meaning it is necessary to take the aid of the other relevant rules of construction to find out the intention of the Constitution makers The question whether there is any implied limitation on the amending power under Article has not been decided by this Court till now He observed in the course of his judgment We may also have to bear in mind the fact that ours is a written Constitution <NAME> side stepped that question by saying that the impugned amendments did not destroy any basic feature of the Constitution The only judge who rejected the contention that there are inherent or implied limitations on the amending power was <NAME> >From the above discussion it is seen that in cases that came up for consideration before this Court in the past several judges did consider the possibility of having some limitation on the amending power under Article though they did not definitely pronounce on that question One of the well recognised rules of construction is the rule laid down in <NAME> case The atrocities committed during the Second World War and the world wide agitation for human rights the liberties guaranteed in the Atlantic Charter the Charter and the Declaration of Human Rights by <ORG> strengthened the demand for the incorporation of Fundamental Rights in our Constitution Since the end of the first World War it was increasingly recognised that peace in the world can be established only if it is based on social justice In evolving the Fundamental Rights and the Directive Principles our founding fathers in addition to the experience gathered by them from the events that took place in other parts of the world also drew largely on their experience in the past Those objectives have now been incorporated in the preamble to our Constitution which reads WE THE PEOPLE OF INDIA having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC and to secure to all its citizens JUSTICE social economic and political LIBERTY of thought expression belief faith and worship EQUALITY of status and of opportunity and to promote among them all FRATERNITY assuring the dignity of the individual and the unity of the Nation IN OUR CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY this twenty sixth day of November do HEREBY ADOPT ENACT AND GIVE TO OURSELVES THIS CONSTITUTION But if there is reasonable doubt as to the nature of the power granted then the <ORG> has to take into consideration the consequences that might ensue by interpreting the same as an unlimited power We have earlier come to the conclusion that the word amendment is not an expression having a precise cannotation It has more than one meaning According to the <ORG> and the States that power inter alia includes the power to destroy the sovereignty of this country and make this country a satellite of any other country substitute the democratic form of government by monarchical or authoritarian form of government break up the unity of this country and form various independent States destroy the secular character of this country and substitute the same by a theocratic form of government abrogate completely the various rights conferred on the citizens as well as on the minorities revoke the mandate given to the States to build a Welfare State extend the life of the two Houses of <ORG> indefinitely and amend the amending power in such a way as to make the Constitution legally or at any rate practically unamendable When they were asked as to what they meant by saying that the power conferred under Article cannot be used to repeal the Constitution all that they said was that while amending the Constitution at least one clause in the Constitution must be retained though every other clause or part of the Constitution including the preamble can be deleted and some other provisions substituted They tried to tone down the effect of their claim by saying that though legally there is no limitation on the amending power there are bound to be political compulsions which make it impermissible for <ORG> to exercise its amending power in a manner unacceptable to the people at large There is no doubt as men of experience and sound political knowledge they must have known that social economic and political changes are bound to come with the passage of time and the Constitution must be capable of being so adjusted as to be able to respond to those new demands When a power to amend the Constitution is given to the people its contents can be construed to be larger than when that power is given to a body constituted under that Consitution If the majority opinion is taken as the guiding factor then the guarantees given to the minorities may become valueless When the President of India is compelled to give assent to a Constitutional amendment which might destroy the basic features of the Constitution can it be said that he is true to his oath to preserve protect and defend the Constitution or does his oath merely mean that he is to defend the amending power of <ORG> Can the amending power of <ORG> be considered as the Constitution The whole scheme and the structure of our Constitution proceeds on the basis that there are certain basic features which are expected to be permanent Implied limitations on the powers conferred under a statute constitute a general feature of all statutes Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Commonwealth of Australia A at stated the law thus The question then is one of construction and in the ultimate resort must be determined upon the actual words used read not in vacuo but as occurring in a single complex instrument in which one part may throw light on another The Constitution has been described as the federal compact and the construction must hold a balance between all its parts The executive power of the <ORG> is vested in the President and he is authorised to exercise the same either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution But it was urged on behalf of the <ORG> and the <ORG>s that though there might be implied limitations on other powers conferred under the Constitution there cannot bo any implied limitations on the amending power That apart during the course of hearing the learned Solicitor General had to concede that there are certain implied limitations on the amending power itself When this incongruity was pointed out to the learned Solicitor General he conceded that in view of the fact that before Article can be amended the form and the manner laid down in proviso to Article has to be followed it follows as a matter of implication that the same would be the position for the amendment of Article It is true that in the United States most of the writers are of opinion that there is no implied limitation on the amending power under the United States Constitution The only case in which the question of implied limitation on the amending power under the United States Constitution came up for consideration was Rhode Island <ORG> There the controversy centred round two questions viz In the former Article there is an express limitation on the amending power i regarding the representation of the States in the <ORG> Hence in our opinion we will be clouding the issues if we allow ourselves to be burdened either by the writings of the various writers on other Constitutions or by the decisions rendered on the basis of the provisions of the other Constittuions though Counsel on either side spared no efforts to place before us various opinions expressed by various writers as well as the decisions rendered by several courts including <ORG> in United States of America The rule laid down by <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> I A that if what has been done is legislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited it is not for any court of Justice to inquire further or to enlarge constructively those conditions and restrictions was heavily relied on by Mr <NAME> That decision however has been confined to the interpretation of conditional legislations and the rule that it laid down has not been applied while considering the question whether there are any implied limitations on any of the powers conferred under a statute or Constitution It was strenuously urged on behalf of the Union and the States that if we come to the conclusion that there are implied or inherent limitations on the amending power of <ORG> under Article it would be well nigh impossible for <ORG> to decide before hand as to what amendments it could make and what amendments it is forbidden to make According to the Counsel for the Union and the States the conceptions of basic elements and fundamental features are illusive conceptions and their determination may differ from judge to judge and therefore we would be making the task of <ORG> impossible if we uphold the contention that there are implied or inherent limitations on the amending power under Article For that matter there are no clear guidelines before the <ORG> to determine what are essential legislative functions which cannot be delegated what legislations do invade on the judicial power or what restrictions are reasonable restrictions in public interest under Article to and yet by and large the legislations made by <ORG> or the State legislatures in those respects have been upheld by courts No doubt there were occasions when courts were constrained to strike down some legislations as ultra vires the Constitution Large number of decisions rendered by courts in A Canada Australia United Kingdom Ceylon and Ireland dealing with the question of implied limitations on the amending power and also as regards the meaning of the word amendment were read to us at the hearing We entirely agree with the views expressed by him and we cannot usefully add to the same It was contended on behalf of the Union and the States that the Constitution should not be treated as something sacred Therefore it will not be correct to say that whenever <ORG> amends the Constitution it must be held to have done it as desired by the people There is a further fallacy in the contention that whenever Constitution is amended we should presume that the amendment in question was made in order to adapt the Constitution to respond to the growing needs of the people On a careful consideration of the various aspects of the case we are convinced that the <ORG> has no power to abrogate or emasculate the basic elements or fundamental features of the Constitution such as the sovereignty of India the democratic character of our polity the unity of the country the essential features of the individual freedoms secured to the citizens Next we shall take up for consideration the contentions of Mr <NAME> regarding the validity of the th th and th Amendments It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that in enacting the th Amendment Act the <ORG> has exceeded its powers If we come to the conclusion that it has not enlarged the power of the <ORG> as we think it has not the various contentions of Mr <NAME> do not arise for consideration Sub article which reads thus Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under Article in Clause as so re numbered for the words it shall be presented to the President for his assent and upon such assent being given to the Bill the words It shall be presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill and thereupon shall be substituted after Clause as so re numbered the following clause shall be inserted namely Nothing in Article shall apply to any amendment made under this Article Because of the fact that <ORG> was not specifically referred to in Article as it originally stood the learned Advocate General of Maharashtra wanted us to spell out that the power conferred under Article as it originally stood was not conferred on <ORG> as such but on the two <ORG> of <ORG> We have earlier rejected that contention Whether an enactment refers to the three components of <ORG> separately or whether all the three of them are compendiously referred to as <ORG> in law it makes no difference In <NAME> case in <NAME> case as well as in <NAME> case each one of the Judges who delivered judgments specifically mentioned that the power to amend the Constitution was vested in <ORG> though there was difference of opinion on the question whether that power could be traced to Article or Article read with Entry of List I There is no ground for taking a different view We have already come to the conclusion that Article as it originally stood comprehended both power as well as procedure to amend the Constitution Every power to amend a statute must necessarily include within itself some power to make addition variation or repeal of any provision of the statute Here again the power conferred under the original Article being a limited one that limitation will continue to operate notwithstanding the change in the phraseology It prescribes that when the Bill is presented to the President he shall give his assent to the Bill Ordinarily he has to act on the advice of the cabinet There is no possibility of the Constitution being amended in opposition to the wishes of the cabinet We have earlier come to the conclusion that Article as it stood earlier did not bar the amendment of the Constitution In this connection reliance was placed on the statement of objects and reasons attached to the Bill which resulted in the th Amendment We are unable to accept the contention that Clause to the proviso to Article confers power on <ORG> to enlarge its own power If that was so there was nomeaning in limiting that power originally We respectfully agree with the observation of <NAME> as he then was in <NAME> case that what <ORG> cannot do directly it also cannot do indirectly This takes us to the validity of the Constitution th Amendment Act As originally enacted it read thus No property movable or immovable including any interest in or in any company owning any commercial or industrial undertaking shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given At a later stage it will be necessary for us to compare Article as it stood after the Fourth Amendment Act and as it stands after the Twenty fifth Amendment Act Article as substituted by Article as susbtituted by the th Amendment Act the th Amendment Act No property shall be compulsorily No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for authority of a law which provides compensation for the property so for acquisition or requisitioning acquired or requisitioned and either of the property for an amount fixes the amount of the compensation which may be fixed by such law or specifies the principles on or which may be determined in which and the manner in which accordance with such principles the compensation is to be determined and given in such manner as may mined and given and no such law be specified in such law and shall be called in question in any no such law shall be called court on the ground that the in question in any court on the compensation provided by that law is ground that the amount so fixed not adequate or determined is not adequate or that the whole or any part of such amount is to be given otherwise than in cash Provided that in making any law providing for the compulsory acquisition of any property of an educatioanl institution established and administered by a minority referred to Clause of Article the <ORG> shall eusure that the amount fixed by or determined under such law for the acquisition of such property is Such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed uder that clause It is a well settled rule of construction that speeches made by members of a legislature in the course of debates relating to the enactment of a statute cannot be used as aids for interpreting any of the provisions of the statute The same rule is applicable when we are called upon to interpret the provisions of a Constitution that speeches made by the members of the <ORG> in the course of the debates on the draft Constitution cannot be used as aid for interpreting the Constitution In the course of his judgment <NAME> speaking for <ORG> observed at of the Report It remains only to point out that the use made by the learned Judges below of the speeches made by the members of <ORG> in the course of the debates on the draft Constitution is unwarranted The reason behind the rule was explained by one of us in <NAME> case at thus A speech made in the course of the debate on a bill could at best be indicative of the subjective intent of the speaker but it could not reflect the inarticulate mental process lying behind the majority vote which carried the Bill No decision of this <ORG> dissenting from the view taken in the above case was brought to our notice But it was urged that this <ORG> had ignored the rule laid down in <ORG> case supra in <NAME> case as well as in what is popularly known as the Privy Purse case But before doing so this is what he observed at of the report Before concluding this judgment I must refer to some of the speeches made by the members of <ORG> in the course of debates on the draft Constitution <NAME> as he then was in the course of his judgment at of the report quoted a portion of the speech of the Home Minister <NAME> not for the purpose of interpreting any provision of the Constitution but for showing the circumstances which necessitated the giving of certain guarantees to the former ruler Hence it is not correct to say that <NAME> speaking for himself and six other Judges had used the speech of <NAME> in aid of the construction of any of the articles of the Constitution It is true Mitter <NAME> in his dissenting judgment at of the report used the speech of <NAME> in aid of the construction of Article but the learned judge no where in his judgment discussed the question whether the speeches made by the members of <ORG> were admisible in aid of interpreting any provision of the Constitution From this it is clear that the learned Judge did not seek any aid from the speeches for the purpose of interpreting the relevant provision It is necessary to note that the learned judge did not dissent from the view earlier taken by the <ORG> in <ORG> case supra Hence the law as laid down in <ORG> case is binding on us and its correctness was not challenged before us Whether such principles take into account all the elements which make up the true value of the property appropriated and exclude matters which are to be neglected is a justiciable issue to be adjudicated by the <ORG> <NAME> as he then was speaking for a bench consisting of himself <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> observed at The fact that <ORG> used the same expressions namely compensation and Principles as were found in Article before the Amendment is a clear indication that it accepted the meaning given by this <ORG> to those expressions in Mrs <NAME> case If <ORG> intended to enable a <ORG> to make such a law without providing for compensation so defined it would have used other expressions like price consideration etc To illustrate a law is made to acquire a house its value at the time of acquisition has to be fixed there are many modes of valuation namely estimate by the engineer value reflected by comparable sales capitalisation of rent and similar others On the other hand if a law lays down principles which are not relevant to the property acquired or to the value of the property at or about the time it is acquired it may be said that they are not principles contemplated by Article of the Constitution In such cases the validity of the principles can be scrutinized The law may also prescribe a compensation which is illusory it may provide for the acquisition of a property worth lakhs of rupees for a paltry sum of Rs If the compensation is illusory or if the principles prescribed are irrelevant to the value of the property at or about the time of its acquisition it can be said that the legislature committed a fraud on power and therefore the law is bad The principles that emerge from the decision in <NAME> case are compensation means just equivalent of the value of the property acquired principles prescribed must be principles which provide for compensation adequacy of compensation fixed or to be determined on the basis of the principles set out cannot be gone into by the court the principles fixed must be relevant to the property acquired or to the value of the property at about the time it is acquired the compensation fixed should not be illusory and courts have power to strike down a law on the ground of fraud on power if the principles fixed are irrelevant or if the compensation granted is illusory This takes us to the decision of this <ORG> in Shantilal case In that judgment he referred somewhat extensively to the decision in <NAME> case and other cases rendered by this Court He did not purport to deviate from the rule laid down in <NAME> case Let us now examine Article as it stands now in the light of the decisions already referred to We have earlier noticed that the decisions of this <ORG> have firmly laid down that while examining the validity of law made under Article as it stood after it was amended under the th Amendment Act it was open to the <ORG> to go into the questions whether the compensation had been fixed arbitrarily and whether the same was illusory Hence if the <ORG> intended to take away the judicial review in any respect other than relating to the adequacy of the amount fixed it would have expressed its intention by appropriate words We find no such words in the Article as it stands It says that the law shall not be called in question on the ground that the amount fixed or determined is not adequate What is an adequate amount An amount can be said to be adequate only when the owner of the property is fully compensated that is when he is paid an amount which is equivalent in value to the property acquired or requisitioned Therefore stated briefly what the th Amendment makes non justiciable is an enquiry into the question whether the amount fixed or determined is an equivalent value of or compensation for the property acquired or requisitioned We have to find out its connotation from the context In so doing we have to bear in mind the fact that Article still continues to be a fundamental right It is difficult to believe that <ORG> intended to make a mockery of the fundamental right conferred under Article But then the word amount is followed by the words which may be fixed by such law or which may be determined in accordance with such principles and given in such manner as may be specified in such law and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate This being the meaning of the word fix it would be necessary for the legislature to lay down in the law itself or otherwise indicate the principles on the basis of which it fixes the amount for the acquisition or requisitioning of the property If this construction is placed on the first mode of determining the amount then there would be no difference between this method and the other method whereby the legislature lays down the principles and leaves it for any other authority to determine the amount in accordance with such principles There is no contradiction between these two methods It was conceded on behalf of the contesting respondents that the court can go into the question whether the amount fixed is illusory This very concession shows the untenability of the contention advanced on behalf of the <ORG> Further when Article says that it is not open to the court to examine whether the amount fixed or determined is adequate or not it necessarily means that the amount payable has to be determined on the basis or principles relevant for determining the value of the property acquired or requisitioned The amount fixed or determined should not make it appear that the measure is one of confiscation Further there is practical difficulty in accepting the contention that the word amount in the context in which it is used has no norm Our Constitution does not provide for one party rule where there is no room for opposition Members belonging to the opposition parties have as much right to participate in making laws as the members belonging to the ruling party They also have a right nay a duty to mould every measure by debate and discussion We have no doubt that the theory propounded by the Advocate General of Maharashtra will be repudiated by our legislatures and the cabinets as something wholly foreign to our Constitution If we bear in mind the fact that the amount in question is to be paid in lieu of the property taken then it follows that it must have a reasonable relationship with the value of the property taken It will be for the aggrieved party to clearly satisfy the <ORG> that the basis adopted by the legislature has no reasonable relationship to the value of the property acquired or that the amount to be paid has been arbitrarily fixed or that the same is an illusory return for the property taken It can only go into the question whether the amount in question was aribtrarily fixed as illusory or whether the principles laid down for the purpose of determining the amount payable have reasonable relationship with the value of the property acquired or requisitioned It says that Nothing in Sub clause of Clause of Article shall affect any such law as is referred to in Clause This provision has no real impact on the right conferred under Article Article empowers the <ORG> to compulsorily acquire or requisition property for public purpose When property is acquired or requisitioned for public purpose the right of the owner of that property to hold or dispose of that property is necessarily lost That being so the only assistance that the owner of the property acquired or requisitioned would have obtained from Article read with Sub article of that Article would be the right to insist that the law made under Article as it stood before its recent amendment should have to conform to some reasonable procedure both in the matter of dispossessing him as well as in the matter of determining the amount payable to him For the reasons mentioned above we are unable to accept the contention urged on behalf of the petitioners that Section of the th Amendment Act is invalid This takes us to Section of the th Amendment Act which now stands as Article of the Constitution This Article empowers the <ORG> as well as the Local Legislatures to enact laws giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in Clause or Clause of Article completely ignoring in the process Articles and Further it lays down that if the law in question contains a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy that Jaw shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy The proviso to that Article prescribes that where such law is made by the legislature of a <ORG> the provisions of Article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent The first part says that laws enacted by <ORG> as well as by the Local Legislatures for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in Clause or Clause of Article shall not be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Articles and notwithstanding anything contained in Article and the second part provides that no law containing a declaration that is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy It was urged on their behalf that interpretations placed by the courts on some of the Articles in Part III of the Constitution have placed impediments in the way of <ORG> in implementing the Directives There is no doubt that the power conferred under Article if interpreted in the manner contended on behalf of the <ORG> and the States would result in denuding substantially the contents of the right to equality the right to the seven freedoms guaranteed under Article and the right to get some reasonable return by the person whose property is taken for public purpose The power conferred under that provision is a blanket power There is force in the contention of the petitioners that this Article has the potentiality of shaking the very foundation of our Constitution What is the nature of the power conferred under Article It is claimed to have empowered <ORG> and <ORG> to enact laws pro tanto abrogating Articles and It is true that there are provisions in the Constitution under which the <ORG> can amend some parts of the Constitution by ordinary law see Article to Article Paragraph of Schedule and Paragraph of Schedule VI There are also some transitional provisions in the Constitution which can be changed by the <ORG> by law Leaving aside for separate consideration Article A which was first introduced by the st Amendment Act there is no provision in the Constitution apart from Article which permitted <ORG> to enact laws contravening one or more of the provisions in Part III Article relates to legislations pending before <ORG> at the time the Constitution came into force The mandates contained in Article are applicable only to the amendments made to the Constitution The power to amend the Constitution was exclusively given to the <ORG> and to no other body Article gives a very large power to <ORG> as well as to <ORG> to pro tanto amend the Constitution by enacting laws coming within its ambit To put it differently Article permits <ORG> and the <ORG> to enact Constitution breaking laws by a simple majority vote of the members present and voting if the rule regarding quorum is satisfied It is true that there are several provisions in the Constitution which lift the ban placed by one or the other Article of the Constitution on the legislative power of the <ORG> Legislatures and <ORG> Articles to etc Each one of these Articles lifts the limitations placed on the legislative power of the legislatures by one or more of the provisions of the Constitution particularly those contained in Part III In such a situation there is no occasion for providing that the law enacted will not be deemed to be void notwithstanding anything contained in Article The laws made under the provisions set out earlier cannot in their very nature take away any of the fundamental features of the Constitution Article proceeds on the basis that the laws enacted under that Article are in conflict with Article and are prima facie void Otherwise there was no purpose in providing in that Article Notwithstanding anything contained in Article no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in Clause or Clause of Article shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any rights conferred by Article Article or Article Hence the contention that limitations imposed by Articles and on the legislative power of the <ORG> and the <ORG>s are lifted to the extent provided in Article cannot be accepted It is true that there is some similarity between the laws made under Article A and those made under Article It was urged that if laws made under Article A without more are valid even if they take away or abridge the rights conferred under Articles and for the same reason laws made under Article must also be held valid It was contended now that this <ORG> has upheld the validity of Article A we should also uphold the validity of Article In that connection reliance was placed on the following observations of <NAME> of the United States Supreme <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> Ed Those laws can encroach upon the rights guaranteed under Articles and only to the extent necessary for giving effect to them Hence the encroachment of the rights guaranteed under Article and must necessarily be incidental Therein the validity of a provision of a statute enacted under Article ii i law providing for <ORG> monopoly in Kendu Leaves came up for consideration The question for decision before the <ORG> was whether that law can unreasonably encroach upon the right guaranteed under Article If there are other provisions made by the Act which are subsidiary incidental or helpful to the operation of the monopoly they do not fall under the said part and their validity must be judged under the first part of Article In other words the effect of the amendment made in Article is to protect the law relating to the creation of monopoly and that means that it is only the provisions of the law which are integrally and essentially connected with the creation of the monopoly that are protected The same principle was reiterated by the full <ORG> in the <ORG> case But that ratio cannot be effectively applied when we come to laws made under Article Further the Court cannot go into the question whether the laws encted do give effect to the policy set out in Article and We were told on behalf of the <ORG> and the States that it is open to the courts to examine whether there is a nexus between the laws made under Article and Article and and all that the courts are precluded from examining is the effectiveness of the law in achieving the intended purpose The power conferred on <ORG> under Article in its very nature is one that cannot be delegated It is a special power to be exclusively exercised by <ORG> and that in the manner prescribed in Article The question whether the legislatures can confer power on some other independent legislative body to exercise its legislative power came up for consideration before <ORG> in re The Initiative and Referendum Act A at <NAME> speaking for the Board observed Section of the Act of British North American Act entrusts the legislative power in a Province to its legislature and to that legislature only <ORG> was held entitled to entrust to a <ORG> authority to enact regulations relating to <ORG> but it does not follow that it can create and endow with its own capacity a new legislative power not created by the Act to which it owes its own existence We respectfully agree with these observations Public interest will suffer if we go back on these decisions and take away the protection given to many statutes Article does not say that the powers conferred under that Article are available notwithstanding anything contained in Article or notwithstanding anything in this Constituion There is no basis for holding that the <ORG> intended that Article should operate as an amendment of Article We have earlier come to the conclusion that the State Legislatures cannot be invested with the power to amend the Constitution If the purpose of Article is to secure for the <ORG> the control of means of production in certain economic spheres exclusively or otherwise the same can be achieved by the exercise of legislative power under Article or under Article read with Article ii If on the other hand the object is to reduce the existing economic disparity in the country that object can be achieved by exercising the various powers conferred on the legislatures under the Constitution in particular by the exercise of the power to tax a power of the largest amplitude One of the basic underlying principles of our Constitution is that every governmental power which includes both the power of the executives as well as of the legislatures must be so exercised as to give no room for legitimate complaint that it was exercised with an evil eye or an uneven hand For the reasons mentioned above we hold that Article permits the destruction of some of the basic features of our Constitution and consequently it is void The IXth Schedule is an appendage to Article which says Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in Article A none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part and notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent <ORG> to repeal or amend it continue in force For this contention of his he relied on the opening words of Article namely without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in Article A He urged that if Article had been an independent provision having no connection whatsoever with Article A as contended on behalf of the contesting respondents there was no occasion for using the words referred to earlier in Article Though there is some force in those contentions the question of law raised is no more res integra It Is concluded by a scries of decisions of this Court and we see no justification to reopen that question There is nothing in Article to indicate that the specific intention of certain statutes was only intended to illustrate the application of the general words of Article A He observed It was contended that Article was merely illustrative of the rule stated in Article A and if Article A had no application that article also should be left out of consideration On the basis of the similarity of the language in the opening part of Article with that of Sub section of Section of the Defence of India Act without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in Article A it was urged that Article was merely illustrative of Article A and as the latter was limited in its application to estates as defined therein Article was also so limited The impugned Acts in this situation qua the acquisition of the eight malguzari villages cannot be questioned on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of Article of the Constitution or any of the other provisions of Part III Thana <NAME> as he then was speaking for the Court observed thus The learned Attorney General contended that Article A and Article should be read together and that if so read Article would only illustrate cases that would otherwise fall under Article A and therefore the same construction as put upon Article should also apply to Article A of the Constitut on For the foregoing reasons we reject the contention of the petitioners that before an Act can be included in the IXth Schedule it must satisfy the requirements of Article A In the result we hold The power to amend the Constitution under Article as it stood before its amendment empowered the <ORG> by following the form and manner laid down in that Article to amend each and every Article and each and every Part of the Constitution Clause of the th Amendment Act which introduced into the Constitution Article is invalid for two reasons i it was beyond the amending power of the <ORG> in so far as the amendment in question permits destruction of several basic elements or fundamental features of the Constitution and it empowers the <ORG> and <ORG> to pro tanto amend certain human freedoms guaranteed to the citizens by the exercise of their ordinary legislative power First no property shall be compulsorily acquired or requsitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of law which provides for an amount which may be fixed by law or which may be determined in accordance with such principles Secondly nothing in Article shall affect any law as is referred to in Article The second part of the Constitution th Amendment Act is introduction of Article which enacts that notwithstanding anything contained in Article no law giving effect to the policy of the State towards securing principles prescribed in Clauses and of Article shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Articles and and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy The principal question which falls for determination is whether the power to amend is under any express limitation of Article Another question is whether there are implied and inherent limitation on the power of amendment The real question is whether there is any power to amend the Constitution and if so whether there is any limitation on the power The scope and power under Article as it stood prior to the Constitution th Amendment Act to amend the Constitution falls for consideration It is said that amendment of the Constitution is law and therefore any law which contravenes fundamental rights is void It is said that law is comprehensive enough to include both ordinary law and Constitutional law It is therefore submitted by the petitioner that the Constitution itself was originally established by law and every amendment has likewise to be established by law in order to take effect The unanimous view of this Court in <NAME> case was that although law must ordinarily include Constitutional law there is a clear demarcation between ordinary law which is made in exercise of legislative power and Constitutional law which is made in exercise of constituent power The validity of the Seventeenth Amendment was challenged before this <ORG> in <NAME> case It was also said that fundamental rights in Article could be regulated as specified in Clauses to and therefore it could not be said to have been assumed by the Constitution makers that fundamental rights were static and incapable of expansion The minority view in <NAME> case was that the rights of society are made paramount and are placed above those of the individual The validity of the Mysore Reforms Act as amended by Act of was also challenged on the same grounds Therefore if an amendment takes away or abridges rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution it is void <ORG> will have no power from the date of this decision meaning thereby the decision in <NAME> case to amend any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights The two views forming the majority arrived at the same conclusion that an amendment of the Constitution being law within the meaning of Article would be unConstitutional if such an amendment abridged any fundamental right When an entire part of the Constitution is devoted to amendment it will be more appropriate to read Article as containing the power to amend because there is no specific mention of amendment in Article or in any Entry of List I The Constitution is the fundamental law and without express power to affect change legislative power cannot effect any change in the Constitution Article which gives power to make law for the whole or any part of India is subject to the provisions of the Constitution Article confers power on <ORG> subject to the procedure provided therein for amendment of any provision of the Constitution It is impossible to introduce in the concept of amendment any idea of improvement An amendment of the Constitution is not an ordinary law made under the powers conferred under Chapter I of Part XI of the Constitution and therefore it cannot be subject to Article It is strange that the power conferred by Article will be limited by putting an interpretation on the word law in Article which will include Constitutional law also If it had been intended by the Constitution makers that the fundamental righto guaranteed under Part III should be completely outside the scope of Article it is reasonable to assume that they would have made an express provision to that effect The majority view was on the basis that there was conflict between Article and Article and this basis was the result of the nature and quality of fundamental rights in the scheme of the Constitution It is therefore to be seen at the threshold as to whether there is any conflict between Article and Article namely whether amendment of Constitution is law within the meaning of law in Article If <ORG> passes a law under any of the items in the Union List abridging a fundamental right and also provides in that law itself that it shall not be invalid notwithstanding anything in Article or Part III of the Constitution yet the law made by <ORG> will be invalid to the extent of its inconsistency with Part III of the Constitution Law in Article of the Constitution could only mean that law which needs validity from a higher source and which can and ought to be regarded as invalid when it comes in conflict with higher law The majority relied on the decision in <NAME> The <NAME> A and the Bribery Commissioner <NAME> A in support of the view that there is no distinction between ordinary legislation and Constitutional amendment Article expressly declares that law taking away or abridging the rights conferred by Part III shall be void Therefore there is no distinction between Article which expressly affirms the doctrine of ultra vires and the necessary implication of the doctrine of ultra vires which has been applied to every part of our Constitution Reference was made to the form of oath in the Third Schedule which uses the words Constitution as by law established The word law in Article will in its ordinary sense embrace Constitutional law and there is no reason for reading the word law in a restricted sense to confine it to ordinary laws The real question is not whether there are any words of limitation in Articles but whether there are any words of limitation in Article It was amplified to mean if a limitation has to be read in either of the two Articles and there is no reason why it should be read in such a way as to enable parliament to take away or abridge fundamental rights Part of the Constitution contains provisions relating to the powers of the three organs of <ORG> Therefore law in Article must mean a law of <ORG> functioning under Chapter II of Part It cannot mean the Constitution itself or an amendment of the Constitution There is some general test or criterion whereby the rules of the fundamental law or the rules of the system of ordinary laws are tested and identified Article became necessary to make a provision similar to Section of the Government of India Act following the repeal of the Act and the Indian Independence Act By our Constitution there was a repeal of all other Constitutional laws operating in our country There was repeal of Constitution in Princely States In non British territory on the Constitution coming into force the Constitution of Princely States lost its character as Constitutional law in the strict sense It is in that strict sense that <NAME> rightly said in <NAME> case that on our Constitution coming into existence no other Constitutional law survived In a broad sense law may include the Constitution and the law enacted by the legislature Therefore a power to amend the Constitution is different from the power to amend ordinary law It was said by Mr <NAME> that legislative power is power to make law and constituent power is the power to make or amend Constitutional law and since law in its ordinary sense includes Constitutional law the legislative power is the genus of which the constituent power is the species The differentia is found in the different procedure prescribed for the exercise of constituent power as distinguished from that prescribed for making ordinary laws The legislatures constituted under our Constitution have the power to enact laws on the topics indicated in Lists I to III in the Seventh Schedule or embodied specifically in certain provisions of the Constitution The power to enact laws carries with it the power to amend or repeal them The distinction between the power to amend the Constitution and the ordinary power to enact laws is fundamental to all federal Constitution It is exercising a particular power which is sui generis bestowed upon it by the amending clause in the Constitution It enacted ordinary laws as legislature If it was intended by Article to exclude Part III altogether from the operation of Article Clause would not have been enacted There is no limitation imposed upon or deception made to the amendments which can be made In cases coming under the proviso the amendment must be ratified by the legislatures of not less than half the number of States The legislative procedure is prescribed in Articles to read with Article <ORG> power to enact laws is not dependent on State legislature nor can it be frustrated by a majority of State legislatures If the President assents the procedure prescribed by Article gomes to an end and the consequence prescribed comes into operation that the Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the bill It cannot be said that Article confers constituent power under its proviso but not under the main part These four provisions confer on <ORG> limited power of amendment There are two features common to all these provisions First they confer on <ORG> a power to make a law which inter alia provides for the specific class of amendments Under Article which provides for the abolition or creation of a State legislative Council <ORG> has power to make a necessary law on a resolution being passed by <ORG> for such abolition or creation by a majority of the membership of the <ORG> and by majority of not less than two thirds of the members present and voting It <ORG> makes such a law that law must make the necessary amendments to the Constitution Paragraph of Schedule and paragraph of Schedule confer on <ORG> a power to amend the schedules by law but no special procedure is prescribed for making such a law No question relating to those four provisions however arises in the present case These four provisions for amendment deal with matters in respect of which it was considered desirable not to impose requirements of Article and therefore it became necessary expressly to provide that such amendments shall not be deemed to be amendments of the Constitution for the purpose of Article These four provisions indicate that the Constitution makers intended to confer on <ORG> power to make amendments in the provisions of the Constitution and having provided for a particular procedure to be followed in respect of matters covered by those four provisions it conferred a general power on <ORG> to make an amendment to the other Articles after complying with the requirements of Article The Industrial Arbitration Act of by Section Sub section authorised the Governor to appoint any Judge of <ORG> to be a Judge of <ORG> and provided that a Judge so appointed shall have the jurisdiction of both offices and shall hold office as a Judge of <ORG> during good behaviour <ORG> held that <ORG> had power both under the Colonial Laws Validity Act Section and apart therefrom under Clauses and of the Order in Council of Section of the Act Vict intended an order in Council to make provision for the government of the Colony and for the establishment of a legislature The Order in Council by Clause gave full power to the legislature of the Colony to make further provision in that behalf The Order in Council of by Clause gave the legislature full power and authority from time to time to make laws altering or repealing all or any of the provisions of this Order in the same manner as any other laws for the good Government of the colony Section of the Colonial Laws Validity Act gave the legislature full power to alter the Constitution Section of the Constitution Act of gave the legislature power to make laws for the peace welfare and good government of the Colony The decision in <NAME> case shows that unless there is a special procedure prescribed for amending any part of the Constitution the Constitution is uncontrolled and can be amended by the manner prescribed for enacting an ordinary law and therefore a subsequent law inconsistent with the Constitution would pro tanto repeal the Constitution The decision also established that a Constitution largely or generally uncontrolled may contain one or more provisions which prescribe a different procedure for amending the provisions of the Constitution The legislature had plenary power there The contention of the respondent in <NAME> case was that the Constitution of Queensland was controlled and that it could not be altered merely by enacting legislation inconsistent with its Articles but that it could be altered by an Act which in plain and unmistakable intention of the legislature to alter consequently gave effect to that intention by operative provisions Section of the Order in Council conferred power and authority in legislature from time to time to make laws altering or repealing all or any of the provisions of the Order in Council in the same manner as any other laws for the good government of the country The decision in <NAME> case related to uncontrolled Constitution which gave the legislature full power to make laws except on one subject and therefore a law made by the legislature under such a Constitution could pro tanto conflict with and repeal the Constitution Section of the Ceylon Constitution Order in Council provided in Sub sections and as follows Subject to the provisions of this Order <ORG> shall have power to make laws for the peace order and good government of the Island No such law shall a prohibit or restrict the free exercise of any religion Any law made in contravention of Sub section of this section shall to the extent of such contravention be void In the exercise of its powers under this section <ORG> may amend or repeal any of the provisions of this Order or of any other Order of Her Majesty in Council in its application to the Island Provided that no Bill for the amendment or repeal of any of the provisions of this Order shall be presented for the Royal Assent unless it has endorsed on it a certificate under the hand of the Speaker that the number of votes cast in favour thereof in <ORG> amounted to not less than two thirds of the whole number of Members of the <ORG> including those not present <ORG> found that there was a conflict between Section of the Ceylon Constitution Order and Section of the Bribery Amendment Act There was no such certificate in the case of the legislation under which the appointment of the impugned <ORG> was made <ORG> said that a legislature has no power to ignore the conditions of law making that are imposed by the regulating instrument But the proposition which is not acceptable is that a legislature once established has some inherent power derived from the mere fact of its establishment to make a valid law by the resolution of a bare majority which its own constituent instrument has said shall not be valid law unless made by a different type of majority or by a different legislative process It was contended that just as the legislature of the Colony of Queensland had power by mere majority vote to pass an Act that was inconsistent with the provisions of the existing Constitution of that Colony as to the tenure of <ORG> so the legislature of Ceylon had no less a power to depart from the requirements of a section such as Section of the Ceylon Constitution notwithstanding the wording of Sections and <ORG> said that in <NAME> case the legislature had full power to make laws by a majority except upon one subject that was not in question and the legislation was held to be valid because it was treated as pro tanto an alternation of the Constitution which was neither fundamental in the sense of being beyond change nor so constituted as to require any special process to pass a law upon the topic dealt with These words do not mean as Mr <NAME> contended that there are fundamental features of the Constitution which cannot be amended Such alterations could only be made by laws which complied with the special legislative procedure laid down in Section <NAME> case shows that <ORG> which by its own Act imposed procedural conditions upon the legislative process is no more limited or non sovereign than a legislature which has such conditions imposed on it by the Constitutional instrument In <NAME> case it was said that <ORG> with plenary powers could treat the Constitutional document which defined its powers as if it were a Dog Act This proposition as a result of <NAME> case is narrowed to the extent that where provisions for procedural special majority are laid down in the Constitutional document they cannot be treated as a provision in the Dog Act might be The opening words of Section are that subject to the provisions of this order <ORG> shall have powers to make laws Section of the Ceylon Constitution prescribes the ordinary legislative procedure for making laws by a bare majority unless otherwise provided for by the Constitution which is to be found in Section of the Ceylon Constitution Section confers rights of freedom of religion and Section states that no laws shall be made prohibiting or restricting such freedom Article of our Constitution expressly makes law which takes away or abridges fundamental rights void to the extent of the contravention It follows from <NAME> case and <NAME> case that a legislature has no power to ignore the conditions of law making imposed upon it which regulate its power to make law <ORG> accepted the distinction made in <NAME> case between controlled and uncontrolled Constitutions by emphasising the observation in <NAME> case with reference to Section of the Queensland Constitution Counsel for the respondent in <NAME> case stated that there was no limitation except the procedure and even that limitation could be removed by amendment complying with Sub section There is nothing to prevent by appropriate amendment a deletion of Section of the Ceylon Constitution which would then empower <ORG> to achieve the power to amend by an ordinary majority It includes both legislative and constituent power Its terms show that limitation is at any rate on the legislative power of enacting laws contrary to Sub sections and of Section The sequiter is that Section is consistent only with the view that so far as amendment of Sub sections and is concerned amendment is permited and there is no limitation on constituent power under Section The Attorney General rightly said that there is no non obstante clause in Article because of the quality of amending power and because the amending power is a constituent power and not ordinary legislative power As soon as an amendment is made it becomes a part of the Constitution The fact that Article confers constitutent powers is apparent from the special conditions prescribed in the Article Article of the Draft Constitution provided reservation of seats for certain sections of people in the legislature for years This shows that if <ORG> or the <ORG> wanted to exclude fundamenal rights from the operation of Article corresponding to Article in the Draft Constitution they could have expressly done so There is no distinction between Article and Article Article by its own force suspends the fundamental rights guaranteed by Article Article on the other hand does not suspend any fundamental rights of its own force but it gives force to order by the President declaring suspension of the enforcement of any fundamental right during the period of emergency The reason is that the power under Article is not a power to make ordinary laws under the Constitution but is the constituent power The draft report of the <ORG> dated April contained an annexure which dealt with fundamental rights Clause of the Annexure to that report was as follows All existing laws notification regulations customs or usages in force within the territories of the <ORG> inconsistent with the rights guaranteed under this part of the Constitution shall stand abrogated to the extent of such inconsistency nor shall the <ORG> or any unit may make any law taking away or abridging any such right The amendment was as follows In Clause for the words nor shall the <ORG> or any unit make any law taking away or abridging any such right the following be substituted Nor shall any such right be taken away or abridged except by an amendment of the Constitution Clause of the said Draft Constitution which later on corresponded to Article of our Constitution was as follows Nothing in this Constitution shall be taken to empower the <ORG> to make any law which curtails or taking away any of the rights conferred by Chapter II of this Part except by way of amendment of this Constitution under Section and any law made in contravention of this sub section shall to the extent of the Contravention be void III it appears that <ORG> on October at a meeting gave a note forming the minutes of that meeting that Clause should be revised as follows The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this sub section shall to the extent of the contravention be void The historical background of Article indicates that the Constitution makers dealt separately with legislative power by providing for the same in Part XI and entrusted the constituent power to authorities mentioned in Article and that authority has the same power as <ORG> because it has not put any fetter upon it The draft Article which provided for a limitation as to time for amendment of certain matters was eventually deleted The opening words of Article which deals with legislative power indicate that any law made under Article read with List I of the Seventh Schedule is subject to the limitations on legislative power imposed by all the Articles in the Constitution The majority view in <NAME> case that Article prevails over Article was on the basis that there was no distinction between constituent and legislative power and an amendment of the Constitution was law and that such law attracted the opening words of Article which in its turn attracted the provisions of Article So long as this distinction is kept in mind <ORG> will have power under Article to amend the Constitution and what <ORG> does under Article is not ordinary law making which is subject to Article or any other Article of the Constitution Mr <NAME> made these submissions The word amendment means on the one hand not the power to alter or destroy the essential features and on the other there are inherent and implied limitations on the power of amendment Reliance is placed on the observations in Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statutes th Ed Third a <ORG> may look to the history of the times and examine the state of things existing when the Constitution was framed and adopted Mr <NAME> said that the word amend may have three meanings First the power of amendment conferred by the four provisions namely Article read with Articles and Article paragraphs and in Schedules and is a limited power Again different expression have been used in other Articles In some Constitutions the words alteration or revision have been used in place of the word amend or along with the word amendment The words alterations or amendments the words amendments or revisions the words revision and alteration are used together to indicate that these words have the same meaning in relation to amendment and change in Constitution The deliberative and restrictive processes and procedure ensure a change in the Constitution in an orderly fashion in order to give the expression to social necessity and to give permanence to the Constitution There are no implied limitations to the amending power Where the intention is clear there is no room for construction The Attorney General rightly sard that just as there are no implied limitation in flexible Constitutions similarly there are no implied limitations in a rigid Constitution In case where the requisite majority is not obtained by the minority thwarting an amendment there is just as much danger to the <ORG> from revolution and violence as there is from what is said to be the caprice of the majority First there is no absolute standard as to what constitutes fundamental right There is no such thing as agreed fundamental rights of the world There were two explanations to that clause The third proposed amendment No was that no amendment which is calculated to infringe or restrict or diminish the scope of any individual rights any rights of a person or persons with respect to property or otherwise shall be permissible and any amendment which is or is likely to have such an effect shall be void and ultra vires of any legislature Again draft Article A which eventually became Article dealing with Upper Chambers in the States gave <ORG> power to abolish the Upper Chambers or to create new Second Chambers In this background there is no doubt about the meaning and scope of Article In <NAME> <NAME> it is said that where plain and clear words occur there is no difficulty but where there is doubt and ambiguity contemporaneous and practical exposition is a great weight Largest meaning is given to the allocated specific power If there are no limitations on the power it is the whole power The contention of Mr <NAME> on behalf of the petitioner is that under Article as it stood prior to the amendment there were implied and inherent limitations on the power of amendment The power to decide upon amendment is given to the year <ORG> which is a creature of the Constitution If the word amendment is read in the widest sense <ORG> will have the power to get rid of the requisite majority required by Article and make any Constitutional amendments possible by bare majority <ORG> can provide that hereafter the Constitution shall be unamendable In the alternative it was submitted on behalf of the petitioner that if the Constitution th Amendment is valid it can be only on a reading down of the amended provisions of Article and which reading would preserve the original inherent and implied limitations Even after the Constitution th Amendment Act <ORG> will have no power to alter or destroy the essential features of the Constitution and secondly fundamental rights are among the essential features of the Constitution and therefore the essence of any of the fundamental rights cannot be altered or destroyed or damaged even when they are sought to be abridged The Constitutional Adviser incorporated in his draft Constitution prepared by him in October a recommendation contained in the supplementary Report of <ORG> The theory of inherent and implied limitations on the amending power is based on the assumption of a narrow and restricted meaning of the word amendment to suggest that the basic features or the essential features and the democratic republican character of the Constitution cannot be damaged and destroyed Therefore it is contended that other provisions which gave effect to the Preamble cannot be amended Reliance is placed on the decision of this Court in <NAME> case in support of the proposition that the Preamble is not a part of the Constitution In the <NAME> case there is an observation that the Preamble is not a part of the Constitution In <NAME> case an argument was advanced on the Preamble that the people gave themselves guaranteeing to the citizens fundamental rights and therefore the provisions of Part III must be construed as being paramount to the legislative will as otherwise the fundamental rights to life and personal liberty would have no protection against legislative action <NAME> said that the high purpose and spirit of the Preamble as well as the Constitutional significance of a declaration of Fundamental Rights should be borne in mind The language of the provisions it was said there could not be stretched in disregard of the cardinal rule of interpretation of any enactment Constitution or other that its spirit no less than its intendment should be collected primarily from the natural meaning of the words used The words procedure established by law in Article must be taken to refer to a procedure which had a statutory origin The Preamble to the American Constitution is without the Bill of Rights and the Bill of Sights which became part of the United States Constitution substantially altered its character and broadly speaking differed in no way in principle from our fundamental rights If the enacting words are clear and unambiguous there is little room for interpretation except the cases leading to an obvious absurdity or to a direct overthrow of the intention expressed in the Preamble <NAME> further says that it is not permissible to refer to the Preamble in connection with the effect of Section and if nevertheless such reference is made there is nothing adverse to the conclusion that there is full power of amendment Section of the Australian Constitution forms an integral part of the Constitution As from the time of the agreement it must have been contemplated that the Constitution should be alterable to the full extent of power conferred by that section Where a Constitutional provision is comprehensive in scope and leaves no room for interpretation the <ORG> is without power to amend add to or detract from a Constitutional provision or to create exceptions thereof by implication See Corpus Juris Secumdum Vol If what has been done is legislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give power and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited it is not for any court of justice to enquire further or to enlarge constructively those conditions and restrictions Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> A said that if the legislature had full power to make laws it was difficult to see how the power was taken away If any body or organised party were bent upon subverting our free Constitution then even if there were no power of amendment <ORG> has powers which would enable such destruction to be brought about <NAME> also said that a large and liberal interpretation should be given to the Constitution The Attorney General rightly said that if the positive power of amendment of this Constitution in Article is restricted by raising the walls of essential features or core of essential features the clear intention of <ORG> will be nullified and that would make a mockery of the Constitution and that would lead to destruction of the Constitution by paving the way for extra Constitutional or revolutionary changes in the Constitution If there is no express prohibition against amendment in Article the ommission of any such restriction did not intend to impose any restriction Where the reading of a statute produces an intelligible result there is no ground for reading any words or changing any words according to what may be supposed intention of the legislature If a statute is passed for the purpose of enabling something to be done but omits to mention in Terms some detail which is of great importance to the proper performance of the work which the statute has in contemplation the courts are at liberty to infer that the statute by implication empowers the details to be carried out The fourth category consists of provisions which were said by the Attorney General to confer enabling power on <ORG> to change the provisions by by the expression unless <ORG> otherwise provides or similar expression Who is to judge what the essential features are On what touchstone are the essential features to be measured Is there any yardstick by which it can be gauged How much is essential and how much is not essential How can the essential features or the core of the essential features be determined If there are no indications in the Constitution as to what the essential features are the task of amendment of the Constitution becomes an unpredictable and indeterminate task He said that there was no esoteric test to find out what is essential and what is not essential and if no precise definition could be given that was no reason to hold that the essential features and the core of essential features could be amended Mr <NAME> rightly contended that there is no foundation for the analogy that just as Judges test reasonableness in law similarly the judicial mind will find out the essential features on the test of reasonableness In Article the Constitution makers substituted procedure established by law for the words due process of law The reason for the change was that the procedure established by law was specific Extracting those observations it was said by Mr <NAME> that though the border line between essential features and non essential features could not be stated or it was not possible to specify exhautively the amendment which could be invalid on that principle yet there was no reason why the principle of inherent and implied limitations to amend our Constitution should not be accepted The proviso confers that power with relation to the judiciary the executive and the legislature none of which could be said to be inessential Indeed it is difficult to imagine that the Constitution contained any provision which was inessential In <NAME> case the majority and the concurring judgment denied the distinction between legislative and constituent power and held that Article applied to an amendment of the Constitution under Article because there was no distinction between legislative and constituent power The dissenting judgments in <NAME> case upheld the vital distinction between legislative and constituent powers and held that the decision in <NAME> case and the majority decision in <NAME> case were correct and that <ORG> had power to amend the fundamental rights since an amendment of the Constitution was not law within the meaning of Article The unamended Article used the words An amendment of this Constitution This has been done because the leading majority judgment in <NAME> case expressed the view that there is considerable force in the argument that the expression amendment in Article has a positive and negative content in exercise of which <ORG> cannot destroy the structure of the Constitution but it can only modify the provisions thereof within the framework of the original instrument for its better effect The leading majority judgment with reference to the meaning of the word amendment and without deciding the matter observed that there was great force in the argument that certain fundamental features the concept of federalism the institutions of the President and the <ORG>ary executive could not be abolished by amendment First does the word amend include abrogation or repeal of the whole Constitution Does amendment mean that there is some feature of the Constitution which cannot be changed But such amendment would in its wake bring all consequential changes for the smooth working of the new system Secondly judicial decisions show that by amending the Article conferring the power of amendment a greater power to amend the Constitution can be obtained than was conferred by the original Article In <NAME> case Irish Report all the learned Judges excepting the Chief Justice held that by first amending Section of the Irish Constitution which conferred the power of amendment subject to certain restrictions thereon so as to remove the restrictions contained in that section <ORG> effectively increased its power in the sense that an amendment could be made which those express restrictions would have prohibited Again in <NAME> case A it was said that a legislature has no power to ignore the conditions of law making that are imposed by the instrument which regulates its power Thirdly the power to amend the amending Article must include the power to add alter or repeal any part of that Article and there is no reason why the addition cannot confer a power of amendment which the authorities named in Article did not possess The picture drawn by Mr <NAME> that a future amendment would be rendered impossible either by absolutely forbidding amendment or by prescribing an impractically large majority does not present any legal impediment to such an amendment The Attorney General rightly contended that this forcefully expresses a clear and deliberate intention of <ORG> that apart from providing for a less rigid amending formula <ORG> took care to avoid the controversy in America as to whether express limitation on Article of the American Constitution itself regarding equal suffrage of the States in the <ORG> could be amended or the controversy in Australia as to whether Section of the Australian Constitution itself could be amended as there was no express limitation on such amendment Other learned Judges who formed the majority held that the words amendment of this Constitution conferred power to amend that Section as well If no intention to amend that section itself is expressed there is nothing which can be implied was the dissent Mr <NAME> contended that the people reserved the power to themselves to amend the essential features of the Constitution and if any such amendment were to be made it should be referred to the people by referendum Both the Attorney General and Mr <NAME> correctly said that the submissions made on behalf of the petitioner indicated that if essential features could be amended by the people the very fact that <ORG> did not include referendum as one of the methods of amendment and that the Constitution makers excluded no part of the Constitution from amendment established that the amendment of a written Constitution can be legally done only by the method prescribed by the Constitution Thirdly because there is no express limitation there can be no implied limitation Mr <NAME> correctly contended that there is intrinsic evidence in the provisions of Part III itself that our Constitution does not adopt the theory that fundamental rights are natural rights or moral rights which every human being is at all times to have simply because of the fact that as opposed to other things he is rational and moral Foreigners are human beings but they are not given fundamental rights because these rights are conferred only on citizens as citizens Article enacts that <ORG> may by law modify rights conferred by Part III in their application to Armed Forces <ORG> may restrict or abrogate any of the rights conferred by Part III so as to ensure the proper discharge of the duties of the Armed Forces and the maintenance of discipline among them Where there is no restraint the society fails The nature of restriction on fundamental rights shows that there is nothing natural about those rights The restrictions contemplated under Article with regard to freedom of speech are essential partis of a well organised developed society The restrictions contemplated in Article are basically social and political There are similar restrictions on right to move freely said that there are no natural rights under our Constitution and natural rights played no part in the formulation of the provisions therein Articles and by their opening words show that the right to the freedom of religion is subject to the paramount interest of society and there is no part of the right however important to devotee which cannot and in many cases have not been denied in civilised society The concurring majority view in <NAME> case however said that there is no natural right in property and natural rights embrace the activity outside the status of citizen There are many Articles in Part III of our Constitution which cannot in any event be equated with any fundamental right in the sense of natural right Article A saves laws providing for acquisition of estates etc Article confers right to move <ORG> There is no higher law above the Constitution The writer refers to the West German Provincial Constitution which has expressly excluded basic rights from amendment This conflict is resolved by ethical or political evolution which finds place in legislative policies and also on the impact of changing ideas on the growth of law There is no law above the Constitution On the one hand there is a school of extreme natural law philosophers who claim that a natural order establishes that private capitalism is good and socialism is bad Outside these extremes there is a far greater degree of common aspirations The Directive Principles embody the set of social principles to shape fundamental rights to grant a freer scope to the large scale welfare activities of the <ORG> The democratic process is maintained because the will of the people to secure the necessary power to enact laws by amendment of the Constitution is not defeated There is before us no aspect of abrogation of the form of <ORG> of the changes apprehended by the petitioners like the abrogation of the judiciary or extending the life of <ORG> But those who frame the Constitution also know that new and unforseen problems may emerge that problems once considered important may lose their importance because priorities have changed that solutions to problems once considered right and inevitable are shown to be wrong or to require considerable modification that judicial interpretation may rob certain provisions of their intended effect that public opinion may shift from one philosophy of government to another The reason is that there are many things which the legislation is presumed not to have intended to bring about and therefore a construction which would not lead to any of these things should be preferred to one which would lead to one or more of them The doctrine of consequences has no application in construing a grant of power conferred by a Constitution In considering a grant of power the largest meaning should be given to the words at the power in order to effectuate it fully First in order to reconcile powers exclusively conferred on different legislatures a narrower meaning can be given to one of the powers in order that both may operate as fully as is possible Second technical terms must be given their technical meaning even though it is narrower than the ordinary or popular meaning In Attorney General for Ontario Attorney General for Dominions A <ORG> refused to read an implication in the Constitution of Canada that there was no power to refer a matter for the advisory opinion of the highest <ORG> because advisory opinions were prejudicial to the correct administration of justice and were embarrassing to Judges themselves who pronounced them for humanly speaking it would be difficult for them to hear a case on merits if they have already expressed an opinion The absurdity of the test of the worst that can be done in exercise of power is demonstrated by the judgment of Chief Justice <NAME> in Gross man Ed where it was said that if those who were in separate control of each of the three branches of <ORG> were bent upon defeating the action of the other normal operations of <ORG> would come to a halt and could be paralysed Where the meaning is plain the <ORG> must give effect to it even if it considers that such a meaning would produce unreasonable result In the Bihar Land Reforms case Mahajan said that agrarian laws enacted by the legislature and protected by Articles and provided compensation which might appear to the <ORG> unjust and inequitable <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> said that you cannot destroy in order to save or save in order to destroy Mr <NAME> relied on the amending provisions in the Constitution of America Canada Australia Ireland and Ceylon and also decisions on the power of amendment in those countries in support of his submissions that a restricted meaning should be attributed to the word amendment and implied and inherent limitations should be read into the meaning and power of amendment Fourth the <ORG> are not at liberty to declare an act void because in their opinion it is opposed to a spirit supposed to pervade the Constitution but not expressed in words where it is stated that the term amendment implies such an addition or change within the lines of the original instrument as will effect an improvement or better carry out the purpose for which it was framed There are other views of Marbury on which the Attorney General relied and which were not extracted by Mr <NAME> There are no implied limitations on the amending power The question which has arisen on the Fifth Article of the American Constitution is whether there are implied limitations upon the power to amend The decision in the National Prohibition Cases is that there is no limit on the power to amend the Constitution except that <ORG> may not without its consent be deprived of its equal suffrage in the <ORG> Again in <NAME> <NAME> there was a suit to strike out the names of women from the register of voters on the ground that the <ORG> Constitution limited suffrage to men and that the th Amendment to the Federal Constitution was not validity adopted The Supreme <ORG> there rejected that contention The Supreme <ORG> said that the function of a <ORG> legislature in ratifying the proposed amendment to the federal Constitution like the function of <ORG> in proposing the amendment is a federal function derived from the federal Constitution and it transcends any limitations sought to be imposed by the people of a <ORG> The decisions in Rhode Island <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and United States <NAME> are all authorities for the proposition that there is no implied limitation on the power to amend Where words are read in their context there is no question of implication for context means parts that precede or follow any particular passage or text and fix its meaning Where the intention is clear there is no room for construction and no excuse for interpolation or addition Mr <NAME> relied on some Canadian decisions the Initiative and Referendum case A <NAME> <NAME> Canada Law Reports <NAME> <NAME> Dominion Law Report and <NAME> City of Quebec and Attorney General of Quebec and <NAME> School Commissioners of Lamorandiere and Attorney General for Quebec in support of three propositions The impugned Act set up a legislature different from that constituted by the A Act and this the legislature had no power to do The second view expressed in the decisions is that the basic liberties are guaranteed by implication in certain sections of the A Act The first view found expression in <NAME> case There was an Act respecting communistic propaganda Under Section A of the Criminal Code a person was detained in custody The Canadian decision show first that certain Judges relying on the Preamble to the A Act that the Canadian Constitution is to be similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom raised the vires of some of the legislations affecting freedom of speech None of these decisions indicates that there is any inherent limitation on the amendment of the Constitution There are no explicit guaranteed liberties in the British North America Act Apart from the phrase civil rights in the Province in Section there is no language in Sections and which even remotely expresses civil liberties values Since the enactment of the Canadian Bill of Rights the question has hardly any substantive effect because the Canadian Parliament can make a declaration in terms of Section of the Bill of Rights that a law abrogating a freedom in the Bill of Rights is operative Mr <NAME> relied on the Australian decisions in <NAME> Attorney General of Queensland and Victoria Commonwealth Australian Law Journal in support of the proposition that there is inherent and implied limitation on the power of amendment The Colonial Laws Validity Act in Section conferred full power on every representative legislature to make laws respecting the Constitution powers and procedures of such legislature provided that such laws shall have been passed in such manner and form as may from time to time be required by any Act of Parliament letters patent Order in Council or colonial laws for the time being in force in the said colony Section of the Colonial Laws Validity Act provided the authority for the legislation First probably the power to make laws respecting the Constitution power and procedure of such legislature does not extend to authorise the elimination of the representative character of the legislature within the meaning of the Act per <NAME> Second probably the representative character of the legislature is a basic condition of the power relied on and is preserved by the word such in the collocation of words in the Constitution of such legislature per <NAME> Third when power is given to a <ORG> legislature to alter the Constitution of the legislature that must be read subject to the fundamental conception that consistently with the very nature of the Constitution as an Empire the <ORG> is not included in the ambit of such power per <NAME> <NAME> held in that case that the word legislature did not include the <ORG> because Section of the <ORG> Laws Validity Act used the expression legislature followed by the words or by persons or bodies of persons for the time being acting as such legislature to show that the legislature was exclusive of the <ORG> Therefore <NAME> said that when a power is given to the <ORG> legislature to alter the Constitution that must be read subject to the fundamental conception that the <ORG> is not included in the ambit of such power Those observations are made in the context of the provisions of the <ORG> Laws Validity Act where a colony as defined to include all of Her Majesty possessions abroad <ORG> in the exercise of its power under Section ii of the Constitution to make laws with respect to taxation but so as not to discriminate between <ORG>s or parts of <ORG> was held competent to include the <ORG> in right of a <ORG> in the operation of a law imposing tax or providing for the assessment of a tax The inclusion of the <ORG> in right of a <ORG> in the definition of employed in Section of the Pay Roll Tax Assessment Act thus making the <ORG> in right of a <ORG> liable to pay the tax in respect of wages paid to employees including employees of departments engaged in strictly governmental functions was also held to be a valid exercise of the power of the <ORG> under Section of the Constitution A law which in substances takes a <ORG> or its powers or functions of government as its subject matter is invalid because it cannot be supported upon any grant of legislative power but there is no implied limitation on <ORG> legislative power under the Constitution arising from the federal nature of the Constitution Four other learned Judges held that there is an implied limitation as lack of <ORG> legislative power but the Act did not offend such limitation In the Australian case <NAME> stated that the basic principles of construction of the Australian Constitution were definitely enunciated in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers <ORG> which unequivocally rejected the doctrine that there was an implied prohibition in the Constitution against the exercise in relation to a State of a legislative power of the Commonwealth in accordance with the ordinary rules of Constitution Mr <NAME> relied on some Irish cases in support of theory of implied and inherent limitations In <NAME> case Irish Report the validity of amendment of Article of the Irish Constitution which came into existence in fell for consideration Article made provisions for the suspension in certain events of any Bill for a period of days and for the submission of any bill so suspended to referendum if demand should be made In before the expiry of years there was an amendment of the Constitution whereby the period of years was changed to years Of the Articles of the Constitution Article created a legislature known as the <ORG> and the sole and exclusive power of making laws for the peace order and good government of the Irish Free State was vested in the <ORG> Article provided that <ORG> of the Irish Free State would have appellate jurisdiction from all decisions of <ORG> and the decision of <ORG> would be final and conclusive There was ex post facto legislation of detention for days of any person suspected of having committed an offence against the <ORG> by widening the class of offences for which trial without jury by three judges nominated by the Minister of Justice would be ordered There is an observation at page of the report that Section of the Ceylon Constitution confers power on <ORG> to pass legislation which does not enable a law to usurp the judicial power of the judicature <ORG> recognised that the impugned law dealt with a grave exceptional situation and were prepared to assume that the legislature believed that it had power to enact it Article contains a limited power of amendment limited to amend Schedules and as may be necessary to give effect to a law mentioned in Articles and and of making supplemental incidental and consequential provisions This decision does not say that there are implied limitations to the amending power The petitioner challenges the legality and the validity of the Constitution th Amendment Act Article has been inserted to the effect that nothing in Sub clause of Clause of Article shall effect any such law as is referred to in Clause Article states that notwithstanding anything contained in Article no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in Clause or Clause of Article shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article or Article or Article and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy It is provided that where such law is made by the legislature of a <ORG> the provisions of this Article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent It was also resolved that political freedom must include the economic freedom of the starving millions It becomes the corresponding duty of every citizen to give effect to fundamental rights of all citizens dignity of all citizens by allowing the <ORG> to achieve the Directive Principles If rights are built upon property those who have no property will have no rights The right to practise any profession or carry on any occupation trade or business under Article will be the right to do forced labour for the <ORG> if the net savings from the fruits of a citizen personal exertion are liable to be acquired by the <ORG> without compensation Article as a result of the Constitution th Amendment Act will empower the <ORG> to fix an amount on a basis which need not be disclosed even to the members of the legislature and which may have no relation to the property sought to be acquired Article has nothing to do with estate zamindaries land reforms or agrarian reforms which are specifically dealt with by Article A The right to acquire hold and dispose of property under Article is subject under Article to reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public If Article permits such reasonable restrictions it is said by the petitioner that the only object of making Article inapplicable by Article is to enable acquisition and requisition laws to contain restrictions or provisions which are unreasonable and not in the public interest Extracting that observation it is said that the amount fixed without giving him a hearing or amending the Land Acquisition Act to provide that any man land or house can be acquired without notice to the owner to show cause or to prove what amount should be fairly paid to him for the property acquired will damage the essence or core of fundamental right to property The legislature may either lay down principles for the determination of the amount or may itself fix the amount It was also said that as a result of the proviso to Article after the th Amendment the law providing for compulsory acquisition of property of an educational institution established by a minority referred to in Article the <ORG> was to ensure that the amount fixed or determined was such as would not restrict or abrogate the right guaranteed under that clause No law shall be called in question in any Court on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is inadequate or the whole or part of it or any part of such amount is given in cash Article provides that all citizens shall have the right to hold acquire or dispose of property whereas Article deals with law by which the property is acquired Such law acquiring property directly extinguishes the right to hold or dispose of property acquired Article is excluded from Article in order to make Article self contained The right to hold property cannot coexist with the right of the <ORG> to acquire property First there is a distinction between cases where the fundamental rights are amended and laws which would have been void before the th Amendment are permitted to be validly passed and cases where the fundamental rights remain unamended but the laws which are void as offending those rights are validated by a legal fiction that they shall not be deemed to be void If Article is valid it would be permissible to <ORG> to amend the Constitution so as to declare all laws to be valid which are passed by <ORG> or <ORG> legislatures in excess of legislative competence or which violate basic human rights enshrined in Part III or the freedom of inter <ORG> Trade in Article Article gives a blank charter to <ORG> and the <ORG> legislatures to defy the Constitution or damage or destroy the supremacy of the Constitution The right to enforce fundamental rights is guaranteed under Article Finally it is said that the fundamental rights under Article and which are sought to be superseded by Article are necessary to make meaningful specific rights of the minorities which are guaranteed by Articles to The pre eminent feature of Article is that it protects only law There are several Articles in the Constitution where the expression law with reference to the authority to make law has been used These Articles indicate that the expression law there means law made by the legislature in accordance with its ordinary legislative procedure The expression law does not include within itself ordinance order bye law rule regulation notification custom or usage having the force of law nor an amendment of the Constitution in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Article In Article the term law has been used in a wide sense Law in Article must have the same meaning as it has in other Articles generally namely a statute passed by the legislature A question arose with reference to Article as to whether a clause of the Sugar Control Order made under the Essential Commodities Act had the effect of repealing the corresponding Uttar Pradesh State Law This Court held that the power of repeal was vested in <ORG> and <ORG> alone could exercise it by enacting an appropriate provision in that regard In <NAME> case it was said that the rights of society are made paramount and they are placed above those of the individual The provisions in Article that no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy was questioned by the petitioner to exclude judicial review and therefore to be illegal Such a declaration in a law shall not be called in question on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy On behalf of the <ORG> and the <ORG> it was not contended that whether there was such nexus or not was not justiciable The real reason for making the declaration free from question in <ORG> on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy is to leave legislative policy and wisdom to the legislature In order to decide whether a statute is within Article the court may examine the nature and the character of legislation and the matter dealt with as to whether there is any nexus or the law to the principles mentioned in Article and The <ORG> can tear the veil to decide the real nature of the statute if the facts and circumstances warrant such a course The third safeguard is that in appropriate cases it can be found as to whether there is any nexus between law and Directive Principles sought to be achieved There is no better safeguard than the character of the citizen the character of the legislature the faith of the people in the representatives and the responsibility of the representatives to the nation The exclusion of Article is on the footing that laws which are to give effect to Directive Principles will constitute reasonable restrictions on the individual liberty Article A relates to law of the class mentioned therein not to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the fundamental rights conferred by Articles and Article states that nothing in Article or in Article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Article ii states that
