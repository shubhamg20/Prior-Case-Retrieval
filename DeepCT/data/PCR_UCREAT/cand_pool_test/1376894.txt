These appeals and cross appeals from a judgment and decrees of <ORG> dated the th of June arise out of certain actions in ejectment brought by the plaintiffs in <ORG> of Mymensing to recover possession of seven plots of jungle lands commonly called garhs as appertaining to their estate of <NAME> The main defence to the suits was based on the allegation that the lands in dispute formed part of the defendant talook of Balasuti and not of the plaintiffs zamindari of Pukhuria The Subordinate Judge in a very able judgment dealing with the real issue came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs had established both title and possession in respect of all four plots and awarded them a decree in modifiction of their claims regarding area In the year there was at the instance of <ORG> a thakbast followed by a scientific survey of this tract of country which seems to have lasted until Ramkrishnabari and the three villages of Pirijpur Bagalbari and Krishnapur now alleged by the defendant to form part of Garhgojali were surveyed then as appertaining to Pergunnah Pukhuria and not to Garhgojali which was thaked and surveyed separately It is clear however that for many years prior to the <ORG> survey of they were unable to localise <NAME> and consequently in the partitions that took place between the different owners of the Pergunnah the batwara of <NAME> among the co sharers was effected by means of a division of the jama or <ORG> revenue payable for it In the thakbast and survey proceedings of and no attempt appears to have been made to trace <NAME> or to have it demarcated by the <NAME> preparing the Thak map which formed the foundation of the subsequent survey There is nothing to show on what data or material the application was made for the allotment to <NAME> of a ten gunda share of the lands demarcated within the thaked boundaries of mouzah <NAME> This petition was rejected on the th July on the ground that the matter had been already disposed of No further step seems to have been taken with regard to the localisation of Jote Pailan until when the plaintiffs brought a suit for the enhancement of the rent of the Talook The Subordinate Judge has accepted the plaintiffs statement that what the defendant calls Mendi <ORG> is the real Kanyajora <ORG> of the petition of and as according to the statements made then by the defendant <NAME> lay to the east of Ram nuggur and north of the Kanyajora <ORG> he has treated the disputed Jote accordingly In the plaint they had claimed biggas as belonging to <NAME> before the officer making the local investigation and who prepared the map of the locality they pointed out an area extending to biggas In the result their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that these appeals and cross appeals be dismissed with costs
