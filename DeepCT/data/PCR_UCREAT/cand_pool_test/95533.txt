On the <ORG> passed an order to wind up the Company in view of the orders passed by <ORG> and <ORG> In the meantime the appellant <ORG> acting under Section of the State Financial Corporations Act SFC Act for short took over the possession of the assets of the Company under liquidation on and advertised for sale in <ORG> and <ORG> of In the meantime as noted earlier on the <ORG> had passed an order to wind up the company On <ORG> filed Company Application No of before the Company Judge to recognise and record its rights as secured creditor to stand outside the winding up proceedings in enforcement of its security for realisation of the amount due to it to approve the sale held in favour of respondent No and to appropriate the sale proceeds towards dues on pan passu basis Learned Company Judge heard all the above said Applications together and disposed mem of by the order dated impugned herein the operative portion of which reads thus The applicant <ORG> is permitted to stand outside the winding up and sell the plant and machinery and immoveable properties of the company inassociation with the official liquidator from the time of settling the terms of advertisement and in negotiating to secure the higher price and subject to the condition that the sale has to he confirmed by the <ORG> and the sale proceeds are to be deposited in <ORG> Learned counsel for the appellant <ORG> Sri <NAME> contends that <ORG> as a secured creditor and in exercise of its power under Section of the SFC Act has a right to stand outside the winding up and bring to sale the assets of the Company concerned without leave of the <ORG> and the said sale would not be void under Section of the Act He further contended that Section of the SFC Act had overriding effect and would prevail upon the provisions of the Act in so far as the latter were inconsistent with the provisions of the SFC Act It was further urged on behalf of the appellant that Respondent No having undertaken to pay the workers dues and other secured creditors having had no objection for sale in favour of Respondent No and the appellant having offered to appropriate the sale proceeds towards dues on Pari Passu basis and the repeated efforts having found that no offer higher than the one given by Respondent No could be accepted there was no justification for not approving the sale in favour of Respondent No and there was no necessity at all for associating the Official Liquidator with the re auction Section of the Act would thus inevitably apply and no sale could have been held without leave of the <ORG> These are the contentions of the learned counsel appearing for the contesting respondents The question of the provisions of the SFC Act overriding the provisions of the Act by virtue of Section of the SFC Act would arise only in the case of repugnancy between the said two Acts But the moment the winding up of the said industrial concern commences or is deemed to commence within the meaning of Section of the Act then the provisions of the SFC Act shall be read together with the provisions of the Act for the reasons to be presently stated Such a course of action is very much permissible by the latter part of Section of the SFC Act itself which provides that save as stated in the earlier part of the said Section the provisions of the said SFC Act shall be in addition lo and not in derogation of any other law for the time being applicable to an industrial concern Section of the Act provides that where any company is wound up or is subject to the supervision of the <ORG> any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties or effects of the company after the commencement of winding up shall be void Assuming for a moment that the matter is not clear as to on what date exactly the winding up of Respondent No company commenced or deemed to commence within the meaning of Section of the Act there is no dispute that the winding uporder was passed on As will be presently seen the sale by <ORG> in favour of Respondent No <ORG> was completed after this winding up order dated and as such without reference to the dale of commencement of winding up Ihe sale so held after the date of winding up order would render it void under Section of the Act By then i on the <ORG> had already passed the winding up order He further urges that there is no change in this position even if Sections and A of the Act were to be taken into consideration inasmuch as the purchaser Respondent No <NAME> also points out that the sale transaction in favour of respondent No was to the satisfaction of all secured creditors and in addition had taken care of the workers dues and there were no allegations of lack of bona fides and as such the right of <ORG> in standing outside the winding up and selling the assets of Respondent No company in enforcing its <ORG> security needs to be recognised This decision of the Supreme <ORG> certainly supports the case of the appellant <ORG> But the said decision had no provision corresponding to Sections and A of the Act Consideration of Section of the Act Section of the Indian Companies Act in the light of Sections and A therefore did not arise before the Supreme <ORG> in the said decision This decision however was questioned in an appeal before <ORG> The <ORG> finding that <ORG> in <NAME> case had no occasion io consider the impact of Sections and A of the Act on the provisions of Section of the Act corresponding to Section of the Indian Companies Act which <ORG> was considering proceeded to examine the matter in the light of the proviso to sub section of Section and A inserted in the Act by the Companies Amendment Act and to further consider whether such insertion made any difference to the position of the secured creditor with a right to sell the property directly without the intervention of the Court and of <ORG> The workmen dues and the debt due to a secured creditor to the extent such a debt could not be realised by such a secured creditor because of the pari passu charge in favour of the workmen or the workmen portion in his security which he has lost because of the proviso to Section will run pari passu with workmen dues under Section A In other words the extent of his claim which a secured creditor could not realise out of his security because of the rights created in favour of the workmen because of their pari passu charge on the security would gel an over riding preference for payment in winding up along with workmen dues Therefore because of the Proviso to Section the secured creditor is not the only mortgagee entitled to sell the security He has a co mortgagee in the form of workmen with an equivalent charge on the same security Therefore when a secured creditor seeks to realisehis security he has also to contend with the Official Liquidator In both these capacities he has an interest in the sale of the mortgaged security by the secured creditor What are the rights of a pari passu charge holder Can a mortgagees exercise his power of sale without the consent of a pari passu holders The meaning of Ihc words pari passu is defined in Jowitt Dictionary of English Law Volume II Edition page as With equal step equally without preference Used especially of creditors who in marshalling assets are entitled to receive out to the same fund without any precedence over each of other Therefore the rights of an Official Liquidalion as representing the workmen run equally with the rights of secured creditors The Court said that no suit can therefore he filed to enforce a mortgage which entails the disintegration of either the amount or the security But it some of them refuse to join they should be included as defendants It is therefore necessary that when a sale of a mortgaged property takes place both the charge holders should join in the sale The same ratio in our view would substantially apply to two charge holders who have a pari passu charge for the recovery of their dues It may be that unlike a co mortgagee a pari passu charge holder can receive payment of his mortgage debt from the mortgagor and release his charge independently But when it comes to realising the security both the pari passu charge holder must join or realise the security simultaneously The sale proceeds are required to be divided proportionately between them in the same proportion as their dues It was further observed in paragraph thus also the statutory right which is given to a financial corporation under Section to sell the property has to be exercised consistently with the rights of a pari passu charge holder in whose favour a statutory charge is created by the Proviso to Section of the Companies Act when the company is in liquidation Therefore such a power can be exercised only with the concurrence of the Official Liquidator and the Official Liquidator is required to take the permission of the <ORG> before giving such concurrence since he is an officer of the <ORG> and is required to act under the directions of the <ORG> while exercising his powers on behalf of the workers Referring to the contention that because of Section of the SFC Act provisions of Section of the said Act would prevail over the provisions of Section of the Companies Act it was observed thus at of AIR We however did not see any inconsistency between the provisions of Section of the State Financial Corporations Act and Section of the Companies Act Section of the State Financial Corporations Act merely confers certain powers on the mortgagee It does not cover a situation where there is a pari passu charge holder Therefore the power to sell whichis given to a financial corporation under Section has to be exercised consistently with the right of a pari passu chargeholder Such a right can be exercised with the consent of the pari passu chargeholder or on orders of the <ORG> after making him a party to the proceedings to enforce the security Having due regard to the fact that an appeal against the decision of <ORG> of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra is admitted and <ORG> has given certain directions while so granting Special Leave to Appeal directing the secured creditor to act jointly with the Official Liquidator under the supervision and in accordance with the directions of the learned Company Judge for effecting the sale we are of opinion that the other decisions referred to above and relied upon by Sri <NAME> learned counsel for the <ORG> the appellant need to be distinguished firstly on the ground that <ORG> in <NAME> case did not have an occasion to consider the impact of Sections and A of the Act on Section of the Act and secondly on the ground that the rest of the decisions were based mainly on the said decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case We fully agree with the exposition of law as made by Mrs Justice <NAME> in this regard It is also true that no provisional Liquidator had been appointed under Section of the Act Nevertheless by the time the appellant completed the sale transaction in favour of Respondent No on Ihe winding up order had already been passed on and <ORG> had already come into picture as liquidator of the Company under Section of the Act There were workmen dues to the tune of Rs Because of the proviso to subsection of Section of the Act <ORG> is not the only secured creditor entitled to sell the security by invoking Section of the SFC Act <ORG> has to contend with the pari passu charge in favour of the workmen dues the workmen being represenled by <ORG> The Proviso to subsection of Scclion as also Section Aof the Act having created pari passu charge in favour of the workmen same would affect the right of the appellant <ORG> to sell the security directly by itself by invoking Section of the SFC Act The appellant is required to join <ORG> in the sale and the property cannot be sold ignoring pari passu charge holder Similarly though <ORG> by virtue of Section of the Act has the power to sell the property of the company in winding up and as a pari passu charge holder under Section of the Act he has the power to sell the said property with the sanction of the <ORG> to realise the charge he cannot sell the properly all by himself ignoring the secured creditors tike <ORG> The aspect of repugnancy between the provisions of two Acts i the SIC Act and the Companies Act and in that situation the provisions of the SFC Act having overriding effect over the provisions of the Act by virtue of Seclion of the SFC Act is not to be seriously considered because there is no inconsistency between the provisions of Ihe said two Acts Section of the SFC Act merely confers certain powers on the secured creditor It does not deal with a situation where there is pari passu charge holder The power to sell which has been given to <ORG> under Section of the SFC Act has to be exercised consistently with the right of pari passu charge holder who in the case of a company under liquidation would be Official Liquidator whose consent can be subject to sanction of the <ORG> Therefore the statutory right given to the appellant <ORG> under Section of the SFC Act being required to be exercised consistently with the right of pari passu charge holder in whose favour statutory charge is created by the proviso to sub section of Section of the Act when the company is in liquidation and the said pari passu charge holder being Official Liquidator who is required to act under the directions of the <ORG> leave of the <ORG> would be necessary and Learned Company Judge was therefore right in declining to approve the sale in favour of Respondent No and giving fresh directions for resale of the property by the appellant <ORG> by standing outside the winding up in association with <ORG> right from the time of settling the terms of advertisement and making the said resale subject to confirmation by the <ORG> While thus finding that there is no merit in the appeal the fact also remains that Respondent No has already parted with a sum of Rs
