This appeal by special leave arises from the order dated December passed by the Chief Justice of <ORG> in the proceedings under Section of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act for short Act whereby he held that all disputes between the parties to the contract have to be referred to the arbitration and appointed Mr <NAME> retired Chief Justice of <ORG> as sole arbitrator to decide the disputes between the parties As no arbitrator was appointed by the appellants despite the request made in the letter dated September the contractor made an application under Section of the Act before the Civil Judge <ORG> <NAME> on January This Court disposed of the special leave petition on January by directing that the application filed by the contractor under Section of the Act shall be placed before the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana <ORG> for appropriate order thereon It was then that the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court decided the application filed by the contractor under Section of the Act and passed the order impugned in the present appeal Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel for the appellants made two fold submission i that no arbitrable dispute existed between the parties as full and final payment has been received by the contractor voluntarily after submission of no claim certificates and the final bill and ii that in any case the Chief Justice in exercise of his power under Section ought to have given due regard to the arbitration clause and appointed the arbitrator in terms thereof Arbitration All disputes between the parties to the Contract other than those for which the decision of the or any other person is by the Contract expressed to be final and binding shall after written notice by either party to the Contract to the other of them be referred to the sole arbitration of an Engineer Officer to be appointed by the authority mentioned in the tender documents If the Arbitrator so appointed resigns his appointment or vacates his office or is unable or unwilling to act due to any reason whatsoever the authority appointing him may appoint a new Arbitrator to act in his place If the value of the claims or counter claims in an arbitration referred exceeds Rs Before we turn to the factual aspect it is appropriate to carefully consider the decision of this <ORG> in <ORG> at some length as the learned senior counsel for the contractor placed heavy reliance on it On the other hand if the Chief Justice his designate comes to the conclusion that the full and final settlement receipt or discharge voucher was the result of any fraud coercion undue influence he will have to hold that there was no discharge of the contract and consequently refer the dispute to arbitration Alternatively where the Chief Justice his designate is satisfied prima facie that the discharge voucher was not issued voluntarily and the claimant was Supp SCC Supp SCC under some compulsion or coercion and that the matter deserved detailed consideration he may instead of deciding the issue himself refer the matter to <ORG> with a specific direction that the said question should be decided in the first instance The Bench in <ORG> in paragraphs and page with reference to the cases cited before it inter alia noted that there were two categories of the cited cases one where the <ORG> after considering the facts found that there was a full and final settlement resulting in accord and satisfaction and there was no substance in the allegations of coercion undue influence and consequently it was held that there could be no reference of any dispute to arbitration and two where the court found some substance in the contention of the claimants that no dues claim certificates or full and final settlement discharge vouchers were insisted and taken either in printed format or otherwise as a condition precedent for release of the admitted dues and thereby giving rise to an arbitrable dispute In para page it was explained that when a contract has been fully performed then there is a discharge of the contract by performance and the contract comes to an end and in regard to such a discharged contract nothing remains and there cannot be any dispute and consequently there cannot be reference to arbitration of any dispute arising from a discharged contract It was held that the question whether the contract has been discharged by performance or not is a mixed question of fact and law and if there is a dispute in regard to that question such question is arbitrable The exception noticed is that where both the parties to a contract confirm in writing that the contract has been fully and finally discharged by performance of all obligations and there are no outstanding claims or disputes courts will not refer any subsequent claim or dispute to arbitration Yet another exception noted therein is with regard to those cases where one of the parties to the contract issues a full and final discharge voucher or no dues certificate as the case may be confirming that he has received the payment in full and final satisfaction of all claims and he has no outstanding claim It was observed that issuance of full and final discharge voucher or no dues certificate of that kind amounts to discharge of the contract by acceptance or performance and the party issuing the discharge voucher certificate cannot thereafter make any fresh claim or revive any settled claim nor can it seek reference to arbitration in respect of any claim In our opinion there is no rule of the absolute kind A bald plea of fraud coercion duress or undue influence is not enough and the party who sets up such plea must prima facie establish the same by placing material before the Chief Justice his designate In light of the above legal position we now turn to the facts of the present case The present in our opinion appears to be a case falling in the category of exception noted in the case of <ORG> <ORG> page In view of our finding above it is not necessary to consider the alternative submission made by the senior counsel for the appellants that the Chief Justice in exercise of his power under Section ought to have appointed the arbitrator in terms of the arbitration clause and the appointment of Mr <NAME> retired Chief Justice of <ORG> was not in accord with the arbitration agreement The parties shall bear their own costs
