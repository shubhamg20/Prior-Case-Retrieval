Against the above order of <ORG> the assessee preferred an appeal to this <ORG> which was formally dis posed of with a direction to the <ORG> to draw up a supplementary statement of the case and refer for the opin ion of this <ORG> the further question of law as sought for by the assessee and such a question to be considered in the present appeal There is also no single definitive criterion which by itself is determinative whether a particular outlay is capital or revenue The improvisation in the process and technology in some areas of the enterprise was supplemental to the exist ing business and there was no material to hold that it amounted to a new or fresh venture The further circumstance that the agreement pertained to a product already in the line of assessee established business and not to a new product indicates that what was stipulated was an improve ment in the operation of the existing business and its efficiency and profitability not removed from the area of the day to day business of the assessee established enter prise There was no material for the <ORG> to record the finding that the assessee had obtained under the agreement a completely new plant with a completely new process and a completely new technical know how from <ORG> The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATACHALIAH This appeal by the assessee <ORG> arises out of and are directed against the judgment dated of <ORG> in Income Tax Reference of answer ing in favour of the <ORG> a question of law referred to it under Section of the Income Tax Act Act by <ORG> In the year with a view to increasing the yield of penicillin the assessee negotiated with <ORG> <ORG> for short a reputed enterprise engaged in the manufacture of antibiotics in Japan which agreed to supply to the assessee the requisite technical know how so as to achieve substantially higher levels of performance of production of more than units of penicillin per millilitre of cultured broth with the aid of better technology and process of fermentation and with better yielding penicillin strains developed by <ORG> <ORG> Ahmedabad Bench dismissed the further appeal of the assessee holding that the arrangements with <ORG> envisaged the setting up of a large commercial plant for the production of the antibiotic modelled on the lines of the pilot plant and that there fore the out lay could not be treated as an expenditure laid out on and for purposes of the existing business but must be regarded as one incurred for a new venture on a new process with a new technology on a new type of plant It was not made in the course of carrying out of an existing business of the assessee but was for the purpose of setting up a new plant and a new process The reasoning of <ORG> in support of its conclusion was on the following lines It is true that the expenditure was manifestly laid out for the purpose of obtain ing benefits and advantages such as sub cul tures of penicillin producing strains design of a pilot and exchange of technical personnel with a view to acquiring know how In view of the find ings recorded by the <ORG> no conclusion other than that the expenditure was incurred once and for all with a view to bringing into existence an asset or advantage for the endur ing benefit of the manufacturing trade of the assessee is possible The question of law respecting which the supplementary reference was sought was this Whether there was any evidence or material before the <ORG> to hold that a completely new plant with a completely new process and new technical know how was ob tained by the assessee from Messrs <NAME> under the said agreement dated and to work out that process separate plant or machinery had to be designed constructed installed and operated <ORG> dismissed this application observing that the <ORG> had no where recorded a finding to the effect that a completely new plant was obtained by the assessee from <ORG> and that the finding of the <ORG> that under the agreement the assessee had obtained a new process and a new technical know now from <ORG> was not without evidence On this <ORG> while directing the <ORG> to draw up a supplementary statement of the case and refer for the opinion of this <ORG> the further question of law which according to the assessee arose out of the Tribu nal order and which was the subject matter of the asses see appeal in A of however disposed of that appeal formally leaving the question of law arising out of the supplemental reference to be considered in the present appeal i CA No of In the oft quoted case on the subject viz <ORG> <NAME> AC Viscount Cave said But when an expenditure is made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into exist ence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of trade I think that there is very good reason in the absence of special circum stances leading to an opposite conclusion for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital If on the other hand it is made not for the purpose of bring ing into existence any such asset or advantage but for running the business or working it with a view to produce the profits it is a revenue expenditure The aim and object of the expendi ture would determine the character of the expenditure whether it is a capital expendi ture or a revenue expenditure There are I think three matters to be considered a the character of the advan tage sought and in this its lasting qualities may play a part the manner in which it is to be used relied upon or enjoyed and in this and under the former head recurrence may play its part and the means adopted to obtain it that is by providing a periodical reward or outlay to cover its use or enjoyment for periods commensurate with the payment or by making a final provision or payment so as to secure future use or enjoyment The question is ultimately a question of law for the court but is a question which must be answered in the fight of all the circumstances which it is reasonable to take into account and the weight which must be given to a par ticular circumstance in a particular case must depend rather on common sense than on strict application of any single legal principle It has to be derived from many aspects of the whole set of circumstances some of which may point in one direction some in the other One considera tion may point so clearly that it dominates other and vaguer indications in the contrary direction It is a common sense appreciation of all the guiding features which must provide the ultimate answer Emphasis Supplied The idea of once for all payment and enduring bene fit are not to be treated as something akin to statutory conditions nor are the notions of capital or revenue a judical fetish There is a difference between the lasting and the everlasting Learned counsel invited our attention to the following passage in the order of the <ORG> where this postulate is found On the other hand a completely new plant with a completely new process and a completely new technical know how was obtained by the assessee from <ORG> and it was in consideration of obtaining this techni cal know how that the assessee made the pay ment of Learned counsel also urged that there was no material for the <ORG> to hold that the use of new process and tech nology from <ORG> amounted to a new venture not already in the line of the assessee existing business or that it required the erection of a new plant discarding and sup planting the huge investment already existing Learned counsel submitted that it was no body case that with the introduction of the <ORG> process of fermentation with improved penicillin strains the existing plant and machinery of over Rs lakhs had become obsolete and irrelevant or that the assessee had had to set up an altogether new plant to work out the improvised <ORG> process of fermentation There were according to <ORG> both the acquisition of an enduring asset and the commencement of a new venture On a consideration of the matter we are persuaded to hold that there was no material for the <ORG> to record the finding that the assessee had obtained under the agree ment a completely new plant with a completely new process and a completely new technical know how from <ORG> We are inclined to agree with <NAME> that there was no material for the <ORG> to hold that the area of improvisation was not a part of the existing business or that the entire gamut of the existing manufacturing operations for the commercial produc tion of penicillin in the assessee existing plant had become obsolete or inappropriate in relation to the exploi tation of the new sub cultures of the high yielding strains of penicillin supplied by <ORG> and that the mere introduc tion of the new bio synthetic source required the erection and commissioning of a totally new and different type of plant and machinery <ORG> will give advice to the extent considered necessary be <ORG> on any diffi culty <ORG> may encounter in applying the subcultures and informations obtained by <ORG> from <ORG> to the large scale manufacture The improvisation in the process and technology in some areas of the enterprise was supplemental to the existing business and there was no material to hold that it amounted to a new or fresh venture The further circumstance that the agreement pertained to a product already in the line of assessee established business and not to a new product indicates that what was stipulated was an improvement in the operations of the existing business and its efficiency and profitability not removed from the area of the day to day business of the assessee established enterprise There is also no single definitive criterion which by itself is determinative whether a particular outlay is capital or revenue In the result for the foregoing reasons the appeal succeeds and is allowed and the question of law referred to <ORG> for its opinion in Income Tax Reference No of is answered in the affirmative and against the revenue The appeal is accordingly allowed but with no order as to costs
