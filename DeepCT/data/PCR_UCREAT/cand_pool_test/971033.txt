Thus the total tax imposed on the appellant came to Rs of the Constitution <ORG> has the exclusive power to make laws with respect any of the matters in List of the Seventh Schedule The Income Tax Act and the annual Finance Act are enacted by the <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by Art read with entry of List I Once the <ORG> has the legislative competence to enact a law with respect to certain subject matter the limits of that competence cannot be judged further by the form or manner in which that power is exercised Under section read with section of the Income tax Act income tax is not payable by the appellant The primary purpose of the annual Finance Act as envisaged by section of the Income tax Act is to prescribe the rates of income tax on the total income of an assessee and this function as contemplated by section is to be subject to the other provisions of this Act namely the Income tax Act which would include inter alia section The history of Indian income tax shows that surcharges by way of increase to the amount of income tax which are added to the basic amount in view of article of the Constitution of India are nothing other than income tax and a part of income tax alone There is no room for any intendment There is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to tax The appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> under Article of the Constitution to challenge an assessment order dated August made by the respondent levying additional surcharge on its residual income <ORG> dismissed the writ petition by its judgment dated October IS but it has granted to the appellant a certificate to file an appeal to this Court under Articles a and of the Constitution Thus the total tax levied on the appellant came to Rs By Article of the Constitution <ORG> has the exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters in List I of the Seventh Schedule The Income tax Act and the annual Finance Act are enacted by the <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred by Article read with Entry of List I Once the <ORG> has the legislative competence to enact a law with respect to a certain subject matter the limits of that competence cannot be judged further by the form or manner in which that power is exercised If the <ORG> has the legislative competence to introduce a new charge of tax it may exercise that power either by incorporating that charge in the Income tax Act or by introducing it in the Finance Act or for the matter of that in any other Statute an assessee challenged the scheme of Annuity Deposits of the ground that the <ORG> has no competence to incorporate ill the Income tax Act a provision which was substantially one relating to borrowings by <ORG> from a class of tax payers The challenge was repelled by this Court on the ground that if the parliament had the legislative competence to pass an Act for collecting Annuity Deposits from tax payers nothing contained in the Constitution disentitled it as a matter of legislative arrangement to incorporate the provisions relating to borrowing from tax payers in the Income tax Act or any other statute We will now proceed to consider the provisions of the Finance Act under which the respondent has levied additional surcharge on the appellant residual income The question which arose for consideration was under the total income The question which arose for consideration was whether the words income tax payable according to the rates applicable under the operation of the Finance Act included surcharges which were leviable under the Act of If while legislating on a matter within its competence the <ORG> can grant an exemption it is surely competent to it to withdraw that exemption in exercise of the self same power which is arrived at after deducting Gross taxes exclusive of additional surcharge amounting to Rs That section uses the language that income tax shall further be increased by an additional sur charge not for making the assessability to surcharge dependent upon Assessability to income tax but for the simple reason that if an assessee total income includes income on which no tax is payable tax has all the same to be computed for purposes of rate Section of the Income tax Act provides that where there is included in the total income of an assessee any income on which no income tax is payable the assessee shall be entitled to deduction from the amount of income tax with which he is chargeable on his total income of an amount equal to the income tax calculated at the average rate of income tax on the amount on which no income tax is payable We have rejected that contention The interpretation put by us on the Finance Act does no violence to section of the Income tax Act under which income tax at the rates prescribed by the Finance Act is to be charged in accordance with and subject to the provisions of It is a tax on residual income and by reason of the definition contained in section of the Act of residual income would include non business income which under the Income tax Act is charge able to income tax For these reasons we confirm the judgment of <ORG> but in the circumstances there will be no order as to costs
