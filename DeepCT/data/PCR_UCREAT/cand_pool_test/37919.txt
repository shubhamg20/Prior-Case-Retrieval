DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> <NAME> JUDGMENT SINHA These appeals arise out of the judgments and orders dated and passed by <ORG> at Bangalore in Writ Appeal Nos of and of respectively whereby and whereunder the appeals preferred by the Appellants herein against the orders dated and passed by the learned Single Judge of the said court in several writ petitions were dismissed They filed writ petitions before <ORG> contending inter alia that as they having worked for a number of years became entitled for regularization The prayers made in the said writ petitions which are relevant for our purpose are as under a Issue a writ of mandamus order or direction directing Respondents No to regularization sic for regularize the service of the petitioner no to the post of Assistant Engineer in the pay scale of Rs with allowance the petitioners no and as Junior Engineers in the pay scale of Rs and allowance Issue a writ in the nature of mandamus order or direction not to discontinue the service of the petitioners and to direct payment of arrears of salary from September onwards and also to pay difference or arrears of salary to the petitioners from the date of completion of days to grant all service benefits as are applicable to regular employees like seniority promotion increments allowance etc Upon an inquiry made in this behalf at the behest of <ORG> it was contended by the Appellants by filing an additional affidavit that no payment for daily wages had been made to the Respondents after the order of their discharge and such certificates had been procured from a Junior Engineer against whom a departmental inquiry had been initiated An appeal preferred thereagainst was also dismissed by the Division Bench of the said <ORG> by an order dated Despite the same the Respondents herein filed applications before <ORG> at Gulbarga which were marked as Reference Written statements in the said proceedings were filed by the Appellants wherein inter alia it was contended that the employment of the Respondents was for daily wages and for a specific scheme A further contention was raised therein that having regard to the decision of the <ORG> in the earlier writ petitions Respondents were not entitled to any relief The legality and or validity of the said awards came to be questioned by the Appellants herein by filing two writ petitions before <ORG> which were marked as Writ Petition Nos of and of which were dismissed by an order dated and The appeals thereagainst filed by the Appellants herein were also dismissed by orders dated and Hence these appeals SUBMISSIONS Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellants would inter alia submit that the Reference Applications were barred under the principle of res judicata The learned counsel would contend that the principle of res judicata would apply to a proceeding under the Industrial Disputes Act and in that view of the matter <ORG> committed a manifest error in not interfering with the awards passed by <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents on the other hand would submit that the principle of res judicata has no application in the instant case inasmuch as in the writ petitions the prayer made by the Respondents herein was for regularization of their services whereas before <ORG> the legality or otherwise of the orders of termination came to be questioned ANALYSIS The said writ petitions were filed by the Respondents on the following premise The Respondents had been appointed in the year When the writ petitions were filed they were still in service They were appointed as Daily Wages Graduate Engineers They were not being paid the regular scale of pay although they had been doing the same work as was being done by the regular employees Having regard to the fact that they had rendered about four years of continuous service and being under threat of termination of service they were entitled to be regularized in their service as also other benefits attached thereto having completed days of continuous service in a year In that view of the matter the proceedings initiated before <ORG> questioning the orders of termination passed against them by the Appellants praying for their reinstatement with full back wages in our opinion was wholly misconceived Here the parties to the writ petition filed by the respondent in <ORG> and the industrial dispute were the same The plea raised before us by the Respondents to the effect that their termination of employment fell within sub clause bb of clause oo of the Industrial Disputes Act apart from having not been raised before <ORG> and <ORG> in our opinion is not available to them having regard to the decision of <ORG> in the writ petitions filed by the Respondents It is also not the case of the Respondents that they were appointed in accordance with the extant rules SCALE Submission of Mr <NAME> to the effect that keeping in view the fact that the Respondents are diploma holders and they have crossed the date of by now this <ORG> should not interfere with the impugned judgment is stated to be rejected In <ORG> Vs <ORG> Chandigarh and Others SCC it is stated We have no doubt in our mind that sympathy or sentiment by itself cannot be a ground for passing an order in relation whereto the appellants miserably fail to establish a legal right JT SC this Court rejected a similar plea for regularization of services stating We repeatedly asked the learned counsel for the appellants on what basis or foundation in law the appellants made their claim for regularization and under what rules their recruitment was made so as to govern their service conditions For the foregoing reasons we are of the opinion that <ORG> and <ORG> committed a manifest error in passing the impugned judgments and awards and as such they are liable to be set aside These appeals are allowed and the impugned judgments and award are set aside
