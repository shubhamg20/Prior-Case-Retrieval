Subsequently he issued a notice under Section of the Income tax Act stating that the order dated January was to be rectified as the petitioner was liable to pay additional surcharge amounting to Rs As the period of limitation for filing an appeal was about to expire the petitioner filed an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner annexing a copy of the notice of demand dated March Ultimately on June <ORG> informed the petitioner that there was no order passed under Section of the Income tax Act copy of which could be supplied to it The Appellate Assistant Commissioner thereafter dismissed the appeal filed by the petitioner on October holding that so long as no order under Section of the Act was passed on the application of the assessee no appeal lay He found that as a matter of fact <ORG> did make an order under Section of the Act on January to the following effect Certain mistakes in calculation of tax have come to notice which are rectified as per this form by charging additional surcharge The petitioner then filed an application dated August before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner for rectifying its appellate order dated October on the ground that it suffered from a manifest error inasmuch as it proceeded to decide the appeal on a wrong assumption that no order rectifying the assessment order dated January had been passed It was claimed that the Commissioner of Income tax had not decided the real issue involved in the case By this petition the petitioner prays for the quashing of the order made by the Income tax Officer dated January and notice of demand issued in pursuance of it as also of the appellate and revisional orders passed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Commissioner of Income tax dated October and August One of the grounds urged by the petitioner in support of its prayer lor quashing the orders passed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and the Commissioner of Income tax is that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner misconceived the proceedings and passed an order dismissing the appeal under a wrong impression that an application for rectifying the original assessment order dated January had been moved on behalf of the petitioner and that no orders on that application had been passed It was contended that the proceedings for rectification were initiated by the Income tax Officer suo motu and an order for rectification had been made Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that the Income tax Officer did not supply copy of the order rectifying the original assessment and thereby he deprived the petitioner of an effective right of appeal In the circumstances it will not be desirable to interfere with orders passed by income tax authorities unless it is found that the contention that the Income tax Officer has no jurisdiction to demand additional surcharge has substance Section of the Income tax Act provides that where any Central Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any assessment year at any rate or rates income tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Income tax Act in respect of the total income of the previous year or previous years as the case may be of every person Relevant portion of Section of the Income tax Act runs as follows Income tax shall not be payable by a co operative society i in respect of the profits and gains of business carried on by it if it is a a society engaged in carrying on the business of banking or providing credit facilities to its members Provided that in the case of a co operative society which is also engaged in activities other than those mentioned in this clause nothing contained therein shall apply to that part of its profits and gains as is attributable to such activities and as exceeds Rs According to Section of the Income tax Act the petitioner society is exempt from payment of income tax and as such the respondents have no jurisdiction to demand any additional surcharge from the petitioner He further invited the attention of the court to the heading surcharge on income tax as contained in the First Schedule to the Finance Act of under which the additional surcharge was being computed He contended that the heading shows that the surcharge was being levied on income tax and that it was not a tax on total income i income tax In order to resolve this controversy it becomes necessary to examine the relevant provisions of the Constitution of India which authorizes levying of surcharge and the relevant provisions of the Finance Act and the Income tax Act Article of the Constitution provides that certain taxes and duties mentioned therein are to be levied and collected by the Government of India but they are to be assigned to the States in the manner provided in that article Article of the Constitution however provides that notwithstanding anything in Articles and <ORG> may at any time increase any of the duties or taxes referred to in those articles by a surcharge for purposes of the <ORG> and the whole proceeds of such surcharge shall form part of the consolidated fund of India Section of the Finance Act of which is the relevant Finance Act for our purposes provides for the charge of income tax at the rates specified in Part of the First Schedule It further provides that in certain cases the income tax is to be increased by a surcharge for the purposes of the <ORG> calculated in the manner provided therein The language used in Section is that the income tax is to be increased by the aggregate of the surcharges In other words the section provides that the total income tax payable by an assessee would be that calculated at rates specified in Part I plus the surcharges calculated in the manner provided in that part This section does not provide for the levy of a tax other than income tax The basic method of computing income tax provided in Section is to work out the tax at the rate specified in Part I of the First Schedule and thereafter increase it by the addition of surcharges calculated in the manner specified in the Schedule If the contention on behalf of the revenue is accepted and it is held that the additional surcharge mentioned in the Finance Act of does not partake of the nature of income tax it will not be possible to demand and realise it under the provisions of the Income tax Act and the notice of demand and recovery proceedings would be vitiated on that account We are therefore of opinion that the additional surcharge calculated in the manner provided in the First Schedule to the Finance Act of is nothing but an amount which goes to constitute the entire income tax which is payable by an assessee Next question that arises for consideration is as to how the exemption granted under Section of the Act is to be worked out The heading of this Chapter is Incomes forming part of the total income on which no tax is payable as distinguished from the heading in Chapter III of the Act which provides for incomes which do not form part of total income of a person How the exemption of the nature contemplated by Section of the Act is to be worked out has been laid down in Section of the Income tax Act which runs as follows Where there is included in the total income of an assessee any income on which no income tax or as the case may be no super tax is payable under the provisions of this Act the assessee shall be entitled to a deduction a from the amount of income tax with which he is chargeable on his total income of an amount equal to the income tax calculated at the average rate of income tax on the amount on which no income tax is payable and from the amount of super tax with which he is chargeable on his total income of an amount equal to the super tax calculated at the average rate of super tax on the amount on which no super tax is payable It will thus be seen that the only effect of making a provision like that of Section of the Act is that the income tax authorities will have to compute the income tax in respect of the total income of the petitioner including surcharge and the additional surcharge calculated in the manner provided in the Finance Act of and from that an amount equal to the income tax calculated at the average rate of income tax on the amount of which no income tax is payable will have to be deducted the petitioner would have been liable to pay some amount of tax calculated in the manner provided in Section In the circumstances we are of opinion that the notice of demand issued by the Income tax Officer in pursuance of his order dated January is clearly erroneous and without authority In the result we allow this petition with costs and quash the order of the Income tax Officer dated January the appellate order of the Assistant Commissioner dated th October and the revisional order of the Commissioner of Income tax dated th August
