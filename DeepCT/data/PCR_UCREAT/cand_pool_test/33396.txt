HEADNOTE The petitioners challenged the constitutional validity of the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Act of and two notifications issued by <ORG> on September and November the former under sub sec of the Constitution could arise where <ORG>ary Legislation and State Legislation occupied different fields and dealt with separate and distinct matters even though of a cognate and allied character and that where as in the present case there was no inconsistency in the actual terms of the acts enacted by <ORG> and the <ORG> the test of repugnancy would be whether <ORG> and the <ORG> in legislating under an entry in the Concurrent List exercised their powers over the same subject matter or whether the laws enacted by <ORG> were intended to be exhaustive so as to cover the entire field that the provisions of of Act LXV of did not cover sugarcane nor indicate the intention of the <ORG> to cover the entire field of such legislation the expression any article or class of articles relatable to any scheduled industry used in ss and of the Act did not refer to raw materials but only to finished products of the scheduled industries the supply and distribution of which was intended to regulate its whole object being the equitable distribution and availability of manufactured articles at fair prices and not to invest <ORG> with the power to legislate in regard to sugarcane that even assuming that sugarcane was such an article and fell within the purview of of the Act no order having been issued by <ORG> thereunder no question of repugnancy could arise as repugnancy must exist as a fact and not as a mere possibility and the existence of such an order would be an essential pre requisite for it that as the provisions of Act of and those of the impugned Act and the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Order made thereunder relating to sugarcane were mutually exclusive and did not impinge upon each other and the one legislature did not trench upon the field of the other the Centre remaining silent where the State spoke and the State remaining silent where the Centre spoke there could be no inconsistency between them and no provision of the impugned Act and the Rules made thereunder was invalidated by any of the provisions of Act LXV of as amended by Act XXVI of or Act of and the Sugarcane Control Order issued thereunder <ORG> <NAME> Ex Parte McLean <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> A I Cal that the power of repeal conferred on <ORG> by the proviso to Art of the Constitution was a limited power and could be exercised only by enacting a law relating to the matter dealt with by the state law and the state law must be one of the kind indicated in the body of Art itself and as the impugned Act did not fall within that category the proviso did not apply and the impugned Act the notifications made thereunder and the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Order stood unrepealed by of Act of and cl that the power of repeal conferred by the proviso to Art could be exercised by <ORG> alone and could not be delegated to an executive authority and consequently <ORG> acquired no power of repeal under cl of the Sugarcane Control Order that the contention that the impugned Act infringed the fundamental right guaranteed by Art inasmuch as very wide powers were given to the Cane Commissioner which could be used in a discriminatory manner was without any foundation since his powers under of the impugned Act were well defined and the Act and Rules framed thereunder gave the canegrowers or <ORG> or the occupier of a factory the right to appeal to <ORG> against any order passed by him and thus provided a sufficient safeguard against any arbitrary exercise of those powers that equally unfounded was the contention that the im pugned Act and the notification dated September violated the fundamental right guaranteed by Art Although the right to form an association was a fundamental right it did not necessarily follow that its negative i the right not to form an association must also be so as all rights which an Indian citizen had were not fundamental rights No canegrower was compelled to become a member of <ORG> or prevented from resigning therefrom or selling his crops elsewhere and consequently the impugned Act and the notification did not violate his fundamental right that the powers given to the Cane Commissioner by of the impugned Act to declare reserved or assigned areas were well defined and controlled by higher authorities and by no means absolute and unguided and were not therefore bit by Art Nor could it be contended that the impugned Act and the notifications contravened the provisions of Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BHAGWATI These Petitions under article of the Constitution impugn the validity of the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Act Act XXIV of hereinafter called the impugned Act and the notifications dated th September and th November issued by the <ORG> thereunder The notification dated th September issued in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section a read with sub section of section of the impugned Act ordered that where not less than of the cane growers of the area of operation of <ORG> are members of the <ORG> the occupier of the factory for which the area is assigned shall not purchase or enter into agreement to purchase cane grown by a cane grower except through such Cane Growers Co operative <ORG> The notification dated th November was issued in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the impugned Act and reserved or assigned to the sugar factories mentioned in column of the Schedule annexed thereto the cane purchasing centers with the authorities attached to them specified against them in column for the purpose of supply of sugarcane during the crushing season subject to the conditions and explanations given therein The impugned Act is challenged as ultra vires the powers of <ORG> the subject matter of the Act being within the exclusive field of <ORG> and also as being repugnant to Act LXV of and Act of passed by <ORG> and section and section a and and the notifications issued thereunder are challenged as unconstitutional inasmuch as they infringe the fundamental rights guaranteed under article article and and article besides being in violation of article of the Constitution As a result of the protection thus granted to the sugar industry the number of sugar factories which was prior thereto registered a rapid rise and by they were in number In order to protect their interests and for the purpose of assuring to them a fair price for their produce <ORG> enacted on st May the Sugarcane Act Act XV of to regulate the price at which sugarcane intended to be used in the manufacture of sugar might be purchased by or for factories Sugarcane was grown in various Provinces and the declaration of controlled areas and the fixing of minimum price for the purchase of sugarcane intended for use in any factory in any controlled area was of necessity left to the Provincial Governments and the Provincial Governments were also empowered to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the objects of the Act including in particular the Organisation of growers of sugarcane into <ORG> for the sale of sugarcane to factories It was felt that Act XV of was not sufficiently comprehensive for dealing with the problems of the sugar industry and it was found necessary to replace it by a new measure which would provide for the better Organisation of cane supplies to sugar factories <ORG> acquired the power to make laws for the Provinces with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the Provincial Legislative List The result was in effect to make the Provincial Legislative List also a Concurrent Legislative List for the operation of <ORG> but if any provision of a Provincial law was repugnant to any provision of the Dominion law made in exercise of that power the Dominion law was to prevail and the Provincial law was to be void to the extent of the repugnancy Section a provided that notwithstanding anything in the Government of India Act <ORG> shall during the period mentioned in section of the Act have power to make laws with respect to the following matters a trade and commerce whether or not within a Province in and the production supply and distribution of cotton and woollen textiles paper including newsprint foodstuffs including edible oil seeds and oils petroleum and petroleum products spare parts of mechanically propelled vehicles coal iron steel and mica The period provided in section was the period of one year beginning with the date on which the proclamation of emergency ceased to operate or if the Governor General by a public notification directed a period of years beginning with that date There was a proviso to that section that if and so often as a resolution approving the extension of the said period was passed by both Houses of Parliament the same period shall be extended for a further period of months from the date on which it would otherwise expire but it was not to continue in any case for more than years from the date on which the proclamation of emergency ceased to operate Acting under the power reserved to it under section a aforesaid <ORG> enacted on th November the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act Act XXIV of to provide for the continuance during the limited period of powers to control production supply and distribution of and trade and commerce in certain commodities Section of the Act provided that it shall cease to have effect on the expiration of the period mentioned in section of the India Central Government and Legislature Act By virtue of this notification the Act would have remained in force till st March Under section read with section of the Indian Independence Act the Governor General passed an order on th August which substituted the words <ORG> for <ORG> in the proviso to section of India Central Government and Legislature Act and also introduced a new section a by way of adaptation providing that the powers of the <ORG> shall be exercised by <ORG> On th October <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by section of the Act promulgated the Sugar and Gur Control Order inter alia empowering it to prohibit or to restrict the export of sugarcane from any area to direct that no gur or sugar shall be manufactured from sugarcane except under and in accordance with the conditions specified in the licence issued in this behalf and to prohibit or to restrict the despatch of gur or sugar from any State or any area therein Power was also given to fix minimum price of sugarcane and no person was to sell or agree to sell sugarcane to a producer and no producer was to purchase or agree to purchase sugarcane at a price lower than that notified thereunder This power of fixing the price of sugarcane was exercised by <ORG> from time to time by issuing notifications fixing the minimum prices to be paid by the producers of sugar by vacuum pan process or their agents for sugarcane purchased by them during the crushing season in various States including On st October <ORG> enacted the Industries Development and RegulatiOn Act Act LXV of to provide for the development and regulation of certain industries By section of the Act it was declared that it was expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the industries specified in the First Schedule which included in item thereof the industry engaged in the manufacture or production of sugar That Committee submitted its Report in recommending inter alia abolition of the dual system of supply and creation of a strong co operative Organisation of the sugarcane growers themselves as also creation of a zonal system There was further the report of <ORG> called <ORG> which also recommended the abolition of dual agencies of cane supplies to factories and commended the desirability of employing the agency of <ORG> for the purpose The Bill is being introduced in order to provide for a rational distribution of sugarcane to factories for its development on organised scientific lines to protect the interests of the cane growers and of the industry and to put the new Act permanently on the Statute Book Vide Statement of objects and reasons published in the Gazette Extraordinary dated th July <ORG> also in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Act promulgated the Sugarcane Supply and Purchase Order which came into effect from th September The essential commodity there was defined to mean any of the following classes of commodities foodstuffs including edible oilseeds and oils xi any other class of commodity which the Central Government may by notified order declare to be an essential commodity for the purposes of this Act being a commodity with respect to which <ORG> has power to make laws by virtue of Entry in List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution Food crops were defined as inclusive of crops of sugar cane Section empowered <ORG> if it was of the opinion that it was necessary or expedient to do so for maintaining or increasing the supply of any essential commodity or for securing its equitable distribution and availability at fair prices to provide by order for regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein Section inter alia provided for the making of such an order for bringing under cultivation any waste or arable land whether appurtenant to a building or not for the growing thereon of foodcrops generally or of specified foodcrops In exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Act <ORG> promulgated on th August the Sugar Control Order and the Sugarcane Control Order The latter empowered <ORG> after consultation with such authorities bodies or associations as it may deem fit by notification in the official Gazette from time to time to fix the price of sugarcane and direct payment thereof and also to regulate the movement of sugar cane The power to regulate the movement of sugarcane comprised the power to prohibit or restrict or otherwise regulate the export of sugarcane from any area for supply to different factories and the power to direct that no gur jaggery or sugar shall be manufactured from sugarcane except under and in accordance with the conditions specified in a licence issued in this behalf Clause of this order provided that the Sugar and Gur Control Order published by the Government of India in <ORG> dated th October and any order made by a State Government or other authority regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution of sugarcane and trade or commerce therein were thereby repealed except as respect to things done or omitted to be done under any such order before the commencement of the order Learned counsel for the petitioners urged before us that the <ORG> of had no power to enact the impugned Act as the Act is with respect to the subject of industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest within the meaning of Entry of List I and is therefore within the exclusive province of <ORG> The impugned Act is therefore ultra vires the powers of <ORG> and is a colourable exercise of legislative power by the <ORG> the impugned Act is repugnant to Act LXV of and Act of and in the event of the Court holding that the impugned Act was within the legislative competence of <ORG> it is void by reason of such repugnancy the impugned Act stands repealed to the extent that it has been repealed by section of Act of and by clause of the Sugarcane Control Order made in exercise of the powers conferred by section of Act of the impugned Act infringes the fundamental right guaranteed by article inasmuch as very wide powers are given to the Cane Commissioner which can be used in a discriminatory manner the impugned Act and the notification dated th September violate the fundamental right guaranteed under article in that <ORG> are not voluntary organisations but a cane grower is compelled to become a member of the <ORG> before he can sell his sugarcane to a factory the impugned Act and the notifications infringe the fundamental right guaranteed by article and and article of the Constitution the impugned Act is void in that it confers very wide powers on executive officials and is a piece of delegated legislation and the impugned Act is destructive of the freedom of trade and commerce and thus is violative of article of the Constitution It was also contended that in so far as the impugned Act purported to legislate in regard to sugarcane which was a necessary ingredient in the production of sugar it was a colourable exercise of legislative power by the <ORG> ostensibly operating in its own field within Entry of List II but really trespassing upon the field of Entry of List I It was contended on behalf of the State on the other hand that The relevant Entries in the respective Lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution are as follows List I Entry Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest List III Entry As it stood prior to its amendment Trade and commerce in and production supply and distribution of the products of industries where the control of such industries by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Entry as amended by the Constitution Third Amendment Act Trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of a the products of any industry where the control of such industry by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest and imported goods of the same kind as such products foodstuffs including edible oilseeds and oils cattle fodder including oilcakes and other concentrates raw cotton whether ginned or unginned and cotton seed and raw jute Production supply and distribution of goods was no doubt within the exclusive sphere of <ORG> but it was subject to the provisions of Entry of List III which gave concurrent powers of legislation to the <ORG> as well as the States in the matter of trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of the products of industries where the control of such industries by the <ORG> was declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest The products of industries which were comprised in Entry of List II were dealt with by <ORG>s which had under Entry of that List power to legislate in regard to the production supply and distribution of goods goods according to the definition contained in article including all raw materials commodities and articles I that legislative power included also the power to legislate in regard to the raw material of the sugar industry that is sugarcane and the production supply and distribution of sugarcane was by reason of its being the necessary ingredient in the process of manufacture or production of sugar within the legislative competence of <ORG> Our attention was drawn in this connection to the definition of industry in section of the Industrial Disputes Act Act XIV of Industry means any business trade undertaking manufacture or calling of employers and includes any calling service employment bandicraft or industrial occupation or avocation of workmen and also to the wide construction which was put upon the term industry in <ORG> <ORG> where it was construed to include all forms of employment in which large number of persons are employed the sudden cessation of whose work might prejudicially affect the orderly conduct of the ordinary operations of civil life These interpretations of the term industry however do not help us because in defining the word industry in the Industrial Disputes Act as also in putting the wide construction on the term industry in as well as they were concerned mainly with the question whether an industrial dispute arose between employers and employees What we are concerned with here is not the wide construction to be put on the term in dustry as such but whether the raw materials of an industry which form an integral part of the process are within the topic of industry which forms the subject matter of Item of List I as ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly or reasonably be said to be comprehended in that topic and whether <ORG> while legislating upon sugar industry could acting within the sphere of Entry of List as well legislate upon sugarcane If both <ORG> and <ORG> were entitled to legislate in regard to this subject of production supply and distribution of sugarcane there would arise no question of legislative competence of <ORG> in the matter of having enacted the impugned Act There was an apparent conflict between the legislative powers of the <ORG> and of the Provinces in this respect which conflict could not have been intended and therefore a reconciliation was to be attempted by reading the two provisions together and by inter preting and where necessary modifying the language of one by that of the other Reliance was placed on the observations of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> In these cases it is the duty of the Courts however difficult it may be to ascertain in what degree and to what extent authority to deal with matters falling within these classes of subjects exists in each legislature and to define in the particular case before them the limits of their respective powers <NAME> Governor General in <ORG> The Province of Madras But it appears to them that it is right first to consider whether a fair reconciliation cannot be effected by giving to the language of <ORG> a meaning which if less wide than it might in another context bear is yet one that can properly be given to it and equally giving to the language of <ORG> a meaning which it can properly bear Reliance was also placed on the observations of <NAME> quoted in <NAME> <NAME> As interpreted by <ORG> the British North America Act presents an exact analogy to the India Act even to the overriding provisions in section of the latter The rule of construction is that general language in the heads of section yields to particular expressions in section where the latter are unambiguous per Lord <NAME> in <ORG> The King and it was contended that Entry of List II should be construed in a general manner as applying to production supply and distribution of goods in general and Entry of List I should be construed as comprehending within its scope ancillary matters in relation to the controlled industries thus excluding production supply and distribution of goods which would be thus comprised within it as ancillary matters from the sphere of Entry of List II There was therefore no trespass upon the exclusive jurisdiction of the <ORG> and the impugned Act was within the legislative competence of <ORG> Entry of List II related to production supply and distribution of goods and development of industries except in regard to controlled industries and in so far as in sugar was not a controlled industry <ORG> enacted provisions for the licensing of the sugar factories and for regulating the price and supply of sugarcane intended for use in such factories With the advent of War and the proclamation of emergency under section of the Government of India Act the <ORG> was invested with the power to make laws for the Provinces with respect to any of the matters enumerated in the Provincial Legislative List and <ORG> as well as <ORG> were thus enabled to enact measures exercising concurrent jurisdiction in regard to the topics enumerated in the Provincial Legislative List Central Government and Legislature Act under which notwithstanding anything in the Government of India Act <ORG> was for the period specified in section thereof invested with the powers to make laws with respect to a trade and commerce in and the production supply and distribution of foodstuffs edible oilseeds and oils and this provision in effect continued the power which had been vested in <ORG> during the emergency under section of the Government of India Act The period mentioned in section of this Act was extended from time to time up to st March Act XXIV of was continued in force up to st March under the terms of section of India Central Government and Legislature Act by the notification of the GovernorGeneral and the resolutions passed by both the Houses of <ORG> but before the expiration of this extended period the Constitution was inaugurated and under article <ORG> was invested with the power to make laws inter alia with respect to trade and commerce within a <ORG> and production supply and distribution of foodstuffs edible oilseeds and oils as if they were enumerated in the concurrent list and it was by virtue of this power that Act XXIV of was extended up to th January by diverse pieces of legislation enacted by <ORG> The list of essential commodities defined in section of the Act comprised foodstuffs including edible oilseeds and oils cattlefodder raw cotton and cotton seed and raw jute which were items and in Entry of List III and the products of the controlled industries coal textiles iron and steel paper petroleum and petroleum products and any other class of commodity which <ORG> may by notification or order declare to be an essential commodity for the purposes of the Act being a commodity with respect to which <ORG> has power to make laws by virtue of Entry of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which were amongst the products of the controlled industries specified in the First Schedule to Act LXV of It follows that Act of was enacted by <ORG> in exercise of the legislative powers conferred upon it by Entry of List III and was an exercise of concurrent jurisdiction It also follows as a necessary corollary that even though sugar industry was a controlled industry none of these Acts enacted by the <ORG> was in exercise of its jurisdiction under Entry of List The process of manufacture or production would be comprised in Entry of List II except where the industry was a controlled industry when it would fall within Entry of List I and the products of the industry would also be comprised in Entry of List II except where they were the products of the controlled industries when they would fall within Entry of List The pith and substance argument also cannot be imported here for the simple reason that when both the <ORG> as well as the State <ORG> were operating in the concurrent field there was no question of any trespass upon the exclusive jurisdiction vested in the <ORG> under Entry of List the only question which survived being whether putting both the pieces of legislation enacted by the <ORG> and <ORG> together there was any repugnancy a contention which will be dealt with hereafter The power of licensing new industrial undertakings was thereafter exercised by the <ORG> under Act LXV of as amended by Act XXVI of vide sections a and and the power of fixation of price of sugar was exercised by the <ORG> under section of Act XXIV of by issuing the Sugar Control Order Even the power reserved to <ORG> to fix minimum prices of sugarcane under Chapter of Act I of was deleted from the impugned Act the same being exercised by the <ORG> under clause of Sugar and Gur Control Order issued by it in exercise of the powers conferred under section of Act XXIV of The prices fixed by the <ORG> were adopted by <ORG> and the only thing which <ORG> required under rule was that the occupier of a factory or the purchasing agent should cause to be put up at each purchasing centre a notice showing the minimum price of cane fixed by the Government meanig there by the centre If that was so there was no question whatever of its trenching upon the jurisdiction of the <ORG> in regard to sugar industry which was a controlled industry within Entry of List I and <ORG> had jurisdiction to enact the law with regard to sugarcane and had legislative competence to enact the impugned Act It was next contended that the provisions of the impugned Act were repugnant to the provisions of Act LXV of and Act of which were enacted by <ORG> and therefore the law made by <ORG> should prevail and the impugned Act should to the extent of the repugnancy be void If any provision of a law made by the <ORG> of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of clause the law made by <ORG> whether passed before or after the law made by the Legisla ture of such State or as the case may be the existing law shall prevail and the law made by the <ORG> of the State shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void Where a law made by the <ORG> of a State specified in Part A or Part of the First Schedule with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by <ORG> or an existing law with respect to that matter then the law so made by the <ORG> of such State shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent prevail in that State Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent <ORG> from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to amending varying or repealing the law so made by <ORG> State We are concerned here with the repugnancy if any arising by reason of both <ORG> and <ORG> having operated in the same field in respect of a matter enumerated in the Concurrent List i foodstuffs comprised in Entry of List III and we are therefore not called upon to express any opinion on the controversy which was raised in regard to the exact scope and extent of article in regard to a law made by <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact as to whether the legislative power of <ORG> therein refers to List I List III and the residuary power of legislation vested in <ORG> under article or is confined merely to the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List Vide A I Cal <NAME> in <ORG> Cowburn laid down one test of inconsistency as conclusive If however a competent legislature expressly or implicitly evinces its intention to cover the whole field orities which laid down the test of repugnancy in Australia Canada and England and concluded at page The principle deducible from the English cases as from the Canadian cases seems therefore to be the same as that enunciated by <NAME> in the Australian hour case if the dominant law has expressly or impliedly evinced its intention to cover the whole field then a subordinate law in the same field is repugnant and therefore inoperative A by <ORG> were intended to be a complete exhaustive code or in other words expressly or impliedly evinced an intention to cover the whole field It also provided for the establishment and constitution of <ORG> for any scheduled industry or group of scheduled industries It did not involve the regulation of the supply and purchase of sugarcane which though it formed an integral part of the process of manufacture of sugar Power to control supply distribution price etc Sugar industry being one of the scheduled industries it was contended for the petitioners that sugarcane was an article relatable to the sugar industry and was therefore within the scope of section and <ORG> was thus authorised by notified order to provide for regulating the supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein It was however urged on behalf of the <ORG> of that articles relatable to scheduled industry comprised only those finished products which were of the same nature or description as the article or class of articles manufactured or produced in the scheduled industry and did not comprise the raw materials for the scheduled industry Reliance was placed in support of this contention on the terms of the explanation to section as also to sections and of the Act where the same words any article or class of articles relatable to that industry were used The structure of the whole Act LXV of related to the development and regulation of the scheduled industries and all the provisions which were contained in the Act including those which were introduced therein by Act XXVI of were designed for effectuating that purpose Not only were the article or class of articles relatable to the scheduled industry which were themselves manufactured or produced in this country sought to be controlled in this manner but also the articles or class of articles imported into India which were of the same nature or description as the article or class of articles manufactured or produced in the scheduled industry so that all these articles whether indigenous or imported would be controlled by <ORG> by regulating the supply and distribution thereof and trade and commerce therein with a view to develop and regulate and thus control the scheduled industries in the public interest See tion of the Act provided that where <ORG> was of the opinion that in respect of any scheduled industry or industrial undertaking there had been or was likely to be a substantial fall in the volume of production in respect of any article or class of articles relatable to that industry or manufactured or produced in the industrial undertakings for which having regard to the economic conditions prevailing there was no justification it may make or cause to be made full and complete investigations into the circumstances of the case If the two fields were different and the Central legislation did not intend at all to cover that field the field was clear for the operation of <ORG> legislation and there was no repugnancy at all between Act LXV of and the impugned Act Even assuming that sugarcane was an article or class of articles relatable to the sugar industry within the meaning of section of Act LXV of it is to be noted that no order was issued by <ORG> in exercise of the powers vested in it under that section and no question of repugnancy could ever arise because as has been noted above repugnancy must exist in fact and not depend merely on a possibility Foodcrops were there defined as including crops of sugarcane and section gave <ORG> powers to control the production supply and distribution of essential commodities and trade and commerce therein for maintaining or increasing the supplies thereof or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices Section empowered <ORG> to provide inter alia for bringing under cultivation any waste or arable land whether appurtenant to a building or not for growing thereon of foodcrops generally or specified foodcrops and section gave <ORG> power for controlling the price at which any essential commodity may be bought or sold These provisions would certainly bring within the scope of <ORG> legislation the regulation of the production of sugarcane as also the controlling of the price at which sugarcane may be bought or sold and in addition to the Sugar Control Order which was issued by <ORG> on th August it also issued the Sugarcane Control Order on the same date investing it with the power to fix the price of sugarcane and direct payment thereof as also the power to regulate the movement of sugarcane That however did not affect the legislative competence of <ORG> to enact the law in regard to sugarcane and the only question which remained to be considered was whether there was any repugnancy between the provisions of the <ORG> legislation and the <ORG> legislation in this behalf The impugned Act did not make any provision for the same and the only provision in regard to the price of sugarcane which was to be found in the Sugarcane Rules was contained in Rule which provided that a notice of suitable size in clear bold lines showing the minimum price of cane fixed by the <ORG> and the rates at which the cane is being purchased by the centre was to be put up by an occupier of a factory or the purchasing agent as the case may be at each purchasing centre The provisions thus made by the Sugarcane Control Order did not find their place either in the impugned Act or the Rules made thereunder or the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Order and the provision contained in section of the impugned Act in regard to the payment of sugarcane price and recovery thereof as if it was an arrear of land revenue did not find its place in the Sugarcane Control Order Our attention was drawn to the several provisions contained in the Sugarcane Control Order and the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Order and the agreements annexed thereto and it was pointed out that they differed in material particulars the provisions of the latter being more stringent than those of the former no question arises of the operation of article of the Constitution and no provision of the impugned Act and the Rules made thereunder is invalidated by any provision contained in Act LXV of as amended by Act XXVI of or Act of and the Sugarcane Control Order issued thereunder made in exercise of the powers conferred by section of Act of Clause of the Sugarcane Control Order made in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Act provided The Sugar and Gur Control Order published with the Government of India in <ORG> dated the th October and any order made by a State Government or other authority regulating or prohibiting the production supply and distribution of sugarcane and trade or commerce therein are hereby repealed except as respect things done or omitted to be done under any such order before the commencement of this order It is submitted that the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Order made by the Government in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the impugned Act is repealed in so far as it regulates or prohibits the production supply and distribution of sugarcane or trade and commerce therein These are provisions for the express repeal of the impugned Act and the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Order and if the contention of the petitioners in this behalf were accepted it would have the effect of nullifying the provisions of the impugned Act and also the impugned notifications which have been issued in exercise of the powers conferred by sections and of the Act As regards section of Act of the validity and effect thereof depends upon the construction to be put on article and the proviso thereto Article deals with repugnancy between the provisions of a law made by <ORG> and those of an earlier law made by <ORG> or an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List and provides that the law so made by <ORG> shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent prevail in the State A proviso however has been attached thereto which says that nothing in article shall prevent <ORG> from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to amending varying or repealing the law so made by <ORG> Ordinarily <ORG> would not have the power to repeal a law passed by <ORG> even though it be a law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List article the Constitution has enlarged the powers of <ORG> and under that proviso <ORG> can do what <ORG> could not under section of the Government of India Act and enact a law addihg to amending varying or repealing a law of the State when it relates to a matter mentioned in the Concurrent List A it is argued for the state of that under the proviso to article the power to repeal a law passed by <ORG> is incidental to enacting a law relating to the same matter as is dealt with in the State legislation and that a statute which merely repeals a law passed by <ORG> without enacting substantive provisions on the subject would not be within the proviso as it could not have been the intention of the Constitution that in a topic within the concurrent sphere of legislation there should be a vacuum There is considerable force in this contention and there is much to be said for the view that a repeal simpliciter is not within the proviso But it is unnecessary to base our decision on this point as the petitioners must in our opinion fail on another ground While the proviso to article does confer on <ORG> a power to repeal a law passed by <ORG> that power is under the terms of the proviso subject to certain limitations It is limited to enacting a law with respect to the same matter adding to amending varying or repealing a law so made by <ORG> The impugned Act is not a law relating to any matter which is the subject of an earlier legislation by <ORG> To such a law the proviso has no application and section of Act of and clause of the Sugarcane Control Order must in this view be held to be invalid There is also a further objection to which clause of the Sugarcane Control Order is open Such delegation if made would be void and <ORG> had no power therefore to repeal any order made by the State Government in exercise of the powers conferred upon it by section of the impugned Act The result therefore is that there was no repeal of the impugned Act or the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Order by section of Act of or by clause of the Sugarcane Control Order as contended by the petitioners It is contended that the powers thus conferred upon him are so wide that they are capable of being exercised in a discriminatory manner and therefore the impugned Act infringes the fundamental right guaranteed by article of the Constitution Without prejudice to any order made under clause of sub section of section the Cane Commissioner may after consulting <ORG> in the manner to be prescribed a reserve any area hereinafter called the reserved area and assign any area hereinafter called an assigned area for the purpose of the supply of cane to a factory in accordance with the provisions of section during a particular crushing season and may likewise at any time cancel such order or alter the boundaries of an area so reserved or assigned An appeal shall lie to <ORG> against the order of the Cane Commissioner passed under sub section Rule of the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Rules made by the Government in exercise of the rule making power conferred by section of the Act however lays down the factors which are to be taken into consideration by the Cane Commissioner in reserving an area for or assigning an area to a factory or determining the quantity of cane to be purchased from an area by a factory a the distance of the area from the factory facilities for transport of cane from the area the quality of cane supplied from the area to the factory in previous years previous reservation and assignment orders the quantity of cane to be crushed in the factory the arrangements made by the factory in previous years for payment of cess cane price and commission and the views of the <ORG> <ORG> of the area It will be thus seen that the powers given to the Cane Commissioner under section are well defined and have got to be exercised within the limits prescribed after consulting the factories and <ORG> Vide section and any order made by the Cane Commissioner thereunder is liable to an appeal to <ORG> at the instance of the party aggrieved Vide section If this is the position it cannot be urged that wide powers are conferred on the Cane Commissioner which can be used by him in a discriminatory manner so as to violate the fundamental right guaranteed under article It is next contended that the impugned Act and the notification dated th September violate the fundamental right guaranteed under article which is the right to form associations or unions It is urged that <ORG> operative Societies are not voluntary organisations but a cane grower is compelled to become a member of the <ORG> before he can sell his sugarcane to a factory The right to form associations or unions is a positive right but in the positive right it is urged there is necessarily implied the negative aspect which means that a citizen has the right not to form associations or unions and cannot be compelled to become a member of an association or a union or a Cane growers Co operative <ORG> before be can sell his goods to the owner of a factory If a citizen has got a right to carry on business we think it follows that he must be at liberty not to carry it on if he so chooses Mr <NAME> was really unable to convince us how any one can be compelled to carry on a business against his will and yet be said to enjoy a right to carry on a business It is urged that if the right to carry on business carries with it by necessary implication a right not to carry on business if the right to speak freely carries with it by necessary implication the right to refrain from speaking at all the right to form associations or unions also carries with it by necessary implication the right not to form associations or unions In the first place assuming that the right to form an association implies a right not to form an association it does not follow that the negative right must also be regarded as a fundamental right The citizens of India have many rights which have not been given the sanctity of fundamental rights and there is nothing absurd or uncommon if the positive right alone is made a fundamental right The whole fallacy in the argument urged on behalf of the petitioners lies in this that it ignores that there is no compulsion at all on any cane grower to become a member of <ORG> The Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Order made in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the impugned Act also talks of cane growers as well as <ORG> and in the case of reserved areas both the cane growers and the <ORG> are entitled within days of the issue of an order reserving The <ORG> are to be fostered if at all for furthering the interests of the cane growers and there is no conflict between the interests of the cane growers on the one hand and those of the Cane growers <ORG> on the other Both are equally catered for by the impugned Act but it is only when <ORG> feels that there are circumstances justifying the issue of an order under which the cane grown by a cane grower shall not be purchased except through <ORG> <ORG> in exercise of the power reserved under section would issue an order accordingly There is also another fallacy in their argument and it lies in ignoring that no canegrower is prevented from resigning his membership of <ORG> There may be of course difficulties in the matter of his being able to sell the same in that manner but that does not mean that there is an absolute restriction on his power of disposal of his goods unless and until he becomes a member of <ORG> It is further contended that the impugned Act and the notifications infringe the fundamental right guaranteed under article and and article of the Constitution The power of granting or withholding licenses or of fixing the prices of the goods would necessarily have to be vested in certain public officers or bodies and they would certainly have to be left with some amount of discretion in these matters ferred on such officers is an arbitrary power unregulated by any rule or principle and it is left entirely to the discretion of particular persons to do anything they like without any check or control by any higher authority A law or order which confers arbitrary and uncontrolled power upon the executive in the matter of regulating trade or business in normally available commodities cannot but be held to be unreasonable Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed under article and the social control permitted by clause of article it must be held to be wanting in reasonableness The power which is given to the Cane Commissioner under section of the Act for declaring reserved or assigned areas is well defined and guided by the considerations set out in Rule of Chapter of the Sugarcane Regulation of Supply and Purchase Rules and is further conditioned that he has to consult the factory and <ORG> and his orders made thereunder are subject to an appeal to <ORG> at the instance of the party aggrieved That being so it comes well within the protection of article and the impugned notification cannot be challenged as violative of the fundamental right guaranteed under article and It is next contended that the impugned Act is void in that it confers very wide powers on the executive officials and is a piece of delegated legislation Our attention has not been drawn to any provisions of the impugned Act which would amount to a delegation of legislative power to any officials of <ORG> The only provisions alleged to contain such delegation of legislative power are those contained in section and section read with section of the impugned Act which we have dealt with above Article of the Constitution does not occur in Part III which deals with fundamental rights but it is urged that if a law was enacted in violation of the provisions of article it will be no law at all and will certainly not avail <ORG> Notwithstanding anything in article or article <ORG> may by law a impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest We may also refer in this context to the following passage from the judgment of their Lordships of <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> which was quoted with approval in the later <ORG> decision in <NAME> and <ORG> <ORG> and Others Every case must be judged on its own facts and in its own setting of time and circumstance and it may be that in regard to some economic activities and at some stage of social development it might be maintained that prohibition with a view to State monopoly was the only practical and reasonable manner of regulation and that inter State trade commerce and intercourse thus prohibited and thus monopolized remained absolutely free The result therefore is that the impugned Act and the notifications dated th September and th November issued thereunder were intravires <ORG> and are binding on the petitioners
