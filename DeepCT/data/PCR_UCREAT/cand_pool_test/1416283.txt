Doctrine of severability Severance may have effect of enlarging scope of legislation HEADNOTE By a Memorandum dated May Exhibit <ORG> liberalised the formula for computation of pension in respect of employees governed by <ORG>s Pension Rules and made it applicable to employees retiring on or after March Petitioners and who had retired in the year from <ORG> and <ORG> service respectively and petitioner No a registered society espousing the cause of pensioners all over the country challenged the validity of the above two memoranda in so far as the liberalisation in computation of pension had been made applicable only to those retiring on or after the date specified and the benefit of liberalisation had been denied to all those who had retired earlier Counsel for respondents contended that a classification based on the date of retirement is valid for the purpose of granting pensionary benefits that the specified date is an integral part of the scheme of liberalisation and the <ORG> would never have enforced the scheme devoid of the date that the doctrine of severability cannot be invoked to sever the specified date from the scheme as it would have the effect of enlarging the class of pensioners covered by the scheme and when the legislature has expressly defined the class to which the legislation applies it would be outside the judicial function to enlarge the class that there is not a single case where the court has included some category within the scope of provisions of a law to maintain its constitutionality that since the scheme of liberalisation has financial implications the <ORG> cannot make it retroactive that if more persons divided the available cake the residue falling to the share of each especially to the share of those who are not before the court would become far less and therefore no relief could be given to the petitioners that pension is always correlated to the date of retirement and the court cannot change the date of retirement and impose fresh commutation benefit which may burden the exchequer to the tune of Rs crores and that the third petitioner has no locus standi in the case The principle underlying the guarantee is that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation and there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their position is substantially the same The classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question Pension would now be on the higher side on account of two fortuitous circumstances namely that the pay scales permit annual increments and usually there are promotions in the last one or two years of the employee service There is nothing immutable about the choosing of an event as an eligibility criteria subsequent to a specified date There is no difficulty in implementing the scheme omitting the event happening after the specified date retaining the more human formula for computation of pension The <ORG> is not conferring benefits by its approach it is only removing the illegitimate classification and after its removal the law takes its own course There is no principle that severance limits the scope of legislation but can never enlarge it viii There is no question of pensioners dividing the pension fund which if more persons are admitted to the scheme would pro rata affect the share ix The date of retirement of each employee remaining as it is there is no question of fresh commutation of pension of the pensioners who retired prior to st March and have already availed of the benefit of commutation Factual matrix has little relevance to the issues raised and canvassed at the hearing per year for years of service which <ORG> while accepting the recommendation raised to Rs The Administrative Reforms <ORG> <ORG> for short set up by <ORG> in took note of the fact that the cost of living has shot up and correspondingly the possibility of savings has gone down and consequently the drop in wages on retirement is in reality much steeper than what the quantum of pension would indicate and accordingly the <ORG> recommended that the quantum of pension admissible may be raised to of the emoluments of the last three years of service as against the existing and the ceiling should be raised from Rs The only important recommendation worth noticing is that the <ORG> recommended that the existing ceiling of maximum pension should be raised from Rs This liberalised pension formula was applicable to employees governed by the Rules retiring on or after the specified date Now if date of retirement is a valid criterion for classification those who retire at the end of every month shall form a class by themselves And therefore it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach No attempt should be made to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for to do so would be to violate its activist magnitude Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be imprisoned within traditional and doctrinaire limits Article strikes at arbitrariness in <ORG> action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment The principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness pervades Article like a brooding omnipresence i that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group and ii that differentia must have a rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved by the statute in question After an exhaustive review of almost all decisions bearing on the question of Art Special Courts Bill restated the settled propositions which emerged from the judgments of this Court undoubtedly insofar as they were relevant to the decision on the points arising for consideration in that matter The constitutional command to the <ORG> to afford equal protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise formula Therefore classification need not be constituted by an exact or scientific exclusion or inclusion of persons or things The <ORG> should not insist on delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of classification in any given case The principle underlying the guarantee of Article is not that the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the Indian territory or that the same remedies should be made available to them irrespective of differences of circumstances It only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation and there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their position is substantially the same It can recognise even degree of evil but the classification should never be arbitrary artificial or evasive The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational that is to say it must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation In order to pass the test two conditions must be fulfilled namely that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others and that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch and if it affects any matter relating to public employment it is also violative of Art Articles and strike at arbitrariness in <ORG> action and ensure fairness and equality of treatment strikes at is arbitrariness because any action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve negation of equality After a review of large number of decisions bearing on the subject in <ORG> etc forbids class legislation but permits reasonable classification for the purpose of legislation which classification must satisfy the twin tests of classification being founded on an intelligible differntia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from those that are left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational nexus to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question The court realistically appraising the social stratification and economic inequality and keeping in view the guidelines on which the <ORG> action must move as constitutionally laid down in part IV of the Constitution evolved the doctrine of classification Legislative and executive action may accordingly be sustained if it satisfies the twin tests of reasonable classification and the rational principle correlated to the object sought to be achieved The basic contention as hereinbefore noticed is that the pensioners for the purpose of receiving pension form a class and there is no criterion on which classification of pensioners retiring prior to specified date and retiring subsequent to that date can provide a rational principle correlated to object viz In reply to this contention set out in para of the petition Mr <NAME> Director <ORG> in part of his affidavit in opposition on behalf of the respondents has averred as under The contentions in part and that all pensioners form one class is not correct and the petitioners have not shown how they form one class These averments would show at a glance that the State action is sought to be sustained on the doctrine of classification and the criterion on which the classification is sought to be sustained is the date of retirement of the <ORG> servant which entitled him to pension It may be made clear that the date of retirement of each individual pensioner is not suggested as a criterion for classification as that would lead to an absurd result because in that event every pensioner relevant to his date of retirement will form a class unto himself What is suggested is that when a pension scheme undergoes a revision and is enforced effective form a certain date the date so specified becomes a sort of a Rubicon and those who retire prior to that date form one class and those who retire on a subsequent date form a distinct and separate class and no one can cross the Rubicon It is only for the purpose of quantifying the amount having regard to service and other allied matters that it may be necessary for the authority to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive pension flows to the officer not because of any such order but by virtue of the rules There are various kinds of pensions and there are equally various methods of funding pension programmes There are other views about pensions such as charity paternalism deferred pay rewards for service rendered or as a means or promoting general welfare see Encyclopaedia Britannica Vol One may live and avoid unemployment but not senility and penury if there is nothing to fall back upon From the discussion three things emerge i that pension is neither a bounty nor a matter of grace depending upon the sweet will of the employer and that it creates a vested right subject to rules which are statutory in character because they are enacted in exercise of powers conferred by the proviso to Art Proceeding further this Court observed that where all relevant considerations are the same persons holding identical posts may not be treated differently in the matter of their pay merely because they belong to different departments If that can be done when they are in service can that be done during their retirement Expanding this principle one can confidently say that if pensioners form a class their computation cannot be by different formula affording unequal treatment solely on the ground that some retired earlier and some retired later obligates the <ORG> within the limits of its economic capacity and development to make effective provision for securing the right to work to education and to provide assistance in cases of unemployment old age sickness and disablement and in other cases of undeserved want The clarion call may be extracted The question of amending the Constitution for removing the difficulties which have arisen in achieving the objective of socio economic revolution which would end poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity has been engaging the active attention of Government and the public for some time It is therefore proposed to amend the Constitution to spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism Having set out clearly the society which we propose to set up the direction in which the State action must move the welfare State which we propose to build up the constitutional goal of setting up a socialist State and the assurance in the Directive Principles of State Policy especially of security in old age at least to those who have rendered useful service during their active years it is indisputable nor was it questioned that pension as a retirement benefit is in consonance with and furtherance of the goals of the Constitution Any one in government service would appreciate at a glance that with an average of months it would be on the higher side on account of the two fortuitous circumstances that the pay scales if one has not reached the maximum permit annual increments and there are promotions in the last one or two years But we find no justification for arbitrarily selecting the criteria for eligibility for the benefits of the scheme dividing the pensioners all of whom would be retirees but falling on one or the other side of the specified date In this context it was lastly submitted that there is not a single case in India or elsewhere where the <ORG> has included some category within the scope of provisions of a law to maintain its constitutionality If it appears to be undisputable as it does to us that the pensioners for the purpose of pension benefits form a class would its upward revision permit a homogeneous class to be divided by arbitrarily fixing an eligibility criteria unrelated to purpose of revision and would such classification be founded on some rational principle The classification has to be based as is well settled on some rational principle and the rational principle must have nexus to the objects sought to be achieved We have set out the objects underlying the payment of pension The artificial division stares into face and is unrelated to any principle and whatever principle if there be any has absolutely no nexus to the objects sought to be achieved by liberalising the pension scheme Further the classification is wholly arbitrary because we do not find a single acceptable or persuasive reason for this division The next question is what is the way you The learned Attorney General contended that the scheme is to be taken as a whole or rejected as a whole and the date from which it came into force is an integral and inseparable part of the scheme The two sub limbs of the submissions were that i the <ORG> cannot make a scheme having financial implications retroactive and ii this <ORG> cannot grant any relief to the pensioners who retired prior to a specified date because if more persons divide the available cake the residue falling to the share of each especially to those who are likely to be benefited by the scheme will be comparatively smaller and as they are not before the <ORG> no relief can be given to the pensioners It was not pointed out that there is something like a pension fund One could have appreciated this line of reasoning where there is a contributory scheme and a pension fund from which alone pension is disbursed That being not the case there is no question of pensioners dividing the pension fund which if more persons are admitted to the scheme would pro rata affect the share Therefore there is no question of dividing the pension fund Now if pension as we view it is some kind of retirement wages for past service can it be denied to those who retired earlier revised retirement benefits being available to future retirees only Therefore there is no substance in the contention that the court by its approach would be making the scheme retroactive because it is implicit in theory of wages That takes us to the last important contention of the learned Attorney General This arbitrary selection of the happening of event subsequent to specified date denies equality of treatment to persons belonging to the same class some preferred and some omitted In our opinion it would make a marginal difference in the case of past pensioners because the emoluments are not revised Therefore there is absolutely no difficulty in removing the arbitrary and discriminatory portion of the scheme and it can be easily severed There is nothing immutable about the choosing of an event as an eligibility criteria subsequent to a specified date We repeatedly posed a question what are those relevant and valid considerations and waited for the answer in vain The appellant challenged the order because the period of officiation from June to May was excluded for the purpose of fixation of his seniority After taking into consideration affidavit in opposition this Court held as under It would be noticed that the date May to begin with had nothing to do with the finalisation of the Gradation List of <ORG> because it was a date which had reference to the finalisation of the Gradation List for the <ORG> The Central <ORG> cannot pick out a date from a hat and that is what it seems to have done in this case and say that a period prior to that date would not be deemed to be approved by the Central <ORG> within the second proviso The Court held that <ORG> cannot pick out a date from a hat and that is what it seems to have done in saying that a period prior to that date would not be deemed to be approved by <ORG> within the second proviso The court further observed that it is difficult to appreciate how it would make any difference from the point of view of allotment of land whether a tenant has been in occupation for years or or years and why differentiation should be made with reference to the date when Rajasthan Tenancy Act came into force In a writ petition filed by the respondent <ORG> held that the classification was unreasonable inasmuch as the fixation of the date for making a declaration had no nexus with the object of the Act When it is seen that a line or a point there must be and there is no mathematical or logical way of fixing it precisely the decision of the legislature or its delegate must be accepted unless we can say that it is very wide of the reasonable mark In fact it is made clear in the decision itself that even if no particular reason is forthcoming for the choice unless it is shown to be capricious or whimsical the choice of the legislature may be accepted The Bill was published in June in which it was made clear that the Act would be brought into force from April But the principle that when a certain date or eligibility criteria is selected with reference to legislative or executive measure which has the pernicious tendency of dividing an otherwise homogeneous class and the choice of beneficiaries of the legislative executive action becomes selective the division or classification made by choice of date or eligibility criteria must have some relation to the objects sought to be achieved we merely set at naught the unconstitutional portion retaining the constitutional portion We may now deal with the last submission of the learned Attorney General on the point We are not sure whether there is any principle which inhibits the <ORG> from striking down an unconstitutional part of a legislative action which may have the tendency to enlarge the width and coverage of the measure We know of no principle that severance limits the scope of legislation and can never enlarge it Similarly when this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra held that the principle of equal pay for equal work may be properly applied to cases of unequal pay based on no classification or irrational classification it enlarged the class of beneficiaries The date is retained without qualification as the effective date for implementation of scheme it being made abundantly clear that in respect of all pensioners governed by Rules the pension of each may be recomputed as on April and future payments be made in accordance with fresh computation under the liberalised pension scheme as enacted in the impugned memoranda There is no question of fresh commutation of pension of the pensioners who retired prior to st March and have already availed of the benefit of commutation Similarly the court is not conferring benefits by this approach the court only removes the illegitimate classification and after its removal the law takes its own course
