Parts III and IV Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles Whether complementary to each other Whether a right could be recognised as a fundamental rot even though not expressly mentioned Articles and Private unaided recognised affiliated educational institutions running professional courses like engineering and medical course Whether entitled to charge a fee higher than that charged by <ORG> institutions Held Entitled to charge a higher fee but such a fee cannot exceed the ceding fixed in this regard However commercialisation of education not permissible fee Meaning of Whether private recognised affiliated institutions obliged to act fairly consistent with Articles and and in accordance with conditions of grant of recognition affiliation Held as conditions of grant of aid they were governed by such rules and regulations Private institutions receiving aid obliged to act fairly in consonance with fundamental rights as well as regulations framed by <ORG> <ORG> while granting recognition affiliation obliged to impose conditions for maintaining standards and ensuring fairness inter alia in respect of fees chargeable and admission Admission and charging of capitation fees in private unaided aided recognised affiliated educational institution conducting professional courses such as medical and engineering courses Scheme framed by <ORG> eliminating discretion of management in admissions in and fees payable in such institutions and substituting merit of the students as the sole criterion Articles and Right to establish and run educational institutions Whether a fundamental right Imparting education Whether a commercial activity of establishing an education institution Whether a profession Words Profession Occupation Trade and Business Meaning of Articles A and ether private educational institutions have a fundamental right to recognition affiliation Whether such a right can be inferred by reading into Article a right in the of Article Section A Power to grant admission to students who qualified in entrance qualifying examination irrespective of their ranking in the examination and to charge any amount in addition to tuition fee Whether violative of Article of the Constitution In the writ petitions flied before this <ORG> the correctness of the decision of this <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <ORG> and Others SCC was challenged by private educational institutions engaged in or proposing to engage in imparting medical and engineering education in the <ORG>s of Andhra Pradesh Karnataka Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu In <NAME> case this <ORG> had held inter alit that every citizen has a right to education under the Constitution the <ORG> was under an obligation to establish educational institutions to enable the citizens to enjoy the said right the <ORG> may discharge its obligation through <ORG> owned or <ORG> recognised educational institutions that when the <ORG> <ORG> granted recognition to the private educational institutions it created an agency to fulfil its obligation under the Constitution that charging capitation fee in consideration of admission to educational institutions was a patent denial of a citizen right to education under the Constitution and that the <ORG> action in permitting capitation fee to be charged by <ORG> recognised educational institutions was wholly arbitrary and as such violative of Article of the Constitution that the capitation fee brought to the fore a clear class bias and that when the <ORG> <ORG> permitted a private medical college to be set up and recognised its curriculum and degrees then the said college was performing a funtion which under the Constitution had been assigned to the <ORG> <ORG> and If the <ORG> permitted such institution to charge higher fee from the students such a fee was not tuition fee but in fact a capitation fee The aforesaid decision was followed by <ORG> of the A High <ORG> in Kranti Parishad <NAME> ALT while allowing the writ petitions filed before it challenging the permission granted by the <ORG> <ORG> for the establishment of private <ORG> in the <ORG> and also the constitutional validity of section A of the Andhra Pradesh Educational <ORG> Prohibition of Capitation Fee Act It was contended that a the <ORG> had no monopoly in the matter of imparting education every citizen had the fundamental right to establish an educational institution as a part of the right guaranteed to him by Article of the Constitution which extended even to the establishment of an educational institution with a profit motive i as a business adventure the said right was absolute subject of course to such reasonable restrictions as may be placed upon it by a law within the meaning of clause of Article the vice was not in the establishment of educational institutions by individuals and private bodies but in unnecessary <ORG> control the law of demand and supply must be allowed a free play the establishment of an educational institution was no different from any other venture eg starting a business or Industry It was immaterial whether the institution was established with or without profit motive only when there was profit motive that persons with means would come forward to open more and more schools and colleges even If It was held that a person had no right to establish an educational institution as a business venture he had atleast the right to establish a self financing educational institution which institution might also be described as one providing cost based education and thus it was open to a person to collect amounts from willing parties and establish an institution to educate such persons or their children as the case may be the quantum of the fees to be charged in such institution should be left to the concerned institution and the <ORG> should have no say in the matter it was not possible for the <ORG> in the very nature of things to go into the issue these private educational institutions were providing a large number of free seats to the nominees of the <ORG> and all these students would not have had an opportunity of studying the course of their choice but for the existence of these private educational institutions in these circumstances <NAME> case was not right in saying that charging of any amount by whatever name it was called over and above the fee charged by the <ORG> in its own colleges must be described as capitation fee and saying so amounted to imposing an impossible condition it was not possible for the private educational institutions to survive if they were compelled to charge only that fee as was charged in <ORG>al institutions the cost of educating an engineering or a medical graduate was very high all that cost was home by the <ORG> in <ORG>al Colleges since the <ORG> was not subsidising the private educational institutions these institutions had to find their own and that could come only from the students even if the right to establish an educational institution was not trade or business within the meaning of Article it was certainly an occupation within the meaning of the said clause the use of the four expressions profession occupation trade or business in Article was meant to cover the entire field of human activity and the petitioners had the right to establish private educational institutions at any rate self financing cost based private educational institutions which would be restricted only by a law as contemplated by clause of Article the right to establish and administer an educational institution by a member of the minority community religious or Lnguistic arose by necessary implication from Article the Constitution could not have intended to confine the said right only to minorities and deprive the majority communities therefrom the <ORG> or the <ORG> could insist or stipulate as a condition of recognition affiliation that the private educational institutions should admit students exclusively on merit moreover there might be several kinds of private educational institutions which might be established for achieving certain specified purposes viz to cater to the needs of a particular region or a district or to educate children of members of a particular community by virtue of mere recognition and or affiliation these private educational institutions did not become instrument of the <ORG> within the meaning of Article of the Constitution the concept of <ORG> action could not be extended to those colleges so as to subject them to the discipline of Part it might be a different matter the institution was in receipt of any aid partially and wholly from the <ORG> in such a situation the command of Article came into play but even that did not oblige the institution to admit the students exclusively on the basis of merit but only not to deny admission to anyone on any of the grounds mentioned therein and i that Article was negative in character and it merely declared that no person should be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law and since the <ORG> was not depriving the respondents students of their right to education Article was not attracted On behalf of the respondents and the Indian Medical Council and <ORG> it was contended that a imparting of education bad always been recognised from does immemorial as the religious duty and also as a charitable object and as a trade or business it was a mission and not a trade and commercialisation of education has always been looked upon with disfavour the <ORG> expressed its intention by enacting In <ORG> Act which specified the prevention of cow motion of education as one of the duties of <ORG> which Intention had also been expressed by several enactment made by the <ORG> and <ORG> Legislatures since then imparting of education was the most important function of the <ORG> which duty might be by <ORG> directly or through the instrumentality of private educational <ORG>s but when <ORG> permitted a private body or an individual to perform the said function It was its duty to ensure that so one got an admission or an advantage on account of his economic power to the detriment of a more meritorious candidate the very concept of collecting the cost of education that was what the concept of cost based or self financing educational <ORG>s meant was morally abhorrent and was opposed to public policy a capitation fee did not cease to be a capitation fee just because it was called as cost based education or by calling the <ORG> concerned as a self fianacing <ORG> these expressions were but a over for collecting capitation fee It was nothing but exploitation and was an elitist concept basically opposed to the constitutional philosephy the concept suffered from class bias and by allowing such education two classes would come Into being even If It was held that a citizen or a person had a dot to establish an educational institution the said right did not carry with it the right to recognition or the right to affiliation as the case may be even a minority educational institution was held by this <ORG> to have no fundamental right to recolor affiliation hence such a right could not be envisaged in the case of majority community or In the case of individuals or persons and it was open to the <ORG> or the <ORG> according recognition or affiliation to impose such conditions as they think appropriate in the Interest of fairness merit maintenance of standards of education and so on Including that the admission of students In whichever category It might be should be on the basis of merit and merit alone the <ORG>s obtaining recognition affiliation would be bound by such condition and any departure therefrom rendered the recognition affiliation liable to be withdrawn and even if such a condition was not expressly imposed it was implicit by virtue of the fact that in such a situation the activity of the private educational institution was liable to be termed as <ORG> action the fact that these institutions performed an important public function coupled with the fact that their activity was closely inter twined with governmental activity characterised their action as <ORG> action at the minimum the requirement would be to act fairly in the matter of admission of students and probably in the matter of recruitment and treatment of its employees as well these institutions were further bound not to charge any fee or amount over and above what was charged in On behalf of the <ORG> of India it was submitted that the Central <ORG> did not have the resources to undertake any aditional financial responsibility for medical or technical education it was unable to aid any private educational institution financially at a level higher than at present therefore the policy of the Central <ORG> was to involve private and voluntary efforts in the education sector in conformity with accepted norms and goals however the private educational institutions could not be compelled to charge only that fee as was charged in <ORG>al institutions so far as engineering colleges were concerned permission was being granted by the A I subject to the condition that they did not collect any capitation fee It was also submitted that a conferring unconditional and unqualified right to education at all levels to every citizen involving a constitutional obligation on the <ORG> to establish educational institutions either directly or through <ORG> agencies was not warranted by the Con stitution besides being unrealistic and impractical when the <ORG> granted recognition to private educational institutions it did not create an agency to fulfil its obligations under the Constitution and there was no scope to import the concept of agency in such a situation the principles laid down in <NAME> case required reconsideration it would be unrealistic and unwise to discourage private initiative in provid ing educational facilities particularly for higher education It was submitted on behalf of the students who had obtained admissions against the Management quota of seats that they were Innocent parties and had obtained admission in a bonafide belief that their admissions were being made properly they had been studying since then and in a few months their academic year would come to a close may be the managements were guilty of an irregularity but so far as the students were concerned they had done nothing contrary to law to deserve the punishment awarded by <ORG> of the High <ORG> The citizens of this country have a fundamental right to education A citizen of this country may have a right to establish an educational institution but no citizen person or institution has a right much less a fundamental right to or recognition or to grant in aid from the <ORG> Those institutions receiving aid shall howeverbe subject to all so terms and conditions as the aid giving authority may impose In the interest of general public The mere fact that the <ORG> is not taking away the right at present does not mean that right to education is not included within the right to life The effect of holding that right to education Is implicit in the right to life is that the state cannot deprive the citizen of his right to education except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law The right to education which is implicit in the right to life and personal liberty guaranteed by Article must be construed in the light of the directive principles in Part IV of the Constitution There are several articles in Part IV which expressly speak of right to education The right to education further means that a citizen has a right to call upon the <ORG> to provide educational facilities to him within the limits of its economic capacity and development Article of the Constitution declares that all citizens of country shall have the right to any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business A Assuming that a person or body of persons has a right to establish an educational institution this right is not an absolute one It is subject to such law as may be made by the <ORG> in the interest of general public However the right to establish an educational institution does not carry with it the right to recognition or the right to affiliation But be or the educational institution has no right to insist that the certificates or degrees if they can be called as such awarded by such institution should be recognised by the <ORG> muchless have they the right to say that the students trained by the institution should be admitted to examinations conducted by the <ORG> or by the <ORG> or any other authority as the case may be No educational institution except an <ORG> can award degrees Sections and of the Act A situation should be brought where there Is no room or occasion for the management or anyone on Its behalf to demand or collect any amount beyond what is permitted However charging the permitted fees by the private educational institutions which Is bound to be higher than the fees charged in similar governmental institutions by itself cannot be characterised as capitation fees It will be a matter of bargain between the <ORG> and the student seeking admission the admission can be made without reference to inter se merit of paying candidates The institution will be entitled to pick and choose the candidates among the applicants on such considerations as It may deem fit Section which prohibits collection of capitation fee by an educational <ORG> is expressly made inapplicable to such admissions Ile <ORG> Legislature had therefore no power to say that a private educational institution will be entitled to admit students of its choice irrespective of merit or that it is entitled to charge as much as it can which means a free hand for exploitation and more particularly commercialisation of education which is impermissible in law If It becomes necessary to decide this question In any subsequent case then having regard to Its vast impact inter alia on the capacity financial capacity the question may be referred to a larger Bench for decision The as to why Article did not positively confer a fundamental right to life or personal liberty like Article is that great concepts like liberty and We were purposefully left to gather meaning from experience There is no need to provide for the time in a positive manner It has to take steps to the maximum of its available resources with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the right of education by all appropriate means Since fundamental rights and directive principles are complementary to each other there is no reason why this fundamental right cannot be interpreted in this manner There is absolutely no fundamental right to recognition in any citizen If there is no fundamental right to establish a university a fortiori a fundamental right to establish an educational institution is not available By implication also a fundamental right of the nature and character conferred under Article cannot be read into Article Accordingly there is no fundamental right under Article to establish an educational institution if recognition or affiliation is sought for such an educational institution Irrespective of the educational institutions receiving aid it is a public duty A However not all the private <ORG>s belong to this category There are institutions which have attained great reputation by devotion and by nurturing high educational standards Regulatory measures must so ensure that private educational institutions maintain minimum standards and facilities Admission within all groups and categories should be based only on merit There may be reservation of seats in favour of the weaker sections of the society and other groups which deserve special treatment The question whether the right to primary education as mentioned in Article of the Constitution of India is a Fundamental Right under Article did not arise in <NAME> case and no finding or observation on that question was called for It was contended by learned counsel appearing for some of the parties before us that Article in Part IV of the Consititution expressly states that the provisions contained in Part IV shall not be enforceable by any court and that therefore assuming the right under Article to be included within the ambit of Article it would still not be enforceable Emphasis was also laid upon the language used in Article which requires the <ORG> to endeavour to provide for the free and compulsory education of children Having given our anxious consideration to the arguments in favour of and against the question aforementioned we are of the view that we should follow the well established principle of not proceeding to decide any question which is not necessary to be decided in the case We therefore do not express any opinion upon this question except to hold that the finding given in <NAME> case on this question was not necessary in that case and is therefore not binding law We are of the view that if it becomes necessary to decide his question in any subsequent case then for the reasons set out above and having regard to its vast impact inter alia on the country financial capacity the question may be referred to a larger Bench for decision For the purposes of these cases it is enough to state that there is no Fundamental Right to education for a professional degree that flows from Article The preamble to the Act recites An Act to prohibit the collection of capitation fee for admission to educations institutions in the State of Karnataka and matters relating thereto Whereas the practice of collecting capitation fee for admitting students into educational institutions is widespread in the State And whereas this undesirable practice beside contributing to large scale commercialisation of education has not been conducive to the maintenance of educational standards And whereas it is considered necessary to effectively curb this evil practice in public interest by providing for prohibition of collection or capitation fee and matters relating thereto Be it enacted by <ORG> in the Thirty Fourth Year of the Republic of India as follows Clause of Section defines the expression Capitation fee in the following words Capitation fee means any amount by whatever name called paid or collected directly or indirectly in excess of the fee prescribed under on but does not include the deposit specified under the proviso to section In view of their importance these sub sections may be set out in full in order to regulate the capitation fee charged or collected during the period specified under the proviso to section the Government may from time to time by general or special order specify in respect of each private educational institution or class or classes of such institutions It is obvious that if the seats to be filled on the basis of merit refundable deposit are not specified all the seats other than Government seats can be filled at the discretion of the management iii the number of Karnataka students which expression is defined by the explanation should not be less than over all iv in case the number of seats to be filled on merit cum refundable deposit are specified a selection committee as contemplated by sub section has to be formed for making the selection In exercise of the power conferred by section of the Act <ORG> issued a notification on June i Is there a right to education guaranteed to the people of India under the Constitution If so does the concept of capitation fee infract the same ii Whether the charging of capitation fee in consideration of admission to educational institutions is arbitrary unfair unjust and as such violates the equality clause contained in Article of the Constitution iii Whether the impugned notification permits <ORG> to charge capitation fee in the guise of regulating fees under the Act and iv Whether the notification is violative of the provisions of the Act which in specific terms prohibits the charging of capitation fee by any educational institution in the State of Karnataka Unless the right to education mentioned in Article is made a reality the fundamental rights in Part III will remain beyond the reach of the illiterate majority Article has been interpreted by this Court to include the right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it We hold that every citizen has a right to education under the Constitution It was directed that the said decision shall have only prospective operation and shall not affect the admissions already made in accordance with the said notification the Respondents in those writ petitions including the State of Andhra Pradesh have filed a number of Ps seeking leave to appeal against the said judgment The three questions are Whether the Constitution of India guarantees a fundamental right to education to its citizens Whether a citizen of India has the fundamental right to establish and run an educational institution under Article or any other provision in the Constitution Whether the grant of permission to establish and the grant of affiliation by a <ORG> imposes an obligation upon an educational institution to act fairly in the matter of admission of the students Before we deal with the above questions it would be appropriate to notice the legal and relevant factual position obtaining in three others States namely Andhra Pradesh Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu Section defines certain expressions occurring in the Act Sub section prescribes the requirements which have to be satisfied by an applicant the matters with respect to which the competent authority has to be satisfied before grant of permission and the steps that have to be taken by the person to whom the permission is granted within the specified period The <ORG> must be satisfied before granting the permission that there is a need for providing educational facilities to the people in the locality that there is adequate financial provision for continued and efficient maintenance of the institution as prescribed by the competent authority and evidence that the institution is proposed to be located in sanitary and healthy surroundings The local authority or the body of persons to whom the permission is granted has to appoint the teaching staff qualified according to the rules made by the <ORG> in this behalf and satisfy other requirements laid down by the Act rules and the orders made thereunder within the period specified by the authorities It reads Whereas the undesirable practice of collecting capitation fee at the time of admitting students into educational institutions is on the increase in the State And whereas the said practice has been contributing to large scale commercialisation of Education And whereas it is considered necessary to effectively curb this evil practice in order to avoid frustration among the meritorious and indigent students and to maintain excellence in the students of education Be it enacted by <ORG> in the Thirty fourth year of the Republic of India as follows The Act was brought into force on and with effect from th January Section provides that even a minority educational institutions shall have to admit students on the basis of merit while admitting the students belonging to that minority or other students Section provides for penalties in case of contravention of the provisions of the Act Section confers upon the Government the power to make rules to carry out the purposes of the enactment The Act was amended in the year by inserting Section A which section reads as follows Notwithstanding anything contained in Section but subject to such rules as may be made in this behalf and the Andhra Pradesh Educational Institutions Regulation of Admission Order it shall be lawful for the management of any un aided private Engineering College <ORG> <ORG> and such other class of un aided educational institutions as may be notified by the <ORG> in this behalf to admit students into such Colleges or educational institutions to the extent of one half of the total number of seats from among those who have qualified in the common entrance test or in the qualifying examination as the case may be referred to in sub section of Section irrespective of the ranking assigned to them in such test or examination and nothing contained in Section shall apply to such admission It starts with a non obstante clause Notwithstanding anything contained in Section but subject to such rules as may be made in this behalf and the Andhra Pradesh Educational Institutions Regulation of Admission Order Presidential order issued under Article of the Constitution it then says that it shall be lawful for the management of any un aided private Engineering college <ORG> <ORG> and such other class of un aided educational institutions as may be notified by the <ORG> in this behalf to admit students into such Colleges or educational institutions to the extent of per cent of the seats from among those qualified in the entrance test or the qualifying examination as the class may be the section says further rather curiously that the educational institution shall be entitled to admit them irrespective of the ranking assigned to them in the entrance test or qualifying examination and further that nothing contained in Section shall apply to such admission No Rules have been made by the <ORG> under the Section so far There are a number of private engineering colleges in the State The management had no discretion or choice in the matter of admission of students There was an uproar among the student and teaching community against such admissions Leave is granted in all the Special leave petitions preferred against the Full Bench decision of <ORG> dated th September in Writ Petition No of and batch of educational standards AND WHEREAS the National Policy on Education envisages that the commercialisation of technical and professional education should be curbed and that steps should be taken to prevent the establishment of institutions set up to commercialise education AND WHEREAS with a view to effectively curb this evil practice it is expedient in the public interest to prohibit collection of capitation fee for admission of students to and their promotion to a higher standard or class in the educational institutions in the State of Maharashtra and to provide for matters connected therewith it is hereby enacted in the Thirty eighth year of the Republic of India as follows Section defines certain expressions occurring in the Act Clause a defines capitation fee to mean any amount by whatever name called whether in cash or kind paid or collected directly or indirectly in excess of the prescribed or as the case may be approved rates of fees regulated under section Section empowers the <ORG> to regulate the tuition fee that may be received or collected by any educational institution for admission to any course of study in such institution Section provides for punishment which may extend to three years and fine in case of contravention of any provisions of Act or Rules per annum in the case of private un aided engineering colleges which was raised to Rs Soon after the decision of this court in <NAME> a large number of students filed a writ petition in <ORG> <ORG> claiming refund of the fee collected from them in excess of the fee prescribed by the <ORG> for students admitted in government medical colleges for such course The said interlocutory order is challenged by the appellant in Civil Appeal No of Writ Petition of is preferred by <ORG> Pune questioning the correctness of <NAME> and praying for issuance of a declaration that the petitioner has a fundamental right under Article of the Constitution of India to establish and run a self financing engineering college subject to compliance with the regulatory requirements of the statute Soon after the decision in <NAME> the Governor of Tamil Nadu promulgated an ordinance being ordinance No of called the Tamil Nadu Educational Institutions Prohibition of collection of capitation fee Ordinance The preamble to the Act recites WHEREAS the practice of collecting capital fee for admitting students into educational institutions is widespread in the State AND WHEREAS this undesirable practice besides contributing a large scale commercialisation of education has not been conducive to the maintenance of educational standards AND WHEREAS it is considered necessary to effectively curb this undesirable practice in public interest by prohibiting the collection of capitation fee and to provide for matters relating thereto BE it enacted by <ORG> of the State of Tamil Nadu in the Forty third year of the Republic of India as follows The expression capitation fee is defined in Clause a of Section to mean any amount by whatever name called paid or collected directly or indirectly in excess of the fee prescribed under Section Section Provides for penalties in case of contravention of any of the provisions of the Act or the rules made thereunder The minimum punishment is three years imprisonment which may extend up to seven years in addition to fine Section gives an overriding effect to the provisions of the Act over any other law for the time being in force Section confers upon the Government the power to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act A writ of mandamus is sought by this institution directed to the respondents State of Tamil Nadu <ORG> and <ORG> to forbear from in any manner interfering with the right of the petitioner to collect capitation fees by whatever nomenclature the said fee or payment may be described from the students seeking admission into various degree courses in the colleges under the control of the petitioner University to cover a reasonable return on the capital investment and meet the recurring expenditure every year for running the course in the colleges including for running <ORG> from the various students who seek admission and who have the requisite merit to be admitted and who are ready and to pay such amount The petitioners have come forward with the following case <ORG> is an autonomous residential unitary university es tablished and incorporated under the Annamalai University Act enacted by the then Madras <ORG> The impugned ordinance by the date of filing of writ petition the Act replacing the ordinance had not yet come into force is violative of the fundamental right of the petitioners to establish and administer a medical college by collecting appropriate amounts from the students who are ready and willing to pay the same for their admission into the medical college says the petitioner Whether the Constitution of Inda guarantees a fundamental right to education to its citizens Article declares that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law We feel unable to hold that the term was intended to bear only this narrow interpretation but on the other hand consider that personal liberty is used in the Article as a compendious term to include within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberties of man other than those deal with in the several clauses of Art There is no question of one being carved out of another speaking for a Constitution Bench of this court observed The sweep of the right to life conferred by Article is wide and far reaching It does not mean merely that life cannot be extinguished or taken away as for example by the imposition and execution of the death sentence except according to procedure established by law And yet such deprivation would not have to be in accordance with the procedure established by law if the right to livelihood is not regarded as a part of the right to fife Deprive a person of his right to livelihood and you shall have deprived him of his life Article a of the Constitution which is a Directive Principle of <ORG> Policy provides that the <ORG> shall in particular direct its policy towards securing that the citizens men and women equally have the right to an adequate means of livelihood Article which is another Directive Principle provides inter alia that the <ORG> shall within the limits of its economic capacity and development make effective provision for securing the right to work in cases of unemployment and of undeserved want If there is an obligation upon the <ORG> to secure to the citizens an adequate means of livelihood and the right to work it would be sheer pedantry to exclude the right to livelihood from the content of the right to life This <ORG> has also been consistently adopting the approach that the fundamental rights and directive principles are supplementary and complementary to each other and that the provisions in Part III should be interpreted having regard to the Preamble and the directive principles of the <ORG> policy While moving for consideration the interim report on fundamental rights <NAME> described both the rights mentioned in Pam III and IV as fundamental rights one justificiable and other non justiciable In his supplemental report he stated There were two parts of the report one contains fundamental rights which were justiciable and the other part of the report refers to fundamental rights which were not justiciable but were directives <NAME> as he then was put the same idea in the following words As I look at the provisions of Parts III and IV I feel no doubt that the basic object of conferring freedoms on individuals is the ultimate achievement of the ideals set out in Part IV This is on the view that the State in Article read with Article includes the judiciary as well In Bandhua Mukti March this court held that the right to life guaranteed by Article does take in educational facilities Having regard to the fundamental significance of education to the life of an individual and the nation and adopting the reasoning and logic adopted in the earlier decisions of this <ORG> referred to hereinbefore we hold agreeing with the statement in <ORG> that right to education is implicit in and flows from the right to life guaranteed by Article In particular we agree with the observation that without education being provided to the citizens of this country the objectives set forth in the Preamble to the Constitution cannot be achieved In these days it is doubtful any child may reasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education It is argued by some of the counsel for the petitioners that Article is negative an character and that it merely declares that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law The first question is whether the right to life guaranteed by Article does take in the right to education or not It is then that the second question arises whether the <ORG> is taking away that right The mere fact that the <ORG> is not taking away the right as at present does not mean that right to education is not included within the right to life The effect of holding that right to education is implicit in the right to fife is that the <ORG> cannot deprive the citizen of his right to education except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law The right to education which is implicit in the right to fife and personal liberty guarenteed by Article must be construed in the fight of the directive principles in Part IV of the Constitution So far as the right to education is concerned there are several articles in Part IV which expressly speak of it Article says that the <ORG> shall within the limits of its economic capacity and development make effective provision for securing the right to work to education and to public assistance in cases of unemployment old age sickness and disablement and in other cases of underserved want Article commands that the <ORG> shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and in particular of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation By primary education we mean the education which a normal child receives by the time he completes years of age There is a fairly general tendency for planned targets of increased primary schooling not to be reached whereas targets are over reached sometimes substantially as regards increases in secondary and particularly tertiary schooling As late as <ORG> has this to say in para of its publication Challenge of Education a policy perspective The right to education further means that a citizen has a right to call upon the <ORG> to provide educational facilities to him within the limits of its economic capacity and development While elaborating the scope of the right guaranteed under Article this court stated But the question which arises is whether the right to life is limited only to protection of limb or faculty or does it go further and embrace something more We think that the right to life includes right to live with human dignity and all that goes along with it viz the bare necessities of life such as adequate nutrition clothing and shelter and facilities for reading writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms freely moving about the mixing and commingling with fellow human beings Of course the magnitude and content of the components of this right would depend upon the extent of the economic development of the country but it must in any view of the matter include a right to the basic necessities of life and also the right to carry on such functions and activities as constitute the bare minimum expression of the humanself As a matter of fact we have referred to Articles and merely to determine the parameters of the said right The contentions urged by the counsel for the petitioners can be broadly summarised in the following words a The <ORG> has no monopoly in the matter of imparting education Every citizen has the fundamental right to establish an educational institution as a part of the right guaranteed to him by Article of the Constitution Because there are more number of persons seeking admission that the existing institutions can provide that the several ins complained of have developed Indeed only when there is profit motive that persons with means would come forward to open more and more schools and colleges There are not many persons available today who are prepared to donate large funds for establishing such institutions by way of charity or philantrophy Even if it is held for any reason that a person has not right to establish an education institution as a business venture he has atleast the right to establish a self financing educational institution Such a institution may also be described as an institution providing cost based education May be the <ORG> or the <ORG> may insist that as a condition for running such institution a reasonable number of seats should be allotted to students purely on merit who shall be asked to pay only such fees as is charged in similar <ORG>al institutions If this is done to which the petitioners have no objection it will not only meet the needs of education of those who have the capacity to pay but it will also meet the needs of other meritorious students who are not able to obtain admission in the <ORG>al institutions and are also not in a position to pay the fees normally charged such private institutions Even if the right to establish an educational institution is not trade or business within the meaning of Article it is certainly an occupation within the meaning of the said clause It is enough to say that the petitioners do have the right to establish private educational institutions at any rate self financing cost based private educational institutions This right can be restricted only by a law as contemplated by clause of Article The right to establish and administer an educational institution by a member of the majority community religion or linguistic arises by necessary implication from Article The Government or the <ORG> cannot insist of stipulate as a condition of recognition affiliation that the private educational institutions should admit students exclusively on merit There is no reason why such a right should not be recognised in the case of the private educational institutions There may be yet another institution which may have been established with the and of a large donation made by a charitable minded person Annamalai <ORG> in Tamil Nadu On the other hand it is contended by the learned counsel for the respondents as also by the learned counsel for <ORG> and <ORG> that a imparting of education has always been recognised in this country from times immemorial as the religious duty If for any reason it is held that a citizen or a person has a right to establish an educational institution the said right does not carry with it the right to recognition or the right to affiliation as the case may be It has been repeatedly held by this court that even a minority educational institution has no fundamental right to recognition or affiliation Section empowers the <ORG> to take in consultation with the <ORG> and other concerned bodies all such steps as it may think fit for the promotion and ordination of University education and for the determination and maintenance of standards of teaching examination and research in the <ORG> Section prescribes the consequences of failure of <ORG> to comply with the recommendations of the <ORG> Section prohibits the use of the word <ORG> in the name of any on other than a <ORG> established or incorporated under an enactment or a deemed <ORG> Section provides for penalties for violation of Sections and Section confers the rule making power upon the central <ORG> while Section confers the regulation power upon the <ORG> Section declares that the medical qualifications granted by any <ORG> or medical institution in India which are included in the first schedule to the Act shall be recognised medical qualifications for the purposes of the Act It also provides the procedure for any <ORG> or <ORG> institution applying to <ORG> for recognising new or other qualifications Section confers the rule making power upon the <ORG> while Section confers the regulation making power upon the <ORG> Section of the Act provides for the establishment of the <ORG> while Section specifies the functions of the <ORG> Apart from directing generally that the <ORG> shall take all such steps as it may think fit for ensuring coordinated and integrated development of technical education and maintenance of standards the Act specifically empowers the <ORG> inter alia to fix norms and guidelines for charging tuition and other fees grant approval for starting new technical institutions and for introduction of new courses or programmes in consultation with the agencies concerned and take an necessary steps to prevent commercialisation of technical education It is true there is no express provision in the Act which says that no engineering college or any other college or institution imparting technical education shall be established except with the permission of the <ORG> We are of the opinion that the vast powers conferred upon the <ORG> by Section including those specified above do extend to and entitle it to issue an order to the above effect It can also pass appropriate directions to the existing institutions as well for achieving the purposes of the Act It is brought to our notice by the learned counsel appearing for the <ORG> that the <ORG> has evolved a proforma of undertaking which should be executed by the person in charge of any institution proposed to be established stating inter alia that such institution will not only observe the several orders and instructions issued by the <ORG> but it shall not charge any capitation fee from the students guardians of the students in any form It is also brought to our notice that the <ORG> has issued guidelines for admission to Engineering Degree and Engineering Diploma programmes in dated th June in exercise of the power conferred upon it by Section of the Act Section of the Act confers the regulation making power upon the <ORG> The section prescribes the procedure for submitting the application the matters which <ORG> shall take into account while considering the said application the obligatory consultation with the <ORG> and the manner in which the application shall be disposed of It also provides the matters which the <ORG> should take into consideration while making its recommendation to <ORG> Suffice it to mention that the several matters which the <ORG> and <ORG> are directed to take into consideration are designed to ensure that a properly equipped institution is in place before it is permitted to impart medical education It is thus the Central <ORG> does not have the resources to undertake any additional financial responsibility for medical or technical education it is unable to aid any private educational institution financially at a level higher than at present therefore the policy of the Central <ORG> is to involve private and voluntary efforts in the education sector in conformity with accepted norms and goals however the private educational institutions cannot be compelled to charge only that fee as is charged in <ORG>al institutions in the Central <ORG> has evolved the New Education Policy according to it in the interests of maintaining the standards and for several other valid reasons the commercialisation of technical and professional education will be curbed When the Government grants recognition to private educational institutions it does not create an agency to fulfill its obligations under the Constitution and there is no scope to import the concept of agency in such a situation The principles laid down in <NAME> case do require reconsideration Admissions within all groups and categories should be based on merit So far as un aided institutions are concerned it is obvious that they cannot be compelled to charge the same fee as is charged in <ORG>al institutions RIGHT TO ESTABLISH AN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION Article of the Constitution declares that all citizens of this country shall have the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade on business Clause of Article however says Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevents the State from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said clause and in particular nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to or prevents the State from making any law relating to i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business or ii carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> or any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise While we do not with to express any opinion on the question whether the right to establish an educational institution can be said to be carrying on any occupation within the meaning of Article perhaps it is we are certainly of the opinion that such activity can neither be a trade or business nor can it be a profession within the meaning of Article The learned counsel for the petitioners relied upon certain decisions in support of their contention that right to establish an educational institution flows from Article At page while dealing with Section of the Gujarat Secondary Education Act empowering the <ORG> to take over an educational institution in certain situations for a period not exceeding five years the teamed Judges observed that the said provision is introduced in the interest of the general public and does not in any way affect prejudically the fundamental right of the management guaranteed under Article of the Constitution We do not think the said observation in a different context has any application here For the purpose of these cases we shall proceed on the assumption that a person or body of persons has a right to establish an educationtal institution in this country It is subject to such law as may be made by the <ORG> in the interest of general public They also recognised that recognition or affiliation is essential for a meaningful exercise of the right to establish and administer educational institutions But he or the educational institution has no right to insist that the certificates ordegree if they can be called as such awarded by such institution should be recognised by the <ORG> much less have they the right to say that the students trained by the institution should be admitted to examinations conducted by the <ORG> or by the <ORG> or any other authority as the case may be Admission to the privileges of a <ORG> is a power to be exercised with great care keeping in view the interest of the general public and the nation It is for this reason that all the private educational institutions seek recognition and or affiliation with a view to enable them to send the students trained by them to appear at the examinations conducted by the <ORG> <ORG> The idea is that if such students pass the said examination the <ORG> <ORG> will award its degree diploma cer tificate to them No educational institution except an <ORG> can award degrees Sections and of the Act Accordingly we have evolved with the help of the counsel appearing before us and keeping in view the positive features of the several <ORG> and <ORG> enactments refeffred to hereinbefore the following scheme which every authority granting recognition affiliation shall impose upon the institutions seeking such recognition affiliation We must strive to bring about a situation where there is no room or occasion for the management or anyone on its behalf to demand or collect any amount beyond what is permitted We must clarify that charging the permitted fees by the private educational institutions which is bound to be higher than the fees charged in similar governmental institutions by itself cannot be characterised as capitation fees The expression Professional colleges in this scheme includes i medical colleges dental colleges and other institutions and colleges imparting Nursing Pharmacy and other courses allied to Medicine established and or run by private education institutions ii colleges of engineering and colleges and institutions imparting technical education including electronics computer sciences established and or run by private educational institutions and iii such other colleges to which this scheme is made applicable by the <ORG> recognising and or affiliating authority The expression appropriate authority means the <ORG> <ORG> or other authority as is competent to grant permission to establish or to grant recognition to a professional college It is made clear that only those institutions which seek permission to establish and or recognition and or affiliation from the appropriate authority shall alone be made bound by this scheme It shalt however give opportunity to the professional colleges or their association if any to place such material as they think fit <ORG> may also consider the advisability of issuing directions under Section of the A I Act regulating the fees that may be charged in private unaided educational institutions imparting technical education It is made clear that even in the matter of reserved categories if any the principle of inter se merit shall be followed No professional college shall be entitled to ask for any other or further payment or amount under whatever name it may be called from any student allotted to it whether against the free seat or payment seat It is made clear that it shall be open to the appropriate authority and the competent authority to issue such further instructions or directions as they may think appropriate not inconsistent with this scheme by way of elaboration and elucidation But our idea in devising this scheme has been to provide more opportunities to meritorious students who may not be able to pay the enhanced fee prescribed by the government for such colleges Section A of the aforesaid Act as introduced by the Andhra Pradesh Amendment Act of read as follows Notwithstanding anything contained in Section but subject to such rules as may be made in this behalf and the Andhra Pradesh Educational Institutions Regulation of admission Order it shall be lawful for the management of any unaided private engineering college medical college dental college and such other class of unaided educational institutions as may be notified by the Government in this behalf to admit students into such colleges or educational institutions to the extent of one half of the total number of seats from among those who have qualified in the common entrance test or in the qualifying examina tion as the case may be referred to in sub section of Section irrespective of the ranking assigned to them in such test or examination and nothing contained in Section shall apply to such admissions It says that notwithstanding anything contained in Section but subject to the rules as may be framed by the <ORG> in this behalf the private educational institutions of the nature mentioned therein shall be entitled to admit students to the extend of half the number of seats from among those who have qualified in the common entrace test or the qualifying examination as the case may be admission of such students could be irrespective of the ranking assigned to them to the common entrance test or other qualifying examination as the case may be and it is made clear that nothing contained in Section shall apply to such admissions The section read as a whole leads to the following consequences a It is open to the private educational institutions to charge as much amount as they can for admission It will be a matter of bargain between the institution and the student seeking admission The institution will be entitled to pick and choose the candidates among the applicants on such considerations as it may deem fit The <ORG> Legislature had therefore no power to say that a private educational institution will be entitled to admit students of its choice irrespective of merit or that it is entitled to charge as much as it can which means a free hand for exploitation and more particularly commercialisation of education which is impermissible in law In the circumstances it is not necessary for us to go into the question whether the section is bad on account of repugnancy with Section A of the University Grants Commission Act We agree that the offending portions of Section A cannot be severed from the main body of the section and therefore the whole section is liable to fall to the ground It is submitted by <NAME> the learned counsel for these students that they were innocent parties and had obtained admission in a bona fide belief that their admissions were being made properly The citizens of this country have a fundamental right to education A citizen of this country may have a right to establish an educational institution but no citizen perosn or institution has a right much less a fundamental right to affiliation or recognition or to grant in aid from the <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> I have had the advantage of perusing the judgment of my learned brother Justice <NAME> Since my learned brother has set out the facts I will confine myself to answering the three questions namely Whether the Constitution of India guarantees a fundamental right to education to its citizens Whether there is a fundamental right to establish an educational institution under Article Various fundamental rights enumerated under Part III of our Constitution can be divided into two classes Article reads as follows Perfection of life and personal liberty No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law A question may be asked as to why it did not positively confer a fundamental right to life or personal liberty like Article However it has been found necessary from time to time to define a new the exact nature and the extent of such protection There is no need to provide for the same in a positive manner So far as the right personal liberty is concerned it is ensured by providing that no one shall be deprived of personal liberty except according to procedure prescribed by law The first question that arises for consideration on the language of Art But there was no definite pronouncement made on this point since the question before the Court was no so much the interpretation of the words personal liberty as the inter relation between Arts SCR AIR SC that the question as to the proper scope and meaning of the expression personal liberty came up pointedly for consideration for the first time before this Court The majority of the Judges took the view that personal liberty is used in the article as a compendious term to include within itself all the varieties of rights which go to make up the personal liberties of man other than those dealt with in the several clauses of Art There is no question of one being carved out of another SCR page Mathew stated therein that the fundamental rights themselves have no fixed content most of them are empty vessels into which each generation must pour its content in the light of its experience SCR In this case reliance was placed on the American decision in <NAME> Connecticut US at Shelter Santistar Builder KI Totame SCC If really Article which is the heart of fudamental rights has received expanded meaning from time to time there is no justification as to why it cannot be interpreted in the light of Article wherein the <ORG> is obligated to provide education up to years of age within the prescribed time limit This right to live with human dignity free from exploitation This right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article derives its life breath from the directive Principles of <ORG> Policy and particularly clauses and of Article and Article and and at the least therefore it must include protection of the health and strength of workers men and women and of the tender age of children against abuse opportunities and facilities for children to develop in a healthy manner and in conditions of freedom and dignity educational facilities just and humane conditions of work and maternity relief These are the minimum requirements which must exist in order to enable a person to five with human dignity and no <ORG> neither the Central Government nor any <ORG> Government has the right to take any action which will deprive a person of the enjoyment of these basic essentials Since the Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy contained in clauses and of Article Articles and are not enforceable in a court of law it may not be possible to compel the <ORG> through the judicial process to make provision by statutory enactment or executive fiat for ensuring these basic essentials which go to make up a life of human dignity but where legislation is already enacted by the <ORG> providing these basic requirements to the workmen and thus investing their right to live with basic human dignity with concrete reality and content the <ORG> can certainly be obligated to ensure observance of such legislation for inaction on the part of the <ORG> in securing implementation of such legislation would amount to denial of the right to live with human dignity enshrined in Article more so in the context of Article which provides that the executive power of every <ORG> shall be so exercised as to ensure compliance with the laws made by <ORG> and any existing laws which apply in that <ORG> Upon that assumption the question which we have to consider is whether the right to fife includes the right to livelihood The sweep of the right to life conferred by Article is wide and far reaching It does not mean merely that life cannot be extinguished or taken away as for example by the imposition and execution of the death sentence except according to procedure established by law And yet such deprivation would not have to be in accordance with the procedure established by law if the right to livelihood is not regarded as a part of the right to live That they can do namely eat only if they have the means of livelihood Life as observed by <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> Illinois means something more than mere animal existence and the inhibition against the deprivation of fife extends to all those limits and faculties by which life is enjoyed Article a of the Constitution which is a Directive Principle of <ORG> Policy provides that the <ORG> shall in particular direct its policy towards securing that the citizens men and women equally have the right to an adequate means of livelihood Article which is another Directive Principle provides inter alia that the <ORG> shalt within the limits of its economic capacity and development make effective provision for securing the right to work in cases of unemployment and of undeserved want If there is an obligation upon the <ORG> to secure to the citizens an adequate means of livelihood and the right to work it would be sheer pedantry to exclude the right to livelihood from the content of the right to life But any person who is deprived of his right to livelihood except according to just and fair procedure established by law can challenge the deprivation as offending the right to life conferred by Article We fail to see how refusal of an application to enter a medical college can be said to affect one personal liberty guaranteed under that article The number of seats being limited compared to the number of applicants every candidate could not expect to be admitted Once it is held that the test is not invalid the deprivation of personal liberty if any in the matter of admission to a medical college was according to procedure established by law It requires to be carefully noted that deprivate of personal liberty if done by a valid procedure established by law the fundamental right under Article was not in any manner affected Now coming to <NAME> case supra it was observed at pages Right to life is the compendious expression for all those rights which the courts must enforce because they are basic to the dignified enjoyment of life This Court has uniformly taken the view that harmonious interpretation of the fundamental rights vis a vis the directive principles must be adopted We will now refer to some of the important cases SCR at it was held There is complete unanimity of judicial opinion of this <ORG> that the Directive Principles and the Fundamental Rights should be construed in harmony with each other and every attempt should be made by the <ORG> to resolve apparent inconsistency So far as the <ORG> are concerned where there is no apparent inconsistency between the Directive Principles contained in Part IV and the Fundamental Rights mentioned in Part III there is no difficulty in putting a harmonious construction which advances the object of the Constitution So far as the courts are con cerned where there is no apparent inconsistency between the directive principles contained in Part which in fact supplement each other there is no difficulty in putting a harmonious construction which advances the object of the Constitution This was however in the context of Article which seeks to protect persons at the deprivation of their life except according to procedure established by law VII at pages and of the Constitutent Debates it is stated The Honourable Shri Santhanam Sir you will remeber that throughout Europe after the First World War all that the minorities wanted was the right to have their own schools and to conserve their own cultures which the Fascist and the Nazis refused them Therefore I do not think it is right on the part of any minority to depreciate the rights given in article And then in clause of this article it is provided that when the <ORG> gives aid to education it shall not discriminate against any educational institution on the ground that it is under the management of a minority First of all we have to give to large linguistic minorities their right to be educated especially in the primary stages in their own language Therefore we should not have rigid provisions by which every child is automatically protected in what may be called his mother tongue Wherever there are large numbers of children they should be given education primary education in their mother tongue But this I think would give the minority or section of people speaking a language the complete and absolute right to have primary education which the people of this country do not have today Emphasis supplied In the World of Science and the Rule of Law by <NAME> Edition at page if is stated The principal global treaty which covers this right is the ICESCR whose Article recognizes the general right to education enunciated by the UDHR but then goes on to add the following more specific provisions The States Parties to the present Covenant recognize that with a view to achieving the full realization of this right a Primary education shall be compulsory and available fee to all Secondary education in its different forms including technical and vocational secondary education shall be made generally available and accessible to all by every appropriate means and in particular by the progressive introduction of free education Higher education shall be made equally accessible to all on the progressive introduction of free education Fundamental education shall be encouraged or intensified as far as possible for those persons who have not received or completed the whose period of their primary education The development of a system of schools at all levels shall be actively pursued an adequate fellowship system shall be established and the material conditions of teach ing staff shall be continuously improved It has to take steps to the maximum of its available resources with a view to achieving progressively the full realization of the right of education by all appropriate means But with regard to the general obligation to provide education the <ORG> is bound to provide the same if it deliberately starved its educational system by resources that it meanifestly had available unless it could show that it was allocating them to some even more pressing programme Thus the key to discovering whether education is Fundamental is not to be found imcomparisons of the relative societal significances of education as opposed to subsistence or housing Rather the answer lies in assessing whether there is a right to education explicitly or implicity guaranteed by the Constitution The next question is whether there is a fundamental right to establish an educational institution That takes us to Article To illustrate co operative societies or mutual insurance companies may carry on business without earning any income or without any profit motive Nor do we find any reason why if teaching is a vocation teaching of Vedanta is not <NAME> The words Trade and Business do not mean the same thing In view of the above dictionary meaning of the word business it cannot be said that the definition of business given in Section of the Partnership Act Vict held The word Business however is also used in another and a very different sense as meaning an active occupation or profession continuously carried on and it is in this sense the word is used in the Act with which we are here concerned The word Business is one of wide import and it means an activity carried on continuously and systematically by a person by the application of his labour skiff with a view to earning an income We are of the view that in the context in which the expression business is used in Section of the Act there is warrant for giving a restricted meaning to it excluding professional connections from its scope There is absolutely no fundamental right to recognition in any citizen The logical corollary of holding that a fundamental right to establish in educational institution is available under Article would lead of the proposition right to establish a university also The position with respect to the establishment of Universities before the Constitution came into force in was this There was no law in India which prohibited any private individual or body from establishing a university and it was therefore open to a private individual or body to establish a university There is a good deal in common between educational institutions which are not universities and those which are universities Thus in law in India there was no prohibition against establishment of universities by private individuals or bodies and if any university was so established it must of necessity be granting degrees before it could be called a university It there is no fundamental right to establish a university a fortiori a fundamental right to establish an educational institution is not available By implication also a fundamental right of the nature and character conferred under Article cannot be read into Article If the scope of Article is made an extension of the right under Article as the right to establish and administer educational institutions for giving religious instruction or for imparting education in their religious teachings or tenets the fundamental right of minorities to establish and administer educational institution of their choice will be taken away Emphasis Supplied At page it is observed Article is a special right to minorities to establish educational institutions of their choice If religious or linguistic minorities are not given protection under Article to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice they will feel isolated and separate Accordingly it is held that there is no fundamental right under Article to establish an educational institution if recognition or affiliation is sought for such an educational institution It may be made clear that any one desirous of starting an institution purely for the purposes of educating the students he could do so but Sections and of the <ORG> Grants Commission Act which prohibits the award of degrees except by a <ORG> must be kept in mind The next question which calls for determination is does recognition or affiliation make the educational institution an instrumentality We propose to examine this question with reference to the following cases We find that the same view has been taken by <NAME> in a subsequent decision of this Court in the UP <ORG> <NAME> SCC and the observations made by the learned Judge in that case strongly reinforced the view we are taking particularly in the matrix of our constitutional system In the absence of a fair application of the tests to be made there is possibility of turning every non governmental society into an agency or instrumentality of the <ORG> <NAME> SCC is an interesting case where a writ of mandamus was issued to a private college But once these are absent and when the party has no other equa lly convenient remedy mandamus cannot be denied When there is existence of this relationship mandamus cannot be refused to the aggrieved party But there were important safeguards It uses the words having regard to Those words are indefinite The public authority for them mean every body which is created by statute and whose powers and duties are defined by statute But there is no such limitation for our <ORG> to issue the writ in the nature of mandamus Article confers wide powers on the <ORG> to issue writs in the nature of prerogative writs Under Article writs can be issued to any person or authority Power of <ORG> to issue certain writs Notwithstanding anything in Article <ORG> shall have power throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction to issue to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any government within those territories directions orders and writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari or any of them for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose The scope of this article has been explained by <NAME> In <NAME> <ORG> SCR This article is couched in comprehensive phraseology and it ex facie confers a wide power on <ORG> to reach injustice wherever it is found Article confers power on <ORG> to issue writs for enforcement of the fundamental rights as well as non fundamental rights Irrespective of the educational institutions receiving aid it should be held that it is a public duty At page it is held In fact given its novelty the panel fits surprisingly well into the format which this court had in mind in <ORG> It Merely requires that the court should have regard to the nature of the matter in respect of which such relief may be granted The relevant extracts from the National Policy on Education being paragraph and are set out herein below In the interests of maintaining standards and for several other valid reasons the commercialisation of technical and professional education will be curbed At this juncture it is worthwhile to refer to the Resolution passed at the th AR India Medical Conference Resolution No Racketeering in Medical Education Whereas a number of institutions have sprung up in the country that style themselves as <ORG> and Whereas such institutions charge large sums as capitation fees a practice which <ORG> and <ORG> have opposed a number of times and Whereas such institutions neither have suitable buildings nor proper equipment and even lack adequate staff of requisite qualifications and further it has come to light that these institutions swindle the public by taking large sums of money from students although these institutions have not been recognised by the authorities This th All India Medical Conference urges upon the Governments to take stringent measures against persons institutions who which run such medical colleges and close them and recommend to <ORG> not to grant them recognition There are institutions which have attained great reputation by devotion and by nurturing high educational standards Regulatory measures must so ensure that private educational institutions maintain minimum standards and facilities Admission within all groups and categories should be based only on merit SCR at page <ORG> is directed to formulate a proper constitutional basis for determining the selection of candidates for nomination to seats in <ORG> outside the State in the light of the observations contained in this judgment It is not the function of the <ORG> to so manage its affairs as to earn the maximum profit even as a private corporate body may be inspired to earn huge profits with a view to paying large dividends to its shareholders In <ORG> A SCC at pages it is held This Court expressly rejected the submission which had found favour with <ORG> that in the absence of a specification by the State Government the position would be as it was before the amendment that is the Board was to carry on its affairs and adjust the tariffs in such a manner as not to incur a loss and no more At page it is stated In English law the word charity has both a popular and a technical meaning Even according to the popular or ordinary meaning the word is used in more senses than one It is said there is also restraint on collection of students fees In <ORG> Minister of Town and Country Planning All England Law Reports at pages it was held In the present case it seems to me that one is entitled and indeed bound to look at the constitutional of the company to see who in fact is in control It seems to me therefore that while nominally the property of the company is held under the provisions of the memorandum and articles of association in actual fact the property of the company is regulated by the terms of the memorandum and articles of association plus the provisions of the trust deed and therefore the company is restricted in fact in application of its property and assets and may apply them only for the charitable purposes which are mentioned in the trust deed
