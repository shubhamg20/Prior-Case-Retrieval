The foundational premise of the aforesaid points is that position by now that a secured creditor stands outside the winding up proceeding and under the law he can proceed to realize his security without the leave of the winding up court if by the time he initiated the action the company has not beer wound up Despite this being the legal position there were some provisions in the Indian Companies Act which enactment preceded the present Companies Act hereinafter the Act in which also a parallel provisions find place which put some restrictions on the aforesaid power or if pending at the date of the winding up order shall be proceeded with against the company except by leave of the <ORG> and subject to such terms as the <ORG> may impose The Court which is winding up the company shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force have jurisdiction to entertain or dispose of a any suit or proceeding by or against the company any claim made by or against the company including claims by or against any of its branches in India any application made under section by or in respect of the company any question of priorities or any other question whatsoever whether of law or fact which may relate to or arise in course of the winding up of the company whether such suit or proceeding has been instituted or is instituted or such claim or question has arisen or arises or such application has been made or is made before or after the order for the winding up of the company or before or after the commencement of the Companies Amendment Act Any suit or proceeding by or against the company which is pending in any <ORG> other than that in which the winding up of the company is proceeding may notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force be transferred to and disposed of by that <ORG> Nothing in sub section or sub section shall apply to any proceeding pending in appeal before the Supreme <ORG> or a High <ORG> In the winding up of an insolvent company the same rules shall prevail and be observed with regard to a debts provable the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities and the respective rights of secured and unsecured and unsecured creditors as are in force for the time being under the law of insolvency with respect to the estates of persons adjudged insolvent Provided that the security of every secured creditor shall be deemed to be subject to a pari passu charge in favour of the workmen to the extent of the workmen portion therein and where a secured creditor instead of relinquishing his security and proving his debt opts to realize his security a the liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and enforce such charge any amount realized by the liquidator by way of enforcement of such charge shall by applied ratably for the discharge of workmen dues and so much of the debt due to such secured creditor as could not be realized by him by virtue of the foregoing provisions of this proviso or the amount of the workmen portion in his security whichever is less All persons who in any such case would be entitled to prove for and receive dividends out of the assets of the company may come in under the winding up and make such claims against the company as they respectively are entitled to make by virtue of this section Provided that it a secured creditor instead of relinquishing his security and proving for his debt proceeds to realize his security he shall be liable to pay his portion of the expenses incurred by the liquidator including a provisional liquidator if any for the preservation of the security before its realization by the secured creditor Explanation For the purposes of this proviso the portion of expenses incurred by the liquidator for the preservation of a security which the secured creditor shall be liable to pay shall be the whole of the expensed less an amount which bears to such expenses the same portion as the workmen portion in relation to the security bears to the value of the security Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act or any other law for the time being in force in the winding up of a company a workmen dues and debts due to secured creditors to the extent such debts rank under clause of the proviso to sub section of section pari passu with dues shall be paid in priority to all other debts The debts payable under clause a and clause of sub section shall be paid in full unless the assets are insufficient to meet them in which case they shall abate in equal proportions Where any company is being wound up by or supervision of the Court a any attachment distress or execution put in force without leave of the <ORG> against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up or any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties or effects of the company after such commencement shall be void Nothing in this section applies to any proceedings for the recovery of any tax or impost or any dues payable to the Government A combined reading of the aforesaid provisions leads to the following results i A winding up court has jurisdiction inter alia to entertain or dispose of any suit or proceeding by or against the company even if such suit or proceeding had been instituted before an order for winding up had been made This apart the winding up court has jurisdiction to transfer such a suit or proceeding to itself and dispose of the same ii When a winding up order has been made or the official liquidator has been appointed as provisional liquidator no suit or other legal proceeding even if pending at the date of the winding up order can proceed against the company except by Leave of the Company Court vide sub section of section iii Any sale held without the Leave of the winding up court pursuant to order of a civil court on it being approached by a secured creditor to realise its debt will not ipso facto be void in view of the holding in <NAME> case that section dealing with voidness of sale operates when the sale is pursuant to attachment of company court The real bone of contention is as to when i leave of the winding up court should be granted to a secured creditor to proceed with the suit after an order of winding up has been made and ii when should a winding up court transfer to itself any suit or proceeding by or against the company during the pendency of the winding up proceeding The aforesaid questions arise because a secured creditor who has initiated a suit or proceeding in a civil court is interested in realization of his debt only whereas the company court looks after the interest of all the creditors so too the workmen dues which rank pari passu with debts due to secured creditors The winding up court does these acts through a liquidator who has been given wide powers by section of the Act As against this a receiver appointed by a civil court on being approached by secured creditor would basically look after the interest of that creditor whose interest may in many cases he in conflict with that of liquidator as was acknowledged in In re Karamelli Barnett Limited CH We feel no difficulty in stating that in case of such conflict the interest of liquidator has to receive precedence over that of the receiver inasmuch as the former looks after the interest of a large segment of creditors alongwith that of workmen whereas the latter confined his concern to the interest of the secured creditor on whose approach the receiver had bean appointed This view cannot also be and has indeed not been contested by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants The real controversy is as to when a winding up court should get transferred to itself a pending proceeding initiated by secured creditor and when a winding up court should grant leave to the secured creditor to pursue his remedy in the civil court despite winding up order having been passed It was also observed that while granting leave under this section the court always takes into consideration whether the company is likely to be exposed to unnecessary litigation and cost A need for such a provision was felt because section of the predecessor Act had only provided for stay of suits and proceeding pending at the commencement of winding up proceeding alongwith the embargo against the commencement of any suit or other legal proceeding against the company except by the leave of the court There was thus no specific provision conferring jurisdiction to the court winding up the company analogous to the one conferred by sub Section which was introduced to enlarge the jurisdiction of the winding up court so as to facilitate the disposal of winding up proceeding This sub section as originally enacted did not meet with the requirement fully with the result that the <ORG> appointed for examining comprehensive amendment to the Companies Act recommended that a suit by or against a company in winding up should notwithstanding any provision in law for the time being be instituted in the court in which the winding up proceedings are pending The <ORG> made this recommendation having noticed that on winding up order being made and the official liquidator being appointed he has to take into his custody company property as required by section Then secting confers power on the liquidator to sell the properties of the company and to realise the assets The <ORG> felt that at the stage when winding up order is made the company may as well have subsisting claims and to realise these claims the liquidator will have to file suits To buttress his submissions <NAME> has referred us to the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act which was recently enacted because of the considerable difficulty being experienced by financial institutions in recovering loans and enforcement securities charged with them Section of this Act has barred jurisdiction of other courts except the writ power of the higher courts in relation to the matters specified in section the same being recovery of debts due to such institutions <NAME> who appeared for official liquidator in many cases however urged that it is the liquidator who can look after the interests of all the secured creditors He submitted that section of the Act contains many provisions to duly protect the interest of secured creditors The underlying idea of this contention is that there cannot he any uniform working principle and the question whether leave should be granted if so on what terms and whether transfer should at all be ordered would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case It may however be that in a particular case the secured creditor who has approached the civil court happens to be one who has lent huge amount or be one who is the main secured creditor on approach being made by such creditor we have no doubt that company court would duly take note of this fact and should like to grant leave required by sub section of section and by the same token refuse to transfer the proceeding to his court But if the position be that the secured creditor who had approached the civil court is one amongst many similar creditors <ORG> may be that the company court feels that to take care of the interest of other secured creditors It may be pointed out that sections and A of the Act do contain provisions in so far as the priority of secured creditor claim is concerned While exercising this power we have no doubt that the company court would also bear in mind the rationale behind the enactment of Recovery of Debts Due to the Banks and Financial Institutions Act to which reference has made above It need not be stated that the terms to be imposed have to be reasonable which would of course vary from case to case According to us such an approach would maintain the integrity of that secured creditor who had approached the civil court or desires to do so
