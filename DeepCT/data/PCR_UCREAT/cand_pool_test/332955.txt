JUDGMENT DERBYSHIRE This matter originally came before <NAME> who referred it to the Chief Justice under rule of Chapter of the Original Side Rules which is as follows Where it shall appear to any judge at any stage of a suit application or other matter that it involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Government of India Act or any order in council made thereunder he shall report to that effect to the Chief Justice who shall constitute a Bench of two or more judges to hear the suit application or other matter The defendants in their written statement have pleaded Section of the Government of India Act which in its material part provides <ORG> shall have any original jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue or concerning any act ordered or done in the collection thereof according to the usage and practice of the country of the law for the time being in force There is no difference between the parties as to the facts A statement was put in by the plaintiffs which is agreed by the defendants to be correct and it is as follows The nine sterling companies are controlled in London where the Boards of Directors sit the share registers are situate and dividends are declared These are marked Exhibit All the companies above concerned with the exception of the plaintiffs have carried on business in India and made profits here which have been assessed to income tax and super tax under the Indian Income tax laws and those taxes have been paid Dividends on the two rupee companies were paid to a representative of the plaintiff company at Chowringhee Calcutta Paragraph of this letter is as follows You are further requested to let me know that in view of Explanation to Section of the Act the dividends shown in Section of the return being income accruing or arising in British India and thus liable to be included in total income it appears that the total income accruing or arising in British India exceed the income arising without British India in the previous year and as such in terms of Section A the company is to be treated as resident in British India and as such the entire profits are liable to be taxed The Company contends that dividends declared outside British India are not income accruing or arising in British India on the following grounds a Explanation to Section of the Indian Income tax Act as amended by the Indian Income tax Amendment Act on its true construction refers to dividends declared within British India but paid outside British India and not to dividends declared outside British India The contention in paragraph of the letter of the Income tax officer dated April that the total income accruing or arising in British India exceeds the income arising without British India in the previous year and as such in terms of Section A the company is to be treated as resident in British India and as such the entire profits are liable to be taxed has since been dropped Subject to the provisions of this Act the total income of any previous year of any person includes all income profits and gains from whatever source derived which if such person is not resident in British India during such year accrue or arise or are deemed to accrue or arise to him in British India during such year Explanation is as follows A dividend paid without British India shall be deemed to be income accruing and arising in British India to the extent to which it has been paid out of profits subjected to income tax in British India The net amounts referred to are net amounts of dividend paid by the rupee companies to the plaintiffs after deducting the income tax and super tax which the two rupee companies had paid on their profits the gross amount is the amount of the net together with the income tax and super tax paid by each rupee company added back The dividends paid by the sterling companies to the plaintiffs amounted to Pounds equivalent to Rs On Total demand On the same day a copy of this assessment was sent by the Income tax officer together with a notice of demand under Section of the Indian Income tax Act to the plaintiffs at Chowringhee Calcutta We have on this occasion and without accepting any responsibility as to the ultimate delivery re addressed and air mailed the cover to England but if the contents called for an urgent replay of laid down a time limit within which some action should be performed we would remind you that there is very considerable delay in the transmission of mails between this country and the United Kingdom There are various provisions in Section of the Indian Income tax Act under which the Income tax authorities in India might have caused to be attached either the plaintiffs share in the rupee companies or the dividends payable to the plaintiffs on these shares In the grounds of appeal the plaintiffs letters of June and September which had been before the Income tax Officer when he made the assessment On August Mr <NAME> wrote to the Appellate Assistant commissioner of Income tax as follows In view of certain constitutional questions which are raised by some of <ORG> in this case <ORG> has been advised to take other proceedings to have those questions determined Under the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act there is an appeal from the assessment by an Income tax officer to the Appellate Assistant Income tax Commissioner under Section of the Act and from him to <ORG> consists of two members one of whom was judicial experience and is generally an ex District Judge whilst the other is an Accountant <ORG> may state a case for the opinion of the High court functions with regard to such case stated are to advice on the law and from its judgment or opinion there is an appeals to <ORG> Section of the Income tax Act provides Where a shareholder has received a dividend from a company which has paid income tax imposed in British India or elsewhere he shall be deemed in respect of such dividend himself to have paid the income tax exclusive of super tax paid by the company on so much of the dividend as bears to the whole the same proportion as the amount of income on which the company has paid such income tax bears to the whole income of the company There is no similar provision in respect of super tax which is a flat rate tax payable by companies as well as individuals Of that amount of tax a certain proportion is attributable to the dividend received from the rupee companies about which there is now no dispute Section of the Income tax Act provides that an Income tax officer it he has reason to believe that a non resident shareholder would be liable to super tax may direct the principal officer of the company to deduct super tax at the time of the payment of the dividend As regards the sterling companies although they were paying super tax on their own profits in India they did not before declaring their dividends make any deduction under Section and Section Lastly in paragraph of the written statement there is this plea The plaintiff company has no cause of action In any event the defendant will object and contend that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain this suit by virtue of Section of the Government of India Act Section of the Government of India Act provides Until otherwise provided by Act of the appropriate legislature <ORG> shall have any original jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue or concerning any act ordered or done in the collection thereof according to the usage and practice of the country or the law for the time being in force There is no evidence of any plea of Section of the Government of India Act or its predecessor Section of the Government of India Act being raised although Sea Customs Duty is just as much revenue as income tax This particular section except where it provide for its repeal substantially re enacts Section of the Act of Settlement He was employed to administer the Act and he had to take the Act as he found it It appears to me that <ORG> although one of the two members of it is a gentleman with judicial experience must take the Act as they find it and not call it in question Section provides that within sixty days of the date on which he is served with a notice of an order under Section the assessee or the Commissioner may require <ORG> to refer to <ORG> any question of law arising out of such order From the decision of the High <ORG> as Section A provides An appeal shall lie to His Majesty in Council from any judgment of <ORG> delivered on a reference made under Section in any case which <ORG> certifies to be a fit one for appeal to His Majesty in Council Under Section of the Government of India Act it is provided that an appeal shall lie to <ORG> from a judgment of <ORG> if <ORG> certifies that the case involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Government of India Act and it shall be the duty of every High Court to consider in every case whether any such question is involved and on its own motion give or withhold a certificate accordingly Section provides Where such a certificate is given any party in the case may appeal to <ORG> on the ground that any such question as aforesaid has been wrongly decided and no direct appeal shall lie to His Majesty in Council either with or without special leave It would seem therefore that appeals from High Courts in cases involving questions of law as to the interpretation of the Government of India Act cannot go direct to <ORG> but must go first to <ORG> and as appeals from judgments in references under Section of the Income tax Act must go to <ORG> and not to <ORG> and as this matter involved basically a decision upon a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of the Government of India Act a suit at law and not a reference under Section of the Income tax Act is the proper procedure The plaintiffs claim in this suit is first to have Explanation to Section together with relevant words of Section declared invalid and then the return of the money they have paid together with other connected reliefs In when prohibition against <ORG> exercising original jurisdiction in matters concerning the revenue clearly meant income from land but in when prohibition against <ORG> exercising original jurisdiction in matters concerning the revenue was first introduced into the Act of Settlement revenue clearly meant income from land but in when the same provision was substantially re enacted revenue in view of the provisions of Sections and of the Act of would clearly include money derived from income tax If the money was paid as the result of a demand made without legal authority the money is money illegally obtained and held to the use of the plaintiffs and there is no bar under Section to our exercising original jurisdiction concerning it in this suit nor under Section of the Indian Income tax Act In order to decide whether the money has been demanded and paid legally the <ORG> must first determine whether the impugned legislation is valid or not The <ORG> is bound to inquire into and decide this matter to ascertain whether it has jurisdiction or not Federation is not yet in being but <ORG> has meanwhile the same law making powers as those given by the Act to <ORG> Section of the Act Section of the same Act provides Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by the preceding sub section no Federal law shall on the ground that it would have extra territorial operation be deemed to be invalid in so far as it applies a to British subjects and servants of the Crown in any part of In dia or to British subjects who are domiciled in any part of India wher ever they may be or to or to persons on ships or aircraft registered in British India or any Federated State wherever they may be or in the case of a law with respect to a matter accepted in the Instrument of Accession of a Federated State as a matter with respect to which <ORG> may make laws for that State to subjects of that State wherever they may be or in the case of a law for the regulation or discipline of any naval military or air force raised in British India to members of and persons attached to employed with or following that force wherever they may be Section provides that <ORG> has power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List of the VIIth Schedule Again in List of Schedule VII there are the following matters on which <ORG> may legislate Item It is difficult to state the precise effect of the words in Section without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by the preceding sub section They are however clearly precautionary and probably mean that laws made for British India even when they do not come within the cases sets out in Section may in certain eventualities which are either too numerous or uncertain to specify have some extra territoriality such as in the cases prescribed for in Items and of List I or where anti smuggling laws are made as related in <NAME> <NAME> In <NAME> <NAME> Lord <NAME> said Where a power is conferred to legislate on a particular topic it is important in determining the scope of the power to have regard to what is ordinarily treated as embraced within that topic in legislative practice and particularly in the legislative practice of the <ORG> which has conferred the power of the nd edition of Halsburys Laws of England which deals with England Income tax law as at April just before the Government of India Act was passed there is this statement of the English Income tax Law at page The income arising abroad to non resident is not within the charge to tax and non residents also enjoy specific exemption in certain cases set out in footnote Interest and dividends of a foreign <ORG> or British possession payable in the through a paying agent It provided as follows In the case of any person residing out of British India all profits or gains accruing or arising to such person whether directly or indirectly through or from any business connection or property in British India shall be deemed to be income accruing or arising within British India and shall be chargeable to income tax in the name of the agent of any such person and such agent shall be deemed to be for all the purposes of this Act the assessee in respect of such income tax Provided that any arrears of tax may be recovered also in accordance with the provisions of this Act from any assets of the non resident person which are or may at any time come within British India This section provided for the assessment and taxation of the foreigners India agent and I doubt if it is extra territorial in it affect Reference to the legal position with regard to this matter in England and in India in does not mean that the Income tax law in India after is to remain unchanged and unchangeable but it does lend some support to the view that where the British Government had refrained from extra territorial legislation involving taxation of non residents upon income received by them abroad it did not in the absence of express enactment intend to confer such power upon the Indian Government by the Act of The dividends in respect of which tax has been claimed and paid in the present case were all dividends declared abroad by foreign Companies with registered offices head offices and share registers either in England or in the Isle of Man and were payable and paid either in England or in the Isle of Man to the plaintiffs a company registered in the Isle of Man with its head office in England The dividends concerned were therefore debts arising abroad and paid abroad by Companies resident out of British India to the plaintiffs another Company resident out of British India see <ORG> <ORG> The effect of the words in Section or are deemed to accrue or arise to him combined with Explanation a dividend paid without British India shall be deemed to be income accruing and arising in British India to the extent to which it has been paid out of profits subjected to income tax in British India is as the facts of the present case show to make liable to tax in British India foreign money measured in a foreign currency paid in a foreign country by one foreign Company to another foreign Company in discharge of a debt which arose and was payable in that foreign country The provision in Section and the Explanation which is impugned is not legislation within the extra territorial powers given in Section of the Government of India Act since its operation is not limited to the persons and places named in Section it is not legislation dealing with any of the matters mentioned in the Lists of Schedule VII in which some degree of extra territorial legislation may be assumed were necessary to give efficacy to legislation for British India it is something beyond all these In my opinion for the reasons given above the legislation impugned is not authorised by any provision either express or implied of <ORG> Act from which statute the legislature of British India in derived its powers The plaintiffs had good reason to believe that their property i the dividends from the rupee companies in India would be taken from them or from the companies that were due to pay money to them in India if they did not yield to the Income tax Officers illegal demand It was held that the circumstances of the payment and the conduct of the plaintiff throughout showed that he only paid to avoid seizure of his goods and never made payments voluntarily or intended to give up his right to the sums paid and that he was entitled to recover those tolls for a period of six years the earlier payments being barred by the Statute of Limitation There are numerous instances in the books of successful claims in this form of action to recover money paid to relieve goods from seizure At page of the report Pickford said I do not think that the mere fact that a payment is made under protest is enough to entitle the payer to recover it back but if it be shown that it was made under circumstances which show that the payer intends to resist the claim and yields to it merely for the purpose of relieving himself of the inconvenience of having his goods sold the money can be recovered back and the fact of a protest is some indication that it is so made Having found that the money now claimed was money paid by the plaintiffs to <ORG> as aforesaid as a result of a demand made under a law which <ORG> had no power to make and so an invalid law I am of the opinion that the suit does not concern revenue in the sense used in Section viz It is the principal shareholder in two companies for brevitys sake called <ORG> and in seven other companies for brevitys sake called <ORG> It was assessed to income tax by <ORG> <ORG> Calcutta on the basis of Explanation to Section of the Indian Income tax Act XI of hereafter called the Act on the December for the financial year The company on getting the same cabled to the Income tax Officer from England on the February before filing the appeal for postponement of the payment of the tax till the disposal of the proposed appeal and requested the latter not to treat it in default while the appeal would be pending Effect was given to the decisions under the old Act to the effect that two separate ideas had been expressed in sub section of Section the phrase arise or accrue connoting one idea and the word received another distinct idea With regard to residents the general provision is that he is to be assessed on income which had not only arisen or accrued in British India or was deemed to have arisen or accrued in British India but also on income which had arisen or accrued outside British India With regard to non residents however they can be assessed on income which had arisen or accrued in British India or which is deemed to have arisen or accrued in British India This follows from the observations of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> and of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> The property of a person who may be the subject of another independent foreign State and may be a resident of such a State and over whom <ORG> has no jurisdiction is thus brought under the provision of a taxing statute enacted by the British <ORG> Subject to some exceptions not material for this case it had power to legislate for all persons and things within British India Section clause a The Government of India Act contains no provision exactly similar to Section a Section read with Section of the Act of authorizes <ORG> <ORG> during the transitional period Section to legislate for the whole or any part of British India in respect of the subjects specified in Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule In my judgment that question must be answered on general principles keeping at the same time in view the provisions of Section It power and jurisdiction is so transcendent and absolute that it cannot be confined either for causes or persons within any bounds But if such a statute is passed the domestic courts <ORG> of the Dominions and of the Empire are bound to obey and administer them it being left to the Government to justify its action with other countries diplomatically If the judgment of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> be considered in its entirety it cannot be said that his Lordship was laying down by the observations at page of the report that every subordinate legislature can legislate with extra territorial effect on the permitted subject just as <ORG> for on the next page he observes that a statute violating International Law passed by <ORG> cannot be challenged as ultra vires in a domestic court but such a statute passed by a subordinate legislature can be challenged as ultra vires in a domestic court on the ground that <ORG> must not be taken to have granted the power to enact such a statute to a subordinate legislature Such an authority has been expressly conferred on <ORG> in matters mentioned in sub section of Section and in some of the items of List I as for instance item No Whether a power to legislate extra territorially has been conferred by <ORG> on a subordinate legislature by implication has to be determined on certain considerations I cannot therefore accept the argument advanced on behalf of the plaintiff company that <ORG> by specifying the subjects over which <ORG> can legislate extra territorially intended that over all other subjects it was not to have that power If legislation on the permitted subject would not be effective without a provision being enacted having extra territorial operation a power to legislate extra territorially will be implied for instance where the permitted subject of legislation is defence of the territory subject to the jurisdiction of the subordinate legislature a provision in a statute which deals with that subject would not be considered ultra vires because the provision has extra territorial effect the principle being that <ORG> gave the subordinate legislature such a power by necessary implication The next Act IX of was an Act which imposed tax on professions and trades carried on in India The next Act II of made income which had arisen or accrued in British India or which had been received in British India or salaries paid to a British subject in the Native States by <ORG> or by a local authority could only be taxed The Act of Act VII of charged all income which arose accrued or was received in British India or which under the provisions of that Act was to be deemed to have arisen accrued or to have been received in British India in British India was Section which corresponds to Section of the Act of XI of The legislative practice in India up to was not to assess a non resident who had no business connection in British India to income tax in respect of an income which had not arisen or accrued to him in British India or which had not been received by him in British India Explanation to Section is accordingly ultra vires to the extent it relates to a non resident who does not fulfill the conditions of Section in respect of his income which did not in fact arise or accrue to him in British India There is therefore no attempt to tax directly an absentee shareholder in respect of income which did not accrue to him in Australia In the <ORG> case where the question was whether the amount paid to a non resident debenture holder could be taxed by the Australian Statute <NAME> pointed out that the purpose of that statute was not dependent on the liability of the debenture holders to pay income tax to the Australian Government but its purpose was to impose only upon such companies which derived assessable income from Australia and on no others an original or independent liability <NAME> however stated in clear words that the company could not escape assessment simply because foreign courts may by reason of the laws of that foreign country refuse to recognize the right of deduction so given to the company by the Australian legislature In support of his view that the State legislature had power to legislate extra territorially he gave four reasons i that the Australian Commonwealth has full self government and <ORG> has power to legislate extra territorially as such a power is an essential part of the conception of self government ii that <NAME> <NAME> had laid down that <ORG> had the powers of a full Sovereign legislature and the observations made therein would apply to <ORG> iii that the legislative powers of the States of the Australian Commonwealth regarding extent are the same as that of <ORG> and iv that the questioned legislation even if it had extra territorial effect would be perfectly valid if in some aspects and relations it bears upon the peace order and good government of the Dominion or the constituting States as the case may be either generally or in respect to specific subjects In my judgment the rules laid down by <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> cannot be the true guide for deciding the question before us Besides his observations do to a certain extent go against the general principle laid down by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> case and is against the decision of <ORG> in London and <ORG> It is from there that their chief operations are controlled managed and directed iii The shares of those companies have been issued in England the share registers are kept in England dividends are declared in England and paid in England iv Those companies carry on business in British India and earn profits here Explanation to Section which deals with dividend only defines the circumstances under which a class of income actually arising or accruing outside British India is deemed to have arisen or to have accrued in British India For the purpose of this issue we have to leave out those two cases namely Explanation to Section and Section Regarding situs of the shares the first view is what has been adopted in <NAME> <ORG> At page <NAME> observed thus A share or a parcel of stock is an incorporeal thing carrying the right to a share in the profits of a company and where the company is there the share is also and there is the source of any dividend paid upon it The income in the shape of dividends paid by the sterling companies to the plaintiff company therefore arose or accrued not in British India but in England The third proposition that he laid down is that when a statute creates a new liability aliability not existing at common law and at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it the remedy provided for in the statute must be followed and the party is not entitled for in the statute must be followed and the party is not entitled to have recourse to an action in the civil court In my judgment these principles can be invoked by the defendant for the purpose of defeation the suit before us only if it can be shown that the point raised in the suit and on the basis of which the plaintiff seeks relief could have been determined by the special tribunals set up by the Income tax Act This court on a reference being made to it under section cannot also deal with such a question as the reference must be limited to points arising out of the order passed by <ORG> In the course of his judgment <NAME> observed that where a statute contains a specific provision limiting or excluding the jurisdiction of civil courts the determination of the ambit of the civil courts jurisdiction must rest upon the language used in the private provision and cases decided on the provisions of statutes couched in different language would be of little assistance I agree with thou observations to this extent that the language of the private provisions is of prime importance but I do not agree to the further proposition if that be its meaning that it would not be legitimate to refer to decisions given on other statutes even when the private provisions are of similar scope I would confine myself to decisions in suits relating to income tax and to decisions in other suits where the private provisions in the statute are of similar scope He brought a suit for a declaration that the assessment on him was illegal This case was cited in <NAME> case but was distinguished on two grounds that the Act of contained no provision corresponding to the second part of the Section and the said Act did not provide the same safeguards as in the act of by way of appeal and reference to <ORG> with a further right of appeal to <ORG> The Act of contained provisions for revision firstly to the Collector and then to the Commissioner of the Division There was no doubt no provision for a reference to <ORG> and for further appeal to <ORG> but in my judgment the scope of a private provision like that contained in Section of Act II of or in the first part of the Section of the Act of would neither be enlarged or curtailed by reason of the number of appeals from the assessment order provided for by the statute Section contained the private provision which is exactly in the same terms as Section of the Act of At page of the report the learned judges made the following observations A civil suit is barred under recession of the Income tax Act of If the tax was lived under that Act no doubt a suit would be barred but if the assessment was made in respect of an item of income which is not assessable under the Act civil suit would lie inasmuch as the officer making the assessment had no jurisdiction to make it In cases in which the Income tax Officer has to decide whether a certain item of income is assessable or not his decision cannot be said to be ultra vires even if it is illegal The decision of <ORG> in <NAME> Secretary of <ORG> for India in Council affirmed on appeal in I A on a different ground also supports the same view It would apply to a case of rate which is authorised that is legally authorised by the <ORG> Section of Act of runs as follows Subject to the exceptions hereinafter appearing no civil court shall exercise jurisdiction as to any of the following matters claim against the Crown to hold land wholly or partially free from payments charged on or payable out of land revenue or to set aside any less or rate authorized by the Government under the provisions of any law for the time being in force On appeal by the plaintiffs to <ORG> the suit was dismissed I would accordingly answer this issue in favour of the plaintiff It has the effect of taking away the original jurisdiction of this <ORG> in matters in respect of which courts subordinate to this court would have original jurisdiction It is an anomaly that this <ORG> cannot exercise its functions in the exercise of its original jurisdiction in matters concerning revenue Be that as it may we have to give effect to th at Section The section is divided into two parts The <ORG> has no original jurisdiction in any matter concerning revenue or in any matter concerning any act ordered on done in the collection of revenue The second part no doubt refers to the machinery for enforcing payment of revenue but I am not prepared to say that the first refers only to preliminary proceedings taken for the purpose of determining the amount of revenue In that case Lord <NAME> laid down that the High <ORG> in the exercise of its original jurisdiction had power in spite of Section of the Government of India Act to interfere by issuing a purgative writ at the stage when the preliminary proceedings were being taken for assessing the amount of income tax A matter concerning revenue would include a matter relating to the collection of revenue In all the cases except the last the act ordered or done by the revenue authorities related to collection of what was admittedly and beyond question revenue and in the last mentioned cases as also in <NAME>s case what was ordered to be collected was found to be revenue by the <ORG> after adjudication In all those cases the construction given to the second part of the Section in <NAME> <NAME> was reiterated <NAME>s case and <NAME> case are of importance for the purpose of showing that where there is a dispute as to whether a particular levy is revenue or not that dispute must be adjudicated upon by the court and only if the court finds that it is revenue then and then only can the bar of Section be invoked and applied The first proposition that is well established is that the condition on which the right of a court of limited jurisdiction to exercise jurisdiction depends must be fulfilled those conditions may be of various kinds If there is any dispute as to those facts that <ORG> is not only entitled to adjudicate upon them but must do so It follows as a converse proposition that where a court has a general jurisdiction That is to say jurisdiction to entertain suits for proceedings of a civil nature and its jurisdiction over a particular subject matter which would otherwise be within its competence is excluded by a statute and there is a dispute as to facts which if established would oust its jurisdiction that <ORG> would have not only the power but would be under a duty to give its decision on the said dispute In the light of these principles this court has the power to determine whether the subject matter of this suit concerns revenue If the right does not exist in respect of a particular matter what is assessed or collected would not in my judgment be considered AAC revenue within the meaning of Section although the name of a tax may be given to it There is no likelihood that the Income tax Officer would make any attempt in future to assess the company on dividends form the sterling company if our judgment to the effect that the assessment is illegal be upheld on appeal <ORG> has shown in his judgment that there is the highest judicial authority for the view that the income of the share holders is quite distinct from the income of the Company even when the whole of the share capital is held by one share holder It seems to me that the provisions of the Indian Income tax Act itself lead to the same conclusion For these reasons and for the reasons given by <NAME> in his judgment I agree that issue No must be answered in the affirmative But Section of the Government of India Act operates whether the aggrieved person has or has not a remedy under the particular Act indeed the very wording of the Section indicates that there may be instances when an aggrieved person will have a remedy in Civil Courts if the cause of action arises outside the territorial limits of the original jurisdiction of <ORG> but will have no such remedy if the case of action arises within those limits For these reasons it seems to me that no assistance to the undertaking of the provisions of this Section can be obtained for the reasoning given in decisions as to the applicability of such provisions as Section of the Income tax Act Section of the Government of India Act reads as follows Until otherwise provided by the act of the appropriate legislator <ORG> shall have any original jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue or concerning any Act ordered or done in the collection thereof according to the usage and practice of the country or the law for the time being in force The plaintiffs contend that if any provision of the Income tax Act is ultra vires of <ORG> the giving of a decision thats ultra vires is not the exercise of original jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue Nor does it concern any act ordered or done in the collection there of according to the law for the time being in force <NAME> in his judgment has pointed out that none of the rulings in whip Section of the Government of India Act was held to be a bar is of any assistance to us inasmuch as in each of those cases the court was concerned with an act ordered or done in the collection of the revenue according with an arc ordered or done in the collection of the revenue accordion got the usage and practice of the country or the law for the time being in force and there was no question whether the provisions of the Act were ultra vires of <ORG> I have no difficulty in accepting the argument that where a proviso of the statute is found to be ultra vires of the legislature an act ordered or done under the provisions is not an act ordered or done according to the law for the time being in force and therefore the original jurisdiction of <ORG> to determine whether a provisions is ultra vires or not is not excluded by the second part of Section of the Government of India Act <ORG> shall have any original jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue <ORG> observed In their Lordships view the order of <ORG> to a revenue officer to do his statutory duty would not be the exercise of original jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue and the latter part of the clause need not be considered for the proceedings in this case had not to do with the collection of the revenue but with the preliminary assessment to ascertain what that revenue was of India Act and suggests that if the statutory duty in question has to do with the collect of the revenue and not merely with the preliminary assessment the power of <ORG> to issue a direction to a revenue officer to perform that duty may possibly be excluded by this Section But so far as the first part of the Section is concerned this decision does not suggest that any special or limited interpretation is to be placed on the words any original jurisdiction in any matter concerning the revenue the decision merely lays down that the issue of an order to a revenue officer to perform his statutory duty of stating a case is not exercise of original jurisdiction in a matter concerning the revenue It only takes away the original jurisdiction of <ORG> in any matter concerning the revenue What is the position in the present case <ORG> in an attempt to increase the revenue considers whether it has a right to tax certain incomes It seems to me that if the ordinary meaning is to attic to the words any matter concerning the revenue then all these questions are matters occurring the revenue The argument that Section is a bar only to the exercise of jurisdiction in matters concerning valid revenue seems to me to conflict with the principle laid down in <NAME> <NAME> I A Similarly if the revenue officer by mere mistake in arithmetic demanded and realised from an assessee more than was legally payable the illegal excess would not be valid revenue and according to this argument the jurisdiction of <ORG> to grant relief in respect thereof would not be barred It only remains for me to add that if I were not convinced that the Section of the Government of India Act was a bar to the exercise of jurisdiction by us in this matter I should agree with the order propped by my Lord the Chief Justice
