the Single Judge In appeal to this <ORG> by special leave the questions that fell for consideration were i Whether of the Central Excise Act was void because the powers delegated to <ORG> thereby including the power to make alterations in the Act applied were excessive ii Whether the Sea Customs Act having been re pealed it was open thereafter to <ORG> under of the Excise Act to apply of the Customs Act and iii Whether the Assistant Collector issued the warrants in the present case after due application of mind to relevant materials and facts in terms of of the Customs Act The power to restrict and modify does not import the power to make essential changes Section only contained a provision delegating limited powers to <ORG> to draw upon the provisions of the Sea Customs Act for the purpose of implementing of the Act By the latter notification the previous notification applying the provisions of the Sea Customs Act was superseded and no question with regard to the validity of the notification issued in and then amended in could survive The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This is an appeal by special leave from a judgement of <ORG> dismissing a writ petition by which the appellant challenged the validity of a warrant issued by the Assistant Collector Central Excise Allahabad authorising the Superintendent Central Excise Varanasi to enter certain premises search the same and seize the documents therefrom The appellant which is a public limited company having its registered office at Calcutta owns and runs a factory known as <ORG> at Varanasi where chemicals such as ammonia and soda ash are manufactured The writ petition was heard in the first instance by the learned single judge who dismissed it The Central Government may by notification in the official Gazette declare that any of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act relating to the levy on and exemption from customs duties drawback of duty warehousing offences and penalties confiscation and procedure relating to offences and appeals shall with such modifications and alterations as it may consider necessary or desirable to adapt them to the circumstances be applicable in regard to like matters in respect of the duties imposed by section if the Assistant Collector of <ORG> or in any area adjoining the land frontier or the coast of India an officer of <ORG> specially empowered by name in this behalf by the <ORG> has reason to believe that any goods liable to confiscation or any documents or things which in his opinion will be useful for or relevant to any proceeding under this Act are secreted in any place he may authorise any officer of customs to search or may himself search for such goods documents or things On the first point it has been urged on behalf of the appellant that of the Act gave unrestricted and unlimited power to <ORG> to modify or alter the provisions of the Sea Customs Act and to apply the provisions of that Act with such modifications and alterations as <ORG> might consider appropriate It has been pointed out in the previous decisions of this Court that the power to restrict and modify does not import the power to make essential changes Objection was taken only with regard to the word alterations but that word must be understood in the sense in which it was open to the legislature to employ it legitimately and in a constitutional manner The second contention has hardly any merit It only empowered <ORG> to apply the provisions of the Sea Customs Act with such modifications and alterations as might be considered necessary or desirable by <ORG> for the purpose of implementation and enforcement of of the Act The usual or recognised formulae generally employed to effect incorporation were considered for instance the words used in of and Vict Section dealt with the procedure relating to appeals and required an appellant to deposit pending the appeal the duty or penalty imposed and empowered the appellate authority in its discretion to dispense with such deposit pending the appeal in any particular case There was a provision in the Act itself which gave an unfettered right of appeal to a person aggrieved by any decision or order made under the Act By the notification issued under of the Act after the enactment of Customs Act the previous notification under the Sea Customs Act stood superseded and no question survives with regard to the validity of the notification issued in and amended in The learned single judge dealt with this matter fully and repelled the contention that there was no relevant material before the authority upon which the belief could be founded in terms of of the Customs Act by the Assistant Collector We find no merit in this contention The appeal fails and it is dismissed with costs
