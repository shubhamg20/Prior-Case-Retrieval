On the petitioner return from leave the post of Deputy Chairman was again created for a period of one year in the grade of the Chief Secretary and the petitioner was appointed to that post The petitioner filed a petition under Art and of the Constitution as the posts of Deputy Chairman <ORG> <ORG> and Officer on Special Duty were inferior in rank and status to that of Chief Secretary and iii that it was made in mala fide exercise of power not on account of exigencies of administration or public service but because the second respondent was annoyed with the petitioner on account There is thus no inconsistency between the draft order and authenticated order from which any error can be spelt out in the authenticated order The validity of such an order can be questioned on other grounds A King Emperor <NAME> I A ii The second proviso to of <ORG> Cadre Rules has no application Where it appears to the <ORG> that the declaration of equivalence is made without application of mind to the nature and responsi bilities of the functions and duties attached to the non cadre post or that extraneous or irrelevant factors are taken into account in determining the equivalence or that the nature and responsibilities of the functions and duties of the two posts are so dissimilar that no reasonable man can possibly say that they are equivalent in status and responsibility or that the decision of equivalence is mala fide or in colorable exercise of power or it is a mere cloak or displacing a member of <ORG> from a cadre post which he is occupying the court can and certainly would set at naught the declaration of equivalence and afford protection to the civil servant This clearly shows that the Government did not apply its mind and objectively determine the equivalence of the post of Deputy Chairman but gave it a rank or grade according as who was going to be appointed to it There was thus no compliance with the requirement of sub But the petitioner cannot get relief in a petition under Art and though it may seem plausible cannot be accepted because there is no adequate material to sustain it There is no formal extension of service The post cannot be substantively filled till he actually retires from service Therefore the petitioner did not have any right to hold the post of Chief Secretary The facts and circumstances has to be looked into in order to find out whether there is in real substance equality in status and responsibility There is no hostile discrimination in transfers from one post to another when the posts are of equal status and responsibility There were Selection Grade posts in the State of Tamil Nadu The petitioner in the month of July filed this petition First the petitioner is appointed to a post or transferred to a post which is not validly created Second under rule of the Indian Administrative Service Pay Rules no member of the Service shall be appointed to a post other than a post specified in Schedule III unless the State Government concerned in respect of posts under its control or <ORG> in respect of posts under its control as the case may be make a declaration that the said Post is equivalent in status and responsibility to a post specified in the said Schedule In this context it is to be ascertained as to whether the petitioner was appointed to the substantive post of Chief Secretary to the state ate of Tamil Nadu When <NAME> went on refused leave for four months from November there was no substantive vacancy in the post of Chief Secretary The note was put up as to whether there was any objection in confirming the petitioner as Chief Secretary The effect of refused leave under the Fundamental Rules is that there is no extension of service by the period of that leave It was contended that the petitioner was appointed in an officiating capacity to the post of Chief Secretary and reliance was placed on Fundamental Rule Under that Rule a <ORG> servant officiates in a post when he perform the duties of a post on which another person holds a lien or the <ORG> may if it thinks fit appoint a <ORG> servant to officiate in a vacant post on which no other <ORG> servant holds a lien There is no formal extension of service The post cannot be substantively filled till he actually retires from service It states that <ORG> shall at the interval of every three years reexamine the strength and composition of each such cadre in consultation with the <ORG> Government or the <ORG> Governments concerned and may make such alterations as it deems fit There are two provisos in the sub rule The first proviso states that nothing shall be deemed to affect the power of <ORG> to alter the strength and composition of the cadre at any other time The second proviso states that the <ORG> Government may add for a period not exceeding one year and with the approval of <ORG> for a further period not exceeding two years to a <ORG> or joint cadre one or more posts carrying duties and responsibilities of a like nature of cadre posts It therefore follows that the strength and composition of the cadre shall be determined by regulations made by <ORG> in consultation with the <ORG> Government The <ORG> has no such power within the second proviso to rule of the Cadre Rules When the petitioner was appointed to the post of Deputy Chairman <ORG> it was upgraded When the petitioner was appointed to occupy the post the post was said to be equivalent to that of Chief Secretary On June the petitioner was appointed to that post in the grade of Chief Secretary for a period of one year or till the need of the post ceased whichever was earlier Broadly stated the petitioner contentions about the two posts of Deputy Chairman <ORG> and the Officer on Special Duty were first that there was no declaration in accordance with Rule of the Indian Administrative Service Pay Rules that the posts were equivalent in status and responsibility to a post specified in the Schedule to the aforesaid Rules secondly that the functions and responsibilities of the two posts were Sub rule of rule states that where equation of posts is not possible the State Government or <ORG> may for sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing appoint a member of a service to such a post without making a declaration There were also demands from the other section for changing the existing single point items to multi point levy if sales tax Third the present classification of commodities taxed at single point and multi point is to be studied in order to find out as to what extent there is a case for transfer of commodities from multi point to single point and vice versa Fourth it is to be found out whether there is any need and justification for the continuance of the concessional rate of taxation under the General Sales Tax Act on components coming under single point levy and if so whether there is a case for extending the same consession to all raw materials The facts and circumstances will be looked into in order to find out whether there is in real substance equality in status and responsibility However the petitioner was appointed to the post of Deputy Chairman <ORG> on April carrying a salary of Rs The post carried a salary of Rs The post of Officer on Special Duty also carried the same salary as that of the Chief Secretary The Administration has also to take into account the willingness or otherwise of an officer to take up a new job which may not invest him with wide executive powers which he wields while holding even less important posts He was given the pay scale of the Chief Secretary because that was the scale of pay he was drawing when he was appointed to these posts There was no reduction in rank The petitioner could not claim that till retirement he must continue to act in the post of the Chief Secretary It is this sense of disinterestedness and detached devotion to duty which has to be recognised and rewarded There is no hostile discrimination in transfer from one post to another when the posts are of equal status and responsibility One of the instances alleged by the petitioner which gave rise to the anger of the Chief Minister relates to irregularities in the accounts of <ORG> <NAME> was the head of th Federation The Chief Minister further alleges in the affidavit that there is no note written by the petitioner suggesting the launching of prosecution against <NAME> There is no occasion for vindictiveness The Chief Minister denied that he ever made any statement that the Chief Secretary should be transferred There were disputes between direct recruits and promotees in regard to fixation of seniority The petitioner in a note suggested that the inclusion of name in the Select List did not confer any right of promotion There is no ground whatever for attributing bad faith or improper motive to the <ORG> against the petitioner The petitioner alleged other instances which gave rise to the wrath of the Chief Minister against the petitioner Large compensation was paid to the owner <NAME> It is discovered that no action was taken by the petitioner When the Chief Minister returned from his camp he took the petitioner to task for registering a case against <NAME> The Chief Minister in his affidavit states that he told the petitioner that action should be taken against the persons who had broken the law He denies that he took the petitioner to task for registering a case against <NAME> when they came to know about the instructions issued by the petitioner to the Inspector General of Police asked the petitioner to withdraw the instructions The Chief Secretary of the <ORG> in his affidavit states that there is no record of any one of the matters alleged by the petitioner with regard to law and order situation on the eve and at the time of the election save and except the instructions issued by the petitioner on March with regard to promulgation The letter dated March was a circular letter sent to all the Chief Secretaries and therefore the Government states that no special credit can be claimed by the petitioner or ascribed to the petitioner alleged instructions The Governor denies that he made a reference to complaints of violence or intimidation from the constituencies of Chief Minister and Cabinet Ministers The Governor denies that he ever paid compliments to the petitioner about his reputation or carrying out his duties without favour or fear <NAME> the Inspector General of Prisons who held the post of Commissioner of <ORG> at the time of the election states that the allegations made by the petitioner about tirade against the petitioner and the Inspector General of <ORG> and the Commissioner of <ORG> are baseless The most significant feature in the allegations of malafides is that when on April the petitioner was appointed to act as Deputy Chairman Planning and he went on leave he did not at any stage state anywhere that the order was made malafide That was when the petitioner returned from leave after one year and he was appointed to the post of Deputy Chairman <ORG> There are no records to suggest that the petitioner advised one way and the <ORG> acted in an opposite manner All the officers of the <ORG> including the police service discharged their duty in the best interest of administration as also in public interest <NAME> We are in agreement with the final conclusion reached in the judgment delivered by the learned Chief Justice but our approach and reasoning are a little different and we are therefore delivering separate judgment expressing our views on the various questions Chief Secretary and stated that they were taking steps to provide that tic First Member <ORG> should The Central <ORG> accordingly issued a notification dated th January in persuance of of the Indian Administrative Service Pay Rules amending Schedule III with effect from th December so as to provide that the pay of First Member <ORG> shall be Rs The reference here was to the fact that <NAME> has been granted refused leave for four months from th November under Fundamental Rule cl a Whether such promotion was byway of substantive appointment or in an officiating capacity is a matter which we would have to decide when we deal with the arguments of the parties On st April <ORG> proposed that in view of the fact that the responsibilities of Chief Secretary to State Government had multiplied and become complex to such an extent that they would no longer be regarded as less onerous than those of Secretary to <ORG> the post of Chief Secretary to State Government should be equated to the post of Secretary to <ORG> in respect of Pay and invited the comments of various State Governments on this proposal According to the petitioner there were several matters in which he had the misfortune to incur the displeasure and wrath of the second respondent during the period prior to the elections as also at the time of the elections whilst acting in discharge of his duties as Chief Secretary and the second respondent therefore on being returned to power decided to remove him from the post of Chief Secretary There was <ORG> in existence on that date though it appears that the proposal to set it up had been under consideration of the Government for Some time The State Government passed an order dated th SCI June sanctioning once again the creation of a temporary post of Deputy Chairman on a pay of Rs The next event that happened was whether as a sequel to the representation of the petitioner or not we do not know that <ORG> issued an order dated th June sanctioning the creation of a temporary post of Officer on Special Duty of the rank of Member <ORG> for a period of me year for streamlining and rationalising the structure of Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax Act and similar enactments relating to commercial taxes and rules We enquired of the learned Advocate General who appeared on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu as to what arrangement had been made to fill the post of Officer on Special Duty in the absence of the petitioner who had gone on leave and in answer to our inquiry we were informed by him that a Member of the <ORG> was discharging the functions of this post in addition to his normal functions one <NAME> who was admittedly junior to the petitioner was promoted as Chief Secretary and we ate told that he has been confirmed in that post and of the Constitution as the posts of Deputy Chairman <ORG> and Officer on Special Duty were inferior in rank and status to that of the Chief Secretary and it was made in mala fide exercise of power not on account of exigencies of administration or public service but because the second respondent was annoyed with the petitioner on account of various incidents referred to in the petition and wanted him out of the way We shall elaborate these grounds as we proceed to discuss them Was he promoted in a substantive capacity or in an officiating capacity The contention of the petitioner was that he was appointed substantively to the post of Chief Secretary and for this purpose he relied on the draft order approved by the second respondent as well as the Governor which did not use any words suggesting that his Promotion was in an acting capacity and promoted and posted him as Chief Secretary without any qualifying or limitative words The first argument was based on the terms of the authenticated order and it was said that that was the final order duly authenticated by the then Chief Secretary and it was not open to the petitioner to go behind that order and refer to the draft order for purpose of varying its terms The validity of such an order can be questioned on other grounds The authentication does not therefore Pre clude the contention that the order though made by the Governor suffers from some other infirmity The authenticated order is merely an expression of the actual order which precedes it and which is made by the appropriate authority entitled to act on behalf of <ORG> But there may conceivably be cases where the Government may also find that there is a mistake in the authenticated order and it requires to be rectified Take for example a case where the actual decision taken by <ORG> is that a person should be appointed to a post in an officiating capacity but by mistake the Can it be suggested in such a case that the Government cannot rectify the mistake by amending the authenticated order so as to bring it in accord with the real decision We have therefore no doubt that it was competent to the petitioner to contend by reference to the draft order which contained the original decision of <ORG> that the authenticated order did not correctly reflect such decision and suffered from an error There is thus no inconsistency between the draft order and the authenticated order from which any error can be spelt out in the authenticated order It appears that before issuing the authenticated order the appropriate authority applied its mind to the question as to whether the promotion should be in a substantive capacity or in an officiating capacity and since <NAME> was going on refused leave for four months from th November and was accordingly as we shall presently point out entitled to retain his lien on the post of Chief Secretary till that date decided that the promotion should be an officiating one as indeed it could not be otherwise and that is why the authenticated order was issued with the addition of the words to act after the expression promoted and Posted There is of course no positive evidence to this effect but it would appear to be a reasonable inference to make in view of the substitution of the words retiring from service with effect from the afternoon of th November in the authenticated order This argument has been dealt with in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice and we do not think we can usefully add anything to what has been stated there by the learned Chief Justice We entirely agree with the reasoning and the conclusion of the learned Chief Justice on this point and hold that since <NAME> proceeded on refused leave for a period of four months from the date of his superannuation he continued to retain his lien on the post of Chief Secretary until th March during the period of refused leave granted to him and the promotion of the petitioner under the order dated th November could not therefore be otherwise than in an officiating capacity The post of Chief Secretary became vacant on th March but at no time thereafter the petitioner was confirmed as Chief Secretary and he had therefore no right to hold the post of Chief Secretary At the date when he was transferred as Deputy Chairman <ORG> So far as the second proviso to of the Indian Administrative Service Cadre Rules is concerned we do not think it has any application The second proviso to has therefore no application and the challenge based on it must fail Rule in so far as material provides as follows No Member of the Service shall be appointed to a post other than a post specified in Schedule III unless the <ORG> concerned in respect of posts under its control or <ORG> in respect of posts under its control as the case may be make a declaration that the said post is equivalent in status and responsibility to a post specified in the said Schedule The pay of a member of the Service on appointment to a post other than a post specified in Schedule III shall be the same as he would have been entitled to had he been appointed in the post to which the said post is declared equivalent under its control or <ORG> in respect of any posts under its control may for sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing where equation is not possible appoint any member of the <ORG> to any such post without making a declaration that the said post is equivalent in status and responsibility to a post specified in Schedule III It has a purpose behind it and that is to ensure that a member of <ORG> is not pushed off so a non cadre post which is inferior in status and responsibility to that occupied by him But where it appears to the court that the declaration of equivalence is made without application of mind to the nature and responsibilities of the functions and duties attached to the non cadre post or extraneous or irrelevant factors are taken into account in determining the equivalence or the nature and responsibilities of the functions and duties of the two posts are so dissimilar that no reasonable man can possibly say that they are equivalent in status or responsibility or the declaration of equivalence is mala fide or in colourable exercise of power or it is a cloak for displacing a member of <ORG> from a cadre post which he is occupying the court can and certainly would set at naught the declaration of equivalence and afford protection to the civil servant and that applies where the noncadre post is such that it is not possible to equate it with any cadre post Where the <ORG> finds that the equation is not possible it can appoint a member of <ORG> to a non cadre post but only for sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing Now it was not the case of the respondents that when the post of Deputy Chairman was sancagain by this order there was any change in the nature and responsibilities of the functions and duties attached to the post of Deputy Chairman per month there was no option but to down grade the post With the recent appointment of Thiru <NAME> as Deputy Chairman of <ORG> the post has been equated to that of the First Member <ORG> It may be pointed out that even if the order dated th April be construed most liberally in favour of the State <ORG> which in our opinion should not be done when there is a contest between a public servant and the State <ORG> But we cannot grant relief to the petitioner on this ground because as andmitted by him in his letter dated th June addressed to the second respondent he accepted the appointment without demur as he though that the post of Deputy Chairman was of the same rank and carried the same emoluments as tie post of Chief Secretary and actually stated in a chat with newsmen on th April that he was looking forward with confidence to discharge the duties of the Deputy Chairman The order dated th June first created the post of Officer on Special Duty of the rank of Member <ORG> but on the next day when it was decided to appoint the petitioner to that post the order dated th June was modified by the order dated th June and the post of Officer on Special Duty was created in the grade of Chief Secretary These two orders dated th June and th June being of the nature and in almost identical words as the order dated th April what we have said above in regard to the order dated th April must apply equally in relation to these two orders dated th June and th June It is clear for reasons we have already discussed while dealing with the order dated th April that in making these two orders dated th June and th June the State <ORG> proceeded on the wrong assumption that it can create a non cadre post in the rank or grade of any cadre post it likes regardless of the nature and responsibilities of the functions and duties attached to such non cadre post decided that the petitioner should be appointed to that post converted it into one in the grade of Chief Secretary This establishes beyond doubt that in making the orders dated th June and th June the State <ORG> did not apply its mind and objectively determine the equivalence of the post of Officer on Special Duty but gave it a rank or grade according as who was the officer going to be appointed to it as there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> gives effect to the doctrine of equality in all matters relating to public employment Now what is the content and reach of this great equalising principle It is a founding faith to use the words of <NAME> a way of fife and it must not be subjected to a narrow pedantic or lexicographic approach We cannot countenance any attempt to truncate its all embracing scope and meaning for to do so Would be to violate its activist magnitude In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch and if it affects any matter relating to public employment it is also violative of Art and are not limited to cases where the public servant affected has a right to a post It is therefore no answer to the charge of infringement of Arts and to say that the petitioner had no right to the post of Chief Secretary but was merely officiating in that post There are not ordinarily many officers who answer the requirements of such specialised posts and the choice with the <ORG> is very limited and this choice becomes all the more difficult because some of these posts though important and having onerous responsibilities do not carry wide executive powers and officers may not therefore generally be willing to be transferred to those posts In fact the affidavit in reply filed on behalf of the first respondent clearly indicates that the petitioner discharged the duties of his office efficiently and to the satisfaction of every one concerned This contention plausible though it may seem cannot be accepted by us because there is no adequate material placed before us to Sustain it So far as the post of Deputy Chairman is concerned the petitioner himself accepted that post as being of the same status and responsibility as the post of Chief Secretary and did not raise objection against it and we need not therefore say anything more about it Now when we examine this contention we must bear in mind two important considerations The only question before us is whether the action taken by the respondents includes any component of mala fides whether hostility and malus enimus against the petitioner were the operational cause of the transfer of the petitioner from the post of Chief Secretary It is from this stand point that we must assess that merits of the allegations of mala fides made by the petitioner against the second respondent Now extensive arguments were addressed before us by counsel on both sides and we were taken through a mass of documents papers and official nothings on this part of the case but we are afraid it is not possible for us to say that the onus of establishing mala fides against the second respondent heavy as it is has been discharged by the petitioner The allegations of mala fides have been dealt with fully in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice and we do not think it will serve any useful purpose for us to discuss the merits of those allegations once again in this judgment as we are substantially in agreement with what the learned Chief Justice has said But we cannot help mentioning that there are certain disturbing features which cause us anxiety We may take by way of example the imputation in regard to <ORG> The file containing the note together with the endorsements of the Minister for works and the second respondent was thereafter placed before the petitioner along with a draft of the memorandum to be addressed by the petitioner to the Director of <ORG> But the fact remains and that cannot be disputed that no inquiry thereafter took place in the affairs of <ORG> It is a little interesting to note that <NAME> addressed a letter dated st July to the petitioner stating that though the Personal Assistant to the Chief Secretary had been reminded to send back the file relating to this matter it had not been received and the petitioner should arrange to send it back SCI if it was with him These and a few other circumstances do create suspicion brunt suspicion cannot take the place of proof and as pointed out above proof needed here is high degree of proof We cannot say that evidence generating judicial certitude in up holding the plea of mala fides has been placed before us in the present case We must therefore reject this contention of the petitioner as well
