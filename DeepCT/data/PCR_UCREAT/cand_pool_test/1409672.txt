On the th October the first defendant sold his right to plaintiff who instituted the suit out of which this second appeal arises to enforce the right thus transferred to him as since the purchase the defendants had prevented his enjoyment of it The appeal was on the ground that the sale was not completed and that the first defendant had no right to sell a specific share of the property of an undivided family I A there is a dictum by <ORG> that although in the case of a family idol the consensus of the family might give the existing dedication another direction this could not be done in the case of a public temple by the consensus of the trustees The Judges in that case upheld an alienation of an hereditary office made in favour of a person standing in the line of succession and not disqualified for the performance of the office by personal unfitness In this latter case the alienation was only allowed on the consideration that the office was heritable and the alienee who was an heir fitted to perform his duties To hold so would tend to public mischief in inducing needy incumbents of hereditary religious offices who desired to sell them to give a dishonest recognition to qualifications which in fact were not the qualifications demanded by the nature of the office that a purchase by a person standing in the line of heirs or otherwise qualified should be upheld We must reverse the decrees of the Courts below and dismiss plaintiff suit with costs
