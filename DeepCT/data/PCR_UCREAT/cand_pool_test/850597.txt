The <ORG> assessed the turnover in respect of edible oil at pies per rupee under but in respect of non edible oil he held that since a notification dated June issued under A had come into force from June of the assessment year providing for the levy of tax at pies per rupee the assessee was liable to be assessed at pies per rupee on the turnover during the first days of the year and at pies per rupee for the remaining days of the year On appeal by the assessee the appellate authority modified the order and directed that the tax be levied at a flat rate of Pies on both edible and non edible oils affirming the view of <ORG> that the assessee who elected to submit his return on the turnover of the previous year is liable to be assessed to sales tax at the rate in force on the first day of the year of assessment because the liability arises on that date and any subsequent enhancement of the rate by virtue of a notification under A does not alter that liability Having regard to the scheme underlying the option to elect for a previous year turnover conferred by of the Act the change in the law and in the rate of tax effected during the assessment year must apply to the turnover of the previous year which is deemed to be the turnover of the assessment year and sales effected during that period have to be assessed at the rate prevailing in that year It is not correct to say that there is absence of machinery for reassessment and refund of tax to justify the conclusion that the basis of the tax liablity for an assessment year is that which prevailed on the first day of that year since there are provisions in the Act such as for instance ss and which provide for reductions refunds and rectification of errors regarding taxation and even for enhancement of the tax already levied There was no ambiguity in the notification and the principle of resolving ambiguities in favour of the assessee could not be applied in this case was delivered by <NAME> SHAH Judge Revisions exercising authority under of the United Provinces Sales Tax Act XV of drew up a statement of case and referred to <ORG> at Allahabad the follow question Whether the assessee who is a manufacturer and a dealer of non edible oils and who elected the previous year as the basis of his assessment in the assessment year is liable to be assessed at the flat rate of pies per rupee on the whole of the turnover of the previous year or whether he is liable to be assessed at the rates of pies per rupee and pies per rupee on the turnover of the previous year in proportion to the two periods from st April to th June and from th June to the st March <ORG> answered the question as follows The applicant company is liable to pay tax for the assessment year on the turnover of the previous year in respect of sales of non edible oils at the flat rate of pies per rupee The facts which give rise to the appeal are briefly these <ORG> referred to as the assessee manufactures oils edible and non edible in its factory at Modinagar District Meerut State of Uttar Pradesh By the Act assessment year was defined as meaning the twelve months ending on March and previous year was defined as meaning the twelve months ending on the st March next preceding the assessment year or if the accounts of the dealer had been made up to a date within the said twelve months in respect of a year ending on any date other than the said st March then at the option of the dealer the year ending on the day to which his accounts had so been made up Turnover was defined as meaning the aggregate of the proceeds of sale by a dealer By A <ORG> was authorised to introduce instead of the multiple point scheme of taxation provided by a single point system of taxation and by notification to declare that the proceeds of sale of any goods or class of goods shall not be included in the turnover of any dealer except to such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed and if the Government made such a declaration the turnover of the dealer in whose turnover the sale of such goods was included was in respect of such sale to be taxed at such rate as may be specified not exceeding one anna per rupee By <ORG> at Allahabad was authorised to decide questions of law raised in any case in the course of assessment and referred to it on a statement of the case drawn up by <ORG> the <ORG> Government was invested with power to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act and in particular in respect of certain specified matters In exercise of the powers conferred by of the Act <ORG> framed rules Rule of the Sales Tax Rules gave to every dealer an option to submit his return of the turnover of the assessment year in lieu of the return of the turnover of the previous year The assessee submitted its return for the assessment year on its taxable turnover of the previous year ending on May to <ORG> Meerut Range By read with the assessee has the option to adopt the turnover of the previous year as the taxable turnover for the year of assessment and if he does so he has to submit within sixty days of the commencement of the assessment year returns showing his turnover for that previous year If however the assessee adopts the turnover in the year of assessment as his taxable turnover he has to submit returns before the last day of July October January and April his gross turnover for each of the four quarters ending th June th September st December and st March If the assessee adopts the turnover of the previous year by the provisions contained in and and rr and the liability to pay tax arises on the st of April and the rate applicable is the rate in force on that date The tax paid on the turnover of the previous year is not related to the actual sales provision for making adjustments in the liability to tax on ascertainment of the actual turnover at the end of the year of assessment Initially when the liability of the assessee to pay tax on edible oils for the assessment year arose the rate was undoubtedly pies per rupee on the turnover and the question which falls to be determined is whether by reason of the alteration of the rate and its incidence in the course of the year the assessee became liable to pay tax at the higher rate on a part of the turnover of the previous year and if so on what basis There were under the Act and the Rules two distinct and clear cut schemes to assess sales tax where the tax payer elected to submit his return based on the turnover of the previous year and where he elected to or was bound by law to submit his return on the turnover of the year of assessment Was it intended when alteration was made in the rate of tax or its incidence during the course of the year to assimilate these two schemes of taxation so as to permit of a departure from the one to the other There is no express provision in the Act or in the Rules in that behalf The notification enjoins levy of the tax at the altered rate only in respect of sales taking place after the fixed date and all sales which preceded that date are to be taxed at the original rate The question next arises Is any machinery provided in the Act or the Rules for projecting this division of the year of assessment into the previous year and for apportioning the turnover of that year Express provision in that behalf there is none and it is difficult to imply such a provision in the Act He submitted that a person who was not a manufacturer or an importer of goods included in the schedule to the notification under A may if he has adopted the turnover of the previous year as his taxable turnover be liable even though it was the intention of the Government to absolve him from liability to pay tax of the Act which provides for proportionate reduction of tax when in the case of a change or discontinuance taking place in the course of the assessment year of a firm which has been assessed for such year on the turnover of the previous year does not support the contention that an artificial divisions of the turnover of the previous year is intended in cases of alteration of circumstances during the course of the assessment year But the fact that the <ORG> has made an express provision dealing with changes or discontinuance of business of firms in the course of the assessment year enabling a reduction proportionately to the tax already paid would be a ground indicating that in cases not governed by that provision no alteration in the liability was permissible when the taxable turnover was based on the previous year turnover The facts giving rise to this appeal are briefly these A company called <ORG> amalgamated with the respondent which will be referred to hereinafter as the assessee was during the years a manufacturer of and dealer in vegetable oils both edible and non edible During that year there was no legislation imposing any tax on sales Section of the Act enacted that it shall be deemed to have come into force on April Section of the Act to quote only the relevant words as it stood at the material time enacted Section Subject to the provisions of this Act every dealer shall pay on turnover in each assessment year a tax at the rate of pies a rupee Provided that i <ORG> may by notification in the official Gazette reduce the rate of tax on the turnover of any dealer or class of dealers or on the turnover in respect of any goods or class of goods ii a dealer whose turnover in the previous year is less than Rs In the Schedule annexed to this notification nonedible oil of the type dealt with by the assessee was subject to a tax pies per rupee if the same was manufactured in Section of the Act as it stood at the date relevant to this appeal enacted Section Rules were framed by Government inter alia under the power conferred by the st proviso just now set out and by rule of the said rules an option was given to dealers to submit returns of their turnover of the assessment year in lieu of the turnover of the previous year The assessee exercised the option of being assessed on the basis of the turnover of the previous year under of the Act and in respect of first assessment year after the Act came to force assessment year it filed a return in respect of the turnover of its previous year June to May As regards the sale of non edible oil the sales tax officer hold that since the notification set out above under A had come into force as and from June of the assessment year the assessee was liable to be assessed pies per rupee on the turnover during the first days of the year and pies per rupee in respect of the remaining days of the year and he computed the tax accordingly The assessee preferred an appeal to the Judge Appeals <NAME> Meerut against the order of the Sales Tax Officer after the assessee made an application to the Judge Revision to state a case for the opinion of <ORG> under of the Act as to whether the rate of tax fixed by the notification could be applied to the sales of the commodity which factually took place on or before June This petition having been dismissed an application was filed before <ORG> for directing the reference and on this being ordered the following question as reframed by <ORG> was referred to it for determination Whether the assessee who is a manufacturer and a dealer of non edible oils and who elected the previous year as the basis of his assessment in the assessment year is liable to be assessed at the flat rate of pies per rupee on the whole of the turnover of the previous year or whether he is liable to be assessed at the rates of pies per rupee and pies per rupee on the turnover of the previous year in proportion to the two periods from April to June and from to March The learned Judges answered the question in favour of the assessee and held that the notification under A could not apply to determine the rate of tax payable by the assessee on his turnover of the previous year As the arguments before us proceeded on practically the same lines as before <ORG> it will be convenient if we set out the reasoning by which the learned Judges upheld the asssessee contention that the notification under A was inapplicable to determine the rate of tax payable by it Hence the liability of the assessee which had become fixed under Act XV of as it originally stood could not be and Was not varied by A and would not therefore be affected by any notification issued under the last mentioned provision that a notification under A could not have retrospective effect since A itself did not operate of its own force and merely empowered the <ORG> by a notification to effect changes in the law and hence such changes when notified could not operate as from any date prior to the date of the notification Section A which used the words in respect of such sales contemplated particular sales taking place after the notification issued under it and hence the notification issued under that section could not alter the rate of levy in respect of sales anterior to the date of the notification that the terms of the notification carried out the general scheme of the Act and negatived retrospective operation and that as on its langu age it applied only to sales which took place on or admittedly effected long prior thereto in the previous year the same could not be affected by the enhanced rate of duty Section of the Sales tax Amending Act XXV of which introduced A enacted It this Act shall be deemed to have come into force on the st April and as A was one of the sections of this enactment it would have effect from the earlier date Besides elaborating the other points in the judgment of <ORG> learned Counsel for the respondent further pressed upon us that there was no specific provision in the Act for refund or reassessment which would have been present if the levy of a rate with retrospective effect were contemplated by the Act as applicable to the assessees who bad opted for the previous year turnover basis of assessment Obviously in their case no difficulty could arise by reason of any change in the law either in the rate or basis of taxation effected during the year as these would automatically be given effect to in the final assessment From this he argued that the scheme of the Act was that in the case of the previous year turnover assessees to use a convenient phrase the tax liability had to be determined on the state of the law as it prevailed on the st day of the assessment year and that it got fixed and crystallised on that date and remained unaffected by any changes in the law effected during the course of the assessment year In view of these additional submissions we consider that it would be convenient to examine the entire argument of learned Counsel for the respondent under three heads into which they naturally fall Does the Act read in conjunction with the Rules framed to give effect to its provisions contemplate any difference being drawn between the basis of the tax liability as distinct from the quantum of the turnover of those assessees who have opted for the previous year turnover and the assessment year turnover assessees On the scheme of Sales tax Act as of every other sales tax legislation in the other Indian States the total tax liability of an assessee is the resultant product of two factors the total of the proceeds of sales effected during a given period universally a year from which are deducted the turnover of the sales of commodities which are exempt from tax for instance under of the Act whose provisions will be referred to later multiplied by the rate of tax applicable either to the entire turnover or where different rates are prescribed on sales of different articles such rates in respect of such turnover The best way to appreciate the scheme underlying the Act would be to ascertain the position at the time the Act was enacted It received the assent of the Governor and was published in the <ORG> on June Section of the Act further enacted that It shall be deemed to have come into force on April The tax is on the turnover i on the total of the sales proceeds of taxable sales and therefore unless there were a taxable sale its proceeds would not enter the pool which goes by the name of turnover It was pointed out that it was possible for an assessee to submit his return on the basis of the previous year turnover even on the st of April of the assessment year and there being no legal impediment in the way of the figures returned by the dealer being accepted the assessment might conceivably be completed and the tax due demanded and even paid on the st of April it sell If this were done it was urged there being no machinery for reassessment or refunds such completed assessment would become final for the year and could not be disturbed thereafter If this were possible or were actually done in the case of one dealer who had so opted it was urged that it would obviously be anomalous if another dealer who happened to submit his return later and whose assessment was in consequence delayed should be subjected to a different law or a different rate of levy It is also not denied that there is nothing in the terms of the proviso to confine the power to effect reductions only prospectively as distinguished from reductions having retrospective effect Let us first take a case where such a reduction in the rate is notified to be effective before an assessee submits his return Let us next take the case of a dealer who has submitted his return of the turnover of the previous year on a date anterior to the notification regarding the alteration of the rate The position reached therefore is that if the change in the rate we have assumed it to be by way of reduction but the argument would equally apply to variation in any kind were effected before the actual assessment it should be given effect to in the case of every assessee for not merely is there no procedural complication in the shape of a need for refund but it would be in accordance with the law and in fact one might go further and say that any other mode of proceeding would not be countenanced by the Act because the statute homologises the basis of the tax whether the turnover is computed on the previous year or the current year sales It is true that there are no provisions specially so designated to meet this contingency here referred to but that is not the same thing as saying that there is a complete absence of machinery This section enacts <ORG> may in its discretion at any time suo motu or on being moved by the Commissioner of Sales Tax or on the application of any person aggrieved call for and examine the record of any order or proceedings recorded by any appellate or assessing authority under this Act for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of such order or as to the regularity of such proceedings and may pass such order as he thinks fit <ORG> shall not pass any order under sub section adversely affecting any person unless an opportunity has been given to such person to be heard In the entire discussion up to now we have proceeded on the assumption that the turnover of the previous year of the dealer was a fixed quantity which was finally determined once and for ever on the st March of that year and that the problem was merely to find the rate of tax to be applied to this predetermined factor Up to now the discussion has proceeded on the basis that a change in the law made in the assessment year whether as regards the computation of the turnover or as to the rate of levy is effective throughout that year i from the st April to the st March and it is found that the fact that the returns of the previous year turnover dealers are required to or are submitted within the early part of the year or the contention based on the absence of specific machinery for reassessment or refund are an insufficient basis for holding that a change in the law affecting the basis of tax liability would not affect the previous year turnover assessees and that the machinery provided by ss and are adequate to meet the contingencies arising out of the changes being retrospectively effected after the assessments were completed In the case of the assessment year turnover dealers there is no problem because the sales effected during the course of the year would be governed by the law applicable from time to time The entire basis or theory of the tax being levied on foot of the previous year turnover is that notwithstanding that factually the sales took place in the previous year they are to be deemed by fiction to have taken place in the year of assessment If that theory be discarded there could be no legal foundation for the tax being levied by the Act even as originally enacted on a sale which factually took place before it was operative If we reject the argument that it is only the law as prevailed on the st April of a year that forms the basis for the computation of the turnover and for the ascertainment of the tax liability as not flowing from the provisions of the Act and indeed as contrary to the very scheme underlying the enactment the changes in the law effected during the course of the assessment year must operate even in respect of the turnover of the previous year which are deemed to be the turnover of the assessment year It now remains to deal with the question as to whether the language employed in the notification by which only sales effected after a date specified in the assessment year are to be governed by the new levy precludes the application of the notified change to those dealers whose sales were actually effected in the previous year but who had opted for the previous year turnover basis of assessment The argument of learned Counsel which found favour with the learned Judges of <ORG> was briefly this So applied it does not appear to us to support the contention of the respondent Whichever of these be the more accurate method of expressing the result the fact is that there is no element of retrospectivity at all involved in the application of the tax law which prevails in the year of assessment to the turnover of the previous year when due to the choice of the assessee of being assessed under the previous years turnover basis is rendered applicable Section of the Act the charging section imposes in effect a tax of three pies per rupee on all sales effected after the commencement of the Act i after April pose that section itself had by a proviso imposed a tax six pies per rupee on all sales of edible oil effected on and after June The date mentioned in the notification as the date from and after which sales would be charged at the new rates would therefore not militate against the new rates being applied to the turnover of the previous year since the turnover of the previous year has to be assessed on the rates prevailing in the assessment year The next question is how on the terms of the notification which came into operation after the commencement of the assessment year and during the course of it the proportion of the turnover on the basis of which the tax liability of a previous year turnover dealer could be computed There is no doubt that this mode of computing the proportion viz We would accordingly allow the appeal set aside the decree of <ORG> and restore the assessment order of the Sales tax Officer with costs here and in <ORG> In accordance with the opinion of the majority the appeal is dismissed with costs
