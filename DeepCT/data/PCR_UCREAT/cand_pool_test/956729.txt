Assuming that the suit related to a matter of which <ORG> could take cognizance I agree with the view taken by the learned Judge who tried the case I think the plaintiffs failed to make out any case and that the suit was rightly dismissed There is a distinction between the case of the st and th plaintiffs who are members of the Kamara caste for whose benefit the defendant alleges and the plaintiffs do not appear to deny the temple was instituted and that of the nd rd and th defendants who were not members of this caste but merely residents in the street in question who had been in the habit of availing themselves of the opportunity to worship when the procession passed down their streets They are not members of the Kamara caste they have no proprietary interest in the institution they have no voice in the appointment of the Dharmakartha and they have no control over him I know no principle of law upon which it can be said by custom prescription or otherwise plaintiffs and have acquired any rights as against the defendant Plaintiffs to claim a right by custom not merely to worship the goddess but to compel the defendant to bring the goddess past their houses in order that they may worship As regards plaintiffs to the fact that they resided in the particular street gave them the opportunity of participating in certain religious advantages which they would not otherwise have enjoyed The fact they enjoyed these advantages for a certain period gives them no rights as against the defendant There was no evidence before the Court below as to the route taken for the procession prior to In a case which came before this Court in Subbaraya Gurukal Chellappa Mudali I in which the custom with reference to ceremonies and processions in connection with idols was involved Sir <NAME> and Sir <NAME> observe We believe there is no general custom by which this question can be at once decided Upon the st plaintiff own statement of the custom upon which he relies it seems to me that the alleged custom is so unreasonable unreasonable I mean from the point of view of the community for whose benefit the institution was founded and the processions are conducted that I should be prepared to hold that no such custom in fact exists There is however other evidence as to the nature of the alleged custom A Dharmakartha of a neighbouring temple was called as a witness on behalf of the plaintiffs He also stated according to the learned Judge note of his evidence that the route of processions depends upon the wishes of the people living in the streets and the pleasure of the Dharmakartha that processions generally keep the same route and that it depends upon the wishes of the people through which the processions go Without saying that the defendant discretion in regard to the route of the procession is absolute as the defendant puts his case in written statement it seems to me that the custom as spoken to by the Dharmakartha witness is more reasonable and more probable I have come to the conclusion that the right claimed by the plain tiffs is not one on which <ORG> can adjudicate The dividing line between the class of cases involving questions of religious ritual and usage of which <ORG> can take cognizance and the class of cases involving questions of which it cannot or at any rate will not take cognizance is not very clearly defined In the course of his judgment Sir <NAME> observed The right which the appellant claimed in the plaint and which he asked the court to protect was a right of access to the inner shrine or sanctum sanctorum of a Hindu temple for the purposes of religious worship and the ground of claim was that prior to his marriage with a Hindu widow he had that right and that he did not since forfeit it by reason of such marriage It may be that an enquiry as to religion or caste or as to the religious foundation for the excommunication pronounced by the chief priest of <NAME> is indispensable to coming to a correct decision but when the right claimed is asserted to be of a civil nature and which is within the cognizance of <ORG> they are bound to hold such enquiry as is ancillary to the exercise of the jurisdiction vested in them by law The custom of which the court took cognizance in the case of <NAME> Subtarayadu I was not the plaintiff right of access to the inner shrine which is inherent in all Brahmans who have not become disqualified but the general usage of the Brahmans which forbids marriage with a widow it was held by this court that a Hindu priest could not sue in respect of the withholding of religious observances due to his sacred rank but unconnected with any special office held by him although the non performance of these observances might have caused him some ascertainable pecuniary loss The court refused to entertain the suit on the ground that it was brought to vindicate the plaintiffs right not to an office but to a mere dignity unconnected with any fees profits or emoluments The distinction may seem fine but it seems in Accordance with the general proposition laid down by Sir <NAME> in the first of the two cases just referred to The proposition is The members of a sect are entitled subject to the rules made by the duly constituted authorities of the sect to take part in the public worship of the sect and if any of them is wrongfully prevented from so doing he is entitled to seek from <ORG> such remedies as they can afford him The case is very shortly reported but it would appear that by the conduct of the defendants the plaintiffs were wholly deprived of their turn of worship In an unreported case decided by this court to which my learned colleague referred Appeal No of the plaintiff had brought the right to certain dignities and emoluments and the contention that the honours and dignities were of a religious nature of which <ORG> could not take cognizance was overruled I think the suit was rightly dismissed and that this appeal ought to be dismissed with costs They allege that last year for the first time the defendant who is the Dharmakartha of the temple broke the practice by not taking the procession through their street and they prayed for a mandatory injunction to compel him to do so in future and for damages The learned Judge who tried the case held that the practice did not constitute a valid custom binding on the temple authorities and dismissed the suit Each plaintiff sets up an individual right as well as the collective right of the residents of the street generally which observation I make in order to dispose of the objection taken to the suit with reference to Sections and of the The only questions that remain for determination are Whether the plaintiffs can sue in <ORG> to establish the right they set up and if so whether they have established the right In Subbaraya Gurukal Chellappa Mudali I a case which in its facts is on all fours with this it was held that a Hindu idol is a property and the right to deal with such property is a right cognizable by <ORG> All the cases in which it has been held that the civil courts had no jurisdiction were cases in which only the mode of worship was in question that is questions relating to the ritual or to precedence and other mere dignities or honours claimed in the exercise of the right of worship So that I take it there can be no doubt of the plaintiffs right of suit in this court The defendant has not shown that he had any authority to divert the idol procession from its ordinary route I should therefore reverse the decree appealed against and issue a mandatory injunction to the defendant as prayed for by the plaintiffs viz Under Section of the Letters Patent the appeal is dismissed with costs
