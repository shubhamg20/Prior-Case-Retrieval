<ORG> passed a Resolution on th January approving a proposal under which a part of the plot was to be used for construction of two buildings that will augment the income of the <ORG> which could be used for the purpose of construction of staff quarters One Mr <NAME> filed writ petition before <ORG> challenging the right of the <ORG> to use the land for a purpose different from the one for which it had been reserved and designated under the development plan as well as the town planning scheme on the ground that it had no right to use it for commercial purpose A single Judge dismissed the petition holding that the substantial portion of the acquired plot was being utilised for a purpose for which it was acquired and the commercial use to which the small portion was being put would substantially augment the coffers of the <ORG> for the benefit of the public at large that the value charged by the <ORG> for allowing use of its property was not grossly inadequate and that sufficient publicity was given before inviting offers and after having rejected the various pleas taken by the petitioner in the case he observed that the petitioner was not an independent minded citizen solely inspired by the laudable motive of protecting public interest and that the allegations in the petition indicated that he had been set up by a disgruntled builder who purchased the tender document but did not give an offer The matter was taken up in appeal but <ORG> dismissed the same after hearing all the parties However the appeal filed by the respondents was allowed by <ORG> which issued a writ of mandamus directing appellants to in civil appeal No not to use the plot reserved for <ORG> bus depot for commercial purpose or for any purpose other than the purpose for which the said plot of land was reserved In this view of the connotation of the word change the proviso has no application to the present case An adjudication is conclusive and final not only as to the actual matter determined but as to every other matter which the parties might and ought to have litigated and have had it decided as incidential to or essentially connected with the subject matter of the litigation and every matter coming within the legitimate purview of the original action both in respect of the matters of claim or defence iii It cannot be disputed that applies to public interest litigation as well in view of Explanation VI but it must be proved that the previous litigation was the public interest litigation not by way of a private grievance It has to be a bona fide litigation in respect of a right which is common and is agitated in common with others The plot in question admittedly lies in a commercial zone and if any facilities are given to the people of that locality providing for commercial offices those facilities would go towards the improvement of Bombay Ordinary traditional litigation is essentially of an adversary character where there is a dispute between the two litigating parties one making the claim of seeking relief against the other and the other opposing such claim or resisting such relief While public interest litigation is brought before the <ORG> not for the purpose of enforcing the right of one individual against another as happens in the case of ordinary litigation it is intended to prosecute and vindicate public interest which demands that violation of constitutional or legal rights of a large number of people who are poor ignorant or socially and economically in disadvantaged position should not go unnoticed unredressed for that would be destructive of the rule of law The said plot originally belonged to one Amarsi and after a prolonged litigation the said land admeasuring sq It however appears that <ORG> referred back the proposal of the th August to the General Manager and he in the light of discussions with the members of <ORG> put up two alternative proposals vide his letter dated th September The proposal further indicated that as the builder maximum investment would amount to Rs lacs he may in lieu thereof be given a right to dispose of the property to the users of his own choice He challenged the right of the <ORG> to use the land for a purpose different from one for which it had been reserved and designated under the development plan as well as the town planning scheme and that it had no right to use it for commercial purpose The petition was dismissed by a learned Single Judge on th May after having heard all parties concerned and after giving opportunity to file replies The learned Judge also rejected the contention that the value charged by the <ORG> for allowing use of its property was grossly inadequate and that no sufficient publicity was given before inviting offers The court after having rejected the various pleas taken by the petitioner in the case also observed that the petitioner was not an independent minded citizen solely inspired by the laudable motive of protecting public interest but the allegations in the petition indicated that he had been set up by a disgruntled builder who purchased the tender document but did not give an offer The matter was taken up in appeal but <ORG> dismissed the same after hearing all the parties After the dismissal of the appeal the present respondents to in civil appeal no filed a similar petition under Article of the Constitution in <ORG> which gives rise to the present appeals and the special leave petition seeking almost the same relief as was claimed in the earlier petition filed by <NAME> The learned Single Judge summarily dismissed the writ petition by his order dated rd November The appellants feeling aggrieved by the judgment of <ORG> filed a detailed review petition mainly on the ground that the respondents to had not taken any plea based on regulation of the Building Regulations and it was only during the course of arguments that this plea was advanced before the court and certain papers were filed before the court The appellants had no opportunity to produce documents in rebuttal and it was only when the decision was given by the court that the appellants have been able to trace and collect a number of documents which according to them have great bearing on the interpretation of the said building regulations contained in the Town Planning Scheme Andheri I nd Variation finally sanctioned by the State Government on th July Town Planning Scheme Andheri No I Final which came into force on th November vide Government notification No GP A dated th October in the Bombay Government Gazette Part I No dated th October Notice dated th January issued by <NAME> Arbitrator announcing that he had drawn up the Final Scheme Andheri No nd Variation as required under section xviii read with section of the MRTP Act We have interpreted Regulation and the proviso in its plain terms An adjudication is conclusive and final not only as to the actual matter determined but as to every other matter which the parties might and ought to have litigated and have had it decided as incidental to or essentially connected with the subject matter of the litigation and every matter coming with the legitimate purview of the original action both in respect of the matters of claim or defence In view of Explanation VI it cannot be disputed that applies to public interest litigation as well but it must be proved that the previous litigation was the public interest litigation not by way of a private grievance It has to be a bonafide litigation in respect of a right which is common and is agitated in common with others This leads us to the third point that a valuable public property was being disposed of at a gross undervalue in a highly secretive manner only to oblige respondent No In view of these circumstances it cannot be said that the whole thing was done in a secretive manner As disclosed in the earlier part of the judgment the General Manager had sent up a proposal whereunder a part of plot No was to be used for construction of two buildings that will augment the income of the <ORG> which could be used for the purpose of construction of staff quarters This leads us to the question of mala fides of the officers of the <ORG> in accepting the tender of <ORG> This plea was based on various circumstances which had been taken into consideration by <ORG> and repelled The plot in question admittedly lies in a commercial zone and if any facilities are given to the people of that locality providing for commercial offices those facilities would go towards the improvement of Bombay Section of the Bombay Municipal <ORG> Act provides that the <ORG> shall be for the purposes of this Act have powers to acquire and hold movable and immovable property whether within or without the limits of Greater Bombay If in a commercial zone the <ORG> was able to make available accommodation for commercial purposes we do not see why such a venture cannot be one either for the purpose of promoting public safety convenience or in the nature of facilities being made available as a part of the improvement of the city If commercial activities are to be pin pointed in a commercial zone and for that purposes the Municipal <ORG> takes a step to provide accommodation for commercial purposes it cannot be said that the property of the <ORG> was being acquired or held for purposes other than the purposes of the Act This leads us to the last but not the least in importance the plea based on Building Regulation No In order to appreciate the contention it will be proper to read the regulation The user of the following final plots will be as under as per the sanctioned development plan Final Plot No User Public Wall Part Parking lot Best Bus Depot Provided that the above users may be changed by <ORG> after modification of the Development Plan If there is a conflict between the requirement of these rules and the requirements of bye laws in force the requirements of these rules shall prevail Provided however that in respect of areas included in a finally sanctioned Town Planning Scheme the scheme regulations shall prevail if there is a conflict between the requirements of these rules and of the Scheme regulations What does the word change mean <ORG> gives the following meaning to the word change In this view of the connotation of the word change the proviso has no application to the present case and <ORG> in our opinion was not quite justified in allowing the writ petition only on the basis of the proviso to Building Regulation No The appellants had no opportunity to produce documents in rebuttal and it was only when the judgment was pronounced that the appellants could lay their hands on certain notifications and certain other documents to show that was a minor adjustment and could be rectified They are accordingly allowed the judgment and order dated th November of <ORG> of <ORG> are set aside and the judgment and order dated rd November of the learned Single Judge of <ORG> dismissing the writ petition are restored In the circumstances of the case however the parties shall bear their own costs
