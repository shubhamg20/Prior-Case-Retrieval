The <ORG> as trustees on behalf of the public is entitled to impose all such limitations on the character and extent of the user as may be requisite for protecting the rights of the public generally but subject to such limitations the the right of a citizen to carry on business in transport vehicles on public pathways cannot be denied to him on the ground that the <ORG> owns the highways Article as the result of the Constitution First Amendment Act enables the <ORG> to carry on any trade or business either by itself or through corporations owned or controlled by the <ORG> to the exclusion of private citizens wholly or in part which was introduced by the amendment of the Constitution in was not in existence when the Road Transport Act be taken in certain circumstances to include prohibition as well then the prohibition of the right of all private citizens to carry on the business of motor transport on public roads within the <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh as laid down by the impugned Act cannot be justified as reasonable restrictions imposed in the interests of the general public Whether the restrictions are reasonable or not would depend to a large extent on the nature of the trade and the conditions prevalent in it There is nothing wrong in the nature of the motor transport trade in the present case which is perfectly innocuous as it stood at the time of enactment must be held to be void under Art The running of these vehicles has been regulated so long by the Motor Vehicles Act of which provides inter alia for granting of driving licences the registration of vehicles and exercising control over transport vehicles through permits granted by <ORG> As a result of this decision <ORG> were directed to deal with the applications for permits made by the various private bus owners in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act without in any way being influenced by the consideration that the <ORG> Government wanted to run buses of their own on certain routes Section gives definitions of certain terms while section which is the most material section in the Act embodies virtually its whole purpose So long as the scheme continues in force <ORG> shall have the exclusive right to operate Road Transport Services or if the scheme so provides a certain fixed number of transport vehicles belonging to others can also be run on those roads Sections and provide respectively for the appointment of <ORG> and <ORG> The constitutional validity of the Act was challenged on a number of grounds the principal contentions being that the Act was discriminatory in its character and contravened the provisions of article of the Constitution that it conflicted with the fundamental rights of the petitioners guaranteed under article of the Constitution and that it was an invalid piece of legislation as it purported to acquire the interest of the petitioners in a commercial undertaking without making any provision for compensation as is required under article of the Constitution It was further argued that the Act violated the guarantee of freedom of inter State and intra state trade embodied in article of the Constitution We will take up these points in proper order and it will be convenient first of all to address ourselves to the two allied questions viz whether the appellants could claim any fundamental right under article of the Constitution which can be said to have been violated by the impugned legislation and whether the Act has deprived them of any property which would attract the operation of article of the Constitution Mr <NAME> argues that a right to carry on any occupation trade or business is guaranteed to all citizens by article of the Constitution The appellants in the present cases were carrying on the business of plying buses on hire on a public highway until now and the Act which prevents them from pursuing that trade or business conflicts therefore with the fundamental right guaranteed under article of the Constitution It is said also that this beneficial interest of the appellants in the commercial undertaking is property within the meaning of article of the Constitution and as the Act does not conform to the requirements of that article it must be held to be void Mr <NAME> put forward another and a somewhat novel argument that the right of the appellants to use a public highway for purposes of trade is in the nature of an easement and as such can be reckoned as property in law consequently there has been a deprivation of property by the impugned legislation in this sense also He must have a legal right to use a particular place for purposes of his trade or business before he can resist any encroachment upon it on the strength of the constitutional guarantee The <ORG> in which all public ways vest under the law has the sole right to determine whether it would allow any citizen to carry on a trade or business upon a public highway and if so to what extent The citizen has no inherent right in this respect apart from any <ORG> sanction There is no question of any conflict with the fundamental right guaranteed under article of the Constitution in such cases The law has thus been stated in Halsbury Laws of England Where a highway originates in an inferred dedication it is a question of fact what kind of traffic it was so dedicated for having regard to the character of the way and the nature of the user prior to the date at which they infer dedication and a right of passage once acquired will extend to more modern forms of traffic reasonably similar to those for which the highway was originally dedicated so long as they do not impose a substantially greater burden on the owner of the soil If there is any danger to the road by reason of such user or if such user by one interferes with the user by others it is up to the State to regulate the motor traffic or reduce the number or weigh of vehicles on the road in any way it i Ibid page The <ORG> as trustees on behalf of the public is entitled to impose all such limitations on the character and extent of the user as may be requisite for protecting the rights of the public generally but subject to such limitations the right of a citizen to carry on business in transport vehicles on public pathways cannot be denied to him on the ground that the <ORG> owns the highways Prima facie it is an infraction of the provision of article of the Constitution and the question for our consideration therefore is whether this invasion by the <ORG> of the fundamental right can be justified under the provision of clause of article on the ground that it imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right in the interests of the general public In the first place it empowers the <ORG> to impose reasonable restrictions upon the freedom of trade business occupation or profession in the interests of the general public In the second place it empowers the <ORG> to prescribe the professional and technical qualifications necessary for practicing any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business Thirdly and this is the result of the Constitution First Amendment Act of it enables the <ORG> to carry on any trade or business either by itself or through a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> to the exclusion of private citizens wholly or in part It is not disputed that the third provision which was introduced by the amendment of the Constitution in was not in existence when the impugned Act was passed and <ORG> rightly held that the validity of the Act is not to be decided by applying the provision of the new clause The learned Judges held however that quite apart from the new provision the creation of a <ORG> monopoly in regard to transport service as has been done under the Act could be justified as reasonable restrictions upon the fundamental right enunciated in article of the Constitution imposed in the interests of the general public In the case of <ORG> Virgo Lord <NAME> while discussing a statutory power conferred on <ORG> to make bye laws for regulating and governing a trade made the following observation No doubt the regulation and governance of a trade may involve the imposition of restrictions on its exercise where such restrictions are in the opinion of the public authority necessary to prevent a nuisance or for the maintenance of order But their Lordships think that there is a marked distinction to be drawn between the prohibition or prevention of a trade and the regulation or governance of it and indeed a power to regulate and govern seems to imply the continued existence of that which is to be regulated or governed The question for consideration in that case was the constitutional validity of the Preventive Detention Act and one of the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the appellant in attacking the validity of the legislation was that it invaded the right of free movement guaranteed under article of the Constitution and as the restrictions imposed by it could not be regarded as reasonable restrictions within the meaning of clause of the article the enactment should be held to be void the several sub clauses of article and <NAME> expressed his views in the following words The use of the word restrictions in the various sub clauses seems to imply in the context that the rights guaranteed by the Article are still capable of being exercised and to exclude the idea of incarceration though the words restriction and deprivation are sometimes used as inter changeable terms as restriction may reach a point where it may well amount to deprivation Read as a whole and viewed in its setting among the group of provisions relating to right to freedom Article seems to my mind to presuppose that the citizen to whom the possession of these fundamental rights is secured retains the substratum of personal freedom on which alone the enjoyment of these rights necessarily rests The point for consideration in that case was undoubtedly different from the one that has arisen in the present case and the question whether the restrictions enumerated in the several sub clauses of article could go to the length of total deprivation of these liberties was neither raised nor decided in that case that restriction may reach a point where it might amount to deprivation yet restrictions would normally pre suppose the continued existence no matter even in a very thin and attenuated form of the thing upon which the restrictions were imposed <NAME> in his judgment vide page expressly said Therefore Article cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty I am unable to accept the contention that the word deprivation includes within its scope restriction when interpreting Article In the opinion of the learned Judges the observations of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> supra referred to above could be distinguished on the ground that the expression used in that article was not restriction but regulation and governing It was contended inter alia on behalf of the appellant in that case that the Excise Regulation and the auction sales made thereunder were ultra vires as the law purported to grant monopoly of that trade to a few persons and this was inconsistent with article of the Constitution The <ORG> has certainly the right to prohibit trades which are illegal or immoral or injurious to the health and welfare of the public The relevant portion of the judgment runs as follows Article of the Constitution guarantees that all citizens have the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation or trade or business and clause of the article authorises legislation which imposes reasonable restrictions on this right in the interests of the general public of the restriction regard must be had to the nature of the business and the conditions prevailing in that trade It can also not be denied that the State has the power to prohibit trades which are illegal or immoral or injurious to the health and welfare of the public It is contended on behalf of the respondents that these observations clearly indicate that the expression reasonable restriction as used in article of the Constitution might in certain circumstances include total prohibition The general observations occurring in the judgment cited above must therefore have to be taken with reference to the facts of that case That point will be dealt with under the other point raised in the appeal If however the word restriction in article of the Constitution be taken in certain circumstances to include prohibition as well the point for consideration then would be whether the prohibition of the right of all private citizens to carry on the business of motor transport on public roads within the State of Uttar Pradesh as laid down by the Act can be justified as reasonable restrictions imposed in the interests of the general public the restrictions are reasonable or not would depend to a large extent on the nature of the trade and the conditions prevalent in it In the second place it has been said that the transport services are essential to the life of the community and it is conducive to the interests of the general public to have an efficient system of transport on public roads It is pointed out that the preamble to the Act indicates that the legislation was passed in the interests of the general public who are undoubtedly interested in a suitable and efficient road transport service and it was not proved by the petitioners that the monopoly which was contemplated in favour of the <ORG> in regard to this particular business was not conducive to the common welfare It is not enough to say that as an efficient transport service is conducive to the interests of the people a legislation which makes provision for such service must always be held valid irrespective of the fact as to what the effect of such legislation would be and irrespective of the particular conditions and circumstances under which the legislation was passed There is undoubtedly a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of a legislation But when the enactment on the face of it is found to violate a fundamental right guaranteed under article of the Constitution it must be held to be invalid unless those who support the legislation can bring it within the purview of the exception laid down in clause of the article If the respondents do not place any materials before the <ORG> to establish that the legislation comes within the permis sible limits of clause it is surely not for the appel lants to prove negatively that the legislation was not reasonable and was not conducive to the welfare of the community In the present case we have absolutely no materials before us to say in which way the establishment of <ORG> monopoly in regard to road transport service in the particular areas would be conducive to the general welfare of the public We mention these matters only to show that these are relevant facts which might help the <ORG> in coming to a decision as to the reasonableness or otherwise of the prohibition but unfortunately there are no materials in the record relating to any one of them Although they carry on the business only with the aid of permits which are granted to them by the authorities under the Motor Vehicles Act no compensation has been allowed to them under the statute It may be pointed out in this connection that in Part IV of the Constitution which enunciates the directive principles of <ORG> policy article a expressly lays down that the <ORG> shall direct its policy towards securing that the citizens men and women equally have the right to an adequate means of livelihood The result of the amendment is that the <ORG> would not have to justify such action as reasonable at all in a <ORG> of law and no objection could be taken to it on the ground that it is an infringement of the right guaranteed under article of the Constitution We think that this is sound law and our conclusion is that the legislation in question which violates the fundamental right of the appellants under article of the Constitution and is not shown to be protected by clause of the article as it stood at the time of the enactment must be held to be void under article of the Constitution We now come to the second point which is in a manner connected with the first and the question is If the effect of prohibition of the trade or business of the appellants by the impugned legislation amounts to deprivation of their property or interest in a commercial undertaking within the meaning of article of the Constitution does not the legislation offend against the provision of that clause inasmuch as no provision for compensation has been made in the Act It is not seriously disputed on behalf of the respondents that the appellants right to ply motor vehicles for gain is in any event an interest in a commercial undertaking There is no doubt also that the appellants have been deprived of this interest In the opinion of <ORG> in the circumstances of the present case there is no scope for operation of article of the Con stitution and the reason for taking this view is thus given in the judgment of one of the learned Judges The question is whether by depriving the private operators of their right to run buses on certain routes and by deciding to run the routes itself the <ORG> acquired the right which was of the petitioners To me it appears that it could not be said that there was by the <ORG> any acquisition of the right which was formerly of the petitioners whether such right was VOl This right of the petitioners has in no way been vested in the <ORG> inasmuch as the <ORG> always had an equal right with the petitioners to run their buses on these routes The <ORG> it is pointed out has an undoubted right to run buses of its own on the public thoroughfares and they do not stand on the rights of the petitioners We think therefore that in these circumstances the legislation does conflict with the provision of article of the Constitution and as the requirements of that clause have not been complied with it should be held to be invalid on that ground The next point that requires consideration is whether the Act or any of its provisions are discriminatory in their character and conflict with the rule of equal protection embodied in article of the Constitution Mr <NAME> has raised a two fold contention on this point He has argued in the first place that no discrimination could be made in favour of the <ORG> as against private individuals in the matter of carrying on the business of plying buses for hire on public roads No rules are laid down to regulate the choice of the <ORG> in such cases The <ORG> has always the power to make classification and all that is necessary is that the classification should not be arbitrary but must bear a reasonable Appendix relation to the object which the legislation has in view There is no doubt that classification is inherent in the concept of a monopoly and if the object of legislation is to create monopoly in favour of the <ORG> with regard to a particular business obviously the <ORG> cannot but be differentiated from ordinary citizens and placed in a separate category so far as the running of the business is concerned and this classification would have a perfectly rational relation to the object of the statute In the last century when the laissez faire doctrine held the field the primary function of a <ORG> was considered to be maintenance of law and order and all other activities were left to private competitors Section of the Act authorises <ORG> to declare that the road transport service in general or on particular routes should be run and operated by <ORG> exclusively or by <ORG> in conjunction with railway or partly by <ORG> and partly by others in accordance with the provisions of the Act The whole question is how is the last part of the section to be implemented and carried out If the <ORG> can choose any and every person it likes for the purpose of being associated with the transport service and there are no rules to guide its discretion plainly the provision would offend against article of the Constitution <ORG> has negatived the contention of the appellants on this point primarily on the ground that article of the Constitution has no application to the present case What is said is that article provides safeguards for carrying on trade as a whole as distinguished from the rights of an individual to carry it on In other words this article is concerned with the passage of commodities or persons either within or outside the <ORG> frontiers but not directly with individuals carrying on the commerce or trade The right of individuals it is said is dealt with under article of the Constitution and the two articles have been framed in order to secure two different objects We would only desire to indicate the contentions that have been or could be raised upon this point and the different views that are possible to be taken in respect to them so that the <ORG> might take these matters into consideration if and when they think of legislating on this subject <ORG> trade is concerned adopts almost the same language as article of our Constitution it has been definitely held by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <ORG> supra that the rights of individuals do come within the purview of the section It is true as Lord <NAME> observed that section does not create any new juristic rights but it does give the citizens of the <ORG> or the <ORG> as the case may be the right to ignore and if necessary to call on the judicial power to help him to resist legislative or executive actions which offend against the section The question of reasonable restrictions could not also arise in this case as the bill was not introduced with the previous sanction of the President as required by the proviso to section It may be argued that freedom of trade does not as Lord <NAME> observed in the <ORG> case referred to above mean unrestricted or unrestrained freedom and that regulation of trade is quite compatible with its freedom As against this it may be pointed out that the Constitution itself has provided in articles and how reasonable restrictions could be imposed upon freedom of trade and commerce and it would not be proper to hold that restrictions can be imposed aliunde these provisions in the Constitution One material thing to consider in this connection would be that although the Constitution was amended in by insertion of an additional clause in article by which State monopoly in regard to trade or business was taken out of the purview of article of the Constitution yet no such addition was made in article or article of the Constitution and article as it stands guarantees freedom of trade commerce and intercourse subject only to Part XIII of the Constitution and not the other parts of the Constitution including that dealing with fundamental rights The Australian Constitution indeed has no provision like article of the Indian Constitution and it is certainly an arguable point as to whether the rights of individuals alone are dealt with in article of the Constitution leaving the freedom of trade and commerce meaning by that expression only the free passage of persons and goods within or without a <ORG> to be dealt with under article and the following articles The result is that in our opinion the appeals should be allowed and the judgment of <ORG> set aside A writ in the nature of mandamus shall issue against the respondents in these appeals restraining them from enforcing the provisions of the State Road Transport Act against the appellants or the men working under them
