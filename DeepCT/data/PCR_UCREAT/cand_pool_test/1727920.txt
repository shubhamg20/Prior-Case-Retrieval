HEADNOTE The proviso to i of the Sales Tax Act excludes from the term turnover proceeds of sale of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by a person on any land in which he has interest Almost every kind of agricultural produce has to undergo some kind of processing or treatment by the agriculturist himself either on the farm or elsewhere in order to make it non perishable transportable and marketable The processes applied were all within the region of minimal processes and at no point of time they crossed that limit and robbed the leaves of their character of being and continuing to be agricultural produce The stand taken on his behalf before the taxing authorities was that the tea leaves sold by the respondent are agricultural produce grown by himself and therefore the sales were not exigible to sales tax The definition of turnover given in section i of the Act at the relevant time stood as follows Turnover means the aggregate amount for which goods are supplied or distributed by way of sale or are sold or the aggregate amount for which goods are bought whichever is greater by a dealer either directly or through another on his account or on account of others whether for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration Provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise or poultry or dairy products from fowls or animals kept by him shall be excluded from his turnover The above proviso was meant to exempt an agriculturist or a horticulturist from the charge of sales tax in respect of his agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself in his land in which he has an interest of the kind mentioned in the proviso The short question which falls for our determination therefore is whether the assessee transactions of sale came within the ambit of the proviso They are often purchased by big tea concerns from the owners of the gardens and after processing and packing them they the concerns sell them in the market The question for consideration is whether on the findings aforesaid it can be justifiably held in law that the leaves lost their character of being an agricultural produce and became something different It should be remembered that almost every kind of agricultural produce has to undergo some kind of processing or treatment by the agriculturist himself in his farm or elsewhere in order to bring them to a condition of non perishability and to make them transportable and marketable Largely the inference to be drawn from the primary facts of processing one may say will be an inference of fact In my opinion all the six processes enumerated above from the primary findings of fact recorded in the order of <ORG> were necessary for the purpose of saving the tea leaves from perishing making them fit for transporting and marketing them It would thus be seen that the tea leaves as plucked have got to pass through stages of processing of one kind or the other in order to make them fit for human consumption as in the case of paddy and many other commodities dehusking in the case of former and some other kind of process in regard to the latter has got to be done in order to make them marketable and fit for consumption It excludes from any tax liability under the Act sale of agricultural and horticultural produce the primary condition to be satisfied being that it must be produce of the land which either belongs to the seller or of the land in which he has an interest as specified by section i There are two decisions of <ORG> given in relation to the question of sugarcane being converted into jaggery In the former case it was observed at page It is true that gur cannot be regarded as an agricultural produce grown on land It appears to me that this case has gone a bit too far and on an appropriate occasion it may require further consideration He had himself applied some indigenous and crude manufacturing process in order to enable him to sell his tea in the market In such a situation I have no difficulty in holding that the sale was of his agricultural produce On that footing by interpretation of the rule it was held that only excise duty paid on the goods sold by the assessee is deductible from the gross turnover and not the excise duty paid on raw tobacco
