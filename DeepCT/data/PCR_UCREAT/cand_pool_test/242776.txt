The suit that has given rise to this appeal relates to certain lands lying in the town of Madura in the Madras Presidency which admittedly belong to an old math situated within the Mysore State The origin development and raison etre of these maths have been discussed in a number of cases decided in <ORG> to some of which their Lordships propose to refer in the course of this judgment In one <NAME> was the matathipathi and he on March of that year granted to the nd plaintiff a near relative a permanent lease of the lands in the suit on a small quit rent of Rs In the nd plaintiff sub leased the lands to the st and nd defendants for a period of ten years It is in evidence and so far as appears from the judgments of the two Courts in India does not appear to be contradicted that it was only in that the representative of the <ORG> acting under the power granted by the matathipathi became aware of the transaction of under which the plaintiffs claim title The plaintiffs are and were at the time they brought their suit on March in <ORG> of Madura admittedly out of possession He contends says the learned judge that the plaint property is trust property set apart for the worship of the titular deity of the <ORG> that the head of the <ORG> is a trustee merely and that the permanent lease to second plaintiff is an alienation of <ORG> property and that th defendant at this distance of time could possibly have no right to such property The alienation being ab initito void the th defendant had no right to plaint property as he succeeded only in and first plaintiff had perfected his title by adverse possession for over twelve years They deal first with the question of justifiable necessity which they decide against the plaintiffs They say there is no doubt that the head of a math cannot in the absence of necessity bind his successors in office by a permanent lease at a fixed rent for all time And then add There is no allegation much less proof of any such necessity The evidence does not support this contention and it has been found against in the lower Court They thus concur with the first <ORG> that there was no specific trust which was the foundation of the plaintiff case In each there are well recognized rules relating to their religious and charitable institutions It is also to be remembered that a trust in the sense in which the expression is used in English law is unknown in the Hindu system pure and simple <NAME> Hindu Law In almost every case he is given the right to a part of the usufruct the mode of enjoyment and the amount of the usufruct depending again on usage and custom It was in view of this fundamental difference between the juridical conceptions on which the English law relating to trusts is based and those which form the foundations of the Hindu and the Mahommedan systems that <ORG> in enacting the Indian Trusts Act II of deliberately exempted from its scope the rules of law applicable to wakf and Hindu religious endowments Section of that Act after declaring when it was to come into force and the areas over which it should extend in the first instance lays down but nothing herein contained affects the rules of Mahommedan law as to wakf or the mutual relations of the members of an undivided family as determined by any customary or personal law or applies to public or private religious or charitable endowments Section of the Act gives a definition of the word trust in terms familiar to English lawyers With this object Act XX of was enacted a system of Committees was devised to which were transferred the powers vested in <ORG> for the appointment of managers trustees and superintendents rules were enacted to ensure proper management and to empower the superior court in the district to take cognizance of allegations of misfeasance against the managing authority Article of Schedule I to the Indian Limitation Act IX of is in these terms To recover possession of immoveable property conveyed or bequeathed in trust or mortgaged and afterwards transferred by the trustee or mortgagee for valuable consideration the period prescribed for the institution of the suit is twelve years from the date of transfer It clearly shows that the article refers to cases of specific trust and relates to property conveyed in trust the position of the superior in relation to the properties of the math was laid down in terms which have an important bearing on the present case It is in a certain sense trust property it is devoted to the maintenance of the establishment but the superior has large dominion over it and is not accountable for its management nor for the expenditure of the income provided he does not apply it to any purpose other than what may fairly be regarded as in furtherance of the objects of the institution In that case the learned judges after an elaborate examination of English institutions which they conceived to be analogous to Hindu maths came to the conclusion that whilst a dharmakarta of a temple who has specific duties to perform might be regarded as a trustee the superior of a math is not a trustee but a life tenant The officiating Chief Justice expressed his opinion in the following terms I think then that it cannot be predicated of the head of a math as such that he holds the properties constituting its endowments as a life tenant or as a trustee He may leave it to accumulate The facts which gave rise to the litigation were almost identical with the present case before their Lordships with this difference that the suit there was brought by the head of the math to recover possession of the leased properties <NAME> stated thus the question for determination The principal question a question which arises in both the appeals is whether the suit is barred by limitation It is conceded for the appellants that the lease is in excess of the powers of the matathipathi and their contention is that the suit is barred because limitation must run from the date of the alienation in the lease being void or at the latest from the death of <NAME> in The learned judges held in substance that there was no specific trust that the properties were given or endowed generally for the performance of the worship of the deities in the math and other attendant duties and for the support of the superior and his disciples that a lease granted by him was valid for his life and if adopted by his successor would enure during his term of office but neither the original alienation nor the subsequent adoption would create a bar by adverse possession But there are some others respecting the powers of the managers of religious institutions generally The defence was limitation running from the date of alienation But from the long lapse of time between the alienation and the challenge of its validity coupled with other circumstances the learned judges came to the conclusion that necessity may reasonably be presumed The first finding was strongly challenged by the plaintiff counsel on second appeal The pith of the judgment consists in the following words We have then here a suit to recover possession of immoveable property conveyed in trust and afterwards purchased from the trustee for a valuable consideration With respect to it they say as follows In further support of this conclusion we would also refer to the already cited case of St We propose to refer to that case in some detail as it probably is not within the reach of most <ORG> in this Presidency Speaking with respect it seems to their Lordships that the distinction between a specific trust and a trust for general pious or religious purposes under the Hindu and Mahommedan law was overlooked and the case was decided on analogies drawn from English law inapplicable in the main to Hindu and Mahommedan institutions The case fell within the principle of <NAME> case I Mad Ordinarily speaking the sajjadanishin has a larger right in the surplus income than a mutawalli for so long as he does not spend it in wicked living or in objects wholly alien to his office he like the mahant of a Hindu math has full power of disposition over it One judge held that the suit was barred either under Article or art In the judgment of <ORG> the words shebait and trustee are used as synonymous and convertible terms the expression is always shebait or trustee There is no allegation that there were any special circumstances of necessity in this case to justify the grant of the pottah of which on the most favourable construction enured only for the lifetime of the grantor <NAME> who died in or of the pottah of which at best could only be deemed operative during the lifetime of <NAME> who died in The question came up again for consideration by the <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> I A The suit was instituted by the head of a math to recover possession of certain land which formed part of the endowment of a Hindu temple attached to the math and had been granted by his predecessor to the defendant by a perpetual rent free lease in consideration of a small sum of money paid at the time It is contended that the second plaintiff acquired the title he is seeking to establish by twelve years adverse possession under Article That article declares that for a suit for possession of immoveable property or any interest therein not hereby i by the schedule otherwise specially provided for the period of limitation is twelve years from the date when the possession of the defendant became adverse to the plaintiff There is one other point which deserves notice Certain persons to whom the second plaintiff had sub leased the lauds for ten years thereupon obtained from the <ORG> during the currency of their term a lease for seventeen years For the foregoing reasons their Lordships are of opinion that neither Article nor Article applies to this case that the plaintiffs have acquired no title under either of those articles that the judgment and decree of <ORG> must therefore be reversed and the order of the Subordinate Judge dismissing the suit restored with costs here and of the appellate Court Their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly
