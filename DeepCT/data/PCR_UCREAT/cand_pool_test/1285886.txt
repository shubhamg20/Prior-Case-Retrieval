An alternative charge under Section read with Sections and I <NAME> and <NAME> were convicted under Section read with Section I and each of them was sentenced to transportation for life Against their convictions and sentences the appellants preferred appeals to <ORG> at Nagpur It confirmed the conviction of <NAME> and <NAME> under Section read with Section I and maintained the sentence of transportation for life passed against them He was followed by the other three to whom he subsequently reported that <NAME> had told him that he would see him on the following morning <NAME> then hired <NAME> tonga and he and his companions went to a place on the main road where <NAME> was expected to pass on his way home from the meeting It did not accept the evidence that it was <NAME> who fired the shots which resulted in injuries on the person of <NAME> We are constrained to say that the approver evidence and the evidence of <NAME> having been rejected there was no justification for the conclusion of <ORG> that this was undoubtedly a case in which there was a conspiracy of the character contemplated by Sub section of Section particularly when the <ORG> had not appealed against the acquittal order There was nothing in the dying declarations justifying the above conclusion The prosecution produced three witnesses to prove that it was <NAME> who fired the pistol shots which hit <NAME> and which eventually resulted in his death The learned sessions judge held that <NAME> and <NAME> witnessed the shooting and that though <NAME> could not identify either the assailant or his one companion there was no reason to disbelieve <NAME> when he said that he identified <NAME> as the person who actually shot <NAME> It was in view of this finding that <NAME> was held guilty under Section while the other appellants were held guilty under Section read with Section I <ORG> on appeal disbelieved the evidence of <NAME> and <NAME> in its entirety It was said that the testimony of <NAME> even to the limited extent to which the learned trial judge found it acceptable was not worthy of reliance and that it was introduced with the object of showing that the shots had been fired by <NAME> and that his description of what happened emanated from his imagination The evidence of both these witnesses having been disbelieved it was concluded that there was no material on the record from which it could be held proved that it was <NAME> who was responsible for firing the shots which hit <NAME> It was conceded by the learned counsel appearing for the <ORG> that the conviction of the appellants rests only on the evidence furnished by the dying declarations made by the deceased on different occasions and that if these dying declarations are held unreliable or it is considered unsafe to convict the appellants on their basis alone then the decision of <ORG> could not be sustained and has to be reversed Dr <NAME> for the appellants contended with great force that the dying declarations on which <ORG> had placed reliance were not only unreliable but were in fact untrue and it was unsafe to base the convictions of the appellants on the testimony furnished by these declarations It is settled law that it is not safe to convict an accused person merely on the evidence furnished by a dying declaration without further corroboration because such a statement is not made on oath and is not subject to cross examination and because the maker of it might be mentally and physically in a state of confusion and might well be drawing upon his imagination while he was making the declaration gave evidence as regards a statement alleged to have been made to them by the deceased when they came to his help and took him in a tonga to the hospital He said as follows On reaching <NAME> I asked him what happened to him and where he had gone He replied that he was returning after the meeting from the <NAME> and that he was treacherously shot by <NAME> In cross examination he admitted having made the statement Ex The third witness <NAME> deposed as follows <NAME> asked <NAME> who had hit <NAME> and <NAME> said that Mama <NAME> had shot him with a bullet and he named the accused Mama <NAME> Purushotham and <NAME> as having been present together at the shooting In cross examination he admitted having made the statement Ex In our opinion unless one is certain about the exact words uttered by a deceased no reliance can be placed on verbal statements of witnesses and such oral declarations made by a deceased I asked him what happened In the first information report there is a post script after the words Same is correctly recorded in these terms Sunder had stated on seeing by means of a torch that all the four individuals were seen It was contended by Dr <NAME> that this sentence was a subsequent interpolation in the report and that there was no satisfactory evidence that <NAME> was in possession of a torch at the time that he was fired at It was only on the th that <NAME> gave it to the police by saying that it had been given to him by some person who was not produced as a witness Dr <NAME> argued that the incident took place at about on a dark and cloudy night and that the firing was sudden and that in this situation it was not likely that <NAME> identified his assailants particularly when the shots were not being fired from the front After hearing Dr <NAME> for the appellants and Mr <NAME> for <ORG> we have reached the conclusion that in view of the sudden firing that took place at that hour of the night it was not possible for <NAME> to clearly identify the persons who had fired the shots at him that in all likelihood the names he mentioned at the time were the result of the reaction on his mind on the occasion It is difficult to conceive how four persons could shoot him by means of a single pistol and how he could have actually seen the persons who fired at him with a single pistol He merely thought that nobody else but these four persons could have fired at him and he therefore made this statement in the vague form in which it is recorded This answer suggests that <NAME> appellant took him to Nakal Ganj and Struck him in front of the chudiwala i at the place where the occurrence took place There is no warrant for such a suggestion There is no evidence whatsoever of any premeditation or of a prearranged plan by the assailants of <NAME> <NAME> The result is that there is no satisfactory evidence for concluding positively that the three appellants were responsible for the murder of <NAME> though it may be that they were behind this murder At best the matter is in doubt and they are entitled to the benefit of that doubt
