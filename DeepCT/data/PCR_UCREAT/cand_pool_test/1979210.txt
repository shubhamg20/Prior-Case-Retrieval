It is further alleged that there are about such workmen who were engaged in such activities that in keeping with the past practice the respondent had reasons to apprehend that the moment any of the workmen completes months of service the services of such employee would be terminated It is submitted on behalf of the respondent that the recruitment of such workmen is done by the appellant and upon selection such workmen are sent to appellants doctor for medical check up They claimed that they are the workmen working under the direct supervision control and direction of the officers of the appellant who assign work to them and they are granted leave by the officers of the appellant and are also paid by the appellant that the company is the real employer apart from being the employees because of statutory obligation of the company to employ such workmen that however the appellant denied the relationship of employer employee from various stages that such denial of relationship is only to deprive the workmen of permanency in the company and payment of wages as are applicable to the permanent workmen of the company that the company has denied this relationship as employer and thus this cause of action has arisen in this complaint that the appellant has engaged in unfair labour practices in terms of Act and it be directed to cease and desist from continuing to do so The appellant contended that since it is engaged in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products for which a high degree of cleanliness and hygiene is required to be maintained and therefore it is necessary for the company to seek the services of the specialised agencies and this practice has been in vogue for several years and in the last eight year such services have been obtained from three different agency and they are i <ORG> ii <ORG> and iii <ORG> The appellant denied that it interviewed and selected the persons to be employed by the second respondent but it was expected that persons employed by the second respondent were subjected to periodical medical examination in order to comply with the statutory requirements for maintaining proper hygiene integrity of the manufacturing processes of the company It was submitted that the second respondent pays wages to those employees in accordance with or more than the minimum wages Whether this <ORG> has jurisdiction to entertain the complaint <ORG> after elaborate consideration of the pleadings and evidence on record came to the following JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ conclusion JJJJJJJJJJJ It can be seen from the evidence on record and the documents filed by the parties that different contractors engaged by the first respondent company and these workmen had never worked in the first respondent company but they had worked through second respondent From these documents it is crystal clear that it is a separate entity and there is a contract between the first respondent and second respondent in respect of sweeping and cleaning in the company premises In the writ petition <ORG> of <ORG> took a different view of the matter and allowed the complaint In that case the complaint of the <ORG> was that workmen who were working in one of the canteens of the respondent company were not given the service conditions as were available to the other workmen of the company and there was also a threat of termination of their services The observation of this Court that it is open to the workmen to raise an appropriate industrial dispute in that behalf if they are entitled to do so has to be understood in the light of the observations of this Court made earlier On that basis <ORG> proceeded to further consider the matter and reversed the findings recorded by the two courts and gave a finding that the workmen in question are the workmen of the appellant company The industrial tribunal also gave consequential directions to the <ORG> for payment of wages etc The contention put forth before this Court was that after coming into force of the Act it is only the appropriate Government which can abolish the contact labour system after consulting the Central <ORG> or the State <ORG> as the case may be and no other authority including the industrial tribunal has jurisdiction either to entertain such dispute or to direct abolition of the contract labour system and neither the appropriate Government nor the industrial tribunal has the power to direct that the workmen of the erstwhile contractor should be deemed to be the workmen of the <ORG> contract covered by But one thing is clear if the employees are working under a the Contract Labour Regulation Abolition Act then it is clear that the labour court or the industrial adjudicating authorities cannot have any jurisdiction to deal with the matter as it falls within the province of an appropriate Government to abolish the same If under other provisions of the Act the industrial tribunal or the labour court has no jurisdiction to deal with a particular aspect of the matter Section does not give such power to it In the cases at hand before us whether a workmen can be stated to be the workman of the appellant establishment or not it must be held that the contract between the appellant and the second respondent is a camouflage or bogus and upon such a decision it can be held that the workman in question is an employee of the appellant establishment In determining whether the wages had been appropriately paid or not the authority under the Payment of Wages Act was held to have jurisdiction to decide the incidental question of whether the applicant was in the employment of the railway administration during the relevant period Therefore we are afraid that the contention advanced very ably by <NAME> on behalf of the respondents cannot be accepted The correct interpretation of these decisions will lead to the result which we have stated in the course of this order In the view we have taken on the question of jurisdiction of <ORG> under the Act the decision given by <ORG> on other questions need not be considered In the circumstances we allow this appeal set aside the order of <ORG> and restore that of the industrial court affirming the order of the labour court
