In exercise of this power <ORG> issued the Imports Control Order and other orders setting out the policy governing the grant of import and export licences The respondents made representations to <ORG> but the <ORG> confirmed the orders The respondents then filed writ petitions in <ORG> <ORG> set aside the orders of the Textile Commissioner and <ORG> and held that the respondents were entitled under the Scheme to obtain import licences for an amount equal to of the value of their exports unless it was found on enquiry duly made under el In appeal to this Court it was contended that the Export Promotion Scheme was administrative in character that it contained mere executive instructions issued by <ORG> to the Textile Commissioner and created no enforceable rights in the exporters who exported their goods in pursuance of the Scheme and that it imposed no obligations upon the <ORG> to issue import certificates that the textile Commissioner was the sole judge of the reasons for reducing the import entitlement that the Scheme did not require him to set out the reasons for reducing the import entitlement or to give an opportunity to the respondents because the exercise of the power to reduce conferred upon the Textile Commissioner was not limited by the terms of el of the Scheme and was not except on proof of mala fide exercise open to judicial review that the <ORG> on grounds of executive necessity was the sole judge of the validity of its action in matters relating to import and export policy because the policy depended upon the economic climate and other related matters and had to be in its very nature flexible with power in the <ORG> to modify or adjust it as the altered circumstances necessitate and that if the <ORG> is held bound by every representation made by it regarding its intentions the <ORG> would be held bound by a contractual obligation even though no formal contract in the manner required by Art HELD The <ORG> is not exempt from liability to carry out the representation made by it as to its future conduct and it cannot on some undefined and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency fail to carry out the promise solemnly made by it nor claim to be the judge of its own obligation to the citizen on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances in which the obligation had arisen But even if it is only executive or administrative in character courts have power in appropriate cases to compel performance of the obligations imposed by the Schemes upon the departmental authorities But where as in the present case the Scheme provided for the rant of import entitlement of the value and not up to the value of the goods exported the Textile Commissioner should in the ordinary course grant import certificate for the full value of the goods exported he may reduce that mount only after the enquiry contemplated by cl of the Scheme that is enquiry made after giving an opportunity to the respondents and held in a manner consistent with the rules of natural justice and the basic concepts of justice and fair play The respondents were not seeking to enforce any contractual right they are seeking to enforce compliance with the obligation which is laid upon the Textile Commissioner by the terms of the Scheme The claim of the respondents was rounded upon the equity which arose in their favour as a result of the representation made on behalf of the <ORG> in the Export Promotion Scheme and the action taken by the respondents acting upon the representation Even though the case did not fall within the terms of of the Evidence Act it was still open to a party who had acted on a representation made by the <ORG> to claim that the <ORG> should be hound to carry out the promise made by it though not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by the Constitution The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The facts which give rise to Appeal No of are these The Textile Commissioner published on October a scheme called the Export Promotion Scheme providing incentives to exporters of woollen goods Representations made by the respondents to the Deputy Director and to <ORG> that they be granted Import Entitlement Certificate for the full value of the goods exported failed to produce any response <ORG> held that the Export Promotion Scheme specifically provided for granting certificates to import materials of the value equal to of the value of the goods exported and the respondents were entitled to obtain import licences for an amount equal to of the value unless it was found on enquiry duly made under el The Imports and Exports Control Act of was enacted on March with the object of enabling <ORG> to continue to exercise the power to prohibit restrict or otherwise control imports and exports which had till then been controlled by orders issued in exercise of the powers conferred by of the Defence of India Rules as extended by the Emergency Provisions Continuance Ordinance of By of that Act it was provided The Central Government may by order published in the Official Gazette make provisions for prohibiting restricting or otherwise controlling in all cases or in specified classes of cases and subject to such exceptions if any as may be made by or under the order a the import export carriage coastwise or shipment as ships stores of goods of any specified description the bringing into any port or place in India of goods of any specified description intended to be taken out of India without being removed from the ship or conveyance in which they are being carried By the orders made under of the Defence of India Rules or under that rule as continued in force by the Emergency Provisions Continuance Ordinance and in force immediately before the commencement of the Act were insofar as they were not inconsistent with the provisions of the Act to continue to remain in force and to be deemed to have been made under the Act By paragraph of the Order it was enacted that Save as otherwise provided in this Order no person shall import any goods of the description specified in Schedule I except under and in accordance with a licence or a customs clearance permit granted by the Central Government or by any officer specified in If in any case it is found that the goods imported under a licence do not conform to the description given in the licence or were shipped prior to the date of issue of the licence under which they are claimed to have been imported then without prejudice to any action that may be taken against the licence under the Customs Act in respect of the said importation the licence may be treated as having been utilised for importing the said goods By paragraph of the notification published in the Gazette Extraordinary dated December it was declared that in certain items there was direct and intimate inter relationship between imports and exports and since the ability to export some of those manufactured goods depended largely on the facility with which the exporter or the manufacturer could procure the basic raw materials required in the manufacture a scheme had been devised with a view to promote export of such goods for the grant of special import licences to replace the imported raw material content of the exported product and to provide an inducement for larger exports It was urged on behalf of <ORG> that the Export Promotion Scheme was administrative in character and the recital therein that the exporters will be entitled to import certificates equal to of the value of the exports was a mere instruction issued by <ORG> to the Textile It was stated in the affidavit of <ORG> that it was not a necessary requirement of the Scheme to set out the reasons for reducing the import entitlement that under paragraph to Appendix of the Import Trade Control Policy for the year April to March the licensing authority was authorised to refuse the issue of a licence or to reduce the value of the licence to such amount as he deemed fit in cases where he considered the value of the goods exported was over invoiced and the Trade Notice having been issued in exercise of the executive power of the State attack by the respondents on the ground set up was completely misplaced and without any requirement of goods of foreign origin for internal consumption economic climate in the country and other related matters and has in its very nature to be flexible and on that account the power of the <ORG> to modify or adjust it as the altered circumstances necessitate cannot be restricted on the ground that promises made by the <ORG> in different situations are not carried out however amoral that claim may appear to be According to Counsel the <ORG> is the sole judge of the validity of its actions in matters relating to Import and Export Policy and the citizens who have acted on the representations of the <ORG> have only such rights as the <ORG> in its wisdom chooses to recognise or accept at any given time He relied in support of his submission upon the doctrine of executive necessity on which <NAME> relied in <ORG> The King In that case during the First World War certain neutral shipowners obtained an undertaking from the British <ORG> that if the shipowners sent a particular ship to the United Kingdom with a specified cargo she shall not be detained On a petition of right for damages for breach of contract it was held that the <ORG> undertaking was not enforceable in a Court of law it not being within the competence of the <ORG> to make a contract which would have the effect of limiting its power of executive action in the future I have not to consider whether there was anything of which complaint might be made outside a Court whether that is to say what the Government did was morally wrong or arbitrary that would be altogether outside my province My main reason for so thinking is that it is not competent for the <ORG> to fetter its future executive action which must necessarily be determined by the needs of the community when the question arises It cannot by contract hamper its freedom of action in matters which concern the welfare of the <ORG> It may also be noticed that before <NAME> the applicants Claimed enforcement of a contract against the <ORG> and the learned Judge came to the conclusion that there was no contract and no damages could be awarded Nor can the <ORG> escape by praying in aid the doctrine of executive necessity that is the doctrine that the <ORG> cannot bind itself so That doctrine was propounded by <ORG> in <ORG> The King but it was unnecessary for the decision because the statement there was not a promise which was intended to be binding but only an expression of intention <NAME> seems to have been influenced by the cases on the right of the <ORG> to dismiss its servants at pleasure but those cases must now all be read in the light of the judgment of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> The King A It only avails the <ORG> where there is an implied term to that effect or that is the true meaning of the contract <NAME> I was dealing with a case of a serving army officer who wrote to <ORG> regarding a disability and received a reply that his disability had been accepted as attributable to military service The defence of executive necessity was not relied upon in the present case in the affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> We are unable to accede to the contention that the executive necessity releases the <ORG> from honouring its solemn promises relying on which citizens have acted to their detriment Under our constitutional set up no person may be deprived of his fight or liberty except in due course of and by authority of law if a member of the executive seeks to deprive a citizen of his right or liberty otherwise than in exercise of power derived from the law common or statute the <ORG> will be competent to and indeed would be bound to protect the rights of the aggrieved citizen Counsel for the respondents submitted that the Export Promotion <ORG> published by the <ORG> under paragraph of the <ORG> Notification dated December must be deemed to be issued under of the Imports and Exports Control Act since the <ORG> have been published in <ORG> and contain general provisions relating to the grant of licences and impose restrictions upon the rights of citizens to carry on business in certain commodities Being general provisions restricting the rights of citizens to carry on business in certain commodities the <ORG> were it was said legislative in character and the obligations imposed or the sanctions prescribed thereby must on that account be deemed to be enforceable by command of the <ORG> The Imports and Exports Control Act authorises the Central <ORG> to make provisions prohibiting restricting or otherwise controlling import export carriage etc There is no pattern of order or logical sequence in the policy statement it is a jumble of executive instructions and matters which impose several restrictions upon the rights of citizens Some of the provisions which impose restrictions upon citizens in the exercise of their right to carry on trade without statutory limits may be open to serious objection but we do not find it necessary to embark upon an enquiry whether the provision which authorises the issue of import entitlement certificate for the full value of the goods exported is legislative in character They thereafter filed a writ petition in this Court for an order that the import certificate had been arbitrarily reduced and thereby the fundamental right of the exporter to carry on trade in artsilk was infringed The Court held in that case that the <ORG> had the right to impose control in the larger interest of the general public on imports and to make orders in exercise of the powers conferred by the Imports and Exports Control Act providing for imposition of restrictions by permitting import of certain goods only in accordance with the licences or customs permits granted by <ORG> Since in that case the power granted to the licensing authority was to grant licences only upto the maximum specified in cl of Appendix It was also observed that it did not impose an obligation upon the controller enforceable at the instance of the exporter to issue a licence for the amount subject to the maximum prescribed claimed by the exporter and since the order of the Controller granting a licence only for of the value of goods exported did not infringe the fundamental right of the exporter under Art But the Court observed The licensing authority would normally issue an import licence for of the value of the goods exported but having regard to special considerations such as difficult foreign exchange position or other matters which have a bearing on the general interest of the <ORG> import licences for a smaller percentage may be granted to the exporters Opinion was therefore expressed that if the power granted to the Controller was arbitrarily exercised it was open to judicial review The exporter was given a right to make a representation and to be heard before the order was passed to his prejudice An exporter claimed that he had exported goods of the value exceeding Rs in accordance with the provisions of the Special Exports Promotion Scheme and this Court held that even though there was no absolute right to the grant of an import licence for the maximum amount prescribed the Controller could impose restrictions if special considerations such as difficult foreign exchange position or other matters which have a bearing on the general interest of the <ORG> warranted but the discretion to be exercised by him was to be reasonable and not arbitrary On a consideration of the affidavit filed and the power given to the Controller to grant licences upto and not of the value of the goods exported it was held that no case of arbitrary exercise of the power to reduce the import entitlement was made out Reduction in the amount of import certificate may be justified on the ground of misconduct of the exporter in relation to the goods exported or on special considerations such as difficult foreign exchange position or other matters which have a bearing on the general interests of the <ORG> He also applied to the Joint Chief Controller who was the licensing authority for grant of a licence for the period January to June but in the application he could not mention his share in the quota right because the Chief Controller had not before the date of the application approved of the division of the quota right After expiry of the period for which the licence was to be issued the Chief Controller informed the applicant that instructions had been issued to the Joint Chief Controller about the division of the quota right The applicant succeeded in obtaining an order from <ORG> directing the Joint Chief Controller to grant a licence It was held that the licensing authority had to deal with the application for a licence on the footing that the approved quota was given to the partners of the dissolved firm from the date of dissolution and the agreement divide and could not refuse the licence solely on the ground that the approval of the Chief Controller was granted after the expiry of the import period licensing authority to issue a licence for the period January to June even if there was a change in the import policy of <ORG> with respect to those articles But the authority vested in <ORG> by the rules even though executive in character was from its nature an authority to deal with the matter in manner consonant with the basic concept of justice and fair play if he made an order which was not consonant with the basic concept In dealing with a representation made by the respondent <ORG> also acted similarly and declined either to make available the evidence on which <ORG> had acted or to give a hearing to the respondents The Textile Commissioner and <ORG> did not purport to act in exercise of the power under cl of the Scheme they have sought to support the order on the plea that the subjective satisfaction of <ORG> is determinative of the extent of the import certificate which may be granted to the respondents It was somewhat faintly urged that if the <ORG> is held bound by every representation made by it regarding its intention when the exporters have acted in the manner they were invited to act the <ORG> would be held bound by a contractual obligation eve of the Constitution was executed and the exporter would be entitled to claim damages contrary to that provision for breach of the contract even though no formal written contract had been executed in the manner provided by that Article But the respondents are not seeking to enforce any contractual fight they are seeking to enforce compliance with the obligation which is laid upon <ORG> by the terms of the Scheme and we are of the view that even if the Scheme is executive in character the respondents who were aggrieved because of the failure to carry out the terms of the Scheme were entitled to seek resort to the Court and claim that the obligation imposed upon <ORG> by the Scheme be ordered to be carried out We hold that the claim of the respondents is appropriately rounded upon the equity which arises in their favour as a result of the representation made on behalf of <ORG> in the Export Promotion Scheme and the action taken by the respondents acting upon that representation under the belief that the <ORG> would carry out the representation made by it On the facts proved in this case no ground has been suggested before the Court for exempting the <ORG> from the equity arising out of the acts done by the exporters to their prejudice relying upon the representation In that case in answer to a requisition by <ORG> addressed to the Municipal Commissioner to remove certain fish and vegetable markets to facilitate the construction of an arterial road the Municipal Commissioner offered to remove the structures if the Government would agree to rent to the <ORG> other land mentioned in his letter at a nominal rent The Government accepted the suggestion and sanctioned the application of the Municipal Commissioner for a site for tabling and establishing the new markets The <ORG> declined to pay the rent and the Secretary of State for India filed a suit against the Municipal Commissioner for a declaration that the tenancy of the <ORG> created by Government Resolution of December stood determined and for an order to pay rent at the rate of Rs per annum It was urged before <ORG> that the events which had transpired had created an equity in favour of the <ORG> which afforded an answer to the claim of the Government to eject the <ORG> with which I am now dealing takes its origin from the jurisdiction assumed by <ORG> to intervene in the case of or to prevent fraud This case is in our judgment a clear authority that even though the case does not fall within the terms of of the Evidence Act it is still open to a party who has acted on a representation made by the <ORG> to claim that the <ORG> shall be bound to carry out the promise made by it even though the promise is not recorded in the form of a formal contract as required by the Constitution In <NAME> and others Secretary of <ORG> for India in Council and another the plaintiffs claimed title to a canal supplied with water from the Sutlej having been constructed at great expense by their predecessors for purposes of irrigation with the sanction and encouragement of the <ORG> partly on <ORG> lands and partly on the lands of private owners under arrangements with them When the Collector of Bombay sought to enhance the land revenue the <ORG> sued for a declaration that the order of assessment was ultra vires and that it was entitled to hold the land for ever without payment of any assessment <ORG> held that the Government had lost its right to assess the land in question because of the equity arising on the facts of the case in favour of the <ORG> and a limitation on the right of the Government to assess under of the Bombay City Land Revenue Act arose the <ORG> was not under the circumstances of the case entitled to assess land revenue on the land in question because the <ORG> had taken possession of the land in terms of the <ORG> resolution and had continued in such possession openly uninterruptedly and as of right for over years and had thereby acquired the limited title it had been prescribing for during the period the right to hold the land in perpetuity free of rent <NAME> observed that even if it be assumed that there was no representation in fact that the land was rent free at the time when it was given to the Municipality if there was a holding out of a promise that no rent will be charged in the future the <ORG> must be deemed in the circumstances of the case to have bound themselves to fulfill it and <ORG> must prevent the perpetration of a legal fraud <NAME> observed at Whether it is the equity recognised in <NAME> case or it is some other form of equity is not of much importance Courts must do justice by the promotion of honesty and good faith as far as it lies in their power Under our jurisprudence the Government is not exempt from liability to carry out the representation made by it as to its future conduct and it cannot on some undefined and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency fail to carry out the promise solemnly made by it nor claim to be the judge of its own obligation to the citizen on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances We agree with <ORG> that the impugned order passed by the Textile Commissioner and confirmed by <ORG> imposing cut in the import entitlement by the respondents should be set aside and quashed and that the Textile Commissioner and the Joint Chief Controller of Imports and Exports be directed to issue to the respondents import certificates for the total amount equal to of the value of the goods exported by them unless there is some decision which fails within cl of the Scheme in question The facts which give rise to But it is common ground that the report of the <ORG> was not made available to them and the Textile Commissioner before he passed the orders did not call for their explanations
