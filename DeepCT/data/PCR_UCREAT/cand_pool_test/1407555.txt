Section read with Section fell within the area which the <ORG> wanted the <ORG> to acquire A fresh Notification under Section read with Section of the Act proposing to acquire acres of land was promulgated on There was an understanding that upon acquisition out of the above land acres would be transferred to the <ORG> The matter was taken in appeal to this Court No award was passed in respect of the remaining lands The Court also noticed that there was unauthorized construction and encroachments but since the land vested in the <ORG> and possession was taken over no rights will acquire by such unauthorized construction and encroachments Declaration that land is required for a public purpose Subject to the provisions of Part VII of this Act when the appropriate Government is satisfied after considering the report if any made under Section A sub section that any particular land is needed for a public purpose or for a Company a declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such Government or of some officer duly authorized to declarations may be made from time to time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the same notification under section sub section irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or have been made wherever required under Section A sub section Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification under Section sub section i published after the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment and Validation Ordinance of but before the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment Act shall be made after the expiry of three years from the date of the publication of the notification or ii published after the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment Act shall be made after the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the notification Provided further that no such declaration shall be made unless the

all the persons known or believed to be interested in the land of whom or of whose claims he has information whether or not they have respectively appeared before him Provided that no award shall be made by the Collector under this sub section without the previous approval of the appropriate <ORG> or of such officer as the appropriate <ORG> may authorise in this behalf Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section if at any stage of the proceedings the Collector is satisfied that all the persons interested in the land who appeared before him have agreed in writing on the matters to be included in the award of the Collector in the form prescribed by rules made by the appropriate <ORG> he may without making further enquiry make an award according to the terms of such agreement In

be excluded In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate <ORG> si directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in Section sub section take possession of any land needed for public purpose XXX XXX XXX In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not be apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under Section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under section sub section Expect in the case provided for in Section the Government shall be at liberty to withdraw from the Acquisition of any land of which possession has not been taken Section states so in unmistakable terms Clearly section A can have no application to cases of acquisition under Section because the lands have already vested in the <ORG> and there is no provision in the said Act by which land statutorily vested in the <ORG> can revert to the owner It is signed by the District Land Acquisition officer Collector under the Act though the signature appears to be illegible dated <ORG> observed that the State is bound by the directions given by the <ORG> earlier in CWJC No that in the light of the aforesaid order of <ORG> proceedings dated was passed that all requisites of an award are mentioned in the said ordure and since there is substantial compliance it should be treated as an award <ORG> was also of the view that even a defective award which has provisions with the directions of the <ORG> and the provisions of law will not invite the wrath of Section A of the Act The reasoning of <ORG> that it has power to issue such directions under Article in a case where otherwise the conduct of the persons called for punishment in contempt appears to be justified The writ petition filed by the appellant in <ORG> was dismissed on the ground that it fact and the appellant had an alternate remedy Against the dismissal of the writ petition the appellant filed an appeal in this <ORG> on a certificate granted by <ORG> He also filed a suit wherein the same question was agitated which was the subject matter of the writ petition There may be extraordinarily situations or circumstances which may even warrant a different approach where the orders passed by the <ORG> are sought to be violated or thwarted with impunity The writ petition was filed by the <ORG> CWJC No praying for a direction to the respondents to give effect to the directions contained in the earlier judgment of this <ORG> in CWJC No dated and for other consequential or incidental reliefs They may be incidental or consequential to the main relief in giving effect to the earlier directions or orders of <ORG> In the Judgment dated rendered in CWJC No the <ORG> categorically held that non passing of the award will not nullify the acquisition the validity of the acquisition was upheld by <ORG> and the Supreme <ORG> and the encroachments or the unauthorized structures were put up by persons in the property at their own risk and it was further observed that once possession of the land was taken by the <ORG> the fact that the owner of the land entered upon the land will not obliterate the consequences of vesting and allowed the writ petition filed by the <ORG> and quashed the steps taken for derequisitioning of the land requested by the <ORG> and issued a writ of mandamus directing the Collector of Patna to prepare the award as expeditiously as possible Mr <NAME> senior counsel feebly raised the plea that the Government authorities did not take possession of a small portion of the land about acres and there is no award relating thereto and the proceedings regarding that portion of the land had lapsed In our view the proceedings dated is in substance an award passed in pursuance of the directions given by this Court in CWJC No Possession was taken of the entire land and the plea that possession of a small portion of the land was not taken is against the record see AIR SC at All the contentions urged on behalf of the appellants fail The appeals are wholly without merit and we dismiss them with costs At one point of time it was brought to the notice of the <ORG> that even the files relating to the acquisition of land are not traceable We therefore direct the State of Bihar its officials the authorities and other persons concerned who are seized of the subject matter of the instant land acquisition proceedings to complete the proceedings in the quickest possible time We further direct the appellants in these appeals to pay costs of Rs The appeals are dismissed with costs as aforesaid
