This appeal preferred against the judgment and decree of <ORG> dismissing the second appeal filed by the appellant raises certain basic questions concerning natural Justice in the context of disciplinary proceedings In March <NAME> went to the <ORG> and discovered that the amount paid by him to the respondent was not credited to his his father account Before ordering a regular oral enquiry the <ORG> had directed <NAME> and <NAME> to conduct a preliminary enquiry The respondent thereupon instituted a suit in the court of learned Sub Judge IInd Class <NAME> for a declaration that the order of removal is void and illegal and for a declaration that he continues to be in service with all consequential benefits <ORG> rejected all the grounds urged by the respondent in support of his case except one viz <ORG> found that in the above circumstances there was a clear violation of Regulation which has prejudicially affected the respondent defence The question is whether on the above facts it can be held that there is a violation of Regulation and whether the violation if any vitiates the enquiry Regulation insofar as is relevant reads thus a The inquiring authority shall where the officer does not admit all or any of the articles of charge furnish to such officer a list of documents by which and a list of witnesses by whom the articles The inquiring authority shall also record an order that the officer may for the purpose of preparing his defence i Inspect and take notes of the document listed within five days of the order or within such further time not exceeding five days as the inquiring authority may allow ii submit a list of documents and witnesses that he wants for enquiry From <ORG> judgment it appears that on June the respondent was given an opportunity of perusing and taking notes from the said documents and statements of witnesses and that the enquiry also commenced on that day So far as the documents are concerned the only right given to the delinquent officer by Regulation is to inspect and take notes and that has been done It is designed to provide an adequate opportunity to the delinquent office to cross examine the witnesses effectively and thereby defend himself properly It is relevant to note in this behalf that neither the enquiry officers report nor the judgment of <ORG> <ORG> or <ORG> say that the respondent had protested at the relevant time that he was denied of an adequate opportunity to cross examine the witnesses effectively or to defend himself properly on account of non supply of the statements of witnesses Moreover as pointed out above the examination of witnesses began long after the expiry of three days from the day on which the respondent was advised to and he did peruse the documents and statements of witnesses So far as the position obtaining under the Code of Civil Procedure and Code of Criminal Procedure is concerned there are specific provisions thereunder providing for such situation There is Section of the Code of Civil Procedure and Chapter It is not brought to our notice that the State Bank of Patiala Officers Service Regulation contains provision corresponding to Section or Section Does it mean that any and every violation of the regulations renders the enquiry and the punishment void or whether the principle underlying Section and Section But there may be any number of procedural provisions which stand on a different footing The several procedural provisions governing the disciplinary enquiries whether provided by rules made under the proviso to Article of the constitutions under regulations made by statutory bodies in exercise of the power conferred by a statute or for that matter by way of a statute are nothing but elaboration of the principles of natural justice and their several facets The first decision on this aspect is that of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> A and the oft quoted words are that of Lord <NAME> to wit Then there was considerable argument whether in the result the watch committee decision was void or merely voidable Time and time again in the cases I have cited it has been stated that a decision given without regard to the principles of natural justice is void and that was expressly decided in <NAME> <NAME> LR Ex I see no reason to doubt these authorities The body with the power to decide cannot lawfully proceed to make a decision until it has afforded to the person affected a proper opportunity to state his case We may now consider the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> The facts of this case are rather involved The Singapore Municipal Ordinance provided that in a case of misconduct which in the opinion of the head of the department merited dismissal the head of the department should outline the case to the president or the deputy president and hold an It is in this context it was observed that it is not open to an authority which has not given a notice or hearing to the affected person to say that even if it had given such an opportunity the affected person had nothing worthwhile to say or that the result would not have been different even if such a notice or hearing is given If the decision was to dismiss the employee the decision was to be conveyed by the head of the department to the employee who was given a right of appeal to <ORG> On appeals a de novo hearing was afforded to the appellants by <ORG> On the facts of the appeal before them <ORG> held in the first instance that at the stage of the deputy president asking questions and the head of the department supplying him information the principles of natural justice had no application Alternately they held that even if the said principles did apply even then it must be held that the said violation was cured by what happened before <ORG> i on appeal Since there was a re hearing before <ORG> and evidence was called de novo and also because no grievance was made with to the proceedings before <ORG> the invalidity arising from the violation of principles of natural justice at the earlier stage was cured This decision was referred with approval in by <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> A in the following words Their Lordships regard this as a decision that in the context namely one of regulations concerning establishments procedures justice can be held to be done if after all these procedures had been gone through the dismissed person has had a fair hearing and put his case Emphasis added <NAME> <NAME> was a case where the first contention of the plaintiff was that since the decision against him was arrived at in violation of the principle of natural justice it was void and no appeal lay against an order which was void Their Lordships opinion would be if it become necessary to fix upon one or other of these expressions that a decision made contrary to natural justice is void but that until it is so declared by a competent body or court it may have some effect or existence in law On the ground of overstaying in United Kingdom the appellant was given a notice proposing to deport him <ORG> and <ORG> upheld his plea holding that notwithstanding absence of fault by the <ORG> there had been a breach of the principle of audi alteram partem which constituted a fundamental flaw in the decision making since the fault lay entirely with the appellant solicitors there was a clear case for quashing the <ORG> decision <ORG> Lord Bridge observed a party to the dispute who has last the opportunity to have his case heard through the default of his own advisers to whom he has entrusted the conduct of the dispute on his behalf cannot complain that he has been the victim of the procedural impropriety or that natural justice has been denied to him In other words <ORG> was of the opinion that natural justice merely imposed standards of procedural fairness on the decision making authority and that natural justice does not demand that the person affected should actually receive a fair hearing Section of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms declares every one has the right to life liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the Principles of fundamental justice In Beare <ORG> of Canada while interpreting the words principles of fundamental justice said that it guarantees fair procedure but does not guarantee the most favourable procedure that can possibly be imagined where the concerned statute mandated that no resolution of <ORG> far the dismissal of a certificated teacher was to be valid unless notice of the motion for dismissal was sent to the teacher not less than three weeks previous to the meeting It was further found that the hearing to be afforded would not be a useless formality as there was an arguable case for the teacher He observed A great many arguments might have been put forward but forward but if none of them had any chance of success then I can see no good reason why the respondents should have given the appellant a hearing nor can I see that he was prejudiced in any way Lord <NAME> too stated the principle in the following words at The appellant has first to show that his position was such that he had in principle a right to make representations before a decision against him was taken But to show this is not necessarily enough unless he was also show that if admitted to state his case he had a case of substance to make A breach of procedure whether failure of natural justice administrative fault cannot give him a remedy in the courts unless behind it there is something of substance which has been lost by the failure It is thus clear that the approach of the Court depended upon the facts and circumstances of each case the law applicables the nature of the right claimed by the person affected and so on speaking for the Constitution Bench had this to say If an inferior court or tribunal of first instance acts wholly without jurisdiction or patently in excess of jurisdiction or manifestly conducts the proceedings before it in a manner which is contrary to the rules of natural justice and all accepted rules of procedure and which offends the superior court sense of fair play the superior court may we thinks quite properly exercise its power to issue the prerogative writ of certiorari to correct the error of the court or tribunal of first instance even if an appeal to another inferior court or tribunal was available and recourse was not had to it or if recourse was had to its it confirmed what ex facie was a nullity for reasons aforementioned There is no doubt that if the principles of natural justice are violated and there is by striking down the order of dismissal but there are cases and cases In other words they were not collected behind his back and could be used to his advantage and he had an opportunity of so using them in his defence We do not think that any prejudice was caused to the appellant in his case by not examining the two retired Superintending Engineers whom he had cited or any one of them Emphasis added Pausing here we may notice two decisions of this Court where the test of prejudice was rejected viz In the former case the Government allowed a revision filed under Section of the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act without notice to opposite party inspite of a request therefor th October when the respondents filed their revision before the <ORG> the appellant filed an application to the <ORG> disputing the claim of the village societies The <ORG> however without any notice to the appellant passed final orders on th December allowing the two review petitions filed by the village societies and set aside the order of the Registrar dated th December The short question that arises for decision is whether the order of the <ORG> in revision which was passed under section of the Act is invalid for non compliance with section which provides that no order rejudicial to any person shall be passed under sub section unless such person has been given an opportunity of making his representation <ORG> rejected this plea on the ground that from a perusal of the voluntary application filed by the appellant it was clear that the appellant had anyhow met with the points urged by the respondents in their revision petition before the <ORG> made the following observation In our view the principle of natural justice know of justice know of no exclusionary rule dependent on whether it would have made any difference if natural justice had natural justice been observed Sabyasachi Mukharji speaking for a three Judge Bench considered the question whether violation of each and very facet of principles of natural justice has the effect of vitiating the enquiry If the credibility of a person who has testified of given some information is in doubt or if the version or the statement of the person who has testified is in dispute right of cross examination must inevitable form part of fair play in action but where there is no lis regarding the facts but certain explanation of the circumstances there is no requirement of cross examination to be fulfilled to justify fair play in action When on the question of facts there was no dispute no real prejudice has been caused to a party aggrieved by an order by absence of any formal opportunity of cross examination per se does not invalidate or vitiate the decision arrived at fairly The party who does not want to controvert the veracity of the evidence from or testimony gathered behind his back cannot expect to succeed in any subsequent demand that there was no opportunity of cross examination specially when it was not asked for and there was no dispute about the veracity of the statements Where there is no dispute as to the facts or the weight to be attached on disputed facts but only an explanation to the acts absence of opportunity to cross examination does not create any prejudice in such cases He gave his explanation but he did not dispute any of the facts nor did he ask for any opportunity to call any evidence to rebut these facts In Managing Director I Karunkar a Constitution Bench did take the view that before an employee is punished in a disciplinary enquiry a copy of the enquiry report should be furnished to him i wherever an enquiry officer is appointed and he submits a report to <ORG> At pages the following observations are relevant This brings us to the question of relief We find that the order of compulsory purchase under Section UD of the income Tax Act which was served on the petitioner in the night of December has been made without any show cause notice being served on the petitioner and without the petitioner or other affected parties having been given any opportunity to show cause against an order of compulsory purchase nor were the reasons for the said order set out in the order or communicated to the petitioner or other concerned parties with the order The Court Tribunal should not interfere with the order of punishment <ORG> should not mechanically set aside the order of punishment on the ground that the report was not furnished as is regrettably being done at present It is only if <ORG> finds that the furnishing of the report would have made a difference to the result in the case that it should set aside the order of punishment To illustrate take a case where the person is dismissed from service without hearing him altogether as in <NAME> <NAME> It would be a case falling under the first category and the order of dismissal would be invalid or void if one chooses to use that expression <NAME> <NAME> It would not be correct in the light of The above decisions to say that for any and every violation of a facet of natural justice or of a rule incorporating such facet the order passed is altogether void and ought to be set aside without further enquiry The object of the principles of natural justice which are now understood as synonymous with the obligation to provide a fair hearing is to ensure that justice is done that there is no failure of justice and that every person whose rights are going to be affected by the proposed action gets a fair hearing Is the entire enquiry and the punishment awarded to be set aside on the only ground that instead of three days before the statements were supplied only two days before the commencement of the examination of witnesses It is suggested by <ORG> that sub clause iii is mandatory since it uses the expression shall But a mandatory provision can only be waived if it is not conceived in the public interests but in the interests of the party that waives it In the present case the executing court had inherent jurisdiction to sell the property If so the question is whether the said provision is conceived in the interests of the public or in the interests of the person affected by the non observance of the provision lt is true that many provisions of the Act were conceived in the interests of the public but the same cannot be said of of the Act which is really intended to protect the interests of a judgment debtor and to see that a larger extent of his property than is necessary to discharge the debt is not sold The principle of the above decision was applied by this Court in Krishan Lal State of Jammu Kashmir in the case of an express statutory provision governing a disciplinary enquiry According to us the requirement is for the benefit of the person concerned which is to enable him to know as to what had taken place during the cause of the proceedings so that he is better situated to show his cause as to why the proposed penalty should not be imposed This is for the reason that violation of natural justice which was dealt with in that case also renders an order invalid despite which <ORG> did not concede that the order of dismissal passed without furnishing copy of the inquiry officer report would be enough to set aside the order According to us therefore the legal and proper order to be passed in the present case also despite a mandatory provision having been violated is to require the employer to furnish a copy of the proceeding and to call upon <ORG> to decide thereafter as to whether non furnishing of the copy prejudiced the appellant petitioner and the same has made difference to the ultimate finding and punishment given It is trite to remember that af a rule all such procedure rules are designed to afford a full and proper opportunity to the delinquent officer employee to defend himself and are therefore conceived in his interest Hence whether mandatory or directory they would normally be conceived in his interest only If it is found that he has been so prejudiced appropriate orders have to be made to repair and remedy the prejudicate including setting aside the enquiry and or the order of punishment As explained in the body of the judgment take a case where there is a provision expressly providing that after the evidence of the employer government is over the employee shall be given an opportunity to lead defence in his evidence and in a given case the enquiry officer does not give that opportunity inspite of the delinquent officer employee asking for it In the case of violation of a procedural provisional which is of a mandatory character it has to be ascertained whether the provision is conceived in the interest of the person proceeded against or in public interest It is made clear that this principle No While applying the rule of audi alteram partem the primary principle of natural justice the <ORG> Tribunal <ORG> must always bear in mind the ultimate and over riding objective underlying the said rule viz to ensure a fair hearing and to ensure that there is no failure of justice <ORG> has no doubt said that it has prejudiced the respondent case but except merely mentioning the same it has not specified in what manner and in what sense was the respondent prejudiced in his defence Accordingly we allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of <ORG> affirming the judgments of <ORG> and <ORG> the suit filed by the respondent shall stand dismissed
