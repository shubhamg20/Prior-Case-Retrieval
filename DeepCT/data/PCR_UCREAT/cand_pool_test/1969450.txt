Having obtained this relief in the fifst Court he had no ground for appealing and therefore no ground for putting in a memorandum of objections under Section The District Judge found that the plaintiff was not entitled to the major relief granted him by the District Munsif There was nothing my opinion to prevent him from giving a decree for In that case the plaintiff claiming title linger a sale from the rd defendant who was a vendee from the widow of a brother of the st and nd defendants sued all these defendants for possession and in the alternative for return by the rd defendant of the purchase money The Subordinate Judge found that there was no bar by the adverse possession on the part of the defendants Nos and and although the plaintiff had put in no memorandum of objections dismissed the suit for purchase money against the rd defendant and gave the plaintiff a decree for possession He was therefore bound if he wanted to obtain that relief in the appeal filed by the rd defendant to put in a memorandum of objections I therefore dismiss this second appeal with costs The plaintiff who is the respondent in this second appeal obtained a decree in the District Munsif Court for the delivery of possession of the property which he had knight the very relief which he sought by his suit It seems difficult to comprehend that the plaintiff should be required by law as contended for by the learned pleader for the appellant to file a special memorandum of objections against a decree which he had sought and obtained He did not relavant to take any objection to that decree and therefore Section can have no application I therefore agree that this appeal should be dismissed with costs
