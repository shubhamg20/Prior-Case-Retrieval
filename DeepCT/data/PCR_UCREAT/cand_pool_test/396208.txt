This appeal is directed against an order of the Subordinate Judge of Birbhum holding the decree sought to be executed by the Appellant incapable of execution and dismissing his application for execution In this execution case the judgment debtors have taken exception to the execution on the ground that when the decree was passed some of the mortgaged properties situated in the Santhal Parganas were under settlement and so under Section of Act of <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass the decree the decree having thus been passed without jurisdiction is void and incapable of execution The finding of fact recorded by the <ORG> below has not been disputed before us by the Appellant but the order of the <ORG> below has been assailed on two grounds that the <ORG> below as executing <ORG> could not go behind the decree and test its validity but was bound to execute it even though it was passed without jurisdiction that the <ORG> below is wrong in holding that the whole decree was bad and it should have executed so much of it as was valid in respect of the Birbhum properties On the first point there is no unanimity of opinion and we find it difficult to reconcile some of the decisions of this <ORG> In <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Gopal Shah the objection that the decree was void and incapable of execution was permitted to be raised and allowed in the execution of the decree enunciates the proposition of law that when a decree is void and a nullity it is not only the duty of the <ORG> which passed it to ignore it but of every <ORG> to which it is presented Though the case in which this observation was made did not arise in execution it is wide enough to cover a case like the present and is in conflict with the view expressed by the same learned Judge in the two previous cases above cited This Reference is made in a first appeal from an order The question propounded is in these words Where a decree having been passed by a <ORG> having no jurisdiction to pass it is void and a nullity is the execution <ORG> competent to question its validity and refuse to execute it We have to start by accepting the proposition that the <ORG> that made the decree had no jurisdiction to make it and by that expression is meant that the <ORG> had not such territorial jurisdiction as would authorize it to make the decree and not that having jurisdiction it exercised it erroneously I think it may be said that the correct view and the view for which there is a strong cur rent of authority is that where the decree presented for execution was made by a <ORG> which apparently had not jurisdiction whether pecuniary or territorial or in respect of the judgment debtor person to make the decree the executing <ORG> is entitled to refuse to execute it on the ground that it was made without jurisdiction within these narrow limits I think that the executing <ORG> is authorised to question the validity of a decree As the question arises in a first appeal we must return the case for final adjudication by the <ORG> which referred it with the statement that our answer to the question propounded is in the affirmative
