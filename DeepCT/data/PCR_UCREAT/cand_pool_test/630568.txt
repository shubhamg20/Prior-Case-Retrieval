decided yesterday I came to the opinion for reasons stated in my judgment then delivered that <NAME> Superintendent of Police of this district has committed offences under Sections and of the Indian Penal Code and that it is my duty to hold an inquiry preliminary to committing him to <ORG> to be tried for those offences There was then no time owing to the lateness of the hour to draw up this formal proceeding After the disposal of the case in this Court the petitioner applied for and obtained the present Rule calling upon the Magistrate of the District to show cause why the proceedings instituted against him under those sections by the <NAME> Judge of Noakhali on the th of February should not be aside first on the ground that they are not warranted by law as there was no proceeding drawn up on the day that he was committed to jail secondly on the ground that no specific statements are set out in the proceedings drawn up on the th upon which the petitioner is charged with having committed perjury thirdly on the ground that there are no statements in the said proceedings showing the character of the forgery charged against him under the sections referred to above and fourthly on the ground that otherwise there is no foundation for the proceedings against him There is no warrant however for that view Having regard then to the phraseology of the law it appears to us that if <ORG> proceeds to take action under Section it must in the first instance frame a charge so as to enable the accused to know the exact nature of the offence he is alleged to have committed A charge is a precise formulation of the specific accusation made against a person who is entitled to know its nature at the earliest stage It contains no particulars of the statements made and acts done by the petitioner upon which perjury and forgery are charged against him There was then no time owing to the lateness of the hour to draw up this formal proceeding A preliminary enquiry is necessary for the purpose of determining whether there is a prima facie case against the person accused As the <NAME> Judge did not charge the petitioner as he was empowered to do and as he considered a preliminary enquiry necessary it seems to us that until then in the opinion of the <NAME> Judge there was not even a prima facie case against the petitioner Apart from the illegality of the order as already mentioned and dealing with the merits of the case we are of opinion that there is no foundation for the proceeding We have already expressed our opinion in the judgment in the main case respecting the allegations of perjury made against the petitioner We may add however that we have again gone through the judgment of the Sessions Judge and beyond surmises and assumptions we find nothing to justify the view that the petitioner wilfully perjured himself or intentionally gave false evidence in <ORG> There is less ground even for the charge of forgery The learned Sessions Judge thinks that Exhibit A could not have been prepared on the th and he therefore comes to the conclusion that the petitioner had purposely antedated his signature because he did not want Mr <NAME> to know that Exhibit A was a copy Mr <NAME> admits that he had it in his hand two days before <NAME> examined him i on the first day of his examination He had therefore the opportunity of tampering with it Both the entries are false documents within the meaning of Section of the Indian Penal Code for in each case Mr <NAME> intention when he made the entry was to make people in the first case Mr <NAME> in the second this <ORG> believe that the entry was made at a time at which he knew that it was not made and as the documents purported to be made by a public servant in his official capacity Mr <NAME> by making them appears to have committed offences under Section of the Indian Penal Code and by using them as genuine to have committed offences under Section But Mr <NAME> points to two pencil marks at the place marked in Exhibit Aa and says he made these to indicate the break and so I have no doubt he did make them but I have equally little doubt that he made them on the th of January and not on the th of September Section which defines the term forgery runs as follows Whoever makes any false document or part of a document with intent to cause damage or injury to the public or to any person or to support any claim or title or to cause any person to part with property or to enter into any express or implied contract or with intent to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed commits forgery But in our judgment there is no ground for the assumption of the Judge that Exhibit A was purposely antedated The inspection of the locality having unquestionably taken place on the th and the results noted in Exhibit Aa the fair copy whenever prepared and excepting the hypothesis of the Sessions Judge there is nothing to show it could not have been prepared on that day would naturally bear the date of the inspection and any other date would misrepresent the fact As regards the pencil marks on Exhibit Aa there is absolutely no reason for suggesting them to be dishonest interpolations by the petitioner or for not accepting his explanations regarding their omission from Exhibit A It was no doubt wrong on the part of the petitioner not to have insisted on the breaks being shown on the maps and that error of judgment is deserving of censure but in our opinion the imputation of forgery and of having used a forged document is not only groundless but a straining of the law as well as the facts It was unfortunate that the Sessions Judge applied Section against the petitioner in the way he has done as it gives colour to the suggestion made at the bar that it was purposely used to deprive the petitioner of the right to bail
