The charge against them was that they had in furtherance of their common intention committed the murder of one <NAME> at about on April in front of the shop of a milk vendor Chhunno situate in Lathi Mohal Collectorganj in the City of Kanpur This was not liked by <NAME> and <NAME> who gave a threat to <NAME> <NAME> reported the matter to his father who thereupon instructed his employees that one or the other of them should keep <NAME> company whenever he was going away from the house or the shop He left it to <NAME> to remove <NAME> to the hospital The necessary entries were made with regard to the progress of the investigation in the General Diary of the Police Station and <NAME> went on duty at his place being taken by Head Constable <NAME> <NAME> went to the hospital at about a but there was a delay in obtaining the body in After returning to the Police Station at A he recorded the statement of <NAME> and sent him to the Jail Doctor as there were two small injuries on the little finger of the right hand He further stated that he had been made to sit there in the <ORG> Station till about midnight and the officers asked him to give evidence against two or three persons whose names he could not recall at the time The injuries were one above the other on one finger of one hand that is the right hand and there was no injury on the left hand We may mention here only that both the courts agree that these injuries on the little finger sustained by <NAME> must have been caused in the act of inflicting injuries on another person with a knife and not in warding off knife blows by a third person There is no dispute also that whosoever be the assailants it was a clear case of murder There was a great possibility that these very accused might have been involved in the affair but however strong the suspicion there could be no conviction The one grave error which he committed was that he first recorded a finding on the question as to whether the eye witnesses could have been present at the scene of occurrence or not After hearing counsel on behalf of the accused and the <ORG> and on a perusal of the evidence to which our attention was invited we have come to the conclusion that the above criticism of <ORG> was fully justified It was submitted that Mr <NAME> was a disinterested witness and if his evidence is accepted it would be clearly established that neither <NAME> nor <NAME> could have been there before and hence the story now told by the prosecution that the first information had been recorded at the instance of <NAME> at is demonstrably false The whole argument proceeds on the assumption that if <NAME> were on the scene of offence There is further indication in his evidence that at least to minutes must have passed between the stabbing and the actual arrival of Mr <NAME> on the scene After returning to his house Mr <NAME> had telephoned to the Control Room and that was at There is record about this at the Control Room It would therefore appear that Mr <NAME> must have casually asked the first man he met in the crowd as to who the boy was and he must not have received any answer In fact he admits that when he put the first question he did not receive any answer and so he did not make any further enquiry He might be just a passerby who like the other members of the crowd might have had only a casual interest We have already referred to the evidence of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Moreover the Investigating Officer had recorded more detailed statements of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> that same night at about and it is not elicited from their cross examination by reference to the police statements that they had failed to mention the presence of <NAME> at the time of the departure from the scene of offence at Then again there is the evidence of Sub Inspector <NAME> who says that when he came to the scene at about he had met <NAME> at the place And if <NAME> was there as alleged by the prosecution there was no difficulty in <NAME> proceeding to the Police Station with <NAME> leaving <NAME> at the scene to make arrangements for removing <NAME> to the hospital Then again if <NAME> and the other captors of <NAME> proceeded to the Police Station from the scene of occurrence soon after there is no dispute that they would be in the Police Station at about for recording the complaint There were serious difficulties however in accepting such a defence Apart from entries with regard to the investigation of the offence that same night there are also other entries made in the General Diary in serial order which had nothing to do with this offence The diary should be a complete but brief record of the proceedings of the police and of occurrences reported to them or of which they have obtained information and the two Head Moharrirs who were incharge of the General Diary on that night namely <NAME> and <NAME> had been examined in the case there is no cross examination of these witnesses on the charge now made In fact Head Constable <NAME> says that when he was recording the statement of <NAME> this particular message was received from the Control Room at and at that very time he told the Control Room on the phone that a report in respect of that offence had already been lodged at <ORG> and necessary action was being taken It is not suggested that <NAME> who was in charge of the Control Room had anything to do with any mischief contemplated by the officers of this Police Station and it would only show that <NAME> was telling the truth when he said that when the message was received from the Control Room the investigation of this offence was in progress Therefore there is no reason whatsoever why the entry should not have been made at the time when the message was received If none of the persons interested in complaining about the offence had reached <ORG> at that time and there was no known source of information at <ORG> with regard to the offence there could not have been any good reason at all why the entries should not be made in the usual course According to the learned Judge <NAME> must have given information about his companions <NAME> and <NAME> and that was the reason why the officers attached to <ORG> stayed their hands and refrained from making any entry about the information given by <NAME> Now the case of <NAME> as disclosed in his statement under Section Criminal Procedure Code is that he had merely seen two or three persons assaulting <NAME> the deceased with knives and since he knew <NAME> he went to his rescue The assailants of <NAME> however turned on him and he got injuries on both his hands He therefore left the place and went to <ORG> to make a report Therefore there is no basis for the conjecture of the learned Sessions Judge that the names of <NAME> and <NAME> might have been mentioned by <NAME> as the assailants Secondly <NAME> would be the last person to go to <ORG> by himself when there were circumstances which would impel him to keep himself as far away from <ORG> as possible It necessarily follows from the above discussion that <NAME> must have been brought to the Police Station with the blood stained knife by somebody at and in that behalf we have a large body of evidence both of the eye witnesses <NAME> etc In our opinion there was no sufficient basis for the learned Sessions Judge to think that the information about this offence had not been received till early next morning and that the General Diary had not been posted with the entries in due course of official business <NAME> had been brought to the Police Station with a blood stained knife and the eve witnesses were available who had also taken part in chasing and capturing <NAME>
