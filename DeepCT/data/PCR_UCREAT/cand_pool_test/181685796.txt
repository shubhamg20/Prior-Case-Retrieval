These two writ petitions are being disposed of by this common judgment On August this Court appointed <ORG> for inspection of the mines with a view to securing assistance in the determination as to whether safety standards laid down in the Mines Act of and the Rules made thereunder have been followed and whether there was any danger of land slide on account of quarrying operations particularly during the rainy season and if there was any other hazard to any individual cattle or agricultural lands on account of carrying of the mining operations The said <ORG> referred to as the Bhargav<ORG> after its Chairman classified the mines which it inspected into three groups being A and It took note of the fact that earlier an Expert <ORG> known as <ORG> had been set up by <ORG> which had also inspected these mines One of the learned Judges constituting the three Judge Bench retired from the <ORG> on September and the said learned Judge <NAME> expressed his views in a short order dated th September In the order of March this Court took note of the position that Prof <NAME> report was confined largely to the geological aspect and considerable reliance on the Main Boundary Thrust MBT had been placed by him in making of the report and he had taken the view that the lime stone quarries which were dangerously close to the MBT should be closed down inasmuch as that was a sensitive and vulnerable belt This Court then took the view that not much importance could be placed to Dr <NAME> report for this litigation The joint report submitted by Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> had been taken into account by this Court in making interim directions and for the making of the final order no specific reference is called for The lessees of the lime stone quarries classified as category A in <ORG> and for Category I in the Working Group Report and falling within the city limits of Mussoorie as also the lessees of the lime stone quarries classified as category in the <ORG> will be at liberty to submit a full and detailed scheme for mining their lime stone quarries to this Committee hereinafter called <ORG> and if any such scheme or schemes are submitted <ORG> will proceed to examine the same without any unnecessary delay and submit a report to this Court whether in its opinion the particular lime stone quarry can be allowed to be operated in accordance with the scheme and if so subject to what conditions and if it cannot be allowed to be operated the reasons for taking that view It was directed in the aforesaid order of th March that until <ORG> cleared the particular mines for operation mining activity in regard to all mines covered within the purview of examination by that Committee would stop The <ORG> observed The consequence of this Order made by us would be that the lessees of lime stone quarries which have been directed to be closed down permanently under this Order or which may be directed to be closed down permanently after consideration of the report of <ORG> would be thrown out of business in which they have invested large sums of money and expanded considerable time and effort This would undoubtedly cause hardship to them but it is a price that has to be paid for protecting and safeguarding the right of the people to live in healthy environment with minimal disturbance of ecological balance and without avoidable hazard to them and to their cattle homes and agricultural land and undue affectation of air water and environment SCC where reasons for the order of th March were given and yet another order was made on th October We shall refer to the last of these orders in a later part of this Judgment It has been claimed before us on its behalf that it operates most scientifically and satisfies all the requirements appropriate for ecological and environmental safeguards As there is sparse growth of trees in the area covered by the mines no significant deforestation is involved There was no apprehension of spreading of scree and future mining operations are not likely to involve any significant deforestation The <ORG> also has opined that there is no apprehension of choking of the water ways due to mining operations as the Song river flows about mts We have in another part of this judgment indicated our conclusion that mining activity as a whole should be stopped in the Doon Valley area but for the reasons indicated therein we have also come to the conclusion that the three mining lessees who have been operating under valid lease may be permitted to work subject to such conditions as have been indicated Keeping the report of <ORG> in view and for the reasons we have elsewhere indicated we direct that mining operations in lease Nos and where the respective leases have expired and mining operation is being carried on under Court Orders shall stop and the several orders of the courts enabling mining activity shall stand superseded This Court in its order dated th of October came to the clear conclusion We are of the view that the stone quarrying in the Doon Valley area should generally be stopped and reasons therefor we shall provide in due course Connected with this submission is the contention that during the pendency of these writ petitions the Environmental Protection Act of has come into force and since that Statute and the Rules made thereunder provide detailed procedure to deal with the situations that arise in these cases this <ORG> should no more deal with the matter and leave it to be looked into by the authorities under the Act We take the view that the lime stone quarries falling within category A of <ORG> and or category of <ORG> and falling outside the city limits of Mussoorie should be allowed to be operated subject of course to the observance of the requirements of the Mines Act the Metalliferous Mines Regulations and other relevant statutes rules and regulations Of course when we say this we must make it clear that we are not holding that if the leases in respect of these lime stone quarries have expired and suits or writ petitions for renewal of the leases are pending in the courts such leases should be automatically renewed So far as the lime stone quarries classified in category A in <ORG> and category in <ORG> and falling within the city limits of Mussoorie are concerned we would give the same direction which we are giving in the next succeeding paragraph in regard to the lime stone quarries classified as category in <ORG> It has been pointed out to us in course of hearing of the objections that the classification of the A category lime stone quarries on the basis of their location within the municipal limits and outside was indeed not a real one If the real purpose of the order made by this <ORG> was not to permit mining within the city limits without further scrutiny as in the case of category stone quarries we really do not see any justification as to why these stone quarries located outside the city limits but close to the heart of the city should not have been subjected to such scrutiny We are therefore of the view that the A category stone quarries in this area irrespective of location within or outside city limits should be subjected to further order of this <ORG> and there is no legal impediment for this <ORG> to do the same Even if it is said that there was a final order in a dispute of this type it would be difficult to entertain the plea of res judicata Under this Act power is vested in <ORG> to take measures to protect and improve the environment These writ petitions were filed as early as more than three years before the Act came into force In consideration of these facts we do not think there is any justification to decline the exercise of jurisdiction at this stage Ordinarily the <ORG> would not entertain a dispute for the adjudication of which a special provision has been made by law but that rule is not attracted in the present situation in these cases This <ORG> would also require an affidavit from responsible authorities of <ORG> as to whether keeping the principles of ecology environmental protection and safeguards and anti pollution measures it is in the interest of the <ORG> that the requirements should be met by import or by taking other alternate indigenous sources or mining activity in this area should be permitted to a limited extent The <ORG> expects <ORG> to balance these two aspects and place on record its stand not as a party to the litigation but as a protector of the environment in discharge of its statutory and social obligation for the purpose of consideration of the <ORG> The two affidavits filed on behalf of <ORG> have been dealt with elsewhere in the judgment and it would be sufficient for the instant aspect to extract from the affidavit of Mr <NAME> Secretary to the Government in <ORG> where he has stated <ORG> submits that from the point of view of protection of the environment in the unique Doon Valley it would be desirable that lime stone mining operations in the Valley are stopped completely That is why there is copious reference to forests in the Vedas and the ancient literature of ours It has therefore been rightly said that there is a balance on earth between air water soil and plant Article A in Part IV A of the Constitution inserted by the same amendment provided a set of fundamental duties and Clause runs thus It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including forests lakes rivers and wild life and to have compassion for living creatures Section vests power in <ORG> to reserve forests Section vests power in <ORG> to declare a forest to be no longer reserved Section of the Act which is relevant provides Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force in a State no State Government or other authority shall make except with the prior approval of <ORG> any order directing i that any reserved forest within the meaning of the expression reserved forest in any law for the time being in force in that State or any portion thereof shall cease to be reserved ii that any forest land or any portion thereof may be used for any non forest purpose Thus the power which was vested in <ORG> under Section of the Indian Forest Act of or any other law containing a similar provision is now exercisable subject to prior approval of <ORG> The question of renewal of mining leases in Gujarat came for consideration in this case before the Court At page of the Reports it was stated The rules dealt with a situation prior to the coming into operation of Act Act was an act in recognition of the awareness that deforestation and ecological imbalances as a result of deforestation have become social menaces and further deforestation and ecological imbalances should be prevented Therefore the concept that power coupled with the duty enjoined upon the respondents to renew the lease stands eroded by the mandate of the legislation as manifest in Act in the facts and circumstances of these cases The primary duty was to the community and that duty took precedence in our opinion in these cases The obligation to the society must predominate over the obligation to the individuals <ORG> has not granted approval The ratio of the decision of this <ORG> in State of Rajas than <NAME> has obviously no application to the facts of this case We agree with the view expressed by Brother <NAME> that the Conservation Act of applies to renewal as well and even if there was a provision for renewal in the lease agreement on exercise of lessee option the requirements of Act had to be satisfied before such renewal could be granted It is clear from the directions contained in the order of th March as also the ratio of the judgment in the <ORG> case supra that even if there has been an order of the <ORG> and no challenge is raised against such order this <ORG> could invoke its jurisdiction to nullify the direction or order and if any order direction or decree has been passed ignoring the provisions of the Conservation Act of the same would not be binding No useful purpose would be served by allowing the litigations to be continued in different courts particularly when keeping the broad interest of society with reference to ecology and environment we have come to the conclusion that mining in this area has to be stopped Apart from the notice contained in the <ORG> Order of th October where it had been specifically stated that this <ORG> was of the view that mining in the Doon Valley area should be totally stopped the position was also made clear to different parties in course of the hearing which continued for several weeks We therefore hold that if any decree or order has already been obtained from any court relating to renewal of these leases the same shall stand vacated and similarly any appeal or other proceeding taken to obtain a renewal or against orders decrees granting renewal shall also become nonest The following Table indicates the approximate short and long term requirements of industries that are dependent upon limestone from this belt In tonnes Short term Long term Sugar Industry Chemicals Paper Industry There are over sugar factories in the State which are traditionally dependent on limestone from Dehradun for use in the process of manufacture This affidavit of Dr <NAME> was not accepted by this <ORG> as it did not fulfil the requirements of the directions given in this <ORG> order dated th October This affidavit stated Now that high grade low silica limestone is also available in the extensive deposits covering large areas in the State of Rajasthan which can meet the requirements of the steel industry which also includes <ORG> requirements there is justification for discontinuance of the existing mining operations in the Dehradun Mussoorie area and in fact complete closure of the said mines in this area Counsel appearing on behalf of the <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh and <ORG> offered serious criticism against this changed stance and we were called upon to reject the second affidavit also We can well gather why the <ORG> would feel aggrieved by the second affidavit but so far as the <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh is concerned we do not see any justification in its critical stand against the second affidavit on the plea that the stand accepted in the first affidavit has been given a go by Maintenance of the environment and ecological balance is the obligation of the <ORG> and the <ORG> Governments and unless there was any real objection to the opinion of <ORG> as to continuing or closing down of mining activity it should have been taken in the proper light and the little modified stand adopted in the second affidavit should have been welcomed The variation of the stand in the second affidavit that mining activity should be totally stopped is certainly an improvement on the stand taken in the first affidavit but we do not think there is any inconsistency in the stand inasmuch as the justification in support of the plea of total closure has been indicated On assessment of the factual position we do not think there is any substance in the argument advanced on behalf of <ORG> <ORG> or any other mine owner which would justify our rejecting the second affidavit The Gotan <ORG> belt has to be worked out in full swing and that would take some time Even if these facilities are made available the distant location is bound to reflect itself in the cost factor There was some controversy as to whether some of the mines were located in the reserved forests We do not agree with the submission advanced by Mr <NAME> for the intervener Mr <NAME> for <ORG> Mr <NAME> for the <ORG> Dr <NAME> for some of the mine owners and similar contentions advanced by other counsel of different mine lessees that there would be a total stalemate in the manufacture of drugs and sugar as also steel in case mining activity is stopped yet we would accept this position that these would be hard hit if mining activity in this area is stopped all of a sudden We have already taken note of the fact that for different reasons several mines are closed down and only six as indicated in another part of this judgment are working Apart from these three there are four other mines which are also operating under decrees orders of Courts as per the details below No Name of the lessee Lease No Lease expired We do not think it appropriate to allow them to operate until their lease periods lapse particularly when we have reached the conclusion that mining operation in this area should close down But in the peculiar situation emerging in this case we do not accept the submission of Dr <NAME> that those A category mines which had stopped working should be permitted to run There are certain situations where in the interest of general benefit to the community interests of individual citizens may be overlooked We have already taken note of the position that <ORG> is a public sector undertaking of the <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh and there has been a huge investment by the <ORG> in this establishment If by the end of December the lessee fails to comply with this direction to the satisfaction of <ORG> which is being set up by this Judgment <ORG> is empowered to direct closing down of the mine subject to any other direction of this Court There is no dispute that continuance of mining operations affects environment and ecology adversely and at the same time creates a prejudicial situation against conservation of forests There is no material on record if any alternate provision has been made either by the State of Uttar Pradesh or the <ORG> There is material that lime stone quarries are available in Rajasthan and Gujarat We direct <ORG> Rehabilitation Committee with the following members We have taken note of the position that <ORG> has a Master Plan for the Doon Valley spread over a quarter of century beginning with The Monitoring <ORG> shall have powers to over see reafforestation in the area by the State of Uttar Pradesh and undertake an appropriate scheme of reafforestation We are of the view that he should be paid a total sum of Rs This amount when deposited shall be paid to Mr <NAME>
