Against the said order the State of filed a appeal after obtaining special leave The question involved for consideration is whether the order terminating the services of the respondent is vitiated in law Allowing the appeal this <ORG> HELD Holding of preliminary inquiry does not affect the nature of the termination order In the instant case the respondent was a temporary Government Servant and there was adverse regarding his work which was reflected in the adverse remarks made for the year A The principle last come first go is applicable to a case where on account of reduction of work or shrinkage of cadre retrenchment takes place and the services of employees are terminated on account of retrenchment Appeal allowed High <ORG> order set aside as it interfered with order of termination in a casual manner The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> Leave granted This appeal is directed against the judgment of <ORG> <ORG> setting aside the order dated terminating the respondent services The sole question which falls for consideration in this appeal is whether the order dated terminating the respondent services who was admittedly an ad hoc and temporary employee is vitiated in law The respondent made representation against the entry but the same was rejected Ultimately the respondent services were terminated by the order dated and on the same day by another order service of <NAME> were also terminated There is no dispute that the respondent was an ad hoc and temporary employees and the terms and conditions of his employment were regulated by the Temporary Government Servant Termination of Services Rules To support that contention the appellant placed reliance on the adverse entry awarded to the respondent in the year and also on the allegations made against him with raged to the audit of <ORG> of <ORG> The adverse entry as well as the preliminary inquiry report with regard to the complaint of unauthorised audit constituted adequate material to enable to competent authority to form the requisite opinion regarding the respondents suitability for service Under the service jurisprudence a temporary employee has no right to hold the post and his services are liable to be terminated in accordance with the relevant service rules and the terms of contract of service Servant has no right to hold the post his services are liable to be terminated by giving him one month notice without assigning any reason either under the terms of the contract providing for such termination or under the relevant statutory rules regulating the terms and conditions of temporary <ORG> Whenever the competent authority is satisfied that the work and conduct of a temporary servant is not satisfactory of that his continuance in service is not in public interest on account of his unsuitability misconduct or inefficiency it may either terminate his services in accordance with the terms and conditions of the service or the relevant rules or it may decide to take punitive action against the temporary Government servant servant is also entitled to the protection of Article in the same manner as a permanent <ORG> servant very often the question arises whether an order of termination is in accordance with the contract of service and relevant rules regulating the temporary employment or it is by way of punishment It is now sell settled that the form of the order is not conclusive and it is open to the <ORG> to determine the true nature of the order servant had a right to the post or the rank or whether he has been visited with evil consequences and if either of the tests is satisfied it must be held that the order of termination of a temporary <ORG> It must be borne in mind that a temporary <ORG> servant has no right to hold the post and termination of such a <ORG> The view taken by <ORG> in <NAME> case has been reiterated and affirmed by <ORG> decisions of this <ORG> in the State or Orrisa and anr A No Learned counsel for the respondent urged that the allegations made against the respondent in respect of the audit of <ORG> of an educational institution were incorrect and he was not given any opportunity of defence during the inquiry which was held ex parte had he been given the opportunity he would have placed correct facts before the inquiry officer He further referred to the allegations made against the respondent in the counter affidavit filed before <ORG> and urged that these facts demonstrate that the order of termination was in substance an order of termination founded on the allegations of misconduct and the ex parte enquiry report In order to determine this question it is necessary to consider the nature of the respondent right to hold the post and to ascertain the nature and purpose of the inquiry held against him servant had no right to hold the post and the competent authority terminated his services by an innocuous order of termination without casting any stigma on him There was no element of punitive proceedings as no charges had been framed no inquiry officer was appointed no findings were recorded instead a preliminary inquiry was held and on the report of the preliminary inquiry the competent authority terminated the respondent services by an innocuous order in accordance with the terms and conditions of his service Mere fact that prior to the issue of order of termination an inquiry against the repondent in regard to the allegations of unauthorised audit of <ORG> was held does not change the nature of the order of termination into that of punishment as after the preliminary inquiry the competent authority took no steps to punish the respondent instead it exercised its power to terminate the respondent services in accordance with the contract of service and the Rules What is decisive is whether the order is by way of punishment in the light of the tests laid down in <NAME> case In <NAME> case supra <ORG> of this Court held that every order terminating the services of a temporary public servant does no amount to dismissal or removal from service merely because an inquiry was held before the order of termination was passed The Court observed that the appropriate authority has power to terminate a temporary public servant either by discharging him under the terms of contract or the relevant rules or by holding departmental disciplinary inquiry and dismissing him from service While discussing the nature of preliminary inquiry the Court observed as under There is no element of punitive proceedings in such an enquiry the idea in holding such an enquiry is not the punish the temporary servant but just to decide whether he deserves to be continued in service or not If as a result of such an enquiry the authority comes to the conclusion that the temporary servant is not suitable to be continued it may pass a simple order of discharge by virtue of the powers conferred on it by the contract or the relevant rule in such a case it would not be open to the temporary servant to invoke the protection of Art for the simple reason that the enquiry which ultimately led to his discharge was held only for the purpose of deciding whether the power under the contract or the relevant rule should be exercised and the temporary servant discharged His services were terminated without assigning any reasons and without affording him opportunity of showing cause Before passing the order of termination the competent authority had issued a notice to <NAME> calling upon him to explain certain irregularities and to show cause why disciplinary action should not be taken against him In response to the notice he submitted his explanation thereupon certain preliminary enquiries were held but he was not given opportunity to place his case during the preliminary enquiry So far as the preliminary enquiry is concerned there is no question of it being governed by Article of the Constitution as it is made for the purpose of collection of facts to enable to the competent authority to decide whether punitive action should be taken or action should be taken in terms and under the contract of service or the rules applicable to a temporary government servant servant has no right to insist for affording him opportunity during such enquiry and such an ex parte enquiry is not initiated in law in view of the purpose and object of preliminary enquiry But at that stage he has no right to be heard for the enquiry is merely for the satisfaction of the Government and it is only when the government decides to hold a regular departmental enquiry for the purposes of inflicting one of the three major punishments that the government servant gets the protection of Art The above principles were reiterated by another Constitution Bench of this Court in <NAME> case supra dealing with the case of reversion of a permanent <ORG> Before terminating the services of a temporary servant or reverting the person officiating in a higher post to his substantive post the <ORG> In that case before the issue of termination order a notice had been issued to <NAME> for showing cause as to why disciplinary action should not be taken on the allegations made against him in respect of which the charges had been framed and an enquiry officer had been appointed While assailing the order of termination it was seriously contended before this Court that in view of the charges being framed and the enquiry officer having been appointed the order of termination in substance was an order of punishment and the recourse to the temporary service rules had been taken only to circumvent Art servant is entitled to opportunity in the preliminary inquiry as there is no element of punitive proceedings in such an inquiry the idea in holding such an inquiry is not to punish the temporary government servant but just to decide whether he deserves to be continued in service or not We have referred to the above decision in detail to dispel any doubt about the correct position of <NAME> Secondly the grounds mentioned in the report of the superintendent of Police on the basis of which the services of the Sub Inspector had been terminated were mere allegations and there was no definite material for terminating his services The <ORG> observations in Nepal <NAME> case that since the enquiry against nepal <NAME> on certain charges was dropped and his services were terminated under the rules applicable to the temporary govt In <NAME> case the order of termination of Probationary Judicial Officer was set aside by this <ORG> on the ground that no relevant material had been taken into consideration in assessing the satisfactory nature of the work and conduct of the Officer on probation The <ORG> held that some of the material which had been taken into account in adjudging the Judicial Officer work and conduct as unsatisfactory was not relevant In the instant case the repondent was a temporary Government servant and there was adverse report regarding his work which was reflected in the adverse remarks made for the year We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the order of <ORG> and dismiss the respondent Writ Petition
