This is an application on behalf of the plaintiffs in the Suit No of to have filed of record in this suit a certain award dated the st day of August But it is difficult to see what point there is in the Second Schedule saying or meaning that arbitration mast be done in a particular way if according to some other law or principle it may still be done in another way Without adverting any further to the terms of Section I desire to point out that if a submission to arbitration of matters in difference in a suit is to take plate there is no provision for it other than the provisions in the Second Schedule The <ORG> from She first is to limit the time within which the award is to be made and it has certain powers of interference after the award is made There is no power on the part of the <ORG> to prevent submission as between tome partie where all the parties interested are not agreed There is no power to prevent or control delay no power to remit such an award no power to correct such an award It seems to me if the Code is looked into as a scheme for dealing with a difficult and highly important matter viz arbitrations in the course of litigation it intends these to be under the strict conditions and stipulations of the Second Schedule and under the supervision of the <ORG> There are decisions of this <ORG> in which arbitrators acting under the Indian Arbitration Act without leave from the <ORG> after the matter has been put in suit have been held to be doing that which is wrong and outside their power That seems to me to take a point which tells against the applicability of Order XXIII Rule I should put it that when the <ORG> in Section says all references to arbitration whether by order in suit or otherwise and all proceedings thereunder it probably had not in mind anything so remote in character as adjustments or settlements of suits In any case it dealt with a specific subject matter in a specific way and other principles are only to be applied to other things Mr <NAME> for the defendant has taken other points firstly the point that in this case only one of the three defendants signed the submission and that there are matters dealt with by the award which do not arise in this suit There is a case also on the part of the defendant of misconduct against the arbitrators I dismiss the application with costs
