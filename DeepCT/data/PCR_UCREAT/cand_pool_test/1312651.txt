Respondent WITH CRIMINAL APPEAL NO OF State of Maharashtra Appellant Versus <NAME> and another Respondents JUDGMENT <NAME> INTRODUCTION These two appeals arise out of a common judgment of conviction and sentence dated th August passed by <ORG> in Confirmation Case No of and three connected appeals one filed by the <ORG> and two by the accused whereby and whereunder it confirmed and accepted the reference made to it in terms of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the case of <NAME> appellant in Criminal Case No of and upheld the conviction and sentence of life imprisonment in the case of the other accused respondents in Criminal Appeal No of Leave in these matters was granted by this Court by orders dated th October and th April respectively He told him to tell to the caller that the friend name was <NAME> and that his mobile number was He was produced again on st November when he made a statement under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure which was recorded The learned Sessions Judge passed an order on rd April granting pardon to him He told them that they would cut the body into pieces and throw them at some place after putting them in different bags On the same day in the evening all the accused shifted to <ORG> which was provided to them by an agent of the appellant JUDGMENT OF THE TRIAL JUDGE The prosecution examined witnesses while two witnesses were examined by the defence The learned Sessions Judge convicted accused No of the offences punishable under Section read with Section as also under Sections A read with of the Indian Penal Code Accused Nos and were convicted of the offences punishable under Section read with Section as also under Sections A read with of the Indian Penal Code CONTENTIONS RAISED Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant in Criminal Appeal No of would submit i The courts below committed a serious illegality in recording the judgment and conviction primarily on the basis of the evidence of PW <NAME> despite the fact that he had retracted his confession as would appear from his letter dated th November Article ii The evidence of learned Magistrate PW could not have been relied upon by the learned Sessions Judge inasmuch there were enough materials to show that when the charge sheet was filed on th November none of the accused was produced during the period and Since PW was not produced in Court there was no occasion for him to inform the Magistrate that he was not the author of Article iii The learned Sessions Judge could not have exercised its jurisdiction under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure having regard to the fact that the requirements as contained in sub section of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure had not been complied with iv As grant of pardon to <NAME> PW was illegal his evidence could not have been taken into consideration as a witness examined on behalf of the prosecution and the same should have been considered to be a statement made by the accused against his other co accused only as envisaged under Section of the Indian Evidence Act vi In any view of the matter the quality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution is such for which the death penalty could not be imposed particularly in view of the fact that the trial court had erroneously held that there was no mitigating circumstances therefor The learned counsel for the <ORG> however supported the impugned judgment as regards the death penalty on the appellant In support of Criminal Appeal No of relating to <NAME> A and <NAME> A it was argued that the sentence awarded to them was shockingly inadequate and that the same be enhanced to penalty of death since the crime they had committed falls within the purview of rarest of the rare cases It was furthermore argued that there was not a single mitigating circumstance in favour of the accused to award to them the lesser penalty of life imprisonment QUESTIONS INVOLVED Two principal questions therefore which arise for our consideration are A Whether the learned Sessions Judge acted illegally in granting pardon to <NAME> PW and Whether the case in hand can be said to be a rarest of rare cases so as to enable the courts below to award the death penalty LEGALITY OF THE ORDER GRANTING PARDON We shall first deal with the order of the learned Sessions Judge granting pardon to <NAME> PW Tender of pardon to accomplice With a view to obtaining the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to an offence to which this Section applies the Chief Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate at any stage of the investigation or inquiry into or the trial of the offence and the Magistrate of the first class inquiring into or trying the offence at any stage of the inquiry or trial may tender pardon to such person on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his knowledge relative to the offence and to every other person concerned whether as principal or abettor in the commission thereof This Section applies to a any offence triable exclusively by <ORG> or by the Court of a Special Judge appointed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act any offence punishable with imprisonment which may extend to seven years or with a more severe sentence Every person accepting a tender of pardon made under sub section a shall be examined as a witness in <ORG> taking cognizance of the offence and in the subsequent trial if any shall unless he is already on bail be detained in custody until the termination of the trial Where a person has accepted a tender of pardon made under sub section and has been examined under sub section the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence shall without making any further inquiry in the case a commit it for trial i to the Court of Session if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court or if the Magistrate taking cognizance is the Chief Judicial Magistrate ii to a Court of Special Judge appointed under the Criminal Law Amendment Act if the offence is triable exclusively by that Court in any other case make over the case to the Chief Judicial Magistrate who shall try the case himself Power to direct tender of pardon At any time after commitment of a case but before judgement is passed the Court to which the commitment is made may with a view to obtaining at the trial the evidence of any person supposed to have been directly or indirectly concerned in or privy to any such offence tender a pardon on the same condition to such person Section thus empowers the Chief Judicial Magistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate or a Magistrate of the First class inquiring into or trying the offence to tender a pardon to such person on condition of his making a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his knowledge relating to the offence and to every other person concerned whether as principal or abettor in the commission thereof The said provision indisputably applies to the cases triable exclusively by <ORG> Sub section of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure mandates that such a person accepting tender of pardon must be examined as a witness in the trial Sub section of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that where a person has accepted tender of pardon made under sub section and has been examined under sub section the Magistrate taking cognizance of the offence shall commit it for trial without making any further inquiry in the case Whether the terms on the same condition occurring in Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure refer to sub section of Section thereof and as in the instant case apart from the purported statement made by <NAME> PW under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure which had been retracted as no other statement had been taken from him by the learned Magistrate the order granting pardon in his favour was illegal is the question It is necessary to be followed only by a Magistrate as he would not have any jurisdiction to try the case himself The learned Sessions Judge before whom the case is committed for trial must be informed as to on what basis pardon had been tendered The power of the learned Sessions Judge is independent of the provisions contained in Section thereof The condition mentioned in Section refers to the condition laid down in sub section of Section namely that the person in whose favour the pardon has been tendered will make a full and true disclosure of the whole of the circumstances within his knowledge It may be that the said fact was not borne out from the judicial records which were sent to the learned Sessions Judge with the order of committal but then we have no reason to disbelieve the statement of the learned Magistrate In that situation the court refrained itself from expressing any opinion about the effect of the alleged non compliance with the provisions of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure read with Section thereof There is no legal obligation on <ORG> or a right in favour of the accused to insist for the compliance with the requirement of Section of the Cr Section provides a complete procedure for recording the statement of an accomplice subject only to compliance of conditions specified in Sub section of Section The order of the learned judge granting pardon to the Approver <NAME> is therefore legal and valid Indeed there is a real danger of such mechanical standardisation degenerating into a bed of procrustean cruelty While on parole he committed murder of his wife and daughter If the court has no option save to impose the sentence of death it is meaningless to hear the accused on the question of sentence and it becomes superfluous to state the reasons for imposing the sentence of death The blatant reason for imposing the sentence of death in such a case is that the law compels the court to impose that sentence In so far as this aspect is considered there is inconsistency in how <NAME> supra has been implemented as <NAME> supra mandated principled sentencing and not judge centric sentencing It is accepted that rarest of rare case is to be determined in the facts and circumstance of a given case and there is no hard and fast rule for that purpose There are no strict guidelines The court must play a proactive role to record all relevant information at his stage Objective analysis of the probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated can be one such illustration The court held The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated The <ORG> shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy the conditions and above In this context <NAME> supra laid down a fundamental threshold in the following terms A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentality that the case belongs to the rarest of rare category The background analysis leading to the conclusion that the case belongs to rarest of rare category must conform to highest standards of judicial rigor and thoroughness as the norm under analysis is an exceptionally narrow exception Alternative Option is foreclosed Another aspect of rarest of rare doctrine which needs serious consideration is interpretation of latter part of the dictum that ought not to be done save in the rarest of rare cases when the alternative option is unquestionably foreclosed Therefore for satisfying the second exception to the rarest of rare doctrine the court will have to provide clear evidence as to why the convict is not fit for any kind of reformatory and rehabilitation scheme In the exercise of its discretion in the above cases the court shall take into account the following circumstances That the offence was committed under the influence of extreme mental or emotional disturbance If the accused is young or old he shall not be sentenced to death The probability that the accused would not commit criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to society The probability that the accused can be reformed and rehabilitated The <ORG> shall by evidence prove that the accused does not satisfy the conditions and above That the accused acted under the duress or domination of another person That the condition of the accused showed that he was mentally defective and that the said defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct Our capital sentencing jurisprudence is thin in the sense that there is very little objective discussion on aggravating and mitigating circumstances This court also gave primacy to mitigating circumstances in the final analysis Despite this it should be kept in mind that while imposing the rarest of rare punishment i death penalty the court must balance the mitigating and aggravating circumstances of the crime and it would depend upon particular and peculiar facts and circumstances of each case Even if presume that the general populace favours a liberal DP policy although there is no evidence to this effect we can not take note of it The arguments which may be relevant for sentencing with respect to various other punishments may cease to apply in light of the constitutional safeguards which come into operation when the question relates to extinguishment of life If there are two considerations the one which has a constitutional origin shall be favoured When Judges acting individually or collectively in their benign anxiety to do what they think is morally good for the people take upon themselves the responsibility of setting down social norms of conduct there is every danger despite their effort to make a rational guess of the notions of right and wrong prevailing in the community at large and despite their intention to abide by the dictates of mere reason that they might write their own peculiar view or personal predilection into the law sincerely mistaking that changeling for what they perceive to be the Community ethic Justice <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> also opined on similar lines The very purpose of a bill of rights was to withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts Second there is a significant but much neglected distinction between people sweeping impressions of sentencing and their views in relation to particular cases of which they know the facts But who should be the target of such explanation and education We have serious doubts whether attempts to reach the ordinary citizen directly will have any impact at all In fact the case where there is overwhelming public opinion favouring death penalty would be an acid test of the constitutional propriety of capital sentencing process the <ORG> observation in this context was subsequently followed noting The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core of the criminal law as administered in India which invests the judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment The only effect is that the application of those principles is now to be guided by the paramount beacons of legislative policy discernible from Sections and namely The extreme penalty can be inflicted only in gravest cases of extreme culpability In making choice of the sentence in addition to the circumstances of the offence due regard must be paid to the circumstances of the offender also This Court therein rejecting the argument that the conviction having been based in circumstantial evidence death penalty should not be awarded affirmed the death penalty awarded by the lower court On the one hand there appears a small band of cases in which the murder convict is sent to the gallows on confirmation of his death penalty by this <ORG> and on the other hand there is a much wider area of cases in which the offender committing murder of a similar or a far more revolting kind is spared his life due to lack of consistency by the <ORG> in giving punishments or worse the offender is allowed to slip away unpunished on account of the deficiencies in <ORG> The situation is unviable as legal discretion which is conferred on the executive or the judiciary is only sustainable in law if there is any indication either though law or precedent as to the scope of the discretion and the manner of its exercise At the very outset <NAME> supra delineated the scope of the matter in the following terms The principal questions that fall to be considered in this case are i Whether death penalty provided for the offence of murder in Section Penal Code is unconstitutional Secondly owing to separation of power doctrine the court took a deferential view towards section which was brought in to discipline the courts on death penalty by making life imprisonment the rule and death penalty exception for more on forum of principle for more on justice and sentencing see <NAME> and <NAME> The Sentencing Theory Debate Convergence in Outcomes Divergence in Reasoning Proportionate Sentencing Exploring The Principles <ORG> There is a fundamental relationship between the legitimacy of sentence belonging to a particular potency and the reasons accorded by the court to justify the same gave some very good illustrations from a number of recent decisions in which on similar facts this Court took contrary views on giving death penalty to the convict see paragraphs to pp He finally observed that courts in the matter of sentencing act differently although the fact situation may appear to be somewhat similar and further it is evident that different benches had taken different view in the matter <NAME> in his order passed in this appeal said that he did not agree with the decision in <NAME> in that it held that death sentence was not to be awarded in a case of circumstantial evidence <NAME> may be right that there can not be an absolute rule excluding death sentence in all cases of circumstantial evidence though in <NAME>a it is said normally and not as an absolute rule On the one hand there appears a small band of cases in which the murder convict is sent to the gallows on confirmation of his death penalty by this <ORG> and on the other hand there is a much wider area of cases in which the offender committing murder of a similar or a far more revolting kind is spared his life due to lack of consistency by the <ORG> in giving punishments or worse the offender is allowed to slip away unpunished on account of the deficiencies in <ORG> THE RAREST OF RARE CASES <NAME> supra laid down its fundamental threshold in the following terms A real and abiding concern for the dignity of human life postulates resistance to taking a life through law instrumentality There is a difference between encroaching upon rights for the purpose of punishment and destroying them altogether In every capital sentence case it must be borne in mind that the threshold of rarest of rare cases is informed by Article and owing to the inherent nature of death penalty In <NAME> at the court held that there is a corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific case In a frequently cited passage <NAME> described the components of proportionality as follows There are in my view three important components of a proportionality test Where the <ORG> cannot show that it had a reasonable basis for concluding that it has complied with the requirement of minimal impairment in seeking to attain its objectives the legislation will be struck down While chosing for one option or the other these constitutional principles must be borne in mind Principle of prudence enunciated by <NAME> supra is sound counsel on this count which shall stand us in good stead whenever in the given circumstances there is difference of opinion with respect to any sentencing prop rationale or subjectivity involved in the determining factors or lack of thoroughness in complying with the sentencing procedure it would be advisable to fall in favour of the rule of life imprisonment rather than invoking the exception of death punishment Thereafter he had left the place to finish his work and when he came back he found <NAME> lying in front of the toilet having sustained head injuries After hearing this he got very scared and told <NAME> that they must inform police and now the joke has gone too far On in the evening he received phone call of <NAME> asking him to come to Mumbai at Dadar immediately and threatened him that if he did not go as per his directions to Mumbai he will inform his name to the police Although the <ORG> judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> supra did not lay down any guidelines on determining which cases fall within the rarest of rare category yet the mitigating circumstances listed in and endorsed by the judgment gives reform and rehabilitation great importance even requiring the state to prove that this would not be possible as a precondition before the court awarded a death sentence There is nothing before us that shows that the appellant cannot reform and be rehabilitated Although the increasing number of cases which affect the society may hold some value for the sentencing court but it cannot give a complete go by to the legal principle laid down by this court in <NAME> supra that each case has to be considered on its own facts Moreover the court in that case too recognized that proper and due regard must be given to the mitigating circumstances in every case For the purpose of imposing death penalty that factor may have to be kept in mind It must be noted that the discretion given to the court in such cases assumes onerous importance and its exercise becomes extremely difficult because of the irrevocable character of death penalty One of the principles which we think is clear is that the case is such where two views ordinarily could be taken imposition of death sentence would not be appropriate but where there is no other option and it is shown that reformation is not possible death sentence may be imposed We do not think that the reasons assigned by the courts below disclose any special reason to uphold the death penalty There are no special reasons to record the death penalty and the mitigating factors in the present case discussed previously are in our opinion sufficient to place it out of the rarest of rare category
