On complaints an enquiry was instituted into the affairs of the society by the Registrar of <ORG> and as a result the committee then in management of the society was after due notice to show cause and a hearing superseded by the Registrar Thereupon the appellant filed a petition in <ORG> for the issue of a writ of prohibition under Art On appeal by special leave it was contended by the appellant that the Registrar should have proceeded under and not under of the Act the dispute about the retention of money belonging to the Society by the appellant was not a dispute touching the business of the society and the transaction of sale which gave rise to the commission alleged to be improperly retained was illegal and that therefore the society could not in law make a claim on the basis of such an illegal transaction Besides the factors that the claim was one against a person in management of the society and for the fraudulent retention of money or other property of the society there was also another condition which had to be satisfied before could be attracted The facts giving rise to the charge had to be disclosed in the course of an audit under or am enquiry under or an inspection under a or on the winding up of the society There were complaints regarding the working of the <ORG> and accordingly an enquiry was instituted into its affairs by the Registrar of <ORG> Madras at a time when Anakapalli now in Andhra Pradesh was in the State of Madras As a result of the facts disclosed in the inquiry the Committee then in management of the <ORG> was after due notice to show cause and a hearing superseded by order of the Registrar dated February such supersession being authorised by of the Madras <ORG> Act Act of hereinafter called die Act Immediately this order was passed the appellant filed a petition in <ORG> Andhra Pradesh for the issue of a writ of prohibition under Art The learned Single Judge who heard the petition allowed the petition and granted the appellant the relief he sought Thereafter the appellant moved this Court for special leave certificate of fitness having been refused by <ORG> and has preferred the present appeal Before adverting to the arguments addressed to us by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant it is necessary to state a few facts concerning the transactions which have given rise to these proceedings This gave occasion for the members of the <ORG> to sell their jaggery at higher prices than fixed because there was demand for jaggery from merchants at prices higher than the controlled price The first was that the transaction on the basis of which the claim was said to have arisen was illegal being contrary to the Gur Control Order issued by <ORG> under the Essential Supplies Act and such an illegal transaction could not fall within the words Dispute touching the business of the <ORG> which alone could be referred to arbitration under of the Act the second was that the reference by the Registrar of the dispute to the arbitration of the Deputy Registrar was illegal as contrary to natural justice because a the Deputy Registrar had conducted an enquiry which had resulted in the supersession of the management of the <ORG> under of the Act and the Deputy Registrar being a subordinate of the Registrar could not be expected to act fairly in this matter and lastly that the Registrar should in this case have proceeded under of the Act and not under the former being more advantageous to him in that he could challenge any final order against him by resort to the civil courts where as an award under was subject to departmental appeals and could not be questioned in a civil court On appeal the learned Judges of <ORG> have as stated earlier rejected all the three points urged on behalf of the appellant Section which learned counsel says was attracted to the case runs to quote only the material provision Sup Where in the course of an audit under section or an inquiry under section or an inspection under section or the winding up of a society it appears that any person who has taken part in the organization or management of the society or any past or present officer of the society has misappropriated or fraudulently retained any money or other property or been guilty of breach of trust in relation to the society the Registrar may of his own motion or on the application of the committee or liquidator or of any creditor or contributory examine into the conduct of such person or officer and make an order requiring him to repay or restore the money or property or any part thereof with interest at such rate as the Registrar thinks just or to contribute such sum to the assets of the society by way of compensation in respect of the misappropriation fraudulent retention or breach of trust as the Registrar thinks just Section on the other hand dealt with special types of disputes which arise in exceptional circumstances segregated out of the larger group dealt with under When there was thus an overlapping of the terms of both the sections the provisions of alone it was held would be applicable Besides the two factors to which learned counsel referred and which we have just set out there is also another condition which has to be satisfied before could be attracted The facts giving rise to the charge have to be disclosed in the course of an audit under or an enquiry under or an inspection under or on the winding up of the <ORG> ted however submitted that there was an enquiry under preceding the supersession and that in consequence the condition was fulfilled It is true that there was an enquiry conducted the affairs of the <ORG> under but that by itself is not sufficient It is not therefore possible to say that there is correspondence between the facts disclosed in that report as a result of the enquiry under and those found in the Statement of Claim which was referred by the Registrar to the Deputy Registrar for arbitration under In so far as it impinges on the third point urged by learned counsel based on the maxim Ex turpi causa non oritur actio we shall deal with it in considering that submission Apart therefore from the question of illegality raised by reason of the sale being it prices in excess of the controlled price The last of the points urged by learned counsel was that the transaction of sale which gave rise to the commission alleged to be improperly retained was illegal and that therefore the <ORG> could not in law make a claim on the basis of such an illegal transaction We see no substance in this point either Before parting with this case however there is one matter to which it is necessary to advert Mr <NAME> pointed out to us that the correctness of the allegations made in the claim filed before the arbitrator have yet to be decided and there was therefore no justification for the learned Judges assuming that the facts stated therein were proved and that the appellant had been guilty of fraud or dishonesty in his conduct of the business of the <ORG> We see force in this complaint of learned counsel It is clear that they did not intend to prejudice the appellant in his defence before the Deputy Registrar in the arbitration proceedings under of the Act but it is possible that it might have such an effect
