The Director of the Academy without holding an enquiry into the alleged misconduct recommended to the <ORG> that the appellant should be discharged from service The appellant challenged the validity of the order under Art The appellant contended that the order discharging him was in reality an order terminating his services on the ground of misconduct and as such could not have been passed without holding an enquiry as contemplated under Art If the <ORG> holds that the order though in the form is merely a determination of employment is in reality a cloak for an order of punishment the <ORG> would not be debarred merely because of the form of the order in giving effect to the rights conferred by law upon the employee In the instant case on going through the record and taking into account all the attendant circumstances the <ORG> is satisfied that the alleged act of misconduct on June was the real foundation for the action taken against the appellant and that the other instances stated in the course of the counter affidavit are mere allegations which are put forward only for purposes of strengthening the defence which is otherwise very weak They all reached the place minutes late i by A when the rains had abated and the parade commenced at A It appears that earlier when a messenger sent by the Assistant Director had gone to call the probationers they had asked for a vehicle to go to the place as it was raining When the appellant was asked about the incident he gave his explanation to the Director of <ORG> which read thus To The Director <ORG> Hyderabad Thanking you Yours sincerely sd <NAME> It would appear that the Director without holding an enquiry into the alleged misconduct recommended to <ORG> that the appellant should be discharged from the service The order of discharge will take effect from the date of which it is served on the said <NAME> sd NARENDRA PRASAD DIRECTOR On receipt of the above order of discharge the appellant made a representation on November to <ORG> to reconsider the matter Thereafter he filed a petition under Article of the Constitution before <ORG> contending that the order of discharge was violative of Article and Article of the Constitution That petition was dismissed by <ORG> at the stage of admission on August after hearing the counsel for <ORG> Against the judgment of <ORG> the appellant has filed this appeal with special leave under Article of the Constitution The main contention of the appellant before us is that the order discharging the petitioner though on the face of it appears to carry no stigma is in reality an order terminating his service on the ground of misconduct alleged to have been committed by him on June in acting as one of the ring leaders who were responsible for the delay of about twenty two minutes in the arrival of the probationers at the Gymnasium and that such an order could not have been passed without holding an enquiry as contemplated under Article of the Constitution and the relevant rules governing such an enquiry He has also contended that the order is based on conjunctures and surmises and by way of illustration he has referred us to paragraph of the counter affidavit which reads thus Para The petitioner did not conduct himself fully in accordance with the prescribed rules and regulations during his training period I deny the rest of the allegations and reiterate the averments made in para of the petition The learned counsel for the parties have cited a number of decisions before us in support of their respective cases on going through them we are of the view that there is not much divergence in them as to the true legal principles to be followed in matters of this nature but the real problem appears to be one of application of those principles in a given case in determining whether the particular action taken amounts to a punishment attracting Article of the Constitution or a mere discharge simpliciter not requiring the holding of an enquiry as contemplated under Article We shall now deal with two leading cases having a bearing or the question before us <ORG> this Court after an elaborate consideration of the relevant provisions of the Constitution and judicial decisions cited before them observed The net result is that it is only in these cases there the Government intends to inflict those three forms of punishments that the Government servant must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to he taken in regard to them It follows therefore that if the termination of service is sought to be brought about otherwise than by way of punishment then the Government servant whose service is so terminate cannot claim the protection of Art and the decisions cited before us and referred to above in so far as they lay down that principle must be held to be rightly decided The foregoing conclusion however does not solve the entire problem for it has yet to be ascertained as to when an order for the termination of service is inflicted as and by way of punishment and when it is not Where a person is appointed to a permanent post in a <ORG> service on probation the termination of his service during or at the end of the period of probation will not ordinarily and by itself be a punishment for the <ORG> servant so appointed has no right to continue to hold such a post any more than the servant employed on probation by a private employer is entitled to do Such a termination does not operate as a forfeiture of any right of the servant to hold the post for he has no such right and obviously cannot be a dismissal removal or reduction in rank by way of punishment It does not however follow that except in the three cases mentioned above in all other cases termination of service of a <ORG> servant who has no right to his post where he was appointed to a post temporary or permanent either on probation or on an officiating basis and had not acquired a quasi permanent status the termination cannot in any circumstances be a dismissal or removal from service by way of punishment In short if the termination of service is founded on the right flowing from contract or the service rules then prima facie the termination is not a punishment and carries with it no evil consequences and so Art But even if the Government has by contract or under the rules the right to terminate the employment without going through the procedure prescribed for inflicting the punishment of dismissal or removal or reduction in rank the Government may nevertheless choose to punish the servant and if the termination of service is sought to be founded on misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualification then it is a punishment and the requirements of Art For purposes of the present appeal it is sufficient if we refer to the case pertaining to <NAME> who was at the material time serving as probationer in <ORG> <ORG> By an order dated December his services were terminated The said order did not contain any statement which would attach any stigma to the career of the officer concerned It read as follows On the recommendation of <ORG> and Haryana the Governor of Punjab is pleased dispense with the services of Shri <NAME> Judicial Branch with immediate effect under Rule in Part of the Punjab Civil Services Judicial Branch Rules as amended from time to time Rule of the Punjab Civil service Judicial Branch Rules relied on in the above order provided that on the completion of the period of probation of any member of the service the Governor might on the recommendation of <ORG> confirm him in his appointment if he was working against a permanent vacancy or if his were or conduct was reported by <ORG> to be unsatisfactory dispense with his services or revert him to his former substantive post if any or extend his period of probation and thereafter pass such orders as he could have passed on the expiry of the first period of probation In this case <NAME> Observed in the course of his judgment thus No abstract proposition can be laid down that where the services of a probationer are terminated without saying anything more in the order of termination than that the services are terminated it can never amount to a punishment in the facts and circumstances of the case If a probationer is discharged on the ground of misconduct or inefficiency or for similar reason without a proper enquiry and without his getting a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against his discharge it may in a given case amount to removal from service within the meaning of Article of the Con Before a probationer is confirmed the authority concerned is under an obligation to consider whether the work of the probationer is satisfactory or whether he is suitable for the post In the absence of any Rules governing a probationer in this respect the authority may come to the conclusion that on account of inadequacy for the job for any temperamental or other object not involving moral turpitude the probationer is unsuitable for the job and hence must be discharged Even an innocuously worded order terminating the service may in the fact and circumstances of the case establish that an enquiry into allegations of serious and grave character of misconduct involving stigma has been made in infraction of the provision That is exactly what has happened in the case of <NAME> <NAME> who agreed with the learned Chief Justice had at the end of this judgment this to say Again could it be that if you summarily pack off a probationer the order is judicially unscrutable and immune If you conscientiously seek to satisfy yourself about allegations by some sort of enquiry you get caught in the coils of law however harmlessly the order may be phrased And so this sphinx complex has had to give way in later cases In some cases the rule of guidance has been stated to be the substance of the matter and the foundation of the order When does motive trespass into foundation When do we lift the veil of form to touch the substance When the Court says so These Freudian frontiers obviously fail in the work a day world and Dr <NAME> observations in this context are not without force As pointed out by us in all these cases including the case of <NAME> supra the principle applied is the one enunciated by <NAME> case supra which we have referred to earlier <ORG> is urged relying upon the observation in <NAME> case supra that it is only when there is a full scale Departmental enquiry envisaged by Article of the Constitution i an enquiry officer is appointed a charge sheet submitted explanation called for and considered any termination made thereafter will attract the operation of Article It is significant that in the very same decision it is stated that the circumstances preceding or attendant on the order of termination of service have to be examined in each case the motive behind it being immaterial As observed by <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> case supra the form of the order is not decisive as to whether the order is by way of punishment and that even an innocuously worded order terminating the service may in the fact and circumstances of the case establish that an enquiry into allegations of serious and grave character of misconduct involving stigma has been made in infraction of the provision of Article If the <ORG> holds that the order though in the form is merely a determination of employment is in reality a cloak for an order of punishment the <ORG> would not be debarred merely because of the form of the order in giving effect to the rights conferred by law upon the employee The recommendation of the Director which is the basis or foundation for the order should be read along with the order for the purpose of determining its true character On reading the two together the <ORG> reaches the conclusion that the alleged act of misconduct was the cause of the order and that but for that incident it would not have been passed then it is inevitable that the order of discharge should fall to the ground as the appellant has not been afforded a reasonable opportunity to defend himself as provided ill Article of the Constitution In fact in the very first reply he gave to the Director on being asked about the incident which took place on June the appellant stated I sincerely regret the lapse Neither in the letter which the Director first wrote to <ORG> nor in the counter affidavit filed in this <ORG> due importance has been given to the said expression of regret and it is further seen that no additional lapse on the part of the appellant between June and the date on which the Director wrote the letter to <ORG> which would show that the appellant had not shown any sign of repentance is pointed out although there is a reference to his reporting to duty late on an earlier date on June A narration of the facts of the case leaves no doubt that the alleged act of misconduct on June was the real foundation for the action taken against the appellant and that the other instances stated in the course of the counter affidavit are mere allegations which are put forward only for purposes of strengthening the defence which is otherwise very weak We accordingly set aside the judgment of <ORG> and the impugned order dated November discharging the appellant from service He is also entitled to all consequential benefits including the appropriate year of allotment and the arrears of salary and allowances upto the date of his reinstatement Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case we feel that the parties should be directed to bear their own costs
