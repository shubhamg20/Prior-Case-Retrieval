The issues raised in the writ petition concern all residents in the State of Assam whose rights as citizens of India have been materially and gravely prejudiced by the operation of the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunals Act hereinafter referred to as the IMDT Act According to the census figures which have been given in the writ petition the rate of growth of the population in Assam is far more than rest of India which shows that large number of foreigners have migrated to different areas of Assam and have settled there It is further pleaded that after signing of the Assam Accord several assurances were given and statements have been made by <ORG> that it is examining the failure of the IMDT Act regarding detection and deportation of foreigners and it is considering steps to repeal the Act In a meeting held on th September between Union Home Minister Chief Minister of Assam and representatives of <ORG> the student union reiterated their demand for repeal of the IMDT Act which demand was noted and an assurance was given that <ORG> would initiate discussions with other political parties A meeting was again held on th March between the representatives of the <ORG> and <ORG> of Assam and also of <ORG> wherein it was assured that the repeal of the IMDT Act was under active consideration of <ORG> and measures would be taken to identify foreigners and steps will be taken to seal the border Accordingly a circular was issued by <ORG> on setting out guidelines for action to be taken in respect of persons who had come to India from Bangladesh In paragraph of the counter affidavit it is stated that a proposal to repeal the IMDT Act is under consideration of <ORG> and in paragraph it is stated that there is need for a uniform Act for detection and deportation of foreigners for the entire country including Assam Paragraph of the counter affidavit which has a bearing on the controversy in hand is being reproduced below In paragraph of the counter affidavit the major impediment in implementation of the IMDT Act have been pointed out in detail and it is also averred that the Act is discriminatory as it has been made applicable only to the State of Assam and not to other States like West Bengal Tripura and Meghalaya etc Copies of several communications sent to <ORG> by the State of Assam requesting for repeal of the IMDT Act and also seeking appropriate amendment to the Citizenship Act in order to declare the children of the illegal migrants entering into India after as foreigners have also been filed <ORG> is of the opinion that the IMDT Act is constitutional and there is no question of either repeal or striking down of the Act The aforesaid I A No of came up for consideration before <ORG> presided by the then Chief Justice of India on th October and the relevant portion of the order passed thereon is being reproduced below An application has been filed on behalf of the State of Assam seeking permission to file a new counter affidavit The application is supported by an affidavit of the Commissioner Secretary <ORG> <ORG> Learned counsel appearing for other parties have no objection to that course being adopted We therefore take on record the new affidavit as an additional affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> of Assam and reject prayer a All other parties may also file their response if any within the same period to the additional affidavit The relevant part of the opening part of the affidavit which has some relevance is being reproduced below In this context it is submitted that detection of illegal migrants who belong to the same ethnic stock as Indians is not an easy task It is also averred that there is no justification in the application of the IMDT Act to the State of Assam when the provisions of the Foreigners Act are quite effective for detection and deportation of illegal migrants foreigners which is applicable to the rest of the country Lastly it is prayed that the constitutional validity of the IMDT Act may be examined in the light and background of the above facts The petitioner has also filed a reply to the additional affidavit filed on behalf of the State of Assam where besides reiterating his earlier pleas it is averred that the <ORG> representatives from North East have themselves alluded to the problem of illegal migration in the past <ORG> has filed another affidavit on th November wherein it is averred that though in the earlier affidavit a prayer was made to examine the constitutional validity of the IMDT Act but on reconsideration <ORG> has taken a decision to retain the IMDT Act in present form in its application to the State of Assam There is a tendency to view illegal migration into Assam as a regional matter affecting only the people of Assam Muslim militant organization have mushroomed in Assam and there are reports of some Assamese Muslim youths having gone for training to Afghanistan and Kashmir Since extensive reference has been made in the affidavits to the Assam Accord it is necessary to notice the main provisions thereof The main clauses of the settlement which have a bearing on the case are being reproduced below MEMORANDUM OF SETTLEMENT Government have all along been most anxious to find a satisfactory solution to the problem of foreigners in Assam Subject to the provisions of sub sections and every person of Indian origin

registering authority as may be specified in such rules and if his name is included in any electoral roll for any <ORG> or Parliamentary constituency in force on the date of such detection his name shall be deleted therefrom Explanation In the case of every person seeking registration under this sub section the opinion of the <ORG> constituted under the Foreigners <ORG>s Order holding such person to be a foreigner shall be deemed to be sufficient proof of the requirement under clause of this sub section and if any question arises as to whether such person complies with any other requirement under this Sub section the registering authority shall i if such opinion contains a finding with respect to such other requirement decide the question in conformity with such finding ii if such opinion does not contain a finding with respect to such other requirement refer the question to a <ORG> constituted under the said Order having jurisdiction in accordance with such rules as the Central Government may make in this behalf under section and decide the question in conformity with the opinion received on such reference A person registered under sub section shall have as from the date on which he has been detected to be a foreigner and till the expiry of a period of ten years from that date the same rights and obligations as a citizen of India including the right to obtain a passport under the Passports Act and the obligations connected therewith but shall not be entitled to have his name included in any electoral roll for any <ORG> or <ORG> constituency at any time before the expiry of the said period of ten years Save as otherwise expressly provided in this section the provisions of this section shall have effect not withstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force Section of this Act read as under Burden of proof If any question arises with reference to this Act or any order made or direction given thereunder whether any person is or is not a foreigner or is or is not a foreigner of a particular class or description the onus of proving that such person is not a foreigner or is not a foreigner of such particular class or description as the case may be shall notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Evidence Act lie upon such person Sub Section of Section lays down that <ORG> may by order make provision either generally or with respect to all foreigners or with respect to any particular foreigner or any prescribed class or description of foreigner for prohibiting regulating or restricting the entry of foreigners into India or their departure therefrom or their presence or continued presence therein Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section sub section confers power to make wide ranging orders concerning a foreigner which have been numerated in clauses a to which include that a foreigner shall not remain in India or in any prescribed area therein or if he has been required by an order under this Section not to remain in India meet from any resources at his disposal the cost of his removal from India or remain in such area as may be prescribed and shall comply with such condition as may be specified or shall be arrested or detained or confined Sub section provides that any authority prescribed in this behalf may with respect to any particular foreigner make orders under clause or clause of sub section Section confers power for directing a foreigner to be detained or confined in such place and manner as <ORG> by order determine Section casts an obligation on master of any vessel and pilot of any aircraft landing or embarking at any place in India to give particulars with respect to any passenger or members of any crew who are foreigners Section casts a similar obligation on hotel keepers in respect of foreigners accommodated therein Section confers power upon any authority who has been conferred power to make or give any direction under the Act to further delegate to any subordinate authority to exercise such power on its behalf Section A and which have been added by the aforesaid amendment provide for punishment with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than two years but may extend to eight years Burden of proof If in any case not falling under section any question arises with reference to this Act or any order made or direction given thereunder whether any person is or is not a foreigner or is or is not a foreigner of a particular class or description the onus of proving that such person is not a foreigner or is not a foreigner of such particular class or description as the case may be shall notwithstanding anything contained in the Indian Evidence Act lie upon such person This Act confers wide ranging powers to deal with all foreigners or with respect to any particular foreigner or any prescribed class or description of foreigner for prohibiting regulating or restricting their or his entry into India or their presence or continued presence including his arrest detention and confinement The most important provision is Section which casts the burden of proving that a person is not a foreigner or is not a foreigner of such particular class or description as the case may be shall lie upon such person He challenged the order before <ORG> which set aside the order by observing that there must be prima facie material on the basis of which the authority can proceed to pass an order under Section of the Foreigners Act <ORG> has made the Foreigners <ORG>s Order in exercise of powers conferred by Section of the Foreigners Act Clause of this Order provides that <ORG> may by order refer the question as to whether a person is or is not a foreigner within the meaning of Foreigners Act to a <ORG> to be constituted for the purpose for its opinion Clause provides that the <ORG> shall serve on the person to whom the question relates a copy of the main grounds on which he is alleged to be a foreigner and give him a reasonable opportunity of making a representation and producing evidence in support of his case and after considering such evidence as may be produced and after hearing such persons as may deserve to be heard the <ORG> shall submit its opinion to the officer or authority specified in this behalf in the order of reference Clause A provides that the <ORG> shall before giving its opinion on the question referred to in sub paragraph A of paragraph give the person in respect of whom the opinion is sought a reasonable opportunity to represent his case Clause provides that the <ORG> shall have the powers of <ORG> while trying a suit under the Code of Civil Procedure in respect of summoning and enforcing the attendance of any person and examining him on oath requiring the discovery and production of any document and issuing commissions for the examination of any witness A person seeking to enter the United Kingdom and claiming to have the right of abode there shall prove that he has that right by means of either a a United Kingdom passport describing him as a British citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies having the right of abode in the United Kingdom or a certificate of entitlement Somewhat similar provision is contained in Immigration and Nationality Act of USA and Section places the burden of proof upon the person concerned in any removal proceeding The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act of Canada contains a provision of placing the burden upon the concerned person to establish his right to have a permanent residence in the said country There is good and sound reason for placing the burden of proof upon the person concerned who asserts to be a citizen of a particular country Though in a criminal case the general rule is that the burden of proof is on the prosecution but if any fact is especially within the knowledge of the accused he has to lead evidence to prove the said fact Paragraph On the principle underlying Evidence Act the burden to establish those facts is cast on the person concerned and if he fails to establish or explain those facts an adverse inference of facts may arise against him which coupled with the presumptive evidence adduced by the prosecution or the <ORG> would rebut the initial presumption of innocence in favour of that person and in the result prove him guilty In this case reference is made to some earlier decisions and it will be useful to notice the same In <NAME> <NAME> LT the learned Judge held as under On the principle laid down in Turner and numerous other cases where it is an offence to do an act without lawful authority the person who sets up the lawful authority must prove it and the prosecution need not prove the absence of lawful authority Clause of sub Section A of the Citizenship Act defines detected to be a foreigner and it means detected to be a foreigner in accordance with the provisions of the Foreigners Act and the Foreigners <ORG>s Order by a <ORG> constituted under the said Order The learned Additional Solicitor General and Shri <NAME> learned senior counsel for the State of Assam have made a statement that such <ORG>s are actually functioning in the State of Assam After taking into account the need for their speedy detection the need for protection of genuine citizens of India and the interests of the general public the President promulgated on the th October the Illegal Migrants Determination by Tribunals Ordinance to provide for the establishment of Tribunals The Preamble of the Act which finally came into force on th December reads as under An Act to provide for the establishment of Tribunals for the determination in a fair manner of the question whether a person is an illegal migrant to enable <ORG> to expel

person may make an application to <ORG> for decision by a <ORG> as to whether the person whose name and other particulars are given in the application is or is not an illegal migrant and where any such application is received by <ORG> it may on the basis of any information in its possession or after making such inquiry as it deems fit reject the application on the ground that the application is frivolous or vexatious or it does not comply with the requirements of this section or refer such application to a <ORG> for decision Every application made under sub section shall be made in such form and in such manner as may be prescribed and shall be accompanied by a declaration by another person residing within the jurisdiction of the same revenue sub division in which the applicant resides in such form as may be prescribed to the effect that the particulars mentioned in the application are true to his knowledge information and belief Provided that no person shall make more than ten such applications or more than ten such declarations Procedure with respect to references under sub section of section On receipt of a reference under sub section of section or sub section of section A the <ORG> shall serve on the person named in such reference a notice accompanied by a copy of such reference calling upon him to make within a period of thirty days from the date of receipt of such notice such representation with regard to the averments made in the reference and to produce such evidence as he may think fit in support of his defence Provided that if the <ORG> is satisfied that the person aforesaid was prevented by sufficient cause from making his representation and from producing evidence in support of his defence within the said period of thirty days it may permit him to make his representation and to produce evidence in support of his defence within such further period not exceeding thirty days as it may by order specify On receipt of an application under sub section of section the <ORG> shall issue a notice accompanied by a copy of the application to the prescribed authority calling upon it to furnish after making such inquiry as that authority may deem fit a report to the <ORG> with regard to the averments made in the application If on a consideration of the report made by the prescribed authority the <ORG> is satisfied that a the person named in the application is not an illegal migrant or that the applicant is frivolous or vexatious or has not been made in good faith the <ORG> shall after giving the applicant an opportunity to be heard reject the application there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person named in the application is an illegal migrant the <ORG> shall issue a notice accompanied by a copy of the application to the person named in the application calling upon him to make within thirty days from the date of receipt of the notice such representation with regard to the averments made in the application and to produce such evidence as he may think fit in support of his defence Provided that if the <ORG> is satisfied that the person aforesaid was prevented by sufficient cause from making his representation and from producing evidence in support of his defence within the said period of thirty days it may permit him to make his representation and to produce evidence in support of his defence within such further period not exceeding thirty days as it may by order specify Determination of the question as to whether a person is an illegal migrant The Tribunal to which a reference has been made under section or section A or to which an application has been made under section shall after taking such evidence as may be adduced before it and after making such inquiry as it may think fit and after hearing such persons as it may deem appropriate by order decide the question as to whether the person named in such reference or application as the case may be is or is not an illegal migrant Provided that where for the determination of such question in any case the decision on any issue renders any decision on any other issue or issues unnecessary the <ORG> may not decide such other issue or issues Where the members of the <ORG> differ on their opinion on any point the Chairman of the <ORG> shall state the point or points on which they differ and make a reference to the President of the Appellate <ORG> which exercises jurisdiction in relation to the <ORG> who shall refer the case for hearing on such point or points by a member of another <ORG> under its jurisdiction and such point or points shall be decided according to the opinion of that member and such decision shall be deemed to be the decision of the <ORG> Every order passed under sub section shall subject to the decision of <ORG> be final and shall not be called in question in any Court Appeal The Central Government or any person named in a reference or an application under section or any application under sub section of that section or any person named in a reference under section A may if it or he is not satisfied with any order made by a <ORG> under section prefer an appeal to the Appellate <ORG> against such order Expulsion of illegal migrant Where a person has been determined by a <ORG> or as the case may be by the Appellate <ORG> to be an illegal migrant <ORG> shall by order served on such person direct such person to

think fit and only a person who is or has been a Judge of <ORG> is eligible to be appointed as member thereof Section A provides that it shall be lawful for the police officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police if he is satisfied that the circumstances so require and for reasons to be recorded in writing direct any person against whom a reference or an application has been made under this Act to enter into a bond with or without sureties for making himself available for inquiry Section provides that any person who contravenes or attempts to contravene or fails to comply with any order or direction given under Section or harbours any such person shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to three years and with fine which shall not be less than two thousand rupees In exercise of powers conferred by Section of the IMDT Act <ORG> has made the Illegal Migrants Determination by <ORG>s Rules hereinafter referred to as the Rules Rules to lay down that the inquiry officer who has been directed to make an inquiry shall call upon that person alleged illegal migrant to give information as regards the particulars mentioned in Form I The details of the inquiry have to be entered day by day in a diary kept for the purpose setting forth the time at which any information reached him the time at which he began and closed his enquiry and the place or places visited by him and the statement of the circumstances ascertained through such enquiry and then he has to submit a report in Form II with the diary to the immediate superior officer who shall endorse the comments thereon and submit it to <ORG> Rule provides that if on recommendations of <ORG> and such further information as the competent authority may call for it appears to that authority that the question arises as to whether any person is or is not an illegal migrant that authority shall make a reference to the <ORG> for its decision thereon along with the diary report of inquiry officer containing the endorsement of his immediate superior officer recommendation of <ORG> and any other further information If <ORG> chooses not to make a reference there is no right of appeal and the alleged illegal migrant remains untouched Rules and A provide that the application to the <ORG> under Section shall be in Form III and to <ORG> under Section A in Form Rule provides that <NAME> shall as far as may be follow the procedure as specified in Rules to while making an inquiry in respect of a notice issued to him by the <ORG> under Section Rules to lay down the procedure for filing appeals to the Appellate <ORG> which has to be in Form IV the fee to be paid and also the contents of the Memorandum of Appeal etc Section of the IMDT Act is an overriding provision which lays down that the IMDT Act or the Rule or order made therein shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Foreigners Act or the Immigrants Expulsion from Assam Act or the Passport Act or any Rule or Order made thereunder Section confers power on <ORG> to make a reference for its decision to the <ORG> whether any person is an illegal migrant or not This provision gives special advantage to an illegal migrant in Assam which is not available to any foreigner in rest of India Section provides that any person may make an application to the <ORG> whether any person whose name is given in the application is or is not an illegal migrant but the proviso to this sub section imposes a restriction that such an application can be given only by a person who lives within the jurisdiction of the same police station in which the alleged illegal migrant is found or resides Section imposes some further conditions and restrictions namely that the application shall be accompanied by affidavits sworn by not less than two persons residing within the jurisdiction of the same police station in which the alleged illegal migrant is found or is residing and a Court Fee of Rs has to be paid Section A lays down that any person may make an application to <ORG> for decision by a <ORG> as to whether the person whose name and other particulars are given in the application is or is not an illegal migrant In view of sub section of this Section the application has to be accompanied by a declaration by another person residing within the jurisdiction of the same revenue sub division in which the applicant resides and further conditions are imposed that no person shall make more than ten such applications or more than ten such declarations In view of the language used in Section there is no right of appeal against such an order as right of appeal is conferred only against an order passed by the <ORG> under Section If <ORG> makes a reference it will only initiate the proceedings before the <ORG> causing no immediate prejudice to the illegal migrant and if the <ORG> ultimately holds against him he will have a right of appeal to the Appellate <ORG> There is no question of his telling his date of entry or giving any information on the aforesaid points It is far more easier to secure conviction of a person in a criminal trial where he may be awarded a capital punishment or imprisonment for life than to establish that a person is an illegal migrant on account of extremely difficult cumbersome and time consuming procedure laid down in the IMDT Act and the Rules made thereunder The Act does not contain any provision for constitution of a screening committee which has been done under the Rules and has been conferred a very wide power of rejecting complaints against which no appeal lies Not every person feels that he owes a duty towards the nation and he should initiate proceedings for deportation of an illegal migrant Similarly there is hardly any sense in making a provision for mentioning the time and date of visit to a place by an enquiry officer in a diary Similarly <ORG> consists of two members who are or have been Judge of <ORG> The argument overlooks the fact that <ORG> does not consist of any judicial member but is manned by the executive But <ORG> or <ORG> have the power to reject an enquiry at the threshold by not making a reference to the <ORG> ii There is no provision in IMDT Act for compelling the suspect to furnish particulars required in Form No I of IMDT Rules and a corresponding penal provision to deal with such suspect in case of their refusal to furnish information as required in Rule iii There is no provision for compelling suspect witness to furnish information or statement to Police Officers making enquiries and as such taking recourse to action under Section is difficult in case of refusal xi There are instances of strong resistance to the Enquiry Officer conducting enquiries against the illegal migrants in Char areas riverain areas and other locations where there is heavy concentration of immigrant population Section of the IMDT Act provides that contravention or non compliance of any order made under Section shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may not be less than one year but which may extend to three years and with fine which shall not be less than two thousand rupees Section of the Foreigners Act after amendment by Act No of provides for imprisonment which may extend to five years and fine The Government has also a duty to prevent any internal disturbance and maintain law and order Various meanings to the word have been given in the dictionaries like an assault an inroad the practice of setting upon anyone an offensive action or procedure the practice of making attacks or encroachments the action of a nation in violating the rights especially the territorial rights of another nation overt destruction covert hostile attitudes On account of use of expression acts of aggression it was thought necessary to define aggression and explain what it exactly means There are many reasons for holding this view Certain observations made in the judgment which is reported in <NAME> vs United States are very illuminating and are being reproduced below To preserve its independence and give security against foreign aggression and encroachment is the highest duty of every nation and to attain these ends nearly all other considerations are to be subordinated The word aggression is therefore an all comprehensive word having very wide meaning The Governor of Assam in his report dated th November sent to the President of India has clearly said that unabated influx of illegal migrants of Bangladesh into Assam has led to a perceptible change in the demographic pattern of the State and has reduced the Assamese people to a minority in their own State The report is by a person who has held the high and responsible position of Deputy Chief of <ORG> and is very well equipped to recognize the potential danger or threat to the security of the nation by the unabated influx and continued presence of Bangladeshi nationals in India It therefore becomes the duty of <ORG> to take all measures for protection of the State of Assam from such external aggression and internal disturbance as enjoined in Article of the Constitution We have considered the provisions of the Foreigners Act Foreigners Tribunals Order and also the IMDT Act and the Rules made thereunder in considerable detail in the earlier part of the judgment On the contrary it is coming to the advantage of such illegal migrants as any proceedings initiated against them under the said provision which as demonstrated above almost entirely ends in their favour enables them to have a document having official sanctity to the effect that they are not illegal migrants Proviso of this Section says that it will not apply to any person who on account of civil disturbances or the fear of such disturbances in any area now forming part of Pakistan has been displaced from his place of residence in such area and who has been subsequently residing in Assam Section confers power on <ORG> to delegate the powers and duties conferred upon it by Section to any officers subordinate to <ORG> It may be noted that the reference to the word East Bangal in the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the aforesaid Act which came into force on st March meant East Pakistan which is the present Bangladesh Sub section of Section of this Act conferred power upon <ORG> to make rules requiring that persons entering India shall be in possession of passports and for all matters ancillary or incidental to that purpose Sub section of this Section says that without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section the rules may prohibit the entry into India or any part thereof of any person who has not in his possession a passport issued to him and also prescribe the authorities by whom passports must have been issued or renewed and the conditions which they must comply for the purposes of the Act Sub section lays down that the rules made under this Section may provide that any contravention thereof or of any order issued under the authority of any such rule shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three months or with fine or with both Section says that any officer of police not below the rank of Sub Inspector and any officer of the customs department empowered by a general or special order of <ORG> in this behalf may arrest without warrant any person who has contravened or against whom a reasonable suspicion exists that he has contravened any rule or order made under Section Section provides that <ORG> may by general or special order direct the removal of any person from India who in contravention of any rule made under Section prohibiting entry into India without passport has entered therein and thereupon any officer of the Government shall have all reasonable powers necessary to enforce such direction <ORG> also had the power to direct removal of any such person who had entered India in contravention of a rule made under Section prohibiting entry into India without a passport The above discussion leads to irresistible conclusion that the provisions of the IMDT Act and the Rules made thereunder clearly negate the constitutional mandate contained in Article of the Constitution where a duty has been cast upon the Union of India to protect every State against external aggression and internal disturbance <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the writ petitioner has submitted that the application of the IMDT Act to the State of Assam alone is wholly discriminatory and violates Article of the Constitution as the classification made is not founded upon any intelligible differentia and there is no nexus between the basis of the classification and the object of the IMDT Act We do not consider it necessary to refer to all the cases cited by learned counsel for the parties as the principle enunciated therein is basically the same and it will suffice to refer to only one such decision namely Kangshari Haldar supra where <NAME> as His Lordship then was held as under In considering the validity of the impugned statute on the ground that it violates Article it would first be necessary to ascertain the policy underlying the statute and the object intended to be achieved by it Section of the IMDT Act says that if any question arises as to whether any person is or is not an illegal migrant <ORG> may whether such question has arisen on a representation made by such person against an order under the Foreigners Act requiring him not to remain in India or to any other effect or has arisen in any other manner whatsoever refer such question to a <ORG> for decision This provision gives very special and advantageous right to an illegal migrant Even though an order may have been passed under the Foreigners Act against an illegal migrant he gets a right to make a representation to <ORG> for making a reference to the <ORG> which will then proceed in accordance with IMDT Act having a further right of appeal to the Appellate <ORG> According to learned counsel this amounts to violation of the rights guaranteed under Article of the Constitution as the people of Assam have a fundamental right to conserve their language script or culture Undoubtedly Article confers a fundamental right on all sections of the citizens residing in the territory of India or any part thereof having a distinct language script or culture of its own to conserve the same and any invasion of this right would be ultra vires Learned counsel has submitted that in view of the clear mandate of Article that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law there has to be a fair procedure for expulsion of foreigners The learned Additional Solicitor General and <NAME> during the course of their arguments have also laid great stress on the fact that the IMDT Act has been enacted to give protection to genuine Indian citizens and to save their harassment The view taken by this Court is that in a criminal trial where a person is prosecuted and punished for commission of a crime and may thus be deprived of his life or liberty it is not enough that he is prosecuted in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law but the procedure should be such which is just fair and reasonable This principle can have no application here for the obvious reason that in the matter of identification of a foreigner and his deportation he is not being deprived of his life or personal liberty We consider it necessary here to briefly notice the law regarding deportation of aliens as there appears to be some misconception about it and it has been argued with some vehemence that aliens also possess several rights and the procedure for their identification and deportation should be detailed and elaborate in order to ensure fairness to them This principle was reiterated in <NAME> vs United States where the court ruled The government of each state has always the right to compel foreigners who are found within its territory to go away by having them taken to the frontier He has not therefore been deprived of life liberty or property without due process of law and the provisions of the Constitution securing the right of trial by jury and prohibiting unreasonable searches and seizures and cruel and unusual punishments have no application This Court held that the power of <ORG> to expel foreigners is absolute and unlimited and there is no provision in the Constitution fettering its discretion and the executive government has unrestricted right to expel a foreigner So far as right to be heard is concerned there cannot be any hard and fast rule about the manner in which a person concerned has to be given an opportunity to place his case SCC following <NAME> supra it was held that the fundamental right of a foreigner is confined to Article for life and liberty and does not include the right to reside and stay in this country as mentioned in Article which is applicable only to the citizens of the country <ORG>s reserve the right to expel them from their territory and to refuse to grant them certain rights which are enjoyed by their own nationals like right to vote hold public office or to engage in political activities The learned Additional Solicitor General has also submitted that the vires of a special statute seeking to make some provisions or some defined object cannot be challenged by comparing its provisions with a general statute covering the field In our opinion the proposition urged by the learned Additional Solicitor General has no application to the fact situation of the present case But the Act so made contains such provisions and prescribes such procedure that it has become virtually impossible to detect and deport a foreigner which is evident from the statistical data furnished by the respondent themselves If an Act made by legislature has the disastrous effect of giving shelter and protection to foreign nationals who have illegally transgressed the international border and are residing in India and further the Act is unconstitutional any citizen is entitled to bring it to the notice of the <ORG> by filing a writ petition under Article of the Constitution There are any number of instances where such writ petitions have been entertained by this <ORG> at the instance of citizens who were not themselves personally aggrieved in the sense that there was no direct invasion of their own fundamental right In view of the finding that the competent authority and <ORG> had no authority or jurisdiction to reject any proceedings initiated against any alleged illegal migrant the orders of rejection passed by such authorities are declared to be void and non est in the eye of law
