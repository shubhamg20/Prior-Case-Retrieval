The appellant made an application under of the Payment of Wages Act claiming Rs The <ORG> allowed a part of the claim but the appellant preferred an appeal to the Appellate <ORG> under the Act The Appellate <ORG> held that the claim was barred by time as limitation had commenced from the date of dismissal from service and not from the date of reinstatement Or the date on which it was decided to treat the period of dismissal as leave due If both these terminii were always relatable to the same Point of time then there would be nor point in mentioning terminus a quo i and the legislature could have simply said that limitation for a claim under would always start from the date on which the wages fall due or accrue as has been done under Article of the Limitation Act which applies only to suits for recovery of wages The Judgment of the Court were delivered by <NAME> appeal by special leave is directed against the order dated November of <ORG> at Allahabad dismissing the appellant writ petition under Article and of the Constitution in limine He was confirmed in that post in On April an incident took place at Railway Station Kalka as a result of which he was prosecuted for an offence under Penal Code On April the appellant received a communication from the Divisional Personnel Officer <ORG> that he had been dismissed by the Divisional Superintendent from service March Thereafter the appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> under Article of the Constitution impugning the order <ORG> by its judgment dated of his dismissal September issued the writ directing the respondents to treat the dismissal of the appellant wholly void and ineffective Pursuant to that direction on December the appellant received a letter from the Divisional Personnel Officer that he had been reinstated to the post of Guard Grade and that the matter of his back wages for the period between the date of his On August the appellant made an application under of the Payment of Wages Act Act of here inafter referred to a the Act before the prescribed authority claim in a sum of Rs In the view propounded by the learned Counsel limitation for making the application under started from January the date of the dismissal and the application made by the appellant more than three years thereafter was clearly time barred The material part of of the Act reads Where contrary to the provisions of this Act any deduction has been made from the wages of an employed person or any payment of wages has been delayed such person himself or any legal practitioner or any official of a registered trade union authorised in writing to act on his behalf or any Inspector under this Act or any other person acting with the permission of the authority appointed under sub section may apply to such authority for a direction under sub section Provided that every such application shall be presented within twelve months from the date on which the deduction from the wages was made or from the date on which the payment of the wages was due to be made as the case may be Provided further that any application may be admitted after the said period of twelve months when die applicant satisfies the authority that he had sufficient cause for not making the application within such period When any application under sub section is entertained the authority shall hear the applicant and the employer or other person responsible for the payment of wages under section or give them an opportunity of being heard and after such further inquiry if any as may be necessary may without prejudice to any other penalty to which such employer or other person is liable under this Act direct the refund to the employed person of the amount deducted or the payment of the delayed wages together with the payment of such compensation as the authority may think fit not exceeding ten times the amount deducted in the former case and not exceeding twenty five rupees in the latter and even if the amount deducted or the delayed wages are paid before the disposal of the application direct the payment of such compensation as the authority may think fit not exceeding twenty five rupees The question of limitation turns on an interpretation of the first proviso to sub of of the Limitation Act which applies only to suits for recovery of wages In the light of the above discussion we reverse the finding of the Additional District Judge and hold that the application filed by the appellant under of the Act having been made within six months of the date of deduction from his wages was within time But that rule has no application to cases in which dismissal is declared invalid by a decree of civil court and he is in consequence reinstated The point pressed into argument is that once the <ORG> had allowed the appellant to amend his application for converting the claim of Traveling Allowance into Running Allowance it had no discretion left thereafter to prevent him from carrying out the amendment on the technical ground that the period indicated by Order Rule Code of Civil Procedure for this purpose has expired He took no steps whatever to carry out the amendment for several months after the order permitting the amendment and thereafter when the case was at the final stage he suddenly woke up as it were from slumber and sought to amend his application In support of this argument he has invited our attention to rule of the <ORG> Establishment Code clause of which defines average pay We therefore negative this contention For the foregoing reasons we allow this appeal set aside the order of <ORG> and restore that of <ORG> The appellant shall have his costs throughout
