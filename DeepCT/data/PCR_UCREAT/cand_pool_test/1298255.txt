He thereupon filed a suit against the respondent and raised the same plea that he was discharged from liability as surety on the same grounds The provisions of Civil Procedure Code are not exhaustive with respect to an earlier decision operating as res judicata between the same parties on the same matter in controversy in a subsequent regular suit and on the general principle of res judicata any previous decision on a matter in controversy decided after full contest or after affording fair opportunity to the parties to prove their case by a court competent to decide it will operate as res judicata in a subsequent regular suit There is therefore no good reason to preclude such decisions on matters in controversy in writ proceedings under Arts <NAME> This appeal by special leave raises the question whether a decision of <ORG> on merits on a certain matter after contest in a writ petition under Art The contracts were taken as a result of auctions which took place under the Conditions of Auction Sale of Forests in the Baria <ORG> in the Samvat year corresponding to A though in the plaint these conditions were referred to as Forest Auction Rules On this application it appears <ORG> issued notices to the contractors stating therein that the surety i the appellant had moved under cl of the Conditions of the Auction Sale of jungle goods for attachment of their goods that be lying in the godowns at Baria Piplod and Limkheda in the <ORG> and the debts or other movable or immovable property belonging to them and for delivering the same to him and directed the contractors not to sell mortgage gift away or otherwise dispose of whatever movable or immovable property they had in the <ORG> without the permission of the <ORG> It however appears from the order of <ORG> on that writ petition that the reliefs claimed were a direction to the respondents i the State of Bombay and the <NAME> of Baria Taluka to raise the attachment levied on Municipal Nos and of Deogad Baria the issue of a writ of mandamus or directions under Art It was urged for the appellant at the hearing of that petition that since the State allowed the contractors to sell their own properties the appellant had been discharged from his suretyship in respect of the said contractors and that the State could no longer claim to recover from him the balance due from the said contractors The petition was misconceived as not maintainable and there was no case for the issue of a writ of mandamus because the proper course for the appellant was to redress his so called grievance by proceeding according to the ordinary law through <ORG> There were no Baria State Forest Auction Rules The contractors had to furnish a surety who also had to execute a separate and independent agreement with the <ORG> in the Form approved by it In that case the property effects and debts of the contractor that may be within the territory of the <ORG> shall as in the case of land revenue be attached and auctioned at the cost and risk of the contractor and out of the sale proceeds realised at the auction the amount due to the surety or an amount equivalent to the amount required to discharge his liability shall be paid to the <ORG> According to the record the appellant had requested the <ORG> to release the goods of certain contractors by his letters dated May and of <ORG> dismissed the writ petition on July holding that there was no substance in the contention that the petitioners had been discharged from their liability as sureties On August the appellant instituted the suit which has given rise to this appeal It was further alleged in the plaint that subsequent to the merger of the Baria State with the Bombay State on October <ORG> without asking the plaintiff or without his consent allowed the said contractors to remove and sell their respective teak and sundry goods which were taken in attachment and thus behaving in contravention of the attachment made in his interest and put an end to his security and that according to law the plaintiff thus became discharged of liability as surety for the said contractors It was also mentioned in the plaint that the appellant had to make a petition to <ORG> in order to prevent his property from being sold and that he had been informed that the said petition had been dismissed on the ground that he could lawfully get his reliefs in <ORG> He accordingly dismissed the appeal He also recorded his findings on the other points urged before him He therefore allowed the appeal set aside the order of the District Judge and passed a decree in favour of the appellant declaring that he was liable to pay the amount due under the surety agreement less the amount paid by the contractor and such amount as had been recovered by the <ORG> by sale of the property of the contractor attached under condition No He further ordered issue of an injunction restraining the <ORG> from enforcing the liability for the amount in excess of the amount declared to be due from the appellant Thereafter the appellant filed this appeal after obtaining special leave from this Court Mr <NAME> for the appellant has urged two points It is urged for the appellant that in the writ petition the contention about the appellant liability as a surety having come to an end was based on the terms of the contract which was based on the conditions of auction sales between the appellant and the State of Baria while in the present suit the contention with respect to the cession of his liability as a surety was based on the auction rules It is denied in the reply affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent in the writ petition that there were any Baria State Forest Auction Rules We have not been referred to any rules In fact when we asked for the rules we were provided by learned counsel for the appellant with a booklet by the name Conditions for the Auction Sale of Forests Further the order of <ORG> on the writ petition mentions in the early part of the order It would appear that the Baria State had auctioned the teak wood trees on the terms and conditions contained in the said Forest Auction Rules The question which arises for consideration is whether such a decision in a writ petition can also bar a later suit on account of its operating as res judicata Before we deal with the question we may dispose of the short points urged for the appellant It is urged that if a decision in a writ application on merits be held to operate as res judicata in a regular suit the provisions of would also be applicable to the institution of the subsequent suit with respect to such part of the cause of action for which no relief was sought in the writ petition The contention is not sound as the provisions of apply only to suits The contention that a decision on a writ petition even on merits should not operate as res judicata as it is discretionary for the Court to pass any order it considers fit on a writ petition and not to decide it after considering all the points urged by the parties was negatived in <NAME> The State of With regard to the point that the issue of a writ by <ORG> was discretionary as it may refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Art as for instance when the party applying for the writ was guilty of laches but <ORG> could not refuse to issue the appropriate writ once it was shown that a fundamental right had been infringed it was said at and that may be said to constitute a difference in the right conferred on a citizen to move <ORG> under Art as distinct from the right conferred on him to move this Court This difference must inevitably mean that if <ORG> has refused to exercise its discretion on the ground of laches or on the ground that the party has an efficacious alternative remedy available to him then of course the decision of <ORG> cannot generally be pleaded in support of the bar of res judicata If however the matter has been considered on the merits and <ORG> has dismissed the petition for a writ on the ground that no fundamental right is proved or its breach is either not established or is shown to be constitutionally justified there is no reason why the said decision should not be treated as a bar against the competence of a subsequent petition filed by the same party on the same facts and for the same reliefs under Art In this connection reference may be made to what was said about the contention that a previous judgment was not to operate as res judicata against a party as it was based on certain statements recorded before that party was impleaded in <NAME> <NAME> It was suggested by Mr <NAME> that the former judgment ought not to be binding because certain witnesses having been examined before the present Appellant intervened in the suit he was refused the opportunity of cross examining them Another reason urged in support of the contention is that the petitioner in a writ petition had no right to apply for the issue of the appropriate writ and it is a matter of discretion for <ORG> to entertain any application or to grant it and that a decision in one proceeding can operate as res judicata in a subsequent proceeding only when the party initiating the first proceeding had a right to initiate both the proceedings when the nature of both the proceedings be the same It is further submitted for the appellant that a writ of mandamus according to its nature is to be issued mainly to compel the performance by a public servant of his duty of a public nature while in a suit the plaintiff prays for the enforcement of his personal rights On the other hand it is contended for the respondent that the doctrine of res judicata is not confined to the provisions of II but is of a general application on grounds of public policy that the fact that the proceedings on a writ petition are conducted summarily is no reason to reduce the value of the decision arrived at in those proceedings especially when a solemn decision is given after affording an opportunity to the parties to put before the Supp It is pertinently pointed out that if the writ application presented by the appellant had been allowed by <ORG> on a finding of fact that the liability of the appel lant as a surety stood discharged and a writ of prohibition had been issued against the <ORG> as prayed for by the appellant in the writ proceedings the <ORG> could not have sued for a declaration that these orders of <ORG> were bad and that a decree be passed in its favour declaring that the appellant liability as the surety still continued and that the <ORG> was free to take any action open to it under law for the recovery of the amount due from him It is not necessary to consider in any detail whether all orders made on a writ petition would bar a subsequent suit Before discussing the law of res judicata as laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure we may refer to the opinion of the Judges expressed in in the Duches of Kingston Case to which reference has been invariably made in most of the cases to be considered by us It was said in that case From the variety of cases relative to judgments being given in evidence in civil suits these two deductions seem to follow as generally true first that judgment of a <ORG> of concurrent jurisdiction directly upon the point Its section gave jurisdiction to the civil courts over all suits of a civil nature with the exception of those of which cognizance was barred by any Act of Parliament or by any Regulation of the Codes of Bengal Madras and Bombay or by any Act of the Governor General of India in Council Since then Civil Courts had jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature except those whose cognizance was barred by any enactment in force Section provided that <ORG> would not take cognizance of any suit brought on a cause of action which had been heard and determined by a Court of competent jurisdiction in a former suit between the same parties or between parties under whom they claimed The bar to the second suit was based on the identity of it cause of action with that of the earlier suit which had been heard and determined by a court of competent jurisdiction between the same parties In Khugawlee Sing Hossein Bux Khan <ORG> after quoting the opinion in Duchess of Kingston Case said There is nothing technical or peculiar to the law of England in the rule as so stated It referred to of Act VIII of and then observed at It is clear that this section would not have applied to the present case the causes of action in the two suits the non payment of interest in one and the non payment of principal in the other being different The expression Court of competent jurisdiction was construed to mean a Court which had jurisdiction over the matter in the subsequent suit in which the decision was used as conclusive or in other words a Court of concurrent jurisdiction It appears to their Lordships that if this case had arisen before the passing of Act of <ORG> in India would have rightly held that the decision of the Extra Assistant Commissioner in the first suit was not conclusive as to the amount of the principal sum due on the bond There is nothing however in its language to exclude the application of the general principles of res judicata to suits It had to restrict its provision about res judicata to the effect of decisions in a civil suit on a subsequent civil suit and therefore enacted in the form in which we find it We may now refer to some of the decided cases having a bearing on the applicability of the general principles of res judicata to suits when the previous decision is not in a suit but in other proceedings It was said at The question as to the perpetuity had been definitely and properly before him on the former hearing and was in fact decided without any reservation as is made plain by the terms of the judgment itself which show that the determination of the dispute as to the perpetuity was the foundation of the whole judgment It is not and indeed it cannot be disputed that if that be the case the matter has been finally settled between the parties for the mere fact that the decision was given in an administration suit does not affect its finality see <NAME> <NAME> Ch and in these circumstances it has to be held that the question of title to the four anna share was necessarily and substantially involved in the land acquisition proceedings and was finally decided by a court having jurisdiction to try it and that decision thus operates as res judicata In that case the general principles of law bearing on the rule of res judicata and not the provisions of of the Code of Civil Procedure were applied to the case This case made the decision in a former petition under Art in <ORG> is dismissed not on the merits but because of the laches of the party applying for the writ or because it is held that the party had an alternative remedy available to it the dismissal of the writ petition would not constitute a bar to a subsequent petition under art If the petition is dismissed in limine without a speaking order such dismissal cannot be treated as creating a bar of res judicata Limitations to the applicability of this general rule of res judicata are indicated at It is true that the general rule can be invoked only in cases where a dispute between the parties has been referred to a court of competent jurisdiction there has been a contest between the parties before the court a fair opportunity has been given to both of them to prove their case and at the end the court has pronounced its judgment or decision are alternate remedies and so the adoption of one remedy cannot bar the adoption of the other which was urged in the aforesaid case was negatived and it was observed at In such a case the point to consider always would be what is the nature of the decision pronounced by a of res judicata altogether in dealing with writ petitions filed by citizens alleging the contravention of their fundamental rights The decision was based on two grounds that the jurisdiction of <ORG> under art <ORG>s do not usually enter into disputed questions of fact but there is no bar to their doing so if they feel disposed to enter into such facts and arrive at a conclusion with respect to them As a result of the above discussion we are of opinion that the provisions of are not exhaustive with respect to an earlier decision operating as res judicata between the same parties on the same matter in controversy in a subsequent regular suit and that on the general principle of res judicata any previous decision on a matter in controversy decided after full contest or after affording fair opportunity to the parties to prove their case by a <ORG> competent to decide it will operate as res judicata in a subsequent regular suit We do not see any good reason to preclude such decisions on matters in controversy in writ proceedings under arts We therefore dismiss this appeal with costs <NAME> I have persued the judgment prepared by my learned brother <NAME> I regret my inability to agree raised are these The appellant filed a petition in <ORG> under Art In the suit from which the present appeal arises he again raises the plea that he was discharged as surety in other words he seeks to reopen in the present suit the finding given by <ORG> in the writ petition To invoke this doctrine the section lays down many conditions It follows and indeed it is not disputed that of the Code does not bar the appellant from raising the question of the discharge of his suretyship again in the present suit When the Code of Civil Procedure enacted prescribing precisely when an earlier decision would be res judicata in a suit it is not open to invoke the general principles of res judicata in the context of a subsequent suit though the conditions laid down in the section were not satisfied for otherwise the section would become nugatory it would also introduce anomalies The cases cited at the <ORG> do not compel me to accept the construction which would lead to that result The order of <ORG> is set aside and the appeal is remanded to <ORG> for disposal on merits in accordance with law Costs will abide the result ORDER In accordance with the Opinion of the Majority the Appeal is dismissed with costs
