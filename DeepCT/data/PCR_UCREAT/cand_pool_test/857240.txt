are inconsistent with the provisions contained in the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act for short the DRT Act for recovery of debt and the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act for short the Securitisation Act for enforcement of security interest and whether by virtue of non obstante clauses contained in Section of the DRT Act and Section of the Securitisation Act two Central legislations will have primacy over <ORG> legislations are the questions which arise for determination in these appeals For the sake of convenience we have taken notice of the facts of Civil Appeal Nos and and the reasons contained in the orders passed by Kerala and Bombay <ORG> which are under challenge in these appeals The learned Single Judge of <ORG> negatived the bank challenge by observing that proceedings under the Kerala Act had been initiated before the issue of certificate by the <ORG> and that even if the <ORG> has got exclusive jurisdiction to recover the amount due to the bank the <ORG> was not obliged to approach it for recovery of the State dues The learned Single Judge referred to Section of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act which provides that within days from the date of attachment of any immovable property any person other than the defaulter can lodge objection to the attachment of the whole or any portion of such property on the ground that such property was not liable for the arrears of public revenue and held that as the bank had claimed first charge or prior charge over the attached property it can file appropriate objections under Section of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act and make a prayer that public revenue can be recovered after paying its dues The appeal preferred against the order of the learned Single Judge was dismissed by the Division Bench which held that the bank can avail remedy by filing objections under Sections to of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act Due to the company failure to repay the amount its account was classified as non performing asset and the bank initiated proceedings under the Securitisation Act by issuing notice under Section After some correspondence the Assistant Commissioner issued notice dated to the bank to show cause as to why action may not be taken against it under Section of the Bombay Sales Tax Act for short the Bombay Act for recovery of Rs in addition to the auction proceeds It was urged on behalf of the bank that in view of the conflict between Section of the Bombay Act and Section of the Securitisation Act the latter being a Central legislation the first charge created by the <ORG> Act cannot have priority over debts of the bank because while enacting the Securitisation Act the <ORG> will be deemed to be aware of the provisions of the <ORG> legislation <ORG> then noted that Section of the Securitisation Act does not create first charge in favour of the banks that it merely provides the machinery for realization by a secured creditor of the security interest without intervention of the <ORG> or <ORG> that it overrides the provisions contained in Sections or A of the Transfer of Property Act which empower the mortgagee to sell or concur in selling the mortgaged property or any part thereof in default of payment of the mortgage money without intervention of the <ORG> in the circumstances referred to in Section and for payment of <ORG> Receiver as provided in Section A and held The Bombay Sales Tax Act and the Securitisation Act have been enacted by the competent legislatures for different purposes and operate in different fields Section of the Securitisation Act may have had some bearing if there was some provision in the Securitisation Act for first charge in favour of the banks and financial institutions The overriding provision contained in Section is only subject to the provision of the first charge in the Central Act holding the field <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants argued that as the DRT Act and Securitisation Act have been enacted by the <ORG> under Article read with Entry in List I in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution for speedy recovery of debts due to banks or financial institutions or for enforcement of security interest by the secured creditors and overriding effect has been given to these legislations vis a vis other laws the provisions contained therein will have primacy over <ORG> legislations which have been enacted under Article read with Entry in List II in the Seventh Schedule and under which first charge has been created in favour of the <ORG> in respect of the dues of sales tax etc All the learned counsel laid considerable emphasis on the non obstante clauses contained in Section of the DRT Act and Section of the Securitisation Act and argued that even though the language of Section of the Bombay Act and Section of the Kerala Act suggests that <ORG> legislations have been given overriding effect vis a vis other laws the courts are duty bound to give full effect to the primacy of Central legislations over <ORG> legislations <NAME> and other learned counsel heavily relied on Section and of the Securitisation Act and argued that when <ORG> has designedly given priority to the right of banks etc Learned senior counsel made a pointed reference to the provisos incorporated in Section for giving priority to the dues of the workers of the company in liquidation and argued that in the absence of similar provision in relation to sales tax dues etc <NAME> and <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the <ORG>s of Kerala and Maharashtra respectively argued that even though the DRT Act and Securitisation Act contain non obstante clauses suggesting that the provisions contained therein would prevail over other laws the same must be interpreted keeping in view the legislative policy underlying those enactments and if they are so interpreted Section of the Bombay Act and Section of the Kerala Act and similar provisions contained in other <ORG> legislations by which first charge has been created on the property of the dealer or any other person liable to pay sales tax etc <NAME> submitted that the DRT Act and Securitisation Act have been enacted to speed up the recovery of the dues of banks financial institutions and secured creditors but there is no provision in the two enactments by which first charge has been created in favour of banks etc is sovereign function as well as necessity of the <ORG> and as such the <ORG> has exclusive plenary power to legislate on that subject and in the absence of any provision in the DRT Act or Securitisation Act creating first charge in favour of the banks etc It provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the legislature of a <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the <ORG> In terms of Clause of Article <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule Under Clause the <ORG> and subject to Clause the legislature of any <ORG> also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule Subject to Clauses and the legislature of <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws for such <ORG> or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule It is thus evident that <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I and <ORG> legislatures enjoys similar power with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II The combined effect of the different clauses of Article is that in respect of any matter falling within List I <ORG> has exclusive power of legislation whereas the <ORG> legislature has exclusive power to make laws for such <ORG> or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule and with respect to the matters enumerated in List III both the <ORG> and <ORG> legislature have power to make laws Article which contains mechanism for resolution of conflict between Central and <ORG> legislations enacted with respect to any matter enumerated in List III of the Seventh Schedule reads as under If any provision of a law made by the <ORG> of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of clause the law made by <ORG> whether passed before or after the law made by the <ORG> of such State or as the case may be the existing law shall prevail and the law made by the <ORG> of the State shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void Where a law made by <ORG> with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by <ORG> or an existing law with respect to that matter then the law so made by the Legislature of such State shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent prevail in that State Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent <ORG> from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to amending varying or repealing the law so made by <ORG> State <ORG> referred to the judgment in <NAME> The Attorney General for the Dominion A and held now by the proviso to Article the Constitution has enlarged the powers of <ORG> and under that proviso <ORG> can do what the Central legislature could not under Section of the Government of India Act and enact a law adding to amending varying repealing a law of the <ORG> when it relates to a matter mentioned in the Concurrent List <ORG> repelled the challenge and held The position then might thus be summed up When a law is impugned on the ground that it is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it what has to be ascertained is the true character of the legislation To do that one must have regard to the enactment as a whole to its objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions If on such examination it is found that the legislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature then it must be held to be valid in its entirety even though it might incidentally trench on matters which are beyond its competence They have no operation generally or to offences which fall outside the Act Neither the presumptions in Section nor the provisions contained in Sections to have any operation apart from offences created by the Act and must in our opinion be held to be wholly ancillary to the legislation under Entry in List II There is no overlapping anywhere in the taxing power and the Constitution gives independent sources of taxation to the Union and the States In spite of the fields of legislation having been demarcated the question of repugnancy between law made by <ORG> and a law made by <ORG> may arise only in cases when both the legislations occupy the same field with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List and a direct conflict is seen If there is a repugnancy due to overlapping found between List II on the one hand and List I and List III on the other the State law will be ultra vires and shall have to give way to the Union law There is a distinction made between general subjects of legislation and taxation The entries in the lists being merely topics or fields of legislation they must receive a liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense The words and expressions employed in drafting the entries must be given the widest possible interpretation A power to legislate as to the principal matter specifically mentioned in the entry shall also include within its expanse the legislations touching incidental and ancillary matters Where the legislative competence of the legislature of any State is questioned on the ground that it encroaches upon the legislative competence of <ORG> to enact a law the question one has to ask is whether the legislation relates to any of the entries in List I or III Where there are three lists containing a large number of entries there is bound to be some overlapping among them Once it is so determined any incidental trenching on the field reserved to the other legislature is of no consequence The court has to look at the substance of the matter The name given by the legislature to the legislation is immaterial The doctrine of occupied field applies only when there is a clash between the <ORG> and the State Lists within an area common to both There the doctrine of pith and substance is to be applied and if the impugned legislation substantially falls within the power expressly conferred upon the legislature which enacted it an incidental encroaching in the field assigned to another legislature is to be ignored The three Judge Bench also dealt with the scope of Article and held Article of the Constitution makes provision first as to what would happen in the case of conflict between a Central and <ORG> law with regard to the subjects enumerated in the Concurrent List and secondly for resolving such conflict Clause lays down that if a <ORG> law relating to a concurrent subject is repugnant to a <ORG> law relating to that subject then whether the <ORG> law is prior or later in time the <ORG> law will prevail and the <ORG> law shall to the extent of such repugnancy be void that if the President assents to a <ORG> law which has been reserved for his consideration it will prevail notwithstanding its repugnancy to an earlier law of the <ORG> both laws dealing with a concurrent subject In short the result of obtaining the assent of the President to a <ORG> Act which is inconsistent with a previous <ORG> law relating to a concurrent subject would be that the <ORG> Act will prevail in that <ORG> and override the provisions of the Central Act in their applicability to that <ORG> only A <ORG> law would be repugnant to the <ORG> law when there is direct conflict between the two laws However still the predominance of the Union List would not prevent <ORG> from dealing with any matter within List II though it may incidentally affect any item in List I In spite of the fields of legislation having been demarcated the question of repugnancy between law made by <ORG> and a law made by <ORG> may arise only in cases when both the legislations occupy the same field with respect to one of the matters enumerated in List III and a direct conflict is seen If there is a repugnancy due to overlapping found between List II on the one hand and List I and List III on the other the State law will be ultra vires and shall have to give way to the <ORG> law If there is conflict the correct approach is to find an answer to three questions step by step as under One Is it still possible to effect reconciliation between two entries so as to avoid conflict and overlapping Two In which entry the impugned legislation falls by finding out the pith and substance of the legislation In this regard the court has to look at the substance of the matter The name given by the legislature to the legislation is immaterial It follows as a corollary of the <ORG> statement that while interpreting tax laws the courts would be guided by the gist of the legislation instead of by the apparent meaning of the words used and the language employed The courts shall have regard to the object and the scheme of the tax law under consideration and the purpose for which the cess is levied collected and intended to be used and Three Having determined the field of legislation where in the impugned legislation falls by applying the doctrine of pith and substance can an incidental trenching upon another field of legislation be ignored Once it is so determined if the impugned legislation substantially falls within the power expressly conferred upon the legislature which enacted it an incidental encroaching in trenching on the field assigned to another legislature is to be ignored supra the Court was called upon to decide whether there was any conflict between the provisions of All India Council for Technical Education Act and the A Education Act and whether the <ORG> legislation was liable to be declared void and inoperative on the ground that the <ORG> legislature was not competent to enact law in the field occupied by the Central legislation A two Judge Bench analysed the provisions of the two enactments and held <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I notwithstanding anything contained in clauses and of Article The non obstante clause under Article indicates the predominance or supremacy of the law made by <ORG> in the event of an overlap of the law made by <ORG> with respect to a matter enumerated in List I and a law made by <ORG> with respect to a matter enumerated in List II of the Seventh Schedule Here again the courts are charged with the duty of interpreting the enactments of <ORG> and <ORG> in such manner as to avoid a conflict If the conflict becomes unavoidable then Article indicates the manner of resolution of such a conflict Thus the question of repugnancy between the parliamentary legislation and the <ORG> legislation can arise in two ways Second where the two legislations are with respect to matters in the Concurrent List and there is a conflict In both the situations parliamentary legislation will predominate in the first by virtue of the non obstante clause in Article in the second by reason of Article Clause of Article deals with a situation where the <ORG> legislation having been reserved and having obtained President assent prevails in that <ORG> this again is subject to the proviso that <ORG> can again bring a legislation to override even such <ORG> legislation The ratio of the above noted judgments is that Article gets attracted only when both Central and State legislations have been enacted on any of the matters enumerated in List III in Seventh Schedule and there is conflict between two legislations That apart as will be seen hereafter there is no ostensible overlapping between two sets of legislations Not only this the efforts made by banks and financial institutions for recovery of their dues were stultified by the defaulting borrowers who indulged in unwarranted and protracted litigation in civil courts <ORG> also prepared a draft of the proposed legislation which contained a provision for disposal of cases in three months and conferment of power upon the recovery officer for expeditious execution of orders made by adjudicating bodies Therefore the President of India in exercise of the powers conferred by Article of the Constitution promulgated The Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Ordinance which was replaced by the DRT Act but also for quick resolution of disputes arising out of the action taken for recovery of such dues Both <ORG> and <ORG>s suggested enactment of new legislation for securitisation and empowering the banks and financial institutions to take possession of the securities and sell them without intervention of the court The provisions contained in Chapter II envisage establishment of <ORG> and <ORG> qualifications of Presiding Officers and Members term of their office staff of the tribunals salaries allowances etc Under Section the Appellate <ORG> has been vested with jurisdiction powers and authority to entertain appeal against any order made or deemed to have been made by a <ORG> Section expressly bars the jurisdiction powers and authority of all courts except <ORG> and <ORG> exercising jurisdiction under Articles and of the Constitution of India in relation to matters specified in Section Section which finds place in Chapter IV of the <ORG> Act contains procedure required to be followed by the <ORG> for deciding an application made for recovery of debt Section gives right to the defendant to set up a counter claim Section empowers the <ORG> to make an interim order by way of injunction stay or attachment before judgment debarring the defendant from transferring alienating or otherwise dealing with or disposing of his properties and assets Section empowers the <ORG> to appoint a receiver of any property on the ground of equity Section lays down that any person aggrieved by an order made or deemed to have been made by a <ORG> may prefer an appeal to the Appellate <ORG> Sub section of Section declares that no appeal shall lie from an order made by the <ORG> with the consent of the parties Proviso to this sub section empowers the <ORG> to entertain an appeal after the expiry of days if it is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not filing the appeal within the prescribed period Section lays down that the Appellate <ORG> shall not entertain an appeal unless the person preferring appeal deposits per cent of the amount determined by the <ORG> under Section Other modes of recovery are specified in Section which states that where a certificate has been issued by the <ORG> under Section the Recovery Officer may without prejudice to the modes of recovery specified in Section recover the amount of debt by any one or more of the modes mentioned in Section By Section the provisions of Second and Third Schedules to the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax Certificate Proceedings Rules have been made applicable to the recovery proceedings Section A lays down that where a decree or order was passed by any court before the commencement of the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Amendment Act and the same had not been executed then the decree holder can apply to the <ORG> for recovery of the amount Sub section of Section contains a non obstante clause and declares that save as otherwise provided in sub section provisions of the <ORG> Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than that Act These rules regulate the procedure for filing application in the prescribed form scrutiny thereof fee for application contents of application documents to be filed with the application filing of reply and documents by the respondent date and place of hearing of the application the manner of recording the order publication of order and communication thereof to the parties The provisions contained in these rules are similar to those contained in the rules regulating the procedure of the <ORG> Section ha declares that debt shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause of Section of the DRT Act Section defines hypothecation to mean a charge created by a borrower in favour of a secured creditor as a security for financial assistance Section defines Securitisation to mean acquisition of financial assets by any securitisation company or reconstruction company from any originator whether by raising of funds by such securitisation company or reconstruction company from qualified institutional buyers by issue of security receipts representing undivided interest in such financial assets or otherwise Chapter II which contains Sections to deals with regulation of securitisation and reconstruction of financial assets of banks and financial institutions It lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in Sections or A of the Transfer of Property Act any security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced without the intervention of the <ORG> or <ORG> by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of this Act Sub section of Section enumerates first of many steps needed to be taken by the secured creditor for enforcement of security interest This sub section provides that if a borrower who is under a liability to a secured creditor makes any default in repayment of secured debt and his account in respect of such debt is classified as non performing asset then the secured creditor may require the borrower by notice in writing to discharge his liabilities within sixty days from the date of the notice with an indication that if he fails to do so the secured creditor shall be entitled to exercise all or any of its rights in terms of Section Sub section of Section lays down that notice issued under Section shall contain details of the amount payable by the borrower as also the details of the secured assets intended to be enforced by bank or financial institution Sub section A of Section lays down that the borrower may make a representation in response to the notice issued under Section and challenge the classification of his account as non performing asset as also the quantum of amount specified in the notice This is subject to the condition that the right to transfer by way of lease etc If the management of whole or part of the business is severable then the secured creditor can take over management only of such business of the borrower which is relatable to security The secured creditor can also by notice in writing call upon a person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower to pay the money which may be sufficient to discharge the liability of the borrower Sub section of Section lays down that where any action has been taken against a borrower under sub section all costs charges and expenses properly incurred by the secured creditor or any expenses incidental thereto can be recovered from the borrower Sub section imposes a restriction on the sale or transfer of the secured asset if the amount due to the secured creditor together with costs charges and expenses incurred by him are tendered at any time before the time fixed for such sale or transfer There are five unnumbered provisos to Section which deal with pari passu charge of the workers of a company in liquidation The second proviso deals with the case of a company being wound up on or after the commencement of this Act If the secured creditor of such company opts to realize its security instead of relinquishing the same and proving its debt under Section of the Companies Act then it can retain sale proceeds after depositing the workmen dues with the liquidator in accordance with Section A Sub section lays down that where dues of the secured creditor are not fully satisfied by the sale proceeds of the secured assets the secured creditor may file an application before the <ORG> under Section for recovery of balance amount from the borrower Sub section lays down that rights available to the secured creditor under the Act may be exercised by one or more of its officers authorised in this behalf The secured creditor can for the purpose of taking possession or control of any secured asset request in writing to the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate within whose jurisdiction the secured asset or other document relating thereto is situated or found to take possession thereof If such request is made the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate as the case may be is obliged to take possession of such asset and document and forward the same to the secured creditor Section speaks of the remedies available to any person including borrower who may feel aggrieved by the action taken by the secured creditor under sub section of Section Such an aggrieved person can make an application to the <ORG> within days from the date on which action is taken under that sub section Sub section of Section casts a duty on the <ORG> to consider whether the measures taken by the secured creditor for enforcement of security interest are in accordance with the provisions of the Act and rules made thereunder If the <ORG> after examining the facts and circumstances of the case and evidence produced by the parties comes to the conclusion that the measures taken by the secured creditor are not in consonance with sub section of Section then it can direct the secured creditor to restore management of the business or possession of the secured assets to the borrower On the other hand if the <ORG> finds that the recourse taken by the secured creditor under sub section of Section is in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder then notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force the secured creditor can take recourse to one or more of the measures specified in Section for recovery of its secured debt Sub section of Section prescribes the time limit of sixty days within which an application made under Section is required to be disposed of If the <ORG> fails to decide the application within a maximum period of four months then either party can move the Appellate <ORG> for issue of a direction to the <ORG> to dispose of the application expeditiously Section provides for an appeal to the Appellate <ORG> Section lays down that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any suit or proceeding in respect of any matter which a <ORG> or Appellate <ORG> is empowered to determine It further lays down that no injunction shall be granted by any court or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be taken under the Securitisation Act or DRT Act It declares that the provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law In exercise of powers vested in it under Sections and read with Sections and of the Securitisation Act <ORG> framed the Security Interest Enforcement Rules Rule prescribes the mode of service of demand notice Various sub rules of this rule specify the mode of taking possession of moveable security assets their preservation and protection valuation and sale Rule lays down similar procedure in respect of immovable security assets Rule regulates time of sale issue of sale certificate and delivery of possession to the purchaser Rule provides for appointment of manager of the security assets of which possession has been taken over by the secured creditor Rule regulates procedure for recovery of shortfall of secured debt This is the reason why the DRT Act not only provides for establishment of the <ORG> and Appellate <ORG> with the jurisdiction powers and authority to make summary adjudication of applications made by banks or financial institutions and specifies the modes of recovery of the amount determined by the <ORG> or Appellate <ORG> but also bars the jurisdiction of all courts except <ORG> and <ORG> in relation to the matters specified in Section In the light of the above we shall now consider whether there is any conflict between the DRT Act and Securitisation Act on one hand and the Bombay and Kerala Acts and similar State legislations on the other and whether by virtue of non obstante clauses contained in Section of the DRT Act and Section of the Securitisation Act the provisions contained in those legislations override Section of the Bombay Act Section of the Kerala Act and similar other State legislations Save as otherwise provided in sub section the provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act The provisions of this Act to override other laws The provisions of this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law Where any employer is adjudicated insolvent or being a company an order for winding up is made the amount due a from the employer in relation to an establishment to which any Scheme or the Insurance Scheme applies in respect of any contribution payable to the Fund or as the case may be the Insurance Fund damages recoverable under section accumulations required to be transferred under sub section of section or any charges payable by him under any other provision of this Act or of any provision of the Scheme or the Insurance Scheme or from the employer in relation to an exempted establishment in report of any contribution to the provident fund or any insurance fund in so far it relates to exempted employees under the rules of the provident fund or any insurance fund any contribution payable by him towards <ORG> under sub section of section damages recoverable under section or any charges payable by him to the appropriate Government under any provision of this Act or under any of the conditions specified under section shall where the liability therefor has accrued before the order of adjudication or winding up is made be deemed to be included among the debts which under section of the Presidency towns Insolvency Act or under section of the Provincial Insolvency Act or under section of the Companies Act are to be paid in priority to all other debts in the distribution of the property of the insolvent or the assets of the company being wound up as the case may be Without prejudice to the provisions of sub section if any amount is due from an employer whether in respect of the employee contribution deducted from the wages of the employee or the employer contribution the amount so due shall be deemed to be the first charge on the assets of the establishment and shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force be paid in priority to all other debts Any rent royalty tax fee or other sum due to the <ORG> either under this Act or any rule made thereunder or under the terms and conditions of any reconnaissance permit prospecting licence or mining lease may on a certificate of such officer as may be specified by the State <ORG> in this behalf by general or special order be recovered in the same manner as if it were an arrear of land revenue and every such sum which becomes due to the <ORG> after the commencement of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Amendment Act together with the interest due thereon shall be a first charge on the assets of the holder of the reconnaissance permit prospecting licence or mining lease as the case may be Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act or any other law for the time being in force in the winding up of a company a workmen dues and debts due to secured creditors to the extent such debts rank under clause of the proviso to sub section of section pari passu with such dues shall be paid in priority to all other debts the debts payable under clause a and clause of sub section shall be paid in full unless the assets are insufficient to meet them in which case they shall abate in equal proportions Section of the State Financial Corporations Act for short the SFC Act which contains a non obstante clause similar to the one contained in Section of the DRT Act and Section of the Securitisation Act and the effect of which was considered by a Division Bench of <ORG> vis a vis Section of the EPF Act also read as under State Financial Corporations Act The provisions of this Act and of any rules or orders made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in the memorandum or articles of association of an industrial concern or in any other instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act but save as aforesaid the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time being applicable to an industrial concern Its setting gives colour to it and provides a cue to the intention of the legislature in using it According to <NAME> there is a basic fallacy in saying that words have meaning in and of themselves and reference to the abstract meaning of words states <NAME> if there be any such thing is of little value in interpreting statutes Speaking for the <ORG> <NAME> noted the importance of rule of contextual interpretation and held Interpretation must depend on the text and the context One may well say if the text is the texture context is what gives the colour That interpretation is best which makes the textual interpretation match the contextual With this knowledge the statute must be read first as a whole and then section by section clause by clause phrase by phrase and word by word If a statute is looked at in the context of its enactment with the glasses of the statute maker provided by such context its scheme the sections clauses phrases and words may take colour and appear different than when the statute is looked at without the glasses provided by the context With these glasses we must look at the Act as a whole and discover what each section each clause each phrase and each word is meant and designed to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act No part of a statute and no word of a statute can be construed in isolation Statutes have to be construed so that every word has a place and everything is in its place It is by looking at the definition as a whole in the setting of the entire Act and by reference to what preceded the enactment and the reasons for it that the <ORG> construed the expression prize chit in Srinivasa SCC and we find no reason to depart from the <ORG> construction The Court while interpreting non obstante clause contained in Section A of Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Fixation of Ceiling on Land Act held It is well settled that while dealing with a non obstante clause under which the legislature wants to give overriding effect to a section the court must try to find out the extent to which the legislature had intended to give one provision overriding effect over another provision However what is most significant to be noted is that there is no provision in either of these enactments by which first charge has been created in favour of banks financial institutions or secured creditors qua the property of the borrower In terms of that sub section secured creditor can enforce security interest without intervention of the <ORG> or <ORG> and if the borrower has created any mortgage of the secured asset the mortgagee or any person acting on his behalf cannot sell the mortgaged property or appoint a receiver of the income of the mortgaged property or any part thereof in a manner which may defeat the right of the secured creditor to enforce security interest This provision was enacted in the backdrop of Chapter VIII of <NAME> Committee nd Report in which specific reference was made to the provisions relating to mortgages under the Transfer of Property Act In an apparent bid to overcome the likely difficulty faced by the secured creditor which may include a bank or a financial institution <ORG> incorporated the non obstante clause in Section and gave primacy to the right of secured creditor vis a vis other mortgagees who could exercise rights under Sections or A of the Transfer of Property Act Sub section of Section which envisages application of the money received by the secured creditor by adopting any of the measures specified under sub section merely regulates distribution of money received by the secured creditor It is interesting to note that the provisos to sub section of Section do not deal with the companies which fall in the category of borrower but which are not in liquidation or are not being wound up The non obstante clauses contained in Section of the DRT Act and Section of the Securitisation Act give overriding effect to the provisions of those Acts only if there is anything inconsistent contained in any other law or instrument having effect by virtue of any other law In other words if there is no provision in the other enactments which are inconsistent with the DRT Act or Securitisation Act the provisions contained in those Acts cannot override other legislations It is essential that as a sovereign the <ORG> should be able to discharge its primary governmental functions and in order to be able to discharge such functions efficiently it must be in possession of necessary funds and this consideration emphasises the necessity and the wisdom of conceding to the <ORG> the right to claim priority in respect of its tax dues see <ORG> In other words where the welfare <ORG> enters into commercial fields which cannot be regarded as an essential and integral part of the basic government functions of the <ORG> and seeks to recover debts from its debtors arising out of such commercial activities the applicability of the doctrine of priority shall be open for consideration There is no question of retrospectivity here as on the date when it was introduced Section operated in respect of all charges that were then in force and gave sales tax dues precedence over them Second it also declares that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force such debt shall be paid in priority to all other debts There are other provisions in the Act rendering the amounts of provident fund immune from attachment of civil court decree which also indicate such intention of <ORG> On behalf of <ORG> section of the Transfer of Property Act was relied upon to contend that since there was a mortgage in favour of the <ORG> the <ORG> would have precedence over the claim of sales tax dues which was only by way of a charge and the Judgment of <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> and finally concluded that since the statute created a first charge it clearly gave priority to the statutory charge over all other charges on the property including a mortgage While this was the law <ORG> amended section of the and Act by specifically enacting sub section thereof declaring that the amount due as contribution to <ORG> has first charge on the assets of the establishment and that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force it shall be paid in priority against all other debts In fact the second facet of section of the and Act goes one step further than what is provided in section of Act We are also not impressed by the contention of the first respondent that upon usage of non obstante clause in section of the Act It is therefore clear that section of the and Act overrides all provisions of other enactments including section of the Act If the provisions of the DRT Act and Securitisation Act are interpreted keeping in view the background and context in which these legislations were enacted and the purpose sought to be achieved by their enactment it becomes clear that the two legislations are intended to create a new dispensation for expeditious recovery of dues of banks financial institutions and secured creditors and adjudication of the grievance made by any aggrieved person qua the procedure adopted by the banks financial institutions and other secured creditors but the provisions contained therein cannot be read as creating first charge in favour of banks etc If <ORG> intended to give priority to the dues of banks financial institutions and other secured creditors over the first charge created under State legislations then provisions similar to those contained in Section A of the Workmen Compensation Act Section of the EPF Act Section of the Estate Duty Act Section of the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act Section of the Gift Tax Act and Section A of the Companies Act would have been incorporated in the DRT Act and Securitisation Act The <ORG> could have given effect to the non obstante clauses contained in Section of the DRT Act and Section of the Securitisation Act vis a vis Section of the Bombay Act and Section of the Kerala Act and similar other State legislations only if there was a specific provision in the two enactments creating first charge in favour of the banks financial institutions and other secured creditors but as the <ORG> has not made any such provision in either of the enactments the first charge created by the State legislations on the property of the dealer or any other person liable to pay sales tax etc In <NAME> case a three Judge Bench of this <ORG> interpreted the expression any sale held without leave of the <ORG> of any of the properties which were added in Section of the Indian Companies Act by amending Act No XXII of and held that the said expression refers only to sales held through the intervention of the <ORG> and not to sales effected by the secured creditor outside the winding up and without the intervention of the <ORG> The Court referred to Article of the Constitution which declares that the accused cannot be compelled to incriminate himself and observed <ORG> was aware of the above fundamental canons of criminal jurisprudence because in various sections of the Criminal Procedure Code it gives effect to it For example in Section it is provided that every person summoned by a police officer in a proceeding under Section shall be bound to attend and to answer truly all questions other than questions the answers to which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or to a penalty or forfeiture Again it is a rule as to the limitation of the meaning of general words used in a statute that they are to be if possible construed as not to alter the common law vide Craies on Statute Law The legislative intention being the speedy disposal of cases with a view to relieving the litigants and the courts alike of the burden of mounting arrears the word parties must be so construed as to yield a beneficent result so as to eliminate the mischief the legislature had in mind There is no reason to assume that the legislature intended to curtail the implied authority of counsel engaged in the thick of proceedings in court to compromise or agree on matters relating to the parties even if such matters exceed the subject matter of the suit There is no such declaration of policy or indication of intent in the present case The civil law is indeed equally efficacious and even older but it is the product of a different tradition culture and language and there is no indication whatever that <ORG> was addressing itself to the task of assimilating or incorporating the rules and practices of that system into our own system of judicial administration So long as the system of judicial administration in India continues unaltered and so long as <ORG> has not evinced an intention to change its basic character there is no reason to assume that <ORG> has though not expressly but impliedly reduced counsel role or capacity to represent his client as effectively as in the past In this respect the words of Lord <NAME> in Sourendra comparing the Indian advocate with the advocate in England Scotland and Ireland are significant <ORG> There are no local conditions which make it less desirable for the client to have the full benefit of an advocate experience and judgment In <ORG> case a two Judge Bench was called upon to consider the question whether an application can be filed under the Companies Act during the pendency of proceedings under the <ORG> Act During the pendency of the applications <ORG> filed company application in Company Petition No of filed by <ORG> against <ORG> under Sections and of the Companies Act for stay of the proceedings of recovery case No instituted by the <ORG> It was argued on behalf of the appellant i <ORG> that the <ORG> Act is a special statute intended for expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions and in view of Section of that Act read with sub section thereof the company courts do not have jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by the respondent bank It was argued on behalf of the appellant that in view of the amendment made in Section of the <ORG> Act only Section A of the Companies Act is attracted and that too for a limited purpose i recovery of dues of the workmen On behalf of the respondent bank it was argued that during the pendency of the winding up petition the company court can pass appropriate order by entertaining an application filed under Section read with Section of the Companies Act After noticing the rival contentions this Court framed six points for determination first four of which were Whether in respect of proceedings under the RDB Act at the stage of adjudication for the money due to the banks or financial institutions and at the stage of execution for recovery of monies under the RDB Act the <ORG> and the Recovery Officers are conferred exclusive jurisdiction in their respective spheres Whether for initiation of various proceedings by the banks and financial institutions under the RDB Act leave of <ORG> is necessary under Section before a winding up order is passed against the company or before provisional liquidator is appointed under Section and whether <ORG> can pass orders of stay of proceedings before the <ORG> in exercise of powers under Section Whether after a winding up order is passed under Section of the Companies Act or a provisional liquidator is appointed whether <ORG> can stay proceedings under the RDB Act transfer them to itself and also decide questions of liability execution and priority under Section and read with Sections A and etc of the Companies Act or whether these questions are all within the exclusive jurisdiction of the <ORG> Whether in case it is decided that the distribution of monies is to be done only by the <ORG> the provisions of Section CPC and sub sections and of Section Section of the Companies Court also apply apart from Section A to the proceedings before the <ORG> under the RDB Act The Court referred to various provisions of the DRT Act in the judgment that Act was referred to as RDB Act and Companies Act and held It appears to us that basically the <ORG> is to adjudicate the liability of the defendant and then it has to issue a certificate under Section Under Section the jurisdiction of any other court or authority which would otherwise have had jurisdiction but for the provisions of the Act is ousted and the power to adjudicate upon the liability is exclusively vested in the <ORG> This exclusion does not however apply to the jurisdiction of <ORG> or of <ORG> exercising power under Articles or of the Constitution the provisions of the RDB Act confer exclusive jurisdiction on the <ORG> and <ORG> in respect of debts payable to banks and financial institutions and there can be no interference by <ORG> under Section read with Section or under Section of the Companies Act The respondent contention that Section gives priority to all secured creditors to share in the sale proceeds before the Tribunal Recovery Officer cannot in our opinion be accepted A learned Single Judge of <ORG> allowed the applications filed by the appellant under Section of the Companies Act read with Section and of the SFC Act subject to the condition that the appellant would undertake to discharge its liability due to workers under Section A of the Companies Act After decree of the suit the appellant along with <ORG> and <ORG> filed an application before the Company Judge for consideration of their claim on pro rata basis and also for exclusion of the claim of <ORG> A non obstante clause must be given effect to to the extent <ORG> intended and not beyond the same ii Whether recourse to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower in terms of Section of the NPA Act comprehends the power to take actual possession of the immovable property The NPA Act proceeds on the basis that security interest vests in the bank FI But under the NPA Act authority is given to the banks FIs which is not there in the DRT Act to assign the secured interest to securitisation company asset reconstruction company Therefore when Section talks about taking possession of the secured assets or management of the business of the borrower it is because a right is created by the borrower in favour of the bank FI when he takes a loan secured by pledge hypothecation mortgage or charge These are some of the factors which the authorised officer of the bank FI has to keep in mind when he gives notice under Section of the NPA Act The <ORG> then adverted to the concept of possession envisaged under Section and held The word possession is a relative concept The dichotomy between symbolic an physical possession does not find place in the NPA Act Basically the NPA Act deals with the mortgage type of securities under which the secured creditor namely the bank FI obtains interest in the property concerned It is for this reason that the NPA Act ousts the intervention of the courts tribunals Section A refers to the word possession simpliciter There is no dichotomy in Section A as pleaded on behalf of the borrowers The scheme of Section read with Section of the NPA Act shows that if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act then <ORG> is entitled to put the clock back by restoring the status quo ante Therefore it cannot be said that if possession is taken before confirmation of sale the rights of the borrower to get the dispute adjudicated upon are defeated by the authorised officer taking possession The NPA Act provides for recovery of possession by non adjudicatory process therefore to say that the rights of the borrower would be defeated without adjudication would be erroneous The Court Receiver can take symbolic possession and in appropriate cases where the Court Receiver finds that a third party interest is likely to be created overnight he can take actual possession even prior to the decree The authorised officer under Rule has greater powers than even a Court Receiver as security interest in the property is already created in favour of the banks FIs Therefore Rule provides that till issuance of the sale certificate under Rule the authorised officer shall take such steps as he deems fit to preserve the secured asset It is well settled that third party interests are created overnight and in very many cases those third parties take up the defence of being a bona fide purchaser for value without notice It is these types of disputes which are sought to be avoided by Rule read with Rule of the Rules In the circumstances the drawing of dichotomy between symbolic and actual possession does not find place in the scheme of the NPA Act read with the Rules In August the first respondent issued a legal notice to the appellant and then filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution of India in the Aurangabad Bench of <ORG> In none of the afore mentioned judgments this Court held that by virtue of the provisions contained in the DRT Act or Securitization Act first charge has been created in favour of banks financial institutions etc The other proposition laid down in that case which appear to have been diluted by a co ordinate bench in <ORG> case is that while distributing the money recovered by a bank or a financial institution priority given to the workers dues in terms of Section A must be respected Section of the <ORG> Excise Act which was considered by the two Judge Bench in <ORG> case does not contain a provision similar to those in <ORG> legislations like Section A of the Workmen Compensation Act Section of the EPF Act Section of the Estate Duty Act Section of the Mines and Minerals Development and Regulation Act Section of the Gift Tax Act and Section A of the Companies Act under which statutory first charge has been created in respect of the dues of workmen or gift tax etc On the basis of above discussion we hold that the DRT Act and Securitisation Act do not create first charge in favour of banks financial institutions and other secured creditors and the provisions contained in Section of the Bombay Act and Section of the Kerala Act are not inconsistent with the provisions of the DRT Act and Securitisation Act so as to attract non obstante clauses contained in Section of the DRT Act or Section of the Securitisation Act Another argument of some of the learned counsel for the appellants is that the prior charge created in favour of the bank would prevail over the subsequent mortgage created in favour of the <ORG> <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the <ORG> of Kerala argued that statutory first charge created in favour of the <ORG> will have precedence over a mortgage created in favour of bank etc <NAME> pointed out that Section does not apply to a case involving a secured creditor or <ORG> On the issue of retrospectivity the learned senior counsel submitted that from the date of insertion of Section in the Kerala Act the dues of sales tax became first charge over the property of the borrower and the same would super impose on the mortgage created in favour of the bank We shall first refer to the judgment in <NAME> case In that case the three Judge Bench considered the question of priority between a charge created by a decree and a subsequent simple mortgage Notices were issued under Order Rule CPC to respondent no and others He also filed a civil suit in <ORG> <ORG> Poona for recovery of Rs allegedly due to him under the two mortgages During the pendency of that suit the property was put up for sale on the darkhast of the appellants who themselves purchased the property with the leave of the <ORG> The appellants contested the suit on the ground that they had a prior charge and the mortgage of respondent no was subject to that charge The obvious reason for this is that in a mortgage there is always an equity of redemption vested in the owner so that the subsequent mortgagees or transferees will have if they are not careful and cautious in examining the title before entering into a transaction only the interest which the owner has at the time of the transaction Insofar as competing mortgagees are concerned Section of the Act gives priority to the first in point of time in whose favour transfer of an interest in respect of the same immovable property is created if the interest which he has taken and the interest acquired subsequently by other persons cannot all exist or be exercised to their full extent together The Court has observed at pages that a charge is a wider term as it includes also a mortgage in that every mortgage is a charge but every charge is not a mortgage It has held that the phrase transferee of property refers to the transferee of entire interest in the property and it does not cover the transfer of only an interest in the property by way of a mortgage The Court then considered the argument made on behalf of the bank that its dues will have priority because at the time when the statutory first charge came into existence there was already a mortgage in respect of the same property and held The argument though ingenious will have to be rejected Since the title of the assessee to the immovable properties acquired was not incomplete and imperfect in any way it cannot also be said that as a result of the payment of the estate duty by the assessee there was an improvement in the title of the assessee and the said payment could be regarded as cost of improvement under Section read with Section of the Act We shall now deal with the individual cases A No A recapitulation thereof shows that suit filed by the appellant bank in for recovery of its dues was later on transferred to the <ORG> and decreed on Before that the <ORG> Mavelikara had attached the properties of the borrower on and again on for recovery of the arrears of sales tax In our opinion the view taken by <ORG> is in consonance with what we have held in the earlier part of the judgment regarding primacy of the <ORG> first charge over the dues of banks financial institutions and secured creditors Therefore the impugned orders do not call for any interference Further appeal preferred by the bank was dismissed by <ORG> of <ORG> on In our opinion the bank cannot claim priority over the dues of sales tax because statutory first charge had been created in favour of the State by Section which was inserted in the Kerala Act with effect from and the courts below did not commit any error by refusing to decree the suit for injunction filed by the bank During the execution proceedings Tehsildar <NAME> issued notice to respondent no under Section of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act for payment of arrears of sales tax amounting to Rs He also indicated that acres of land in revenue survey no will be sold for realization of sales tax dues The learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition by observing that sale was being conducted under the Revenue Recovery Act pursuant to the judgment of the Court Judicial pronouncements settled the law once for all stating that <ORG> has got priority in the matter of recovery of debts due and the specific statutory charge created under the Sales Tax Act notwithstanding the equitable mortgages created by the defaulters in favour of the <ORG>s prior to the liability in favour of the <ORG> We are in this case concerned with the question as to whether Section of the Act would take away the efficacy of a decree passed by the civil court prior to the introduction of said section Decree passed by the civil court is the formal expression of an adjudication which conclusively determines the rights of parties but unless and until the decree is executed the <ORG> would not procure the property and the <ORG> overriding rights would have precedence over that of the <ORG> Decree has only conclusively determined the rights between the mortgagor and mortgagee which would not affect the statutory rights of the <ORG> <ORG> which has got a statutory first charge under Section of the Act would prevail over the rights created in favour of the <ORG> by an unexecuted decree On creation of bench of the <ORG> at Cochin the suit was transferred to the <ORG> which passed decree dated for a sum of Rs with interest at the rate of per annum from In the meanwhile <ORG> Revenue Recovery issued notice dated under Section of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act and attached the property of the company in lieu of the dues of sales tax He then issued notice dated under Section of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act for sale of the property The appellant also filed Writ Petition No of for restraining the revenue officer from taking action against the auctioned property We therefore find no reason to accept the contention raised by senior counsel We also find no substance in the arguments raised by the counsel for <ORG> Contentions raised by the counsel are only to disturb the substantial right of the <ORG> which has already been recognized by <ORG> holding that they have got first charge and the <ORG> can adopt its own procedure for enforcing the statutory charge Regarding the contention raised by senior counsel <NAME> we are of the view if any amount is due towards employees provident fund those matters could be taken up before the <ORG> Government <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant argued that decree passed by the <ORG> on was prior to the notice for attachment issued by <NAME> under Section of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act and as the sale notice issued by him was stayed by <ORG> on the bank did not commit any illegality by auctioning the first property of the company Learned counsel appearing for the bank argued that since the <ORG> was not a party before the <ORG> it was not necessary to give notice to the <NAME> In our view <ORG> did not commit any illegality by nullifying the auction conducted by the recovery officer of the <ORG> who as per admitted factual matrix of the case did not give notice to the revenue officer despite the fact that the property had been attached under Section of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act and the bank had challenged the notice issued under Section of that Act in Writ Petition No of and succeeded in persuading <ORG> to stay that notice On establishment of the bench of the <ORG> at Ernakulam all the suits were transferred to the <ORG> which passed decree dated in A No in A No and in A No The appellant issued notice under Section of the Securitisation Act and approached <ORG> Revenue Recovery Kanayannur for rendering assistance to take possession of the mortgaged property Thereupon the appellant filed Writ Petition No of for issue of a direction to the District Collector Ernakulam and <ORG> Kanayannur to take vacant possession of the mortgaged property Liberty was also given to the borrower guarantor to pay the arrears Writ appeal filed by the appellant bank against the interim order was disposed of by the Division Bench with the following observations Since the revenue authorities have already attached the property this court will not be justified in directing respondents and to hand over possession of the property to the <ORG> We leave it to the <ORG> to take a decision in this matter in accordance with law Since we have already expressed the view that in terms of Section of the Kerala Act the <ORG> has got prior charge over the property of the dealer and the facts of the case show that the revenue authorities had already attached the property there is no valid ground to interfere with the order passed by <ORG> In the meanwhile <ORG> issued notice under Section of the Kerala Revenue Recovery Act on for sale of the mortgaged properties for recovery of sales tax dues amounting to Rs The appellant challenged the proposed sale in Writ Petition No of and prayed that the <ORG> and its functionaries may be restrained from selling the property Accordingly he refused to interfere with the proposed sale of the mortgaged properties but gave liberty to the bank to proceed to execute the decree passed in its favour in accordance with law However it is made clear that this judgment shall not preclude the banks from realising their dues by taking recourse to other proceedings as may be permissible under law
