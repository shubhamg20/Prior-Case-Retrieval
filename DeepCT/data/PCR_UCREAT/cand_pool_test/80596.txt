It was contended on behalf of <NA<ORG>E> that the tribunal was not properly constituted The facts giving rise to the complaint against the appellant are very few It appears that there was a dispute concerning Jhalra well and certain agricultural plots surrounding the well between <NAME> and others on the one hand and Dr <NAME> and others on the other The learned Magistrate also passed an order attaching the property in dispute pending the decision of the proceedings under This was followed by another order passed on August that the crop which was on the field should be auctioned its price deposited in court and the land itself should be given for cultivation to the highest bidder for the next year Members of <ORG> were aggrieved by these orders and on their behalf the appellant preferred a revision application against these orders in the court of the <NAME> Judge <NAME> on August The appellant presented another petition before the learned <NAME> judge on August On these allegations the application prayed that an order should be passed not to auction the crop as well as the right of future cultivation and that liberty should be given to the cultivators to go to the well and to look after the crop pending the final disposal of their revision application before the learned <NAME> Judge The learned <NAME> Judge was not apparently inclined to grant ex parte interim stay and so on the same day he directed that notice of the revision application should be given to the other party and called upon the applicants to furnish talbana and a copy of the application So far there is no dispute about the facts There is however a serious dispute as to other events which according to the complainant happened on September As we have already indicated many of the facts alleged in the complaint against the appellant are not in dispute It is not denied by him that he took the envelope from the despatch clerk addressed to the Sub Divisional Magistrate <NAME> and that he in fact handed over the envelope the next day in the office of the Sub Divisional Magistrate Before the tribunal evidence was led by both the parties The complainant Dr <NAME> himself gave evidence and on his behalf <NAME> and <NAME> were examined The appellant <NAME> gave evidence on his behalf Both the members of the tribunal and the learned Judges of <ORG> have on the whole accepted the complainants version rejected the pleas raised by the appellant and have held that the appellant is guilty of gross professional misconduct It is this finding which on the merits is challenged before us by <NAME> on behalf of the appellant <NAME> has also raised two points of law in support of his argument that the order passed against the appellant must be set aside <NAME> contends that since <NAME> had appeared in the criminal proceedings in question for the opponent he was disqualified from acting as a member of the tribunal and this disqualification introduces a fatal infirmity in the constitution of the tribunal itself There is some force in this argument But where pecuniary interest is not attributed but instead a bias is suggested it often becomes necessary to consider whether there is a reasonable ground for assuming the possibility of a bias and whether it is likely to produce in the minds of the litigant or the public at large a reasonable doubt about the fairness of the administration of justice The principle says <NAME> nemo debet esse judex in causaproprta sua precludes a justice who is interested in the subjectmatter of a dispute from acting as a justice therein In our opinion there is and can be no doubt about the validity of this principle and we are prepared to assume that this principle applies not only to the justices as mentioned by <NAME> but to all tribunals and bodies which are given jurisdiction to determine judicially the rights of parties In this case the <ORG> was dealing with a case rising out of a collision between a motor A An affidavit was filed on behalf of the justices that they reached their decision without consulting the acting clerk and that the acting clerk had in fact abstained from referring to the case This affidavit was accepted as true by all the learned judges who heard the case and yet the conviction was quashed Nothing is to be done which creates even a suspicion that there has been an improper interference in the course of justice Subsequently the solicitor acted as a clerk to the justices who tried the case He stated in his affidavit that when acting as a clerk to the justices on the occasion in question he had no knowledge that his firm had acted for the wife and that he was in no way adverse to the husband It was urged that the decision of the justices should be set aside as the justices were not properly constituted and it appears also to have been suggested that the decision might perhaps have been influenced by a prejudice though indirectly and to a very small extent It has however been urged before us by <NAME> on behalf of the Advocate General that this principle should not be applied to the proceedings before the tribunal appointed under <ORG>s Act In the present case we have no hesitation in assuming that when <NAME> agreed to work as the Chairman of the tribunal he did not remember that he had appeared against the appellant clients in the criminal proceedings under The decision of the <ORG> however was based substantially on two grounds <ORG> who delivered the principal judgment of the <ORG> observed that when objection to a conviction is taken merely by a member of the public and not by a party more particularly aggrieved the granting of a certiorari is discretionary The alleged bias in a member of the tribunal does not render the proceedings invalid if it is shown that the objection against the presence of the member in question had not been their by the party even though the party knew about the circumstances giving rise to the allegations about the alleged bias and was aware of his right to challenge the presence of the member in the tribunal The first round of objection filed by the appellant against the tribunal report was that <NAME> had pecuniary and personal interest in the complainant Dr <NAME> The learned Judges of <ORG> have also found that the objection was raised by the appellant before them only to obtain an order for a fresh enquiry and thus gain time We have however heard <NAME> case on the question of waiver and we have no hesitation in reaching the conclusion that the appellant waived his objection deliberately and cannot now be allowed to raise it We are disposed to think that even a layman not familiar with legal technicalities and equitable principles on which this doctrine of disability has been based would have immediately apprehended that the lawyer who had appeared for Dr <NAME> was authorised to sit in judgment over the conduct of the appellant and that might cause embarassnient to the appellant and might lead to prejudice against him Since we have no doubt that the appellant knew the material facts and must be deemed to have been conscious of his legal rights in that matter his failure to take the present plea at the earlier stage of the proceedings creates an effective bar of waiver against him It seems clear that the appellant wanted to take a chance to secure a favourable report from the tribunal which was constituted and when he found that he was confronted with an unfavourable report he adopted the device of raising the present technical point It appears from the judgment of <ORG> that the learned Judges sent for and looked into the record of Revision Application No of in <ORG> <NAME> and the record of Case No of in <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> has made pointed reference to the fact that the record in Case No of was sent for by <ORG> after this matter had been argued before them It was this argument which provoked the reply from the other side that in fact the fabricated order had been implemented and in support of this reply reference was made to the application made by Dr <NAME> and his men in which it had been specifically alleged that the appellant clients had taken possession of the crops and that they had also removed them We may however incidentally point out that there are some salient features of the case which unequivocally support the view taken by <ORG> against the appellant It is admitted that the appellant was present and that he took the envelope containing the order to the Sub Divisional Magistrate <ORG> has taken the view and we think rightly that the conduct of <NAME> should also be examined as it is obvious that both <NAME> and <NAME> were interested in persuading the Sessions Judge to take the view that the fabrication of the order was due to a mistake committed by <NAME> Then again the order actually issued is elaborate in its terms and its object clearly was to require the Sub Divisional Magistrate to give effect to the prayers made by the appellant in his application without any delay His present version is that he prepared the draft order at the instance of the appellant before the case was argued and when he received it back duly signed by the Reader <NAME> it was given to the despatcher and from him it reached the hands of the appellant There is no doubt that <NAME> is an accomplice and so like all accomplices he has tried to minimise the part played by him in this transaction It is true that the evidence against the appellant is substantially circumstantial and there is no a doubt that the finding against the appellant cannot be made on such circumstantial evidence unless the evidence is wholly incon sistent with his innocence and leads irresistibly to the inference of his guilt <NAME> then argued that the failure of the complainant to examine <NAME> the Reader was deliberate and he suggested that adverse inference against the complainant should be drawn in consequence Besides in the present case there is no justification for drawing any such adverse inference against the complainant because <NAME> is no better than an accomplice and it is difficult to assume that the failure of the complainant to examine an accomplice can ever give rise to an adverse inference against the complainant case In the result we have no hesitation in holding that no case has been made out for our interference with the conclusions of <ORG> under Art They are in a sense officers of the court and as such they are given special rights and privileges In fairness to the <ORG> we ought to add that cases of this nature are very rare but unfortunately when such cases come before the courts the courts must take a serious view of such reprehensible lapses and must pass deterrent orders
