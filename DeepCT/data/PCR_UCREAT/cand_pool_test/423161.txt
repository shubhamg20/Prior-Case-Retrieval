In <ORG> all parties appear to have been willing that a scheme should be framed but on appeal objection has been taken on behalf of the <ORG> to the scheme approved by the <ORG> on the ground that it is not open to the <ORG> to frame a scheme of this sort interfering with the statutory management of the Temple <ORG> Section imposes upon all trustees managers and superintendents the duty of keeping accounts and empowers and requires the Temple <ORG>s to require the production of such accounts at least once a year means an individual or body to which others have delegated a particular duty and I can see no reason why the remaining members constituting a majority should not be able to act during a vacancy Mr <NAME> who appeared for the <ORG> stated that there is evidence to show that the <ORG> never appointed any hereditary trustee and alleged that they had no power to do so in the exercise of the statutory authority under Section of the Regulation Now as to this I take it the <ORG> cannot interfere with the statutory powers conferred upon the members of the <ORG> so as to deprive them of their statutory functions see Attorney General Governors of <ORG> Ves although following the practice of the <ORG> of Chancery it might frame a scheme conditional on legislative sanction being obtained for it as to which see In re <ORG> Tw The learned Judge observed I prefer to state my own opinion broadly There is no authority in the books for any such proposition That case however does not go so far as to decide that the <ORG> cannot frame any scheme at all for a charity under statutory management on the contrary although as observed in the judgment no case of breach of trust or maladministration of any kind was suggested by the Attorney General against the governing body and there was no case of failure of the trusts or of the charitable objects of the endowments the learned Judge whilst rejecting the Attorney General scheme still held himself at liberty to sanction the scheme submitted by the governors themselves proposing certain alterations to meet the altered circumstances of the time If travel over the same ground in my judgment it is because the points raised in appeal are of far reaching consequences On the other hand Mr <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> argued that the Trichinopoly Temple <ORG> had no jurisdiction over <ORG> as at the time of the passing of Act XX of there was a hereditary trustee The language of Section of the Regulation which confers general powers to adopt measures for carrying out the objects of the trust must be restricted to the cases for which a report is to be called for under the preceding sections Moreover the documents to which our attention was drawn show that only the right to select a trustee was given to the family of the Sthalathars and that the selection was subject to the approval of <ORG> If this question had been raised in proper time evidence might have been forthcoming to show that the term hereditary has been loosely applied in this case I agree with the learned Chief Justice that this temple comes under Section of Act XX of and that the <ORG> has jurisdiction over it There is no reliable data regarding the exercise of supervision by the ancient kings of the land over temples Consequently they very early came to the conclusion that the king as parens patrice should protect the religious institutions from malversation in the same way that he looked after the rights of his lay subjects Lord <NAME> pointed out that the Supreme <ORG> had an equitable jurisdiction similar to and corresponding with the equitable jurisdiction exercised by the <ORG> of Chancery in England over charities There is no doubt that the Mofussil <ORG>s had similar powers Sar which was an appeal from a Mofussil <ORG> their Lordships of <ORG> proceeded on the footing that Civil <ORG>s had jurisdiction to see that temple funds were properly applied It is clear from the Charter granted to <ORG> that they were authorised to judge all persons belonging to the said Governor and <ORG> or that should live under them in all causes whether civil or criminal according to the laws of the kingdom and to execute justice accordingly Charter of Charles II in I shall next consider whether <ORG> in England would have had jurisdiction to frame a scheme like the one we are now considering with special reference to the fact that <ORG> as statutory bodies had certain powers delegated to them In Attorney General <NAME> Vesey Junior the Lord Chancellor says I have long been perfectly satisfied that this <ORG> has jurisdiction The above cases do not sustain the proposition contended for by the appellant that the <ORG> is deprived of jurisdiction by reason of the existence of a visitor or of a statutory body to control the affairs of a trust In <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> Ch Ch <NAME> quotes with approval <NAME> classification of liabilities relating to trusts There is that class where there is a liability existing at Common Law and which is only re enacted by the Statute with a special form of remedy there unless the Statute contains words necessarily excluding the Common Law remedy the plaintiff has his election of proceeding either under the Statute or at Common Law Then there is a second class which consists of those cases in which a Statute has created a liability but has given no special remedy for it there the party may adopt an action of debt or other remedy at Common Law to enforce it The third class is where the Statute creates a liability not existing at Common Law and gives also a particular remedy for enforcing it The observations of <NAME> are very apposite to this class of cases Now if I find that the Statute enacts either by way of new creation or by way of re statement of an ancient right a right of property that at once gives rise to the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to protect that right If the Act goes on to provide a particular remedy for the infringement of that right of property so created that does not exclude the jurisdiction of this <ORG> to protect the right of property unless the Act in terms says so His Lordship held that greater powers were given to him than was warranted by the original Charter These observations apply mutatis mutandis to the present case Where there is a clear and distinct trust this <ORG> administers and enforces it as much where there is a visitor as where there is none The visitor has a Common Law office and Common Law duties to perform and does not superintend the performance of the trust which belong to the various officers which he may take care to see are properly kept up and appointed and several other cases expressly establish the authority of this <ORG> in cases of trusts and the duty of this <ORG> to see that they are properly performed notwithstanding that there may be a special or a general visitor I have made this lengthy extract because it seems to me that in India under the superintendence of <ORG> we have reached a position where the duties and functions are rarely if ever spontaneously performed The duty I take it is that of the parens patriae The right of general superintendence is wide enough to include the power to appoint additional trustees I infer the power to appoint additional trustees from Sections and read with Section Further the right of superintendence must be limited to the exercise of the powers conferred on the <ORG> or on the <ORG> whose jurisdiction is analogous to that of the visitor in England Section deals with cases in which the <ORG> had the exclusive power of appointment and requires the local agent to suggest names It seems to me that the clause or made such other provision for the trust etc Section gives a right of suit to persons aggrieved by the exercise of the powers vested in the <ORG> It stands to reason that when there is a trustee who is responsible for the management of the properties and for their application his control over the servants of the establishment should not be interfered with by the <ORG> The very limited power as to accounts given by the second clause of Section to the <ORG> bears out this position It is a limited remedy that is given by this section to the public It only empowers the <ORG> to direct the specific performance of duties which have been neglected The above examination of the sections of the Regulation and of the Act shows that the power of settling a scheme is not within the competence of the <ORG> It is true as pointed out by Mr <NAME> that the <ORG> trustee whenever he had an opportunity endeavoured to subvert the uses of the institution by showing his partiality towards the usages of his own section Moreover although the temple is mainly Thengalai the archakas and paricharakas are <ORG>s and there are a large number of <ORG> mirasi offices in this Temple We see no reason for disagreeing with the Subordinate Judge in regard to this matter <ORG> trustee there was no necessity for the appointment of another <ORG> trustee The <ORG> should have the same power with regard to them as they have with reference to the other three trustees Clause which confers certain powers of supervision and control on the treasurer should be modified by investing <ORG> with those powers As was done with reference to the <ORG> scheme we think liberty should be given to any of the trustees or any member of the <ORG> or to the st plaintiff in this case to move the <ORG> for such alterations in the scheme as seem desirable in the light of the experience that may have been gained of its working Who has been convicted of any offence involving moral turpitude or against whom orders under Sections Criminal procedure Code have been passed An appeal shall lie to the <ORG> from an order of dismissal whose decision shall be final All leases and gales shall be by public auction or in such other manner as may be provided for in the rules
