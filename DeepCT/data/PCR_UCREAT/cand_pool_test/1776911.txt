On the language of this instrument I have come to the conclusion that there is no sufficient reason for cutting down the disposition in favour of the widows was decided on the view that there is a general presumption that a gift to a woman is only of a woman estate though on the language of that document which was different from the language here the rule of construction laid down in <NAME> <NAME> I A Sar I do not think that these judgments are authorities for the proposition that in all oases where gifts are made to females a Hindu must be deemed to have given them only an estate for life I am not aware of any such provision in the Hindu Law nor have we been referred to any authority in support of it <ORG> say at the end of page Nothing has been found in the context here or the surrounding circumstances or is relied upon by the respondents but the fact that the donee is a woman and a widow which was expressly decided in the last mentioned case not to suffice that at any rate so far as the Southern Presidency is concerned there is nothing improbable in a Hindu giving an absolute estate to his wife when he directs an adoption to be made to him It was not seriously argued that there is any material difference between the words employed in the case of the adopted son and the words employed in the case of the two wives The decree of the Subordinate Judge must be reversed and the suit should be dismissed with costs except in respect of the property which was the subject matter of the suit under Exhibit A The memorandum of objections is also dismissed with costs
