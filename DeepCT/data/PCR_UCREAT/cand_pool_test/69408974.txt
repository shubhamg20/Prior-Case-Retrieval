The background in which the question has come up for consideration may first be noticed It is considered necessary to prepare a Regional Environmental Management Plan for urgent implementation to enable eco friendly regional development in the area On consideration of the reports this Court came to the conclusion that the mining activities in the vicinity of tourist resorts are bound to cast serious impact on the local ecology On th May this Court directed the Chief Secretary <ORG> to stop within hours all mining activities and pumping of ground water in and from an area upto kms It may be noted that <ORG> was constituted by <ORG> under notification dated th January issued in exercise of power under Section of the Environment Protection Act for short the EP Act Mr <NAME> was appointed its Chairman The <ORG> was constituted with a view to protect and improve the quality of environment and preventing controlling and abetting environmental pollution The <ORG> has jurisdiction over the National Capital Region as defined in clause of Section of the National Capital Region Planning Board Act There was clear evidence of violation of the following conditions Mining should commence only after the environmental management plan EMP is approved by a designated authority There is no evidence of an environmental management plan being adhered to in this region Compliance with groundwater related regulations The NOC given by <ORG> includes an explicit condition regarding ground water That the mine owner will ensure that there is no discharge of effluent of ground water outside lease premises Even the Haryana government affidavit in court accepts that pumping of ground water is taking place though it attempts to soften the issue by arguing that it is only being done in a few cases But there was little evidence in these poor and destitute villages that any effort had been made to share the proceeds with them <ORG> also noted the bias of <ORG> to shield the offenders and has said that because there is prima facie evidence of the involvement of a person who holds the high position of the cabinet minister in the state the enquiry should be done by <ORG> It has been observed that drainage pattern of the area has been modified due to haphazard mining and dumping of waste material which has bearing on natural path of ground water flow in the area The Committee was also permitted to associate such other organizations or persons as it may deem fit and proper for the purpose of inspection The observations made as a request of inspection in regard to each mine are as follows The numbers indicated in parenthesis are serial number of mines given in the list of mines furnished by <NAME> senior advocate to <ORG> that was forwarded to <ORG> It is also stated in the report that the geology and geomorphology of the area comprises oldest exposed lithology with upland units The NOC given by <ORG> includes an explicit condition regarding ground water That the mine owner will ensure that there is no discharge of effluent or ground water outside lease premises <ORG> is concerned that if mining is allowed to continue in this area it will have serious implications for the groundwater reserve which is the only source of drinking water in the area If mining could not be stopped in so many pits even after reaching groundwater level there is no guarantee that even some of those mines still at the surface level will abide by the stipulated norms when they reach the water table Submissions for Confirming or varying Order dated th May Having regard to the ground realities as reflected in the aforesaid reports should the order passed on th May be varied is the question The continuance of the order has been strenuously objected to by the mining lease holders and also by <ORG> The notification in so far as material for the present purposes reads Whereas a Notification under Section and Section of the Environment Protection Act inviting objections against restricting certain activities in specified area of Aravalli Range which are causing Environmental Degradation in the Region was published in the Gazette of India Part II Section sub section ii vide dated th January And whereas all objections received have been duly considered by <ORG> Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section and clause of sub section of Section of the Environment Protection Act read with rule of the Environment Protection Rules <ORG> hereby prohibits the carrying on the following process and operations except with its prior permission in the areas specified in the Table appended to this Notification i ii a All new mining operations including renewals of mining leases Existing mining leases in sanctuaries national Park and areas covered under Project Tiger and or Mining is being done without permission of the competent authority iii Cutting of trees iv Construction of any clusters of dwelling units farmhouses sheds community centers information centers and any other activity connected with such construction including roads a part of any infrastructure relating thereto The said notification reads thus MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT AND FORESTS NOTIFICATION New Delhi the th November In exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Environment Protection Act hereinafter referred to as the said Act read

the respective State Governments to take necessary action under section of the said Act in respect of cases where the project proponents fail to implement the conditions The notification has been issued by <ORG> <ORG> in exercise of powers conferred by sub section and clause of sub section of Section of the EP Act read with clause of sub rule of Rule of the EP Rules stipulating that expansion or modernization of any activity if the pollution load is to exceed the existing one or a new project listed in Schedule I of the notification shall not be undertaken in any part of India unless it has been accorded environmental clearance by <ORG> in accordance with the procedure specified in the notification The notification dated th January to the extent material for the present purpose reads as under Whereas a notification under clause a of sub rule of rule of the Environment Protection Rules inviting objections from the public within sixty days from the date of publication of the said notification against the intention of <ORG> to impose restrictions and prohibitions on the expansion and modernization of any activity or new projects being undertaken in any part of India unless environmental clearance has been accorded by <ORG> or <ORG> in accordance with the procedure specified in that notification was published as No dated th January And whereas all objections received have been duly considered Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section and clause of sub section of section of the Environment Protection Act read with clause of sub rule of rule of the Environment Protection Rules <ORG> hereby directs that on and from the date of publication of this notification in the Official Gazette expansion or modernization of any activity if pollution

in accordance with the procedure hereinafter specified in this notification The said Committee of Experts shall have full right of entry and inspection of the site or as the case may be factory premises at any time prior to during or after the commencement of the operations relating to the project The assessment shall be completed within a period of ninety days from receipt of the requisite documents and data from the project authorities and completion of public hearing where required and decision conveyed within thirty days thereafter In order to enable <ORG> to monitor effectively the implementation of the recommendations and conditions subject to which the environmental clearance has been given the project authorities concerned shall submit a half yearly report to <ORG> In terms of the notification <ORG> and <ORG> were directed to impose the conditions mentioned in the notification while according environmental clearance The applications were filed during the pendency of these matters under the order of this <ORG> <ORG> was constituted in terms of notification dated th September issued by the <ORG> <ORG> in exercise of power conferred by Section of the EP Act for the purposes of monitoring and ensuring compliance of the order of this <ORG> covering the subject matter of forest and wildlife and related issues arising out of the said order and one of the functions of the <ORG> in terms of the notification is to monitor the implementation of the orders of this <ORG> and place reports of non compliance before the <ORG> including in respect of encroachment and removals working plans compensatory afforestation plantations and other conservation issues In the order dated st October this <ORG> has observed that no mining activity can be carried out without remedial measures taking place and for this purpose it is necessary that environment impact assessment is done and the applications dealt with before any mining activity can be permitted Mining activities are permitted in a manner which is destroying the ground water table and also the deep aquifers thereby causing irreparable damage to the critical ground water reserves In respect of mining in Aravalli Hills in Gurgaon the relevant notifications dated th May th November and th January have been noticed earlier This <ORG> has repeatedly said that the right to live is a fundamental right under Article of the Constitution and it includes the right to of enjoyment of pollution free water and air for full enjoyment of life Article which provides that it shall be the duty of the <ORG> to raise the level of nutrition and the standard of living and to improve public health is also relevant in this connection this <ORG> observed that sustainable development means the type or extent of development that can take place and which can be sustained by nature ecology with or without mitigation For carrying on any mining activity close to township which has tendency to degrade environment and are likely to effect air water and soil and impair the quality of life of inhabitants of the area there would be greater responsibility on the part of the entrepreneur Principle of Rio Conference of relating to the applicability of precautionary principle which stipulates that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for proposing effective measures to prevent environmental degradation is also required to be kept in view Bearing in mind the aforesaid principles we have to consider the main question should the mining activity in areas in question be banned altogether or permitted and if so conditions to be provided therefor The reports and suggestions of <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> have already been extensively noted <ORG> is empowered to make rules to provide for the manner in which rehabilitation of flora and other vegetation such as trees shrubs and the like destroyed by reason of any mining operation shall be made in the same area or in any other area selected by <ORG> whether by way of reimbursement of the cost of rehabilitation or otherwise by the person holding the mining lease Section inter alia casts a duty upon <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and systematic development of minerals in India and for the protection of environment by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by mining operations and for such purposes <ORG> may by notification in the official gazette make such rules as it thinks fit The Mineral Concession Rules have been framed by <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the MMRD Act Rules made under Section however deal with commencement of mining operations and steps required to be taken for protection of environment by proventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by mining operation The mining operations shall be carried out in such a manner so as to cause least damage to the flora of the area and nearby areas Our attention was drawn by learned counsel appearing for lease holders to the part of national policy which provides that beneficiaries who are allowed mining and quarrying in forest land and in land covered by trees should be required to repair and re vegetate the area in accordance with established forestry practices to submit that the policy itself contemplates mining operations in the forest area Further it is also not possible to accept the contention urged on behalf of the lease holders that only that part of such leased land where allegedly damage has been caused to plantation as a result of mining operations be excluded from mining and not the entire area of the lease Report of <ORG> on Aravalli <ORG> <ORG> on being asked by <ORG> to conduct a study of environmental problems of Aravalli hills and preparation of action plan for restoration of environmental quality in Gurgaon district after extensive examination has submitted to <ORG> its final report in July Though the records of such lands are available at every village level map there is no record available in the district level in respect of these areas to undertake realistic appraisal and effective monitoring of mining and other projects at the macro level on such lands There is no identified land where overburden could be temporarily dumped prior to being utilized for void filling and for other purposes The environmental cost needs to be internalized in the cost of the product and there is need to limit the supply options There are number of mining projects etc The report states that though the environmental upgradation measures need to be taken more seriously by the mine and other industrial operators there is need on the part of the <ORG> Government to immediately start these measures in the areas where degradation has already taken place Before concluding this aspect we may note that assuming there was any ambiguity about the applicability of order dated th May to mining in Aravalli Range it is clarified that the said order would be applicable to all the mines in Aravalli hill range in Gurgaon district The contention urged on behalf of the lease holders is that the leases in question do not relate to expansion or modernization of any activity as postulated by the notification Reliance has been placed on a decision of this Court in <NAME> case supra holding that the notification is clearly prospective and inter alia prohibits the undertaking of a new project listed in Schedule I without prior environmental clearance from <ORG> The observations made in para of the said decision and relied upon by learned counsel for the lease holders have no relevance to determine the applicability of the notification at the stage of renewal In <NAME> case the environmental clearance had been granted in the year and this Court noticing that when it was granted by the Prime Minister whatever studies were available were taken into consideration it was known that the construction of the dam would result in submergence and the consequent effect which the reservoir will have on the ecology of the surrounding areas and various studies relating to environmental impact had been taken into consideration and that there was no obligation to obtain the statutory clearance under notification In the present case regarding the manner of grant of no objection certificate from environmental angle for proposed mining activity by way of illustration we may refer to the order dated th January issued by <ORG> whereby no objection certificate for renewal of lease was granted stipulating that the applicant <NAME> in respect of mining activity at village Anangpur district Faridabad shall also seeking environmental clearance of its mining project in compliance with this notification without even mentioning any time limit for it and admittedly till date that had not been done Further the letter dated th January sent to Principal Secretary of <ORG> by <ORG> Haryana shows how the State Government has been circumventing the legal requirements and permitting mining though a case under Forest Conservation Act rejecting the contention that approval at the stage of renewal was not necessary and also the plea that since the leaseholders had invested sum of money in mining operation it was the duty of the authorities to renew the lease it was held that having regard to the awareness that deforestation and ecological imbalances as a result of deforestation have become social menaces and the same should be prevented and that the concept that power coupled with the duty enjoined upon the respondents to renew the lease stood eroded by the mandate of the FC Act Therefore it was the duty of the authorities that the power of granting permission should have been so exercised that the appellants had the full benefits of their investments While there was power to grant renewal and in these cases there were clauses permitting renewals it might have cast a duty to grant such renewal in the facts and circumstances of the cases specially in view of the investments made by the appellants in the areas covered by the quarrying leases but renewals cannot be claimed as a matter of right for the following reasons SCC agreeing with views expressed in Ambica Quarry Workers it was held that the FC Act applies to renewals as well and even if there was a provision for renewal in the lease agreement on exercise of lessee option the requirement of the Act had to be satisfied before such renewal could be granted We are unable to accept the contention that the notification dated th January would not apply to leases which come up for consideration for renewal after issue of the notification The controversy is in respect of certain leases where area under the lease is covered under notification issued under Section and or of the Punjab Land Preservation Act Under Section of the aforesaid Act whenever it appears to <ORG> that it is desirable to provide for the conservation of sub soil water or the prevention of erosion in any area subject to erosion or likely to become liable to erosion such Government may by notification make a direction accordingly In respect of some mining areas notifications have been issued under Section and in respect of some notifications have been issued both under Sections and The contention urged on behalf of <ORG> is that it was on account of erroneous view point of <ORG> Not only in their record the area has been shown as forest but the affidavits have been filed in this Court stating the area to be forest We may also note that assuming that there was any confusion or erroneous impression it ought to have been first sorted out at appropriate level and where affidavits had been filed in this Court clarifications orders sought before issue of the mining lease in respect of such area Impact of Mining on Ground Water Where during mining water level is touched <ORG> shall carve out that area and it was agreed on behalf of the leaseholders that they would co operate and not undertake any mining in such an area Non payment of royalty to the villagers A controversy has been raised about non payment of royalty by the leaseholders to villagers on whose behalf it was contended that the order dated th May prohibiting mining should not be varied till the leaseholders discharge their liability to pay royalty to the villagers We leave it open to be adjudicated before appropriate forum in accordance with law Leases in respect of minor mineral Though notification dated th January is not applicable to minor minerals but having regard to what we have discussed above in regard to degradation of environment and the required standard about the risk of harm to the environment or to human health to be decided in public interest according to reasonable person test and the report of <ORG> we direct <ORG> to examine the leases granted for extraction of minor mineral in light thereof and file its report The Committee would however bear in mind that the notification dated th January as such is not applicable to these leases Besides above <ORG> is directed to appoint an officer from <ORG> to be a member of <ORG> In case despite stringent condition there is an adverse irreversible effect on the ecology in the Aravalli hill range area at a later date the total stoppage of mining activity in the area may have to be considered
