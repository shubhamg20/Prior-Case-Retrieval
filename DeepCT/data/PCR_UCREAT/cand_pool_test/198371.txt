Section ii provides that the provisions of clause i shall apply only in respect of one of such houses which the assessee may at his option specify in that behalf The petitioner an assessee under the Act contended before <ORG> in a petition under Article of the Constitution that inclusion of any amount under section of the Act in his income was unconstitutional as there could be no income at all in such a case accruing to him in a true sense of that term and that the liability that was sought to be imposed under the Act in respect of his residential house was in its pith and substance a tax on building falling under Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and hence <ORG> could not impose the said liability under a law made in exercise of its legislative power under Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule which authorised it only to levy taxes on income other than agricultural income In the Special Leave Petition to this Court it was contended on behalf of the petitioner that as he was not deriving any monetary benefit by residing in his own house no tax could be levied on him on the ground that he is deriving income from that house and that the word income only means realisation of monetary benefit and that in the absence of any such realisation the inclusion of any amount by way of notional income under section of the Act in the chargeable income was impermissible as it was outside the scope of Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution The expression income means a thing that comes in Section of the Indian Income tax Act provided for levy of income tax on the basis of the bona fide annual value of the property even when it was in the occupation of the assessee for the purposes of his own residence ii The Constitution makers had the Indian Income tax Act in their view is borne out from Article of the Constitution which provides for collection of taxes on income by <ORG> and distribution thereof between the Union and the States It is well settled that the entries in the Lists in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution should not be read in a narrow or restricted sense and each and every subject mentioned in the entries should be read as including within its scope all ancillary and subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended in it The Order of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMIAH The short question which arises for consideration in this petition for special leave to appeal filed under Article of the Constitution is whether it is open to the Income tax Officer while computing the liability of an assessee to tax under the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act to include in the income of the assessee any amount calculated in accordance with section of the Act in respect of a house in the occupation of the assessee for the purposes of his own residence The petitioner who is an assessee under the Act contended before <ORG> in a petition filed under Article of the Constitution that inclusion of any amount under section of the Act in his income was unconstitutional as there could be no income at all in such a case accruing to him in the true sense of that term the liability that was sought to be imposed under the Act in respect of his residential house was therefore in its pith and substance a tax on building falling under Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and hence <ORG> could not impose the said liability under a law made in exercise of its legislative power under Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which authorised it only to levy taxes on income other than agricultural income The petitioner has now applied to this Court for special leave to appeal against the decision of <ORG> When the petition came up for hearing on February before us we did not find that there was any ground to grant special leave to appeal but since the case was argued with some persistence we decided to give reasons for rejecting the prayer of the petitioner which we proceed to give hereunder <NAME> Section of the Act lays down that where any Central Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any assessment year at any rate or rates income tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the Act in respect of the total income of the previous year or previous years as the case may be of every person Section of the Act mentions income from house property as one of the heads of income liable to charge Section ii of the Act provides that where the property consists of more than one house in the occupation of the owner for the purposes of his own residence the provisions of clause i of section shall apply only in respect of one of such houses which the assessee may at his option specify in that behalf There are some other ancillary and incidental provisions in the Act dealing with the computation of the annual value of such property with which we are not concerned in the present petition The argument urged on behalf of the petitioner is that as the petitioner is not deriving any monetary benefit by residing in his own house no tax can be levied on him on the ground that he is deriving income from that house Now it is well settled that the entries in the list in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution should not be read in a narrow or restricted sense and each and every subject mentioned in the entries should be read as including within its scope all ancillary and subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended in it The expression income according to <ORG> means a thing that comes in A is but one of five Schedules which provide varying methods of estimating the measure of that income from different sources for the purposes of charge to tax If the owner of such pro <NAME> perties as these should be himself in occupation of them it by no means follows that he will in fact derive from them an income equal to this annual value but as he has the use and enjoyment of the properties it is for the purposes of the Statute presumed that he does derive from them an income equal in amount to this annual value and the tax is accordingly under Schedule A assessed upon this presumed income In the above case this Court held that the word income in Entry No of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act should be given a meaning wider than the connotation given to it in the English Income tax Act under which income attributable to property was chargeable under Schedule A thereof There is one other circumstance which persuades us to take the view that computation of income for purposes of levy of income tax in accordance with section of the Act is justifiable under Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution Section of the Indian Income tax Act provided for levy of income tax on the basis of the bona fide annual value of the property even when it was in the occupation of the assessee for the purposes of his own residence That the Constitution makers had the Indian Income tax Act in their view is borne out from Article of the Constitution which provides for collection of taxes on income by the Government of India and distribution thereof between the Union and the States Article which defines agricultural income as agricultural income as defined for the purposes of the enactments relating to Indian Income tax and Article which defines tax on income as including a tax in the nature of an excess profits tax In the circumstances it would not be wrong to construe the word income in Entry as including all items which were taxable under the contemporaneous law relating to tax on incomes which was in force at the time when the Constitution was enacted when as observed by this Court in the case of <NAME> supra the word income in Entry is capable of a wider meaning than what was given to it in the Indian Income tax Act or the English Act of Hence we do not find any merit in the contentions urged on behalf of the petitioner
