In all these references the following question has been referred to this court under Section of the Orissa Sales Tax Act by the Member <ORG> Whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the petitioner society is a dealer within the meaning of Section of the Orissa Sales Tax Act liable to be assessed to sales tax for the quarter in question For the quarters covered by the financial years to the assessee filed nil returns for all the quarters since according to it it was not a dealer under the Act Being moved by the assessee the <ORG> has referred the above question to this court It is contended by Mr <NAME> appearing for the petitioner that the petitioner society is not a dealer and that it neither carries on any business within the meaning of Section of the Act nor does it purchase goods from its members or supply goods to its members within the meaning of the latter part of that section According to him carrying on business refers to an activity or activities designed to earn a profit and when there is no element of profit making in the business the society cannot be said to be a dealer To bring a transaction within the purview of the Act there must be a sale and such sale must be made by a dealer in the course of his business In this Act unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context Dealer means any person who carries on the business of purchasing or selling or supplying goods in Orissa whether for commission remuneration or otherwise and includes a department of Government which carries on such business and any firm or Hindu joint family and any society club or association which purchases goods from or sells or supplies goods to its members and also includes a casual dealer as hereinbefore denned The manager or agent of a dealer who resides outside Orissa and who carries on the business of purchasing or selling or supplying goods in Orissa shall in respect of such business be deemed to be a dealer for the purpose of this Act Carrying on own business of buying or selling goods is essential for a person to be a dealer It may be that he is selling somebody else goods but the business which he carries on must be his own The fact that such a person would be receiving commission or remuneration for selling somebody else goods would not make any difference provided that the business of selling belongs to him Unless therefore the assessee can be said to have carried on such business of selling goods whether as principal or as agent he cannot be termed as a dealer Two questions therefore arise for determination in this case namely whether the goods that are sold by the petitioner are its own and assuming that the goods do not belong to it whether the business of selling belongs to it It is not disputed that wages are paid to the weaver members for converting the yarn into finished goods We thus find in this case that the yarn before it is made over to the members remains the property of the society and after the yarn is converted into finished goods these finished goods remain the property of the society and it is the society which has absolute control over the goods till they are sold On these facts their Lordships posed the question whether the business of selling the goods was the assessee own business or the business of <ORG> and held having regard to the facts stated above that in selling the goods of the organisation the assessee was not carrying on his own business but the business of the organisation The effect of surrendering to the pool is to place the coffee at the absolute disposal of the <ORG> and thereafter the owner has no right except to share the sale proceeds of the pool as provided by the Act after the coffee is marketed by the <ORG> It was argued on behalf of the <ORG> that it was merely an agent of the producer and as the sale by the producer of his produce is excluded from the turnover definition in the Act there is no justification for imposing the tax on the assessee Their Lordships repelled this contention and held The collective marketing activity or sale by the <ORG> of the coffee which is under its control and custody of which it becomes the absolute owner under the provisions of the Act is undoubtedly the business of the <ORG> of selling goods and therefore the transactions of the <ORG> now under consideration are clearly transactions of the dealer within the meaning of the General Sales Tax Act Referring to the contention advanced on behalf of the <ORG> as has been done by the petitioner in this case that the <ORG> makes over the profits to the producer their Lordships held The <ORG> when it sells the coffee of the pool does undoubtedly aim to make a profit though not for itself For the reasons aforesaid we answer the question in the affirmative
