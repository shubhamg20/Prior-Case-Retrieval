I may state briefly the facts leading to this appeal The appellant insurer however defended its liability mainly on the ground that the terms and the conditions of the policy of insurance had been violated inasmuch as the deceased was traveling by the offending tractor as unauthorized passenger whose risk was not covered under the policy and the offending driver at the time of accident was not holding a valid and effective driving licence for the reason that the licence held by him was not renewed and did not authorize him to drive tractor fitted with a trolly which falls in the category of a transport vehicle <ORG> after completing the inquiry and appraisal of the evidence found that the accident had occurred due to rash and negligent driving by the driver of the offending tractor and the deceased died as a result thereof In regard to the defence taken by the appellant insurer <ORG> held that the deceased was traveling as a labourer with the offending tractor Mr <NAME> submitted that a <ORG> or Claims <ORG> has no jurisdiction to foist liability of satisfying the award on the insurer with liberty to recover the amount from the insured In support of his contention that the deceased was traveling as unauthorized passenger Mr <NAME> sought to draw support from the evidence rendered by respondent <NAME> who is wife of the deceased and <NAME> and submitted that the tractor having been attached with a trolly and deceased having been engaged as a labourer risk to life of a labourer was not covered under the insurance policy Having read and analyzed the evidence led by both the sides before the learned <ORG> I am not persuaded as I find no valid reason to disagree with the conclusion recorded by the learned <ORG> on various issues of fact I have noticed that there is nothing in the evidence led before the learned <ORG> that the offending tractor at the time of accident was being used for any commercial purpose Last question but not the least however is whether the learned Tribunal had the jurisdiction and was legally right in foisting the liability on the appellant insurer to satisfy the award with liberty to recover the awarded amount from the insured owner In <ORG> <NAME> AIR SC <ORG> has observed that the liability of the insurance company to satisfy the decree at the first instance and to recover the awarded amount from the owner or driver thereof has been holding the field for a long time the <ORG> and the court must however exercise their jurisdiction to issue such a direction upon consideration of the facts and circumstances of each case and in the event such a direction has been issued despite arriving at a finding of fact to the effect that the insurer has been able to establish that the insured has committed a breach of contract of insurance as envisaged under subclause ii of clause a of sub section of Section of the Act the insurance company shall be entitled to realise the awarded amount from the owner or driver of the vehicle as the case may be in execution of the same award having regard to the provisions of Sections and of the Act I agree with the view taken by the learned <ORG> as I find no good reason to disagree Besides I find another good reason for upholding the order of the learned <ORG> There is not even a whisper in the evidence led by the appellant insurer that the owner of the offending tractor was aware of the fact that the driver had not got his licence renewed For all that said and discussed above I hold that this appeal has no merit and dismissed the same
