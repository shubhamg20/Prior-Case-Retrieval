The short facts which have given rise to this reference are The opponent firm is a registered dealer dealing in iron and steel gold and silver vegetable ghee corrugated iron sheets etc iron plates sold in the same form in which they are directly produced by the rolling mills It would undoubtedly be very bad groundnut oil but still it would be groundnut oil and if so it did not seem to accord with logic that when the quality of the oil was improved in that its resistance to the natural processes of deterioration through oxidation was increased it should be held not to be oil Thus though the hydrogenated oil was refined groundnut oil after this process of hydrogenation it was held that hydrogenated oil still continued to be groundnut oil notwithstanding the processing which was merely for the purposes of rendering the oil more stable thus improving its keeping qualities for those who desire to consume groundnut oil At page this Court followed the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> and Others where the question had arisen regarding chira and muri as to whether they could be said to be covered by tile words all cereals and pulses including all forms of rice Muri was parched beaten rice which involved the process of boiling paddy its dehydration frying and flattening Muri involved the process of soaking boiling and dehydration of paddy and the removal of husks <NAME> observed that those commodities could be regarded more as forms of rice than products thereof and were there fore exempt from tax under the Assam Sales Tax Act Scrap iron purchased was merely re rolled into bars hats and plates and they were processed only for convenience of sale They did not in the process lose their character as iron and steel The dealer sold iron and steel in the shape of bars dots and plates and the customer purchased iron and steel in that shape and therefore it was held that the bars hats and plates sold by the assessee were iron and steel exempted under the notification It was in terms held that the said dental creamy snuff completely retained its essential character as snuff as flavoring agents preservatives and water were added only to change its physical condition to make it more acceptable to the customers when intended for use as paste for application to the gums and there was no reason to hold that snuff had lost its essential character and a totally different article was produced which could not claim exemption On a parity of reasoning we must hold that iron does not lose its essential character when it is put merely in the form of corrugated iron sheets as it is merely an alteration of form or shape to make it more acceptable to the customer It is well settled that that doctrine could not apply where there is apparent reason to show why the <ORG> introduced the amendment and when the whole object would be apparent that the amendment was not one by way of parliamentary exposition of the earlier statute As I have already mentioned section was enacted by the <ORG> and this amendment was done by the State <ORG> to bring the entry of iron and steel in line with that definition given in section The <ORG> shall pay the costs of this reference to the assessee In this reference under section of the Bombay Sales Tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act the following question has been referred to us by <ORG> Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the sale of corrugated sheets by the opponent firm was covered by entry of Schedule or entry of Schedule to the Bombay Sales Tax Act prior to its amendment by Bombay Act of The short facts giving rise to this reference are as follows The opponent firm is a registered dealer dealing in iron and steel gold and silver vegetable ghee corrugated iron sheets etc Against the order of the <ORG> there was an appeal to the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax Baroda At the time when the application for reference was heard by the <ORG> a question of limitation was argued before the <ORG> but the <ORG> held that it had the power to condone the delay under section read with section of the Indian Limitation Act and exercising the said power the <ORG> condoned the delay and thereafter granted the application for reference to <ORG> At one stage of the hearing before us Mr <NAME> on behalf of the assessee wanted to argue before us that the reference was not competent inasmuch as the Sales Tax <ORG> had no power to condone the delay and hence the entire reference was incompetent iron plates sold in the same form in which they are directly produced by the rolling mills I agree with my learned brother that the principle of legislative interpretation which was contended for by the learned Advocate General cannot help <ORG> in the instant case Under these circumstances I agree with my learned brother that the principle of legislative interpretation cannot have any application in the instant case and the only question here is whether the words iron and steel as occurring in entry as it originally stood during the period st April to th April would cover corrugated iron sheets It is clear that if they did not fall within the entry of iron and steel they would be falling within the residuary entry covering all goods other than those specified from time to time in any of the preceding entries in Schedule Under entry of Schedule the articles would attract sales tax of nP whereas under entry as it originally stood there was no sales tax but there was general sales tax of six pies in the rupee and purchase tax of three pies in the rupee Since the principle of subsequent legislation is not applicable to the facts of this case we cannot say merely from the amended entry as was in force from th April to th September that iron and steel as it originally stood during the period st April to th April included merely basic raw material and not any iron and steel in its manufactured form or for production or consumption It is contended on behalf of the assessee firm that corrugated iron sheets are nothing else but iron or steel sheets which are wrinkled by hydraulic pressure or in a rolling mill and corrugation merely means wrinkling iron sheet It was therefore contended on behalf of the assessee before us that a corrugated iron sheet is only a form of iron or steel sheet On the other hand it has been contended by the learned Advocate General on behalf of the <ORG> that as shown by the standard books of reference like <ORG> an elaborate process has to be gone into in order to convert an iron sheet into a corrugated iron sheet and further that a corrugated iron sheet cannot be used for the same purpose for which an ordinary iron sheet can be used nor an ordinary iron sheet can be used for the purpose for which a corrugated iron sheet can be used Every such registered manufacturer of groundnut oil will be entitled to a deduction under clause of sub rule of rule equal to the value of the groundnut and or kernel purchased by him and converted into oil and cake if he has paid the tax to the <ORG> on such purchases Provided that the amount for which the oil is sold is included in his net turnover Provided further that the amount of the turnover in respect of which deduction is allowed shall not exceed the amount of the turnover attributable to the groundnut and or kernel used in the manufacture of oil and included in the net turnover It was in the context of this sub rule of rule that the question was considered by <ORG> and <ORG> came to the conclusion after considering the hydrogenating process that hydrogenated groundnut oil was a form of groundnut oil and they held that the assessee company was entitled to the benefit of the deduction of the purchase price of kernel or groundnut which went into the manufacture of hydrogenated groundnut oil from the sale turnover of such oil There is no use to which the groundnut oil can be put for which the hydrogenated oil could not be used nor is there any use to which the hydrogenated oil could be put for which the raw oil could not be used Similarly we consider that hydrogenated oil still continues to be groundnut oil notwithstanding the processing which is merely for the purpose of rendering the oil more stable thus improving its keeping qualities for those who desire to consume groundnut oil Therefore the question that <ORG> and thereafter <ORG> had to consider in that particular case was whether patasa harda and alchidana could be regarded as forms of sugar containing more than per cent of sucrose The petitioners before <ORG> contended that they had purchased iron scrap or steel scrap and then rolled the same into rolled steel sections and <ORG> held that when the raw material iron or steel that was purchased by the petitioners was rolled into rolled steel sections the outcome is a different and a new commodity and when it is sold there is a sale of a different commodity and not a sale of steel over again The corrugations made in one direction give it greatly increased stiffness and adapt it to numerous purposes for which it would otherwise be less suitable It comes out in the commercial form and is frequently subjected to a process of coating with zinc to protect it from oxidation and is then known as galvanized corrugated iron It is used widely for roofing and walling barns sheds warehouses and other buildings In the absence of corrugation flat iron sheet tends to buckle and get out of shape with every change in temperature and more so in a tropical country like ours and it is for the purpose of giving it greatly increased stiffness and also to adapt it to numerous purposes that the process of corrugation has to be gone through Thus the test which was applied by <ORG> in <ORG> case The real test applicable to such cases is the test of possibility of substituting one for the other and if there is a possibility where articles can be used for one or the other and can be substituted one for the other then in spite of the process being undergone the article would still remain the same and if there is no possibility of any substitution to the consumer it would be a new commodity and would no longer be a form of the original article In my opinion the only conclusion possible in the light of the technical information available from the standard works of reference and applying the tests laid down by <ORG> in <ORG> case I would therefore answer the question referred to us by stating that the sale of corrugated iron sheets in question was covered by entry of Schedule to the Act and I would direct the assessee firm to pay the costs of this reference to the State of Gujarat In pursuance of the <ORG> order the reference came on for hearing before <NAME> and the learned Chief Justice delivered the following judgment on November Bhagwati The short question which arises for determination in this reference is whether corrugated iron sheets fall within entry or entry of Schedule to the Bombay Sales Tax Act prior to its amendment by Bombay Act of Entry reads iron and steel while entry is a residuary entry providing for all goods other than those specified in Schedule A section A and the preceding entries of Schedule It was common ground between the parties that if corrugated iron sheets do not fall within entry there is no other specific entry which covers them and they would fall to be governed by entry The Sales Tax Officer assessing the assessee for the period st April to st March took the view that corrugated iron sheets were not covered by entry and were therefore taxable under entry which provides a higher rate of tax and this view was affirmed by the Assistant Commissioner of Sales Tax in appeal and the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax in revision The <ORG> thereupon applied for a reference and on the application of the <ORG> the following question of law was referred for the opinion of this Court Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the sale of corrugated sheets by the opponent firm was covered by entry of Schedule or entry of Schedule to the Bombay Sales Tax Act prior to its amendment by Bombay Act of On the answer to this question there was a difference of opinion between Divan and <NAME> and hence the reference was ordered to be placed before a third Judge In order to determine this question it is necessary to understand the nature of the commodity known as corrugated iron sheets The corrugations made in one direction give it greatly increased stiffness and adapt it to numerous purposes for which it would otherwise be less suitable The sheet metal is corrugated by passing between ridged rollers It comes out in the commercial form and is frequently subjected to a process of coating with zinc to protect from oxidation and is then known as galvanized corrugated iron It is used widely for roofing and walling barns sheds warehouses and other buildings Corrugated firm sheets are thus nothing but iron sheets sheets of iron corrugated that is wrinkled for the purpose of making them more rigid and giving them increased stiffness so that they become more suitable for roofing and walling than they would otherwise be as hat iron sheets They are iron sheets with their shape altered to make them more adaptable and useful for being used as iron sheets for roofing and walling where iron and steel bars hats and plates were held to be covered by the expression iron and steel in the notification issued by <ORG> under section of the Essential Goods Declaration and Regulation of Tax on Sale or Purchase Act If flat iron sheets are within the entry iron and steel it is difficult to appreciate how they cease to be so by mere alteration of shape by corrugation It is no doubt true that iron sheets when corrugated cease to be raw materials for manufacture or fabrication of goods and they can be used only as corrugated iron sheets for roofing and walling but on that account they do not cease to be iron sheets having the essential character of iron It may be that by reason of alteration of shape iron sheets may cease to be usable for any purpose other than roofing or walling but they still remain iron sheets and do not lose the essential character of iron which they possessed as flat iron sheets before corrugation The question in cases of this kind is always one of degree and where precisely to draw the dividing line when a commodity loses its essential character of iron and steel ceases to be a form of iron and steel and becomes an article or product of iron and steel is by no means easy to decide Even if I had any doubt about this conclusion I would resolve it in favour of the assessee taking resort to the doctrine which Lord <NAME> has characteristically described as the last refuge of judicial hesitation the doctrine that if two views are possible in a taxing statute that which favours the assessee must be preferred Hydrogenated groundnut oil said <ORG> still contained to be groundnut oil notwithstanding the processing which was merely for the purpose of rendering the oil more stable thus improving its keeping qualities for those who desired to consume groundnut oil There is also a decision of <ORG> in Kapildeoram Baijnath Prosad <NAME> There the question was whether chira and muri could be said to be covered by the words all cereals and pulses including all forms of rice Chira was parched beaten rice which involved the process of boiling paddy its dehydration frying and then flattening Muri involved the process of soaking boiling dehydrating paddy and removal of husks This decision was affirmed in appeal by <ORG> and the decision of <ORG> is reported at page of the same volume <ORG> pointed out that the word sugar in entry was intended to include within its ambit all forms of sugar that is to say sugar of any shape or texture colons or density and by whatever name it was called So also it can be said on a parity of reasoning that merely because iron is given the shape of a sheet and is subjected to corrugation for the purpose of giving it rigidity and increased stiffness so as to make it acceptable to a particular class of persons who might rant to use it in the form of an iron sheet for roofing and walling it does not cease to be iron it merely assumes another form namely that of a wrinkled sheet but it still continues to retain the essential character of iron to which I have already made a reference earlier but I do not think this decision in any way supports the contention of the revenue The question arose whether the iron bars flats and plates re rolled and sold by the assessee were exempt from sales tax by virtue of a notification which inter alia exempted iron and steel from liability to sales tax or they were taxable under another notification which imposed tax at a particular rate on goods prepared from any metal other than gold and silver <NAME> speaking on behalf of <ORG> said Scrap iron purchased by the respondent was merely re rolled into bars hats and plates They were processed for convenience of sale They did not in the process lose their character as iron and steel The dealer sold iron and steel in the shape of bars flats and plates and the customer purchased iron and steel in that shape These observations clearly show that mere alteration of shape is wholly immaterial and it does not matter whether iron is in the shape of bars flats or plates and equally one may say it makes no difference whether it is in the form of flat sheets or corrugated sheets The State will pay costs of the reference to the assessee
