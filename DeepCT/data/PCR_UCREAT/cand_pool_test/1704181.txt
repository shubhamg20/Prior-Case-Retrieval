The facts leading to the filing of these appeals in brief are that In all properties including the properties in question in these appeals were notified for acquisition on th March under the provisions of Section and Section of the Land Acquisition Act for short the Act The respondents in these appeals filed writ petitions challenging the acquisition of their properties under the very notification The appellants questioned the correctness and validity of the orders made by learned Single Judge in <ORG> which were dismissed by the impugned order mainly following earlier judgments in the cases of <ORG> and <NAME> Hence we heard the learned counsel for the parties on either side at length The contentions advanced on behalf of the appellants were that <NAME> case was wrongly decided and further it was on its own facts being property specific <NAME> case was not a precedent as no reasoned order was made by this Court inasmuch as the petition was dismissed at the SLP stage itself Non mentioning of the nature and existence of urgency in the notification issued under Sections and of the Act does not vitiate the notification subjective satisfaction as regards urgency could not be determined solely on the basis of the expressions used in the notification and such urgency could be gathered looking to the surrounding circumstances and the records which would show the urgency for the acquisition pre and post notification delay would not affect the notification on account of lethargy of the officers and such delay would not render the exercise of power to invoke urgency clause invalid where there was a grave urgency on account of shortage of Government housing <ORG> committed a serious error in appointing the arbitrator to determine the damages in the absence of any arbitration agreement and there being no prayer in that regard in the writ petition correctness of the order in <NAME> case was not considered in <NAME> case paras and in <NAME> case in review must be read together to understand the correct legal position alternatively notification as regards Section could be quashed sustaining it only to the extent of Section of the Act Hence the same result rightly followed in the writ petitions filed by the respondents in these appeals <ORG> was right and justified in passing the impugned common judgment affirming the order of the learned Single Judge having regard to the decision already rendered in <NAME> case in regard to the same common notification if a different view is taken at this stage particularly after the decision in <NAME> case in the main appeal as well as in review it will lead to anomalous result leading to conflict of decisions i the very same notification stands quashed in respect of some writ petitioners which has attained finality by virtue of affirmation of the said order by this court in <NAME> and <NAME> and in regard to other writ petitions filed by the present respondents it will have to be sustained According to them in these cases even on the facts and circumstances found there was neither material nor justification to invoke urgency clause they made submissions distinguishing decisions relied on behalf of the appellants having regard to the facts of those cases and the points that arose for consideration It was also their contention that the appellants having been in possession of the properties there was no reason to invoke urgency clause to take immediate possession at best after the expiry of the Act as amended by Act No of the appellants continuing in unauthorized possession could be made to pay damages or compensation for the period during which they unauthorisedly continued to be in possession They also submitted that this Court sustained the appointment of arbitrator to determine the damages made in earlier decisions and having taken note of the same as can be seen from the impugned common judgment in these appeals almost after years it may not be just and equitable to direct the parties to approach civil court for claiming damages In SLP No the ground of delay in filing writ petition is not raised the learned Single Judge did not find delay as a good ground for rejecting the writ petition on the facts and circumstances We have carefully considered the respective submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties The notification issued on which was the subject matter of challenge in the writ petitions reads NOTIFICATION Dated No Whereas it appears to the Governor Delhi that the lands properties are likely to be required to be taken by the government at the public expense for the following public purposes This notification is made under the provisions of Section of the Land Acquisition Act to all whom it may concern In exercise of the powers conferred by the aforesaid section the Lt It may be recalled that notification under Section read with Section of the Act was issued on for acquiring properties including this building Ansari Road Darya Ganj Delhi Mainly three grounds were urged in the writ petition the notification issued under Section and Section did not indicate the urgency for taking possession and therefore the same was vitiated in law petitioners were illegally deprived of their right to raise objections and inquiry under Section A of the Act the <ORG> could not acquire commercial building for residential purpose that the whole exercise of acquisition of the building was a fraud on the powers under the Act <ORG> dealing with the contentions raised in the said writ petition held that there was no whisper in the notification as to what was the urgency to take immediate possession and to deny the right of raising objections under Section A of the Act the building was already in occupation of the officers of <ORG> and the <ORG> knew that the Requisitioning and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act was to lapse on they had sufficient time to make alternate arrangements for the residence of the officers and that there was no urgency whatsoever for invoking the provisions of Section of the Act <ORG> filed SLP No aggrieved by this order of <ORG> dated made in the writ petition The SLP was dismissed on by passing the following order In the facts and circumstances of the case we do not find any good ground to interfere with the impugned order of <ORG> Although we have dismissed the petition but having regard to the fact that public servants are residing in the premises in dispute and their immediate dispossession may cause injury to public interest we allow the petitioners to continue in possession till provided the petitioners file an undertaking in this Court within three weeks with usual conditions to hand over the vacant possession of the premises including the servant quarters on or before we further make it clear that the Arbitrator appointed by <ORG> may give award and the same may be filed before <ORG> for appropriate orders emphasis supplied <NAME> filed writ petition No of inter alia raising similar contentions as were raised in <NAME> case supra <ORG> allowed the said writ petition and quashed the notification following the order made in the case of <NAME> and <ORG> aforementioned We do not find any sustainable ground raised in the present appeal to make any distinct or difference from the one in the case of <ORG> Accordingly there is no error committed by <ORG> in making the decision and dismissing the same Accordingly the present appeal has no merits and it is dismissed The learned counsel for the respondents heavily relied on this decision and contended that it fully covers the case against the appellants in view of the same it is not open to the appellants particularly being the parties to the said decision to re agitate on the same issue again when the notification being composite one in respect of all properties sought to be acquired under it and when the ground of urgency was also common in respect of all the properties In other words the decision in <NAME> is confined to its own facts In the light of these submissions and that this decision will have great bearing on the question in deciding these appeals whether urgency clause could be invoked under Section of the Act the notification being composite one in respect of all properties including the properties which are the subject matter of these appeals we will refer to the decision in greater details <NAME> challenged the notification issued under Section read with Section as well as the declaration made under Section of the Act under Article of the Constitution of India before <ORG> As already stated above <NAME> and <ORG> the owner of one of the properties specified in the notification also filed writ petition in <ORG> impugning the same notification inter alia urging that there was no urgency to dispense with the right of the owner to file objections and inquiry under Section A of the Act <NAME> writ application was allowed on quashing the impugned notification upholding the contentions urged on behalf of <NAME> including the issue of urgency Later the appellants made an application for recalling the order dismissing the appeal on the ground that it was disposed of without hearing them On accepting the request of the appellants the application made for recalling the order dated was treated as a review petition and the review petition was accordingly heard it was urged that the principles of law enunciated in <NAME> case no longer held the field On that basis it was contended that the decision of <ORG> quashing the impugned notification by following <NAME> decision was erroneous Opposing the review petition it was urged that the review petition itself was not maintainable as there was no error apparent on the face of the record the same notification stood quashed in <NAME> case since the impugned notification had been quashed on a general ground which did not specifically relate to a particular petitioner the quashing of the notification must enure to the benefit of all persons affected by that notification The urgency sought to be expressed in the impugned notification cannot be held to be sufficient for the purposes of Section in this case when it has already been held to be bad in <NAME> case The sentence in paragraph extracted above that It is also not necessary to consider whether the decision in <NAME> correctly enunciates the principles of law as to acquisitions under Section of the Act as we are of the view that the order of this <ORG> dated was in the circumstances of the case correct has reference to enunciation of principles of law in relation to Section as to the expression of urgency as stated in <NAME> i to whether the existence of urgency and expression of urgency must be specifically stated in the notification issued under Section read with Section of the Act and if not whether the notification is vitiated The ground of urgency also being common it is not possible to accept that the decision rendered in the cases of <NAME> or <NAME> on the question of urgency was properties specific We find ourselves in full agreement with the ratio of the decisions in those cases that urgency clause on the facts and circumstances which are similar to the present cases could not have been invoked In the order disposing of the appeal on it is clearly stated that <ORG> quashed the impugned notification following its earlier decision in <NAME> case the subject matter including the notification under the Act was the same except that in <NAME> case it was the <ORG> In this view and looking to what is stated in paragraph extracted above we find substantial force in the preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents The provisions of the Act to the extent they are relevant are reproduced hereunder Section Publication of preliminary notification and powers of officers thereupon Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose or for a company a notification to that effect shall be published in <ORG> and in two daily newspapers circulating in that locality of which at least one shall be in the regional language and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the said locality the last of the dates of such publication and the giving of such public notice being hereinafter referred to as the date of the publication of the notification Thereupon it shall be lawful for any officer either generally or specially authorized by such Government in this behalf and for his servants and workmen to enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in such locality to dig or bore in the subsoil to do all other acts necessary to ascertain whether the land is adapted for such purpose to set out the boundaries of the land proposed to be taken and the intended line of the work if any proposed to be made thereon to make such levels boundaries and line by placing marks and cutting trenches and where otherwise the survey cannot be completed and the levels taken and the boundaries and lines marked to cut down and clear away any part of the standing crop fence of jungle provided that no person shall enter into any building or upon any other enclosed court or garden attached to a dwelling house unless with the consent of the occupier thereof without previously giving such occupier at least seven days notice in writing of his intention to do so Section A Hearing of objections Any person interested in any land which has been notified under Section sub section as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose or for a company may within thirty days from the date of the publication of the notification object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case may be Every objection under sub section shall be made to the Collector in writing and the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard in person or by any person authorized by him in this behalf or by pleader and shall after hearing all such objections and after making such further inquiry if any as he thinks necessary either make a report in respect of the land which has been notified under Section sub Section or make different reports in respect of different parcels of such land to the appropriate <ORG> containing his recommendations on the objections together with the record of the proceedings held by him for the decision of that <ORG> Section Special powers in cases of urgency In cases of urgency whenever the Appropriate <ORG> so directs the collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any land needed for a public purpose Whenever owing to any sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency it becomes necessary for any Railway Administration to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the maintenance of their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river side or ghat station or of providing convenient connection with or access to any such station or the appropriate Government considers it necessary to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the purpose of maintaining any structure or system pertaining to irrigation water supply drainage road communication or electricity the Collector may immediately after the publication of the notice mentioned in sub section and with the previous sanction of the appropriate Government enter upon and take possession of such land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances Provided that the Collector shall not take possession of any building or part of a building under this sub section without giving to the occupier thereof at least forty eighty hours notice of his intention so to do or such longer notice as may be reasonably sufficient to enable such occupier to remove his movable property from such building without unnecessary inconvenience A Before taking possession of any land under sub section or sub section the Collector shall without prejudice to the provisions of sub section a tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to the persons interested entitled thereto and pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in section sub section and where the Collector is so prevented the provisions of section sub section except the second proviso thereto shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation under that section In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under section sub section These provisions clearly provide protection to a person whose land is to be acquired by providing right to object to the proposed acquisition of any land notified under Section opportunity of hearing is also provided to show that the proposal to acquire the land was unwarranted such opportunity available under Section A cannot be denied except in case of urgency Section confers extraordinary powers on the authorities under which it can dispense with the normal procedure laid down under Section A of the Act in exceptional case of urgency Such powers cannot be lightly resorted to except in case of real urgency enabling the <ORG> to take immediate possession of the land proposed to be acquired for public purpose A public purpose however laudable it may be by itself is not sufficient to take aid of Section to use this extraordinary power as use of such power deprives a land owner of his right in relation to immoveable property to file objections for the proposed acquisition and it also dispenses with the inquiry under Section A of the Act The <ORG> must have subjective satisfaction of the need for invoking urgency clause under Section keeping in mind the nature of the public purpose real urgency that the situation demands and the time factor i whether taking possession of the property can wait for a minimum period within which the objections could be received from the land owners and the inquiry under Section A of the Act could be completed Normally urgency to acquire a land for public purpose does not arise suddenly or overnight but sometimes such urgency may arise unexpectedly exceptionally or extraordinarily depending on situations such as due to earthquake flood or some specific time bound project where the delay is likely to render the purpose nugatory or infructuous A citizen property can be acquired in accordance with law but in the absence of real and genuine urgency it may not be appropriate to deprive an aggrieved party of a fair and just opportunity of putting forth its objections for due consideration of the acquiring authority While applying the urgency clause the <ORG> should indeed act with due care and responsibility If the Government wants to take over the property for an indefinite period of time the Government must acquire the property but it cannot use the power of requisition for achieving that object If the public purpose for which the premises are required is of a perennial or permanent character from the very inception no order can be passed requisitioning the premises and in such a case the order of requisition if passed would be a fraud upon the statute for the Government would be requisitioning the premises when really speaking they want the premises for acquisition the object of taking the premises being not transitory but permanent in character As such it has since been decided by the <ORG> to compile a priority list of the occupants of requisitioned leased houses with a view to allot them alternative accommodation on priority basis <ORG> Delhi emphasis supplied One more aspect to be noticed is as observed by <ORG> that the properties in question continued to be in possession of the appellants in other words there was no urgency of taking immediate possession nor there was any immediate threat of dispossessing them from the properties During the course of the hearing we specifically asked the learned counsel for the appellants in this regard the only answer was that the appellants being <ORG> others did not want to remain in the unauthorized possession of the properties Having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case in these appeals the authorities could have completed acquisition proceedings in couple of months even after providing opportunity for filing objections and holding inquiry under Section A of the Act if they were really serious They had enough time to provide opportunity for filing objections and holding inquiry under Section A of the Act There was no need to invoke Section of the Act The Office Memorandum dated extracted above shows that <ORG> took the decision in view of the amendment in the Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act with all the requisitioned leased houses which were with the <ORG> for more than years were to be released to their owners immediately and all the occupants of requisitioned leased houses were requested to furnish the relevant information by failing which the officer concerned will be liable for eviction from the requisitioned house without provision for alternative accommodation Further having regard to the observations made by this Court in the case of <NAME> supra there would have been no justification for the appellants to continue properties in question under the Requisitioning Act any more If the appellants were really serious in acquiring the properties in question they had almost years time even after taking the decision to acquire them or derequisition them within which time acquisition proceedings could be completed in the usual course without depriving the respondents of their valuable right to file objections for acquisition and without dispensing with inquiry under Section A of the Act Having examined the facts and circumstances of the case it was found that there was no material and the circumstances even to have subjective satisfaction by the authorities to invoke urgency clause under Section of the Act The finding of fact that there was no urgency for invoking Section has become final Save in real urgency were public interest does not brook even the minimum time needed to give a hearing land acquisition authorities should not having regard to Articles and burke an enquiry under Section of the Act Here a slumbering process pending for years and suddenly exciting itself into immediate forcible taking makes a travesty of emergency power In the same judgment it is also stated that The mind of the officer or authority concerned has to be applied to the question whether there is an urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under Section A of the Act should be eliminated It is not just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an inquiry under Section A which has to be considered The various decisions cited on behalf of the appellants in support of their submission that there was justification in invoking urgency clause for acquiring the properties in question were on the facts of those cases where either urgency was made out or where it was shown that relevant material and data was available at the time of issuing notification invoking urgency clause SCC one of the grounds raised was that long period of years was spent in inter departmental correspondence which showed that there was no urgency to invoke Section of the Act In that context the <ORG> observed that Very often persons interested in the land proposed to be acquired make various representations to the concerned authorities against the proposed acquisition The <ORG> proceeded on the assumption that the pre notification delay could have been caused by representations made by the aggrieved parties but this case is not an authority to say that in the absence of material to justify urgency clause and long delay in issuing the notification could be ignored or condoned to uphold the validity of such notification In that case the <ORG> appeared to think that very often the officials due to apathy in the implementation of the policies and programmes of the <ORG> themselves adopt dilatory tactics which leads the aggrieved party to challenge the invocation of urgency Urgency for invoking of Section of the Act should be one arising naturally out of circumstances which exist when the decision to acquire the land is taken and not such which is the result of serious lapse or gross delay on the part of <ORG> Failure to take timely action for acquisition by the authorities of the Union of India cannot be a ground to invoke the urgency clause to the serious detriment of the right of the landowner to raise objections to the acquisition under Section A In Civil Writ Petition No filed by <NAME> the respondent in SLP No a contention was raised on behalf of the appellants herein that the writ petitioner case suffered from delay and laches The learned Single Judge having regard to the facts and circumstances of the case concluded that the writ petition could not be dismissed on the ground of delay holding that the writ petitioner had been pursuing his remedies in the court of law against the proposed action of the appellants <ORG> of <ORG> in the order under challenge in regard to the delay in filing the writ petition agreeing with the learned Single Judge has stated thus Before parting we may however notice that the appellant had raised a question of delay in filing the writ petition by the first respondent in writ petition No which is the subject matter of LPA No In this view the contention urged on behalf of the appellants that the writ petition No of ought to have been dismissed on the ground of delay and laches cannot be accepted The argument advanced by the learned counsel on behalf of the appellants that the arbitrator could not be appointed by <ORG> in the absence of any agreement for appointment of arbitrator to determine the damages and there being no prayer in that regard in the writ petition cannot be accepted This Court dismissed the SLP No of filed by the appellants against the order dated made by <ORG> in <NAME> case While dismissing the said SLP on may be in the light of the argument made on behalf of the appellants that arbitrator could not be appointed this Court expressly made it clear that the arbitrator appointed by <ORG> may give award and the same may be filed before <ORG> for appropriate orders In the said order this Court did not find any sustainable ground raised in the appeal to make any distinction or difference from the case of <NAME> and others Hence it follows that order of appointment of arbitrator made in <NAME> case was also upheld by this Court Since the order appointing arbitrator in the cases of <NAME> and <NAME> is upheld by this Court we have no good reason to take a different view The alternative argument urged on behalf of the appellants that if the impugned notification suffers from infirmity in relation to invoking urgency clause it can be quashed only to the extent of invoking the aid of Section and the said notification can be sustained confining it to Section of the Act cannot be accepted Thus having regard to the facts and circumstances brought on record in these appeals it is not possible to accept this argument particularly when the very foundation of invoking Section was invalid and unjustified as upheld by this Court in <NAME> and <NAME> Further when we are upholding the impugned common order on other grounds we do not wish to deal with this contention One more contention urged on behalf of the appellants in SLP No namely that the writ petition filed by the respondents being tenants was not maintainable is required to be dealt with In this view at this stage the contention urged on behalf of the appellants that writ petition filed by a tenant was not maintainable cannot be accepted Thus having regard to all aspects and for the reasons stated and discussion made above we do not find any merit in these appeals
