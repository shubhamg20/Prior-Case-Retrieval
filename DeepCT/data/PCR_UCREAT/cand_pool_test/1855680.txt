An order fixing the compensation was passed by a special officer under Section Bombay Land Requisition Act Sub section of Section provides that an appeal shall lie against the decision of that officer and in this ease the appeal lay to this Court The petitioners applied that delay should be condoned under Section Limitation Act as they had sufficient cause for the delay and the question that arises for our determination is whether Section applies to an appeal provided under the Land Requisition Act What calls for our interpretation in the first instance is Section Limitation Act Before that amendment there was considerable conflict between the different <ORG> as to the true interpretation of this sub section and in order to resolve the conflict the <ORG> amended the sub section in As it stands now it provides Where any special or local law prescribes for any suit appeal or application a period of limitation difierent from the period prescribed therefor by Schedule I the provisions of Section shall apply as if such period were prescribed therefor in that schedule and for the purpose of determining any period of limitation prescribed for any suit appeal or application by any special or local law a the provisions contained in Sections to and shall apply only in so far as and to the extent to which they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law The first question is whether the special law as embodied in the Land Requisition Act contains a period of limitation for the appeal provided therein which is different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule of the Limitation Act The contention of Mr <NAME> is that Sub section only applies when you find a period of limitation laid down in the first schedule and a special law alters or modifies that period and inasmuch as the Limitation Act does not provide for a period of limitation in respect of an appeal from a special officer to <ORG> Section has no application to this particular special law a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule It may also be different in the sense that it departs from the period of limitation fixed for various appeals under the Limitation Act If the first schedule to the Limitation Act omits laying down any period of limitation for a particular appeal and the special law provides a period of limitation then to that extent the special law is different from the Limitation Act We are conscious of the fact that the language used by the <ORG> is perhaps not very happy but we must put upon it a construction which will reconcile the various difficulties caused by the other sections of the Limitation Act and which will give effect to the object which obviously the <ORG> had in mind because if we were to give to Section the meaning which The result would be that although an appeal may be barred by limitation it would not be liable to be dismissed under a Therefore in our opinion it is clear that we have before us a special law which does prescribe a period of limitation different from the period prescribed therefor by the first schedule to the Limitation Act In our opinion the expression for the purpose of determining any period of limitation does not mean computing the period of limitation In our opinion every provision in the Limitation Act is intended for the purpose of determining the period of limitation Therefore in our opinion there is no justification for giving to the expression for the purpose of determining any period of limitation the restricted meaning suggested by Mr <NAME> Section is made applicable to all special or local laws which prescribed a period of limitation for any suit appeal or application The final argument advanced by Mr <NAME> is that Section applies to all appeals proprio vigore and this argument is based upon the different language used by the <ORG> in Section and Section refers to the period of limitation which is to be found in Schedule Section applies to all laws which prescribe any period of limitation and therefore according to Mr <NAME> without any reference being made in any special or local law Section must pf its own strength apply because the <ORG> has made Section applicable to all cases where periods of limitation are prescribed If the intention of the <ORG> was to refer to the period of limitation prescribed by other laws the <ORG> would have expressly so mentioned It is true that in Section there is an express mention of Schedule to the Limitation Act But the mere fact that there is no such express mention in Section does not and cannot lead to the conclusion that the <ORG> intended the limitation prescribed to be prescribed by any law other than the Limitation Act itself The other reason why this argument cannot be accepted is that when we turn to Section it also speaks of limitation prescribed and not limitation prescribed by Schedule and yet under Section the <ORG> had expressly to make Section applicable when the period of limitation was prescribed by a special or local law If Mr <NAME> contention were right then Section as much as Section would apply proprio vigore and it was not necessary for the <ORG> in Therefore in our opinion unless the <ORG> expressly makes Section applicable Section does not apply when no period of limitation for that appeal is prescribed in the Limitation Act and a special period is prescribed by a special law The intention of the <ORG> obviously was that an appellant must prefer the appeal within the period defined in the statute and if he fails to do so the <ORG> should have no power to condone the delay and admit the appeal under Section There are various statutes to which our attention is drawn where the <ORG> has applied Section On the other hand there are statutes where Section has not been applied and this difference in different statutes clearly bear out what we have been suggesting viz It is certainly somewhat alarming that limitation for so short a period as seven days should not be one over which <ORG> in a proper case should have any power of control or dispensation but it is necessary to base our construction of the Ordinance and of the Limitation Act upon principle and it is not possible for us on the ground of hardship to give another meaning to the Ordinance Therefore in giving the construction to Section which we are giving we find that we are taking the same view which the other <ORG> in India have taken The result therefore is that we must hold that the appeal is out of time that Section does not apply and therefore we have no power to condone the delay on the part of the petitioners
