Appellants Vs State of Karnataka Respondent <NAME> The constitutional validity of Roerich and Devika Rani Roerich Estate Acquisition Transfer Act in short the Acquisition Act the legal validity of Section of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act in short Land Reforms Act the Notification No RD LRA dated th March issued by the State Government thereunder and the scope and content of Article A of the Constitution of India are the issues that have come up for consideration in these civil appeals When the Land Reforms Act came into force they filed declarations under Section of the Act before <ORG> Bangalore South Taluk II stating that they had no surplus lands to surrender to the State since the entire area held by them had been used for the cultivation of Linaloe which was exempted under Section vi of the Land Reforms Act The Company then preferred an appeal before the District Registrar but when the appeal was about to be taken up for hearing one <NAME> who claimed rights over the property on the strength of an alleged will preferred a Writ Petition No of before <ORG> and a learned Single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the writ petition The <ORG> accorded sanction in its meeting held on and the Government issued a notification dated in exercise of powers conferred by Section of the Land Reforms Act withdrawing the exemption granted for the lands used for cultivation of Linaloe under clause vi of Sub section of Section of the Act <NAME> the appellant in Civil Appeal No of had in the meanwhile filed No of before <ORG> claiming rights over some of the articles belonging to <NAME> couple on the strength of a will dated When <ORG> came up before a bench of this Court on and this Court passed an order framing the following substantive questions of law Whether Section of the Karnataka Land Reforms Act as amended by the Karnataka Land Reforms amendment Act Act of which came into effect from read with Section of the said Act introduced by amending Act of violates the basic structure of the Constitution in so far as it confers power on <ORG> a delegatee of the <ORG> of withdrawal of exemption of <ORG> plantation without hearing and without reasons Learned senior counsel also submitted that Section gave unfettered and unguided power to the Executive to take away the exemption granted by the <ORG> and hence that Section is void for excessive delegation of legislative powers on <ORG> Learned senior counsel also submitted that <ORG> cannot take away retrospectively the vested rights of persons to hold lands used for Linaloe cultivation from onwards without assigning any reasons Further it was also submitted that the exemption under Section vi was granted with respect to the lands used for the cultivation of Linaloe and not for any specific individual and there is no bar in alienating the land to third parties Mr <NAME> senior counsel for the State of Karnataka submitted that the validity of Section of the Act was never questioned before <ORG> on the ground of excessive delegation and hence the appellants are precluded from raising that contention before this Court Learned senior counsel submitted that the validity of Section was challenged on the ground of violation of the fundamental rights which was rightly negatived by <ORG> since the Land Reforms Act was placed in the IXth Schedule Learned senior counsel also submitted that the company had illegally acquired acres guntas of land in excess of the ceiling prescribed under Section of the Land Reforms Act and the Act mandates that no person shall which includes a Company also after the date of commencement of the Land Reforms Act i acquire land in any manner for cultivation of <ORG> to an extent which together with the land cultivated by <ORG> if any already held by him exceed units notwithstanding anything contained in sub section of Section Learned senior counsel further submitted that the provisions of Sections to also shall apply mutatis mutandis in respect of every acquisition contrary to Section Learned counsel also submitted that exemption under Section vi was granted to <ORG> for cultivation of <ORG> while the <ORG> is statutorily disentitled to hold the land and hence the claim for exemption from the provisions of Land Reforms Act is opposed to the policy of the Act Exemption was granted to <ORG> subject to Section of the Land Reforms Act and it was with that statutory limitation the <ORG> had purchased the land Learned senior counsel also submitted that there is no provision for providing hearing or recording reasons before issuing the notification dated while exercising powers under Section of the Act Learned senior counsel submitted that exercise of powers under Section of the Act is in the nature of subordinate legislation and no opportunity of hearing or recording of reasons are warranted Chapter II of the Act deals with general provisions relating to tenancies Chapter III deals with conferment of ownership on tenants Chapter VIII of the Act deals with exemptions and Chapter XI deals with the miscellaneous provisions Appellants in these appeals have challenged the validity of Section of the Act primarily on the ground of excessive delegation of legislative powers on <ORG> To examine that contention it is necessary to refer to certain provisions contained in various Chapters referred to above the scheme of the Act its object and purpose legislative policy underlying in the provisions of the statute etc Section of the Act prohibits holding of agricultural land by certain persons which says that with effect on and from the date of commencement of the Amendment Act Act no person other than a person cultivating land personally shall be entitled to hold land and that it shall not be lawful for a company inter alia to hold any land Sub section of Section states that in respect of the land vesting in <ORG> under that section an amount as specified in Section shall be paid If the company was holding any land with Linaloe cultivation on the date of the commencement of the Act the same would have vested in <ORG> under Section of the Act and an amount as specified in Section would have been paid Section states that the provisions of the Act would not apply to certain lands mentioned therein but made subject to the provisions of Section Section we have already indicated is made subject to Section which reads as follows Before we examine the scope and ambit of the above quoted provision reference may be made to few of the decided cases of this <ORG> on the power of delegation of legislative functions In re The Delhi Laws Act supra this <ORG> held that legislatures in India have been held to possess wide powers of delegation but subject to one limitation that a legislature cannot delegate essential legislative functions which consists in the determination of the legislative policy and of formally enacting that policy into a binding rule of conduct It is not for the <ORG> to examine the merits or demerits of such a policy because its scrutiny has to be limited to the question as to whether the impugned regulations fall within the scope of the regulation making power conferred on the delegate by the Statute Law is settled that the Court shall not invalidate a legislation on the ground of delegation of essential legislative functions or on the ground of conferring unguided uncontrolled and vague powers upon the delegate without taking into account the preamble of the Act as also other provisions of the statute in the event they provide good means of finding out the meaning of the offending statute So also there are some statutes which empower the government to exempt from their operation certain persons commodities etc So also some statutes confer the power on the executive to adopt and apply statutes existing in other states without modifications to a new area Legislative policy is therefore clearly discernible from the provision of the Statute itself that whenever the <ORG> wanted to confer the power to withdraw the exemption to <ORG> it has done so otherwise it has retained the power to itself Section of the Land Reforms Act empowers <ORG> to withdraw the exemption granted to any land referred to in Sections and Section itself has been made subject to Section of the Act The words subject to conveys the idea of a provision yielding place to another provision or other provisions to which it is made subject Since Section is made subject to Section the former section conveys the idea of yielding to the provision to which it is made subject that is Section which is the will of legislature The <ORG> apathy in granting exemption for lands used for cultivation of Linaloe is discernible from the language used in sub section of Section which says that no person shall after the commencement of the Amendment Act acquire in any manner for the cultivation of Linaloe land of an extent which together with the land cultivated by Linaloe if any already held by him exceeds ten units We therefore reject the contention that Section is void due to excessive delegation of legislative powers The State Government issued the notification dated in exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the Land Reforms Act which was published in the official gazette on Section of the Act defines Notification to mean a notification published in the official gazette Section of the General Clauses Act also states that the publication in the official gazette of a rule or by law purported to have been made in exercise of power to make rules or by laws after previous publication shall be conclusive proof that the rule or by law has been duly made It is therefore necessary that subordinate legislation in order to take effect must be published or promulgated in some suitable manner whether such publication or promulgation is prescribed by the parent statute or not So far as this case is concerned <ORG> has already followed the legal requirement of publication of the notification dated which came into effect on Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the respondent State has not followed the procedure laid down in Section of the Act and that the approval of the notification by <ORG> is an important circumstance to be taken into account in determining its validity The degree of control the <ORG> wants can be noticed on the language used in such laying clause We have in this case already found that there has not been any excessive delegation of legislative powers on <ORG> and we may now examine whether the failure to follow the procedure laid down under Section of the Act has affected the legal validity of the notification Rules and notifications to be laid before <ORG> Every rule made under this Act and every notification issued under Sections and shall be laid as soon as may be after it is made or issued before each House of <ORG> while it is in session for a total period of thirty days which may be comprised in one session or in two successive sessions and if before the expiry of the session in which it is so laid or the session immediately following both Houses agree in making any modification in the rule or notification or both Houses agree that the rule or notification should not be made the rule or notification shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect as the case may be so however that any such modification or annulment shall be without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done under that rule or notification <ORG> of this Court in <NAME> case supra examined the effect of sub section of Section which provides that the rules shall be laid before each <ORG> of the provisional <ORG> for giving effect Direction was issued to the <ORG> Government to lay notifications at the earliest The expression land has been defined under Section which is all comprehensive and takes in agricultural lands that is land which is used or capable of being used for agriculture but for the exemption granted under Section vi lands used for the cultivation of linaloe would have fallen under Section We also find no force in the contention that opportunity of hearing is a pre condition for exercising powers under Section of the Act When the exemption was granted to <NAME> no hearing was afforded so also when the exemption was withdrawn by the delegate The <ORG> Government after withdrawing the exemption granted to the lands used for Linaloe cultivation felt the necessity to take effective and proper steps to manage the estate its tree growth preserve paintings artefact and other valuables of <NAME> and their transferees and to establish an <ORG>Museum <NAME> submitted that the impugned Act does not contain any provision for protection of agrarian reforms and hence not protected by the provisions of Article A and hence not saved from challenges on the ground of violation of Articles and of the Constitution <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants in CA No of submitted that Article A is almost a replica of Article hence all the judicial pronouncements rendered by this <ORG> on Article would equally apply when we interpret Article A Learned counsel also referred to the Judgment of this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and submitted that a person can be deprived of his property only by a valid law which can be tested in the light of Articles and <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants in CA No of also supported the arguments of <NAME> and submitted that the concept of eminent domain be read into Article A of the Constitution and the impugned Act is unconstitutional for not providing adequate compensation to the transferors Learned counsel submitted that the main object of the Acquisition Act is not being Acquisition and Requisition of Property and the Legislation in pith and substance is in respect of land under Entry of List II of the Constitution and there is no repugnancy between State and Central Legislation and hence no assent of the President under Article was warranted Further it was also proposed to place the Bill before the Governor as provided under Article of the Constitution of India for consideration of the President under Clause of Article of the Constitution The question of repugnancy under Article of the Constitution arises when the provisions of both laws are fully inconsistent or are absolutely irreconcilable and it is impossible without disturbing the other or conflicting results are produced when both the statutes covering the same field are applied to a given set of facts Repugnancy between the two statutes would arise if there is a direct conflict between the two provisions and the law made by the <ORG> and the law made by <ORG> occupies the same filed The test for determining the same is to find out the dominant intention of the two legislations and if the dominant intention of the two legislations is different they cover different subject matter then merely because the two legislations refer to some allied or cognate subjects they do not cover the same field A provision in one legislation to give effect to its dominant purpose may incidentally be on the same subject as covered by the provision of the other legislation but such partial coverage of the same area in a different context and to achieve a different purpose does not bring about the repugnancy which is intended to be covered by Article We are of the considered view that the Acquisition Act in this case as rightly contended by the <ORG> primarily falls under Entry List II since the dominant intention of the legislature was to preserve and protect <NAME> Estate covered by the provisions of the Land Reforms Act on the <ORG> Government withdrawing the exemption in respect of the land used for linaloe cultivation On the other hand the Land Acquisition Act is an act which fell exclusively under Entry List III and enacted for the purpose of acquisition of land needed for public purposes for companies and for determining the amount of compensation to be made on account of such acquisition which is substantially and materially different from the impugned Act whose dominant purpose is to preserve and protect estate governed by Art Learned counsel submitted that whenever there is arbitrariness in <ORG> action whether it be of the legislature or of the executive or of an authority under Article Article springs into action and strikes down such <ORG> action as well as the legislative provisions if it is found to be illegal or disproportionate Learned senior counsel also submitted that the twin requirements of public purpose and compensation though seen omitted from Article A but when a person is deprived of his property those limitations are implied in Article A as well as Entry List III and <ORG> can always examine the validity of the statute on those grounds Property rights at times compared to right to life which determine access to the basic means of sustenance and considered as prerequisite to the meaningful exercise of other rights guaranteed under Article Canada does not have an equivalent to the Fifth Amendment taking clause of the Constitution and the federal or provincial governments are under any constitutional obligation to pay compensation for expropriated property In Australia Section xxxi of the Constitution permits the federal government to make laws with respect to the acquisition of property on just terms from any <ORG> or persons for any purpose in respect of which the <ORG> has powers to make laws Eminent domain is distinguishable alike from the police power by which restriction are imposed on private property in the public interest in connection with health sanitation zoning regulation urban planning and so on from the power of taxation by which the owner of private property is compelled to contribute a portion of it for the public purposes and from the war power involving the destruction of private property in the course of military operations Further there are several significant differences between regulatory exercises of the police powers and eminent domain of deprivation of property According to one school of thought See Lewis Eminent Domain rd Edition opined that this question must be answered in the negative but another view See Randolph Eminent Domain in the United States Boston AWR the claim for compensation is an inherent attribute of the concept of eminent domain Professor <NAME> cases on Constitutional law Vol however took a middle view according to which the concept of eminent domain springs from the necessity of the state while the obligation to reimburse rests upon the natural rights of individuals Right to claim compensation some eminent authors expressed the view is thus not a component part of the powers to deprive a person of his property but may arise but it is not as if the former cannot exist without the other Further it was also noticed that the fundamental rights are not absolute but subject to law of reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public to achieve the above objectives specially to eliminate Zamindari system While examining the scope of the Bihar Land Reforms Act conflicting views were expressed by the Judges with regard to the meaning and content of Article and Article as reflected in Sir <NAME> case supra Suffice it to say that the <ORG> felt that the views expressed by the judges on the scope of Articles and might come as a stumbling block in implementing the various welfare legislations which led to the First Constitutional Amendment introducing Articles A and in the Constitution Article A enabled the legislature to enact laws to acquire estates which also permitted the <ORG> in taking over of property for a limited period either in the public interest or to secure the proper management of the property amalgamate properties and extinguish or modify the rights of managers managing agents directors stockholders etc The <ORG> held that under Article the <ORG> could not make a law depriving a person of his property without complying with the provisions of Article However it was also provided that no such law could be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law was not adequate This <ORG> in <NAME> case supra held that Articles and are different fundamental rights and that the expression law in Article shall be a valid law and that it cannot be a valid law unless it imposes a reasonable restriction in public interest within the meaning of Article and therefore be justiciable This Court in <NAME> case supra examined the scope of the Land Acquisition Madras Amendment Act by which the lands were acquired for the purpose of building houses which move was challenged under Articles and The Court held that if the compensation fixed was illusory or the principles prescribed were irrelevant to the value of the property at or about the time of acquisition it could be said that the <ORG> had committed a fraud on power and therefore the law was inadequate Speaking for the Bench Justice <NAME> stated that If the legislature through its ex facie purports to provide for compensation or indicates the principles for ascertaining the same but in effect and substance takes away a property without paying compensation for it it will be exercising power it does not possess If the <ORG> makes a law for acquiring a property by providing for an illusory compensation or by indicating the principles for ascertaining the compensation which do not relate to the property acquired or to the value of such property at or within a reasonable proximity of the date of acquisition or the principles are so designed and so arbitrary that they do not provide for compensation at all one can easily hold that the legislature made the law in fraud of its powers In <NAME> case supra the validity of Bombay Town Planning Act was challenged before this Court on the ground that the owner was to be given market value of land at date of declaration of scheme which was not the just equivalent of the property acquired the Court held that after the Fourth Amendment resulting in the changes to Article the question of adequacy of compensation could not be entertained A majority of the judges accepted that view and held that both before and after the amendment to Article there was a right to compensation and by giving illusory compensation the constitutional guarantee to provide compensation for an acquisition was not complied with The Court held that the Constitution guarantees a right to compensation an equivalent in money of the property compulsorily acquired which is the basic guarantee and therefore the law must provide compensation and for determining compensation relevant principles must be specified if the principles are not relevant the ultimate value determined is not compensation The <ORG> enacted the th Amendment Act by which the <ORG> restored to the amending power of the <ORG> and also extended the scope of Article which authorised the <ORG> to amend any part of the Constitution A new Article was also inserted stating that no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards acquiring the principles specified in clause or clause of Article shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article Article or Article and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy We have extensively dealt with the scope of Articles and Article as interpreted in the various decisions of this Court so as to examine the scope and content of Article A and the circumstances which led to its introduction The Forty Fourth Amendment Act inserted in Part XII a new chapter Chapter IV Right to Property and inserted Article A which reads as follows No person shall be deprived of property save by authority of law It would however be ensured that the removal of property from the list of fundamental rights would not affect the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Property while ceasing to be a fundamental right would however be given express recognition as a legal right provision being made that no person shall be deprived of his property save in accordance with law Right to acquire hold and dispose of property has ceased to be a fundamental right under the Constitution of India Right to acquire hold and dispose of property is not a basic feature of the Constitution but only a Constitutional right Article A proclaims that no person can be deprived of his property save by authority of law meaning thereby that a person cannot be deprived of his property merely by an executive fiat without any specific legal authority or without the support of law made by a competent legislature A confined not to land alone it includes intangibles like copyrights and other intellectual property and embraces every possible interest recognised by law This Court in <ORG> <ORG> Another while examining the provisions of the West Bengal Great Eastern Hotel Acquisition of Undertaking Act held in the context of Article A that the <ORG> or executive offices cannot interfere with the right of others unless they can point out the specific provisions of law which authorises their rights Further it was also argued that the twin requirements of public purpose and compensation in case of deprivation of property are inherent and essential elements or ingredients or inseparable concomitants of the power of eminent domain and therefore of entry List III as well and hence would apply when the validity of a statute is in question Learned senior counsel <NAME> also referred to the opinion expressed by another learned author Prof Learned author opined that Article A will require obviously that the law must be a valid law and no law of acquisition or requisitioning can be valid unless the acquisition or requisition is for a public purpose unless there is provision in law for paying compensation will continue to have a meaning given to it by <NAME> case supra Learned author has stated although Article A says that no one shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law there is no reason to expect that this provision would protect private property only against executive action <NAME> in his book Shorter Constitution of India th Edition dealt with Article A in Chapter IV wherein the learned author expressed some reservation about the views expressed by <NAME> as well as Prof <NAME> Learned author expressed the view that after the th amendment Act there is no express provision in the Constitution outside the two cases specified under Article A and the second proviso to A requiring the <ORG> to pay compensation to an expropriated owner Resultantly though no individual or even educational institution belonging to majority community shall have any fundamental right to compensation in case of compulsory acquisition of his property by the <ORG> an educational institution belonging to a minority community shall have such fundamental right to claim compensation in case <ORG> enacts a law providing for compulsory acquisition of any property of an educational institution established and administered by a minority community Looking at the history of the various constitutional amendments judicial pronouncements and the statement of objects and reasons contained in the th Amendment Bill which led to the th Amendment Act we have no doubt that the intention of the <ORG> was to do away with the fundamental right to acquire hold and dispose of the property But the question is whether the principles of eminent domain are completely obliterated when a person is deprived of his property by the authority of law under Article A of the Constitution The concept of eminent domain which applies when a person is deprived of his property postulates that the purpose must be primarily public and not primarily of private interest and merely incidentally beneficial to the public Any law which deprives a person of his private property for private interest will be unlawful and unfair and undermines the rule of law and can be subjected to judicial review After the th Amendment Act the constitutional obligation to pay compensation to a person who is deprived of his property primarily depends upon the terms of the statute and the legislative policy Article A however does not prohibit the payment of just compensation when a person is deprived of his property but the question is whether a person is entitled to get compensation as a matter of right in the absence of any stipulation in the statute depriving him of his property Before answering those questions let us examine whether the right to claim compensation on deprivation of one property can be traced to Entry List III It provides that subject to the provisions of this Constitution the <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the State <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in Seventh Schedule called the Union List and subject to the said power of the <ORG> the <ORG> of any State has power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III called the Concurrent List Subject to the above the <ORG> of any State has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II called the State List Under Article the exclusive power of the <ORG> to make laws extends to any matter not enumerated in any Concurrent List or State List We find no apparent conflict with the words used in Entry List III so as to infer that the payment of compensation is inbuilt or inherent either in the words acquisition and requisitioning under Entry List III Right to claim compensation is therefore cannot be read into the legislative Entry List III In other words the right to claim compensation or the obligation to pay though not expressly included in Article A it can be inferred in that Article and it is for the <ORG> to justify its stand on justifiable grounds which may depend upon the legislative policy object and purpose of the statute and host of other factors Article A enables the <ORG> to put restrictions on the right to property by law At this stage we may clarify that there is a difference between no compensation and nil compensation A law seeking to acquire private property for public purpose cannot say that no compensation shall be paid However there could be a law awarding nil compensation in cases where the <ORG> undertakes to discharge the liabilities charged on the property under acquisition and onus is on the government to establish validity of such law The right to challenge laws enacted in respect of subject matter enumerated under Article A a to on the ground of violation of Article was also constitutionally excluded Article read with Ninth Schedule protects all laws even if they are violative of the fundamental rights but in <NAME> case supra <ORG> of this Court held that the laws added to the Ninth Schedule by violating the constitutional amendments after if challenged will be decided on the touchstone of right to freedom guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution and with reference to the basic structure doctrine which includes reference under Article read with Articles etc Article states that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law then the essential characteristics of tax is that it is imposed under statute power without tax payer consent and the payment is enforced by law This <ORG> in <NAME> case supra took the view that the principle of unfairness of procedure attracting Article does not apply to the acquisition or deprivation of property under Article A but that per se is not a ground to strike down a statute or its provisions But at the same time is it the law that <ORG> is powerless when it confronts with a situation where a person is deprived of his property by law for a private purpose with or without providing compensation For example a political party in power with a massive mandate enact a law to acquire the property of the political party in opposition not for public purpose with or without compensation is it the law that such a statute is immune from challenge in <ORG> Can such a challenge be rejected on the ground that statute does not violate the Fundamental Rights due to deletion of Art A law made by <ORG> or the legislature can be struck down by courts on two grounds and two grounds alone viz There is no third ground No enactment can be struck down by just saying that it is arbitrary or unreasonable felt that the question whether arbitrariness and unreasonableness or manifest arbitrariness and unreasonableness being facets of Article of the Constitution are available or not as grounds to invalidate a legislation is a matter requiring examination by a larger Bench and accordingly referred the matter for consideration by a Larger Bench A legislation could also be challenged as unreasonable if it violates the principles of equality adumbrated in our Constitution or it unreasonably restricts the fundamental rights under Article of the Constitution The validity of a constitutional amendment and the validity of plenary legislation have to be decided purely as questions of constitutional law Court also generally expressed the view that the doctrines of strict scrutiny compelling evidence and suspect legislation followed by the Courts have no application to the Indian Constitutional Law It becomes a postulate of our own constitutional order by way of the preamble to the Constitution Act and its implicit inclusion in the preamble to the Constitution Act by virtue of the words with a Constitution similar in principle to that of the United Kingdom The founders of this nation must have intended as one of the basic principles of nation building that Canada be a society of legal order and normative structure one governed by the rule of law This was a case involving a challenge to Ontario legislation restricting the political activities of civil servants in Ontario Although the <ORG> upheld the legislation <ORG> described the implied limitations in the following terms There is no doubt in my mind that the basic structure of our Constitution as established by the Constitution Act contemplates the existence of certain political institutions including freely elected legislative bodies at the federal and provincial levels Rule of law as a principle contains no explicit substantive component like eminent domain but has many shades and colours Violation of principle of natural justice may undermine rule of law so also at times arbitrariness proportionality unreasonableness etc but such violations may not undermine rule of law so as to invalidate a statute Violation must be of such a serious nature which undermines the very basic structure of our Constitution and our democratic principles But once the <ORG> finds a Statute undermines the rule of law which has the status of a constitutional principle like the basic structure the above grounds are also available and not vice versa Any law which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not just fair and reasonable is not a ground to strike down a Statute because such an approach would always be subjective not the will of the people because there is always a presumption of constitutionality for a statute Rule of law as a principle it may be mentioned is not an absolute means of achieving the equality human rights justice freedom and even democracy and it all depends upon the nature of the legislation and the seriousness of the violation Rule of law as an overarching principle can be applied by the constitutional courts in rarest of rare cases in situations we have referred to earlier and can undo laws which are tyrannical violate the basic structure of our Constitution and our cherished norms of law and justice Let the message therefore be loud and clear that rule of law exists in this country even when we interpret a statute which has the blessings of Article A We therefore answer the reference as follows a Section of the Land Reforms Act and the notification dated are valid and there is no excessive delegation of legislative power on the State Government under Section of the Land Reforms Act before <ORG> is a curable defect and it will not affect the validity of the notification or action taken thereunder There is no repugnancy between the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act and the Karnataka Land Reforms Act and hence no assent of the President is warranted under Article of the Constitution Public purpose is a pre condition for deprivation of a person from his property under Article A and the right to claim compensation is also inbuilt in that Article and when a person is deprived of his property the State has to justify both the grounds which may depend on scheme of the statute legislative policy object and purpose of the legislature and other related factors We accordingly dismiss all the appeals and direct the notified authority under the Acquisition Act to disburse the amount of compensation fixed by the Act to the legitimate claimants in accordance with law which will depend upon the outcome of the pending litigations between the parties
