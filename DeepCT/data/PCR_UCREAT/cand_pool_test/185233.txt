The charges were based upon the fact that in the Hindi rd paper set at the said examination the respondent gave wrong answers to Question No in precisely the same form in which the answers had been given by the candidate whose Roll number was consecutive with that of the respondent <ORG> interpreting the charge as confined to that the respondent had copied either from the answer book of the candidate bearing the consecutive Roll Number or from a common source held that the findings of the enquiry committee were based on no evidence and quashed the cancellation of the result Held further that in dealing with cases like those of educational institutions dealing with matters of discipline like employing unfair means the problem faced by the educational institutions should be appreciated by <ORG> and so long as the enquiry held is fair and affords the candidate an opportunity to defend himself the matter should not be examined with the same strictness as applicable to criminal trials in the ordinary courts of law Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> in Civil Misc The Judgement of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR <ORG>This appeal by special leave arises out of a Writ Petition filed by the respondent <NAME> against <ORG> Allahabad and its Secretary appellants and another By his petition the respondent challenged the validity of the order passed by appellant No on December cancelling the respondent result at the <ORG> Examination held in This charge was based on the fact that in Hindi rd paper set at the said examination the respondent had given wrong answers to Question No in precisely the same firm in which the said answers had been given by a candidate whose Roll No was The respondent was shown the identical wrong answers to the said Question which were found in the two papers and he was asked to explaining about the said identity of the wrong answers He admitted that the wrong answers appeared to be identical but he denied that he had used any unfair means As a result of the report made by the <ORG><ORG><ORG> the first appellant passed an order cancelling the results of both the candidates It is against this order that the appellants have come to this Court by special leave No of it appears that he challenged the validity of the impugned order on several grounds The principal contentions raised by the petitioner against the competence and the authority of appellant No and against the regularity and fairness of the enquiry held srose for decision<ORG> before <ORG> in the companion No of also <ORG> then proceeded to examine the narrow ground of attack against the validity of the order which was made on the basis that the impugned order was not supported by any evidence at all It appears from the judgment of <ORG> that the High court was inclined to accept this argument and it has set aside the order on the ground that it is not supported by any evidence The correctness of this finding is seriously disputed before us by the learned Advocate<ORG>General who appears for the appellants It is also common ground that <ORG> would be justified in quashing the impugned order if it is satisfied that the said order is not based on any evidence at all Having made this assumption <ORG> has observed that there was no charge against the respondent that he connived in the act of copying by the other candidate from his answer<ORG>book and it has added that there is no evidence in proof of such connivance This position is made very clear when we consider the explanation given by the respondent He admitted that the mistaken answers in the two papers were identical and he pleaded that he could not say any thing as to why this happened It would thus be seen that at the enquiry the charge against the respondent was either that he copied from candidate bearing Roll No or that he connived at the said candidate copying from his answer book or that both of them had copied from a common source There is another circumstance which is relevant and significant and that has been ignored by <ORG> in dealing with this petition It appears that at the examination held at Bindki Centre unfair means were adopted on a very large scale by a large number of students and the examination appears to have been conducted in an atmosphere which was not at all congenial to the enforcement of the discipline which has to be observed in conducting examinations It appears that there are rivalries and party politics in <ORG> that runs the institution at which this examination was held and there are rivalries and party politics even amongst the members of the staff book of the other candidate and <ORG> did not think that there was any evidence to show that the other candidate could have copied from the respondents paper with his connivance The question before <ORG> had to be decided by it in the light of the nature of the incorrect answers themselves and that is what <ORG> has done There was still the alternative possibility that the candidate sitting behind may have copied from the respondent with his connivance that <ORG> did not write an elaborate report does not mean that it did not consider all the relevant facts before it came to the conclusion that the respondent had used unfair means In dealing with petitions of this type it is necessary to bear in mind that educational institutions like the <ORG> or appellant No set up Enquiry Committees to deal with the problem posed by the adoption of unfair means by candidates and normally it is within the jurisdiction of such domestic <ORG> to decide all relevant questions in the light of the evidence adduced before them In the matter of the adoption of unfair means direct evidence may sometimes be available but cases may arise where direct evidence is not available and the question will have to be considered in the light of probabilities and circumstantial evidence This problem which educational institutions have to face from time to time is a serious problem and unless there is justification to do so courts should be slow to interfere with the decisions of domestic <ORG> appointed by educational bodies like the <ORG> <ORG> is not sitting in appeal over the decision in question its jurisdiction is limited and though it is true that if the impugned order is not supported by any evidence at all <ORG> would be justified to quash that order But the conclusion that the impugned order is not supported by any evidence must be reached after considering the question as to whether probabilities and circumstantial evidence do not justify the said conclusion Enquiries held by domestic <ORG> in such cases must no doubt be fair and students against whom charges are framed must be given adequate opportunities to defend themselves and in holding such enquiries the <ORG> must scrupulously follow rules of natural justice but it would we think not be reasonable to import into these enquiries all considerations which govern criminal trials in ordinary courts of law The enquiry has been fair and the respondent has had an opportunity of making his defence That being so we think <ORG> was not justified in interfering with the order passed against the respondent It appears that the respondent has in June passed his Intermediate Examination and it has been fairly conceded that there is no intention to disturb his career under the present circumstances The learned Advocate General wanted a decision from us in this appeal because he apprehended that the reasoning adopted by <ORG> in setting aside the order passed against the respondent may be construed to mean that under Art <ORG> can examine the merits of the order passed by appellant No in such cases
