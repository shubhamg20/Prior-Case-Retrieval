which formed part of the ancestral property were deposited in a <ORG> and some years ago drawn out by the st defendant There was a suggestion that it was used by the st defendant for purpose of his own marriage or other legitimate family expenses But all his affairs were in the hands of the Official Assignee who had every opportunity of examining the insolvent and ascertaining the true facts At the time he told his mother that he was lending a large part of it to a Muhammadan a business man but there is no evidence that this loan is still outstanding and it is much more probable that it was ultimately used to meet the defalcations in Messrs <NAME> Co or to meet the st defendant losses in some unfortunate speculations which led to his making away with this large amount of <NAME> money He points out that there is an exception to this rule when a person is able to establish misappropriation on the part of the manager He also holds that there is another exception namely that if a co parcener is a minor the manager can be made to account generally in respect of the corpus of the estate at any rate where there are no adult members except the manager and as the plaintiff in this case was at all material times a minor he holds that the first defendant must bring into account this sum of Rs That a managing member is not bound to give a general account of his dealings that in the absence of fraud or misappropriation the managing member cannot be called upon to justify his past transactions that the manager is not bound to keep general accounts and that co parceners cannot complain if the manager in his discretion favours in his expenditure one of the co parceners at the expense of the others are matters I think beyond controversy nor do I find any authority in support of the proposition that in this matter there is any difference between the position of an infant co parcener and another In fact on an examination of the cases establishing these propositions it will be found that in most of them there were persons who were minors at the date of the partition or had been minors at the time of the expenditure by the manager But in this case there is nothing of the sort and I think that the proper inference to be drawn is that these monies have been misappropriated by the managing member There is no evidence that he spent it on a family necessity or that there was any family necessity for which such a sum of money would have been required and in my judgment under those circumstances when the assets are traced into the hands of the managing member he is bound to account for them on a partition whether his co parceners are minors or majors and in this case the first defendant and the Official Assignee representing him have entirely failed to do so The result is that this appeal must be dismissed with costs I agree that this appeal must be dismissed with costs Though he is not entitled to ask for a general account of the management he is entitled to an account of the property at the time he asks for partition It is argued on the other hand that they have an absolute right to them it being called a light in rent In my judgment it is quite wrong to say that the members of a joint Hindu family have rights in rent to residence in a particular house It is true that while it is being used as a family house they have a right to reside there but I have serious doubts whether they have a right to any particular separate room but on partition it is clearly a matter for the tribunal arranging the partition to say whether it is in the general interest of the co parceners that residence should be given in a particular house or not Some other provision can be made if there are more houses than one to choose from I think that so much of this judgment as purports to hamper the Official Referee discretion in effecting this partition by giving these two ladies an indefeasible right to occupy a certain part of this house is wrong and that the matter must go before the Official Referee to decide what is best to be done unfettered by any such direction
