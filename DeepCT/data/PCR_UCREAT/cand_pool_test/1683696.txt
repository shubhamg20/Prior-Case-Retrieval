<NAME> suit was that the property comprised in the first mortgage be sold again and out of the sale proceeds he should be paid the amount due on that mortgage at that date of the plaint The learned Subordinate Judge has found that the appellant <NAME> is entitled to priority in the amount of the prior mortgage calculated up to the date fixed for payment that this amount is to be arrived at by calculating interest at per cent We shall first take up the two questions of fact Was the lower <ORG> wrong in holding that <NAME> got possession of the lands sold under the decree in the prior mortgage and is Rs The learned Subordinate Judge has stated that appellant failed to show in what manner the mortgagor and his sons were influential enough to defy the orders of the <ORG> that appellant has had the patta for the lands transferred to his name and has been paying the revenue due to <ORG> regularly and that since the date of the alleged dispossession he has never moved any authority with a view to being put into possession nor complained to any public authority We have heard learned counsel on both sides at some length on the question of the value of the evidence adduced by the appellant at the trial and we see no sufficient reason to differ from the opinion of the Judge who saw the witnesses What did the appellant mean by that statement if he did not mean that he the purchaser had got effective possession of the lands though the sale is not binding on the subsequent mortgagee who can in spite of it exercise his right of redemption Applying that rule to the facts of the present case we have to accept the position that the mortgagor rights were transferred to the defendant respondents in but the plaintiff appellants who were no party are entitled to redeem allowing credit for all the sums paid to the mortgagees and the actual profits realised by them during the period they have been in possession of the mortgaged property It ignores the fact that the purchase was made behind the back of the puisne mortgagee in pursuance of a decree to which the puisne mortgagee was no party though he ought to have been made a party in which case the lands would have been sold for their full value and the puisne mortgagee would have been satisfied wholly or in part In this connexion we observe that though the appellant declared in his plaint in No that when he bought the land at <ORG> auction he knew nothing of the respondent mortgage as a matter of fact the existence of that mortgage was proclaimed at the time of the auction The sale which took place in pursuance of that decree is thus a nullity and the purchaser at that sale could not acquire the rights of a mortgagor owner as against the puisne mortgagee In of Mad That to our minds is conclusive to show that the mortgage which is revived against the puisne mortgagee though extinguished against the mortgagor is kept alive to the fullest extent as if no action had ever teen brought on it The second argument in support of the appellant plea that he is not accountable at all is based on the fact that the price he paid for the mortgaged property was more than the amount due on the mortgage and the amount due on the mortgage including costs of the suit and poundage was Rs Though we must record an appreciation of the skill and learning with which Mr <NAME> has pressed the appellant case we must hold that the appellant is accountable for the profits to the full extent The suit was by the third mortgagee and the question debated was whether the purchaser was entitled to be reimbursed in what he had paid towards the prior mortgagee with interest and if so whether he was liable to account for the profits The fact which distinguishes the case from the present is that the purchaser came into possession of the mortgaged property by virtue of a sale which the mortgagees were not entitled to ignore while here the possession of the purchaser derived from a sale which the puisne mortgagee is entitled to treat as a nullity We say again that we respectfully agree with the conclusion arrived at in that ease But it is stipulated that if there is failure to pay the interest or principal on the due dates the interest shall be at per cent awarded by the learned Subordinate Judge We think both questions should be answered in the affirmative The appeal and cross objections are dismissed with costs Following our decision that the appellant is in possession of the property that appeal is dismissed with costs
