The petitioners instead of preferring appeals under sub of of the Act filed petitions before <ORG> under Art of the Constitution Dismissing the Petitions HELD In the provenance of tax where the Act provides for a complete machinery which enables an assessee to effectively raise in the courts the question of the validity of an assessment denied an alternative jurisdiction to <ORG> to interfere under Art They have the right to prefer an appeal before the prescribed authority under sub of of the Act The Act provides for a complete machinery to challenge an order of assessment and the impugned orders of assessment can only be challenged by the mode prescribed by the Act and not by a petition under Art No such question arises in a case like the present where the impugned orders of assessment are not challenged on the ground that they are based on a provision which is ultra vires There is no justification for extending the principles laid down in <ORG> case or <NAME> case to a case like the present where there is an assessment made by the learned <ORG> under the Act A The question whether another adjournment should have been granted or not was within the discretion of the learned <ORG> and is a matter which can properly be raised in an appeal under sub of of the Act The rule laid down in <NAME> case which requires the exhaustion of alternative remedies is a rule of convenience and discretion rather than a rule of law The petitioner have a right to prefer an appeal under sub of of the Act subject to their payment of an admitted amount of tax as enjoined by the proviso thereto It is for the Commissioner to decide whether or not there should be such stay on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit looking to the nature of the demand raised in the facts and circumstances of the present case The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SEN <NAME> These two special leave petitions are directed against an order of <ORG> dated March dismissing the Writ Petitions flied by the petitioners in limine challenging the two orders of assessment passed by the Assistant Sales Tax Officer Cuttack II Circle Cuttack dated February By one of the Writ Petitions the petitioners challenged the validity of the order of assessment under the Central Sales Tax Act for the assessment year passed by the Assistant Sales Tax Officer Cuttack II Circle Cuttack dated February under of the Central Sales Tax Orissa Rules treating the gross turnover of Rs By the other the petitioners challenged the validity of an order of assessment under the Orissa Sales Tax Act It appears from the impugned orders of assessment that proceedings under of the Central Sales Tax Orissa Rules Rules for short and under sub of of the Orissa Sales Tax Act Act for short were initiated against the petitioners for the assessment year in relation to assessment of tax on sales in the course of inter state trade and commerce under the Central Sales Tax Act and inside sales effected during the year in question under the Orissa Sales Tax Act The provisions contained in of the Rules and in sub of of the Act enjoin the affording of reasonable opportunity to the dealer for completion of assessment The learned Sales Tax Officer observes that he gave repeated opportunities to the petitioners to get themselves ready for the assessment of tax and to produce their account books and other documents but they sought adjournments on one pretext or another The petitioners instead of preferring appeals under sub of of the Act filed petitions before <ORG> under Art <ORG> while dismissing the writ petitions observed Having heard the learned counsel for both the parties and having gone through the records we are not inclined to interfere with the impugned order in exercise with our extra ordinary jurisdiction since there is a right of appeal against the same It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that the impunged order being a nullity is entitled to invoke our extra ordinary jurisdiction There is no violation of principles of natural justice In support of these petitions the submissions advanced by learned counsel for the petitioners rest purely on procedural irregularities or touch upon the merits of the assessments Broadly speaking the contentions were that The learned Sales Tax Officer had no authority or jurisdiction while making an assessment under of the Central Sales Tax Orissa Rules to treat the gross turnover as returned by the petitioners to be their taxable turnover It is true that the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra was in relation to a suit brought for a declaration that an assessment made by the Income Tax Officer was a nullity and it was held by <ORG> that an assessment made under the machinery provided by the Act even if based on a provision subsequently held to be ultra vires was not a nullity like an order of a court lacking jurisdiction and that of the Income Tax Act operated as a bar to the maintainability of such a suit In dealing with the question whether operated as a bar to a suit to set aside or modify an assessment made under a provision of the Act which is ultra vires <ORG> observed In construing the section it is pertinent in their Lordships opinion to ascertain whether the Act contains machinery which enables an assessee effectively to raise in the courts the question whether a particular provision of the Income Tax Act bearing on the assessment made is or is not ultra vires The presence of such machinery though by no means conclusive marches with a construction of the section which denies an alternative jurisdiction to inquire into the same subject matter If an assessee raises such a question according to the decision of the majority in <NAME> case supra <ORG> can only reject it on the ground that it has no jurisdiction to entertain such objection or render any decision on it It can only decide questions of law that arise out of the order of <ORG> and that are referred to it Further an appeal to this Court under A does not enlarge the scope of the jurisdiction of this Court as this Court can only do what <ORG> can under No such question arises in a case like the present where the impugned orders of assessment are not challenged on the ground that they are based on a provision which is ultra vires We are dealing with a case in which the entrustment of power to assess is not in dispute and the authority within the limits of his power is a <ORG> of exclusive jurisdiction We find no justification for extending the principles laid down in <NAME> case supra to a case like the present where there is an assessment made by the learned <ORG> under the Act The decision in <NAME> case supra is clearly distinguishable as in that case there was total lack of jurisdiction There is no suggestion that the learned Sales Tax Officer had no jurisdiction to make an assessment The question whether another adjournment should have been granted or not was within the discretion of the learned Sales Tax Officer and is a matter which can properly be raised only in an appeal under sub of of the Act The petitioners have the right to prefer an appeal before the prescribed authority under sub of of the Act The Act provides for a complete machinery to challenge an order of assessment and the impugned orders of assessment can only be challenged by the mode prescribed by the Act and not by a petition under Art It is now well recognised that where a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for enforcing it the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of This rule was stated with great clarity by <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> in the following passage There are three classes of cases in which a liability may be established founded upon statute But there is a third class viz where a liability not existing at common law is created by a statute which at the same time gives a special and particular remedy for enforcing it the remedy provided by the statute must be followed and it is not competent to the party to pursue the course applicable to cases of the second class The petitioners have a right to prefer an appeal under sub of of the Act subject to their payment of the admitted amount of tax as enjoined by the proviso thereto As regards the disputed amount of tax the petitioners have the remedy of applying for stay of recovery to the Commissioner of Sales Tax under cl a of the second proviso to sub of of the Act which runs Provided further that a When the dealer or person as the case may be has presented an appeal under sub of the Commissioner may on an application in that behalf filed by such dealer or person within thirty days from the date of receipt by him of the notice under sub in his discretion stay the recovery of the amount in respect of which such notice has been issued or any portion thereof for such period and subject to such conditions as the Commissioner thinks fit The petitioners are at liberty to make an application for stay of the disputed amount and the Commissioner will decide whether or not there should be such stay on such terms and conditions as he thinks fit looking to the nature of the demand raised in the facts and circumstances of the present case
