In this connection we must bear in mind the observation of Sir <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> I A Bom Consequently upon the death of <NAME> the shebaitship vested in <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> who were the heirs of the founder at the time But it has been argued for the appellant that <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> took successive life estates in the office with the result that the remainder at the death of the founder constituted a vested interest in the hands of his six sons When a Hindu female is thus in possession she represents the estate completely and though her powers of disposition may be of a restricted character no one else has a vested interest in the estate during her life time namely that the rule that when a worship of a thakoor has been founded the shebaitship is vested in the heirs of the founder in default of evidence that he has disposed of it otherwise or of there being some evidence of usage course of dealing or some circumstances to show a different mode of devolution cannot be applied so as to vest the shebaitship in persons who according to the usages of the worship cannot perform the rights of the office The result is that the appeal is dismissed with costs
