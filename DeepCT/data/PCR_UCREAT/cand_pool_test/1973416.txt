His period of probation was extended for six months from and before his services were terminated there was no express order either confirming him or extending the period of probation The respondent filed a writ petition in the High court on the ground that the order terminating his services was malafide and was in fact passed by way of penalty entailing evil consequences The plea taken by the respondent found favour with the High <ORG> which allowed the petition and quashed the order of the appellant terminating the services of the respondent The contention that the real motive behind the termination of the service of the respondent was to inflict a punishment on him and as the appellants did not comply with the requirements of Article of the Constitution the order impugned was illegal is not correct As the respondent was merely a probationer the appointing authority did not consider it necessary to continue the enquiry but decided to terminate the services of the respondent as he was not found suitable for the job who has no right to the post such a termina tion of his service is valid and does not attract the provisions of Article of the Constitution A Even if misconduct negligence inefficiency may be the motive or the inducing factor which influences the employer to terminate the services of the employee a power which the appellants undoubtedly possessed even so as under the terms of appointment of the respondent such power flowed from the contract of service it could not be termed as penalty or Punishment The order does not in any way involve any evil consequences and is an order of discharge simpliciter of the respondent who was a probationer and had no right to the service The respondent has not been able to make out any strong case for this <ORG> to delve into the documents materials in order to determine a case of victimisation or one of punishment The short history of the service of the respondent clearly showed that his work had never been satisfactory and he was not found suitable for being retained in service and that is why even though some sort of an enquiry was started it was not proceeded with and no punishment was inflicted on him In these circumstances therefore if the appointing authority considered it expedient to terminate the services of the respondent a probationer it cannot be said that the order of termination attracted the provisions of Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against a judgment and order dated th JULY of <ORG> The facts giving rise to the appeal lie within a very narrow compass He will be entitled to draw dearness and other allowances at such rates and subject to such conditions as may be laid down in the rules and orders governing the grant of such allowances from time to time The order of appointment was accompanied by conditions regulating his appointment and two of them may be extracted below as they appear to be very relevant for the purpose of deciding the question at issue ii The appointment may be terminated at any time by one month notice to be given by either side viz The appointing authority however reserves the right of terminating the services or the appointee without notice or before expiration of the stipulated period of notice by making payment to him of a sum equivalent to the pay and allowances for the period of notice or the unexpired portion thereof iii He will be on probation for a period of one year from the date of appointment It appears that during the period of his probation there were some reports against the respondent as a result of which a departmental enquiry was held against him but which does not appear to have been proceeded with nor was any punishment imposed on him After he had completed the period of one year on his probation was extended for another six months and before his services were terminated there was no express order either confirming him or extending the period of probation The respondent felt aggrieved by the termination of his services and filed a writ petition in <ORG> on the ground that the order terminating his services was mala fide and was in fact passed by way of penalty entailing evil consequences The plea taken by the respondent found favour with <ORG> which allowed the petition and quashed the order of the appellant terminating the services of the respondent The appellant obtained special leave to appeal from this Court hence the appeal has now been posted before us for hearing The only point raised before us by the appellants was that as the respondent was a mere Probationer and the order terminating his services was all order of termination simpliciter without involving any stigma or penalty <ORG> was in error in quashing the order or termination and directing the reinstatement of the respondent The counsel for the appellants submitted that reading the order per se there is nothing to indicate that it was passed by way of punishment In other words the argument of the respondent was that the order of termination of the services passed by the appellant was an order which amounted to A dismissal from service involving a clear stigma and would therefore attract the provisions of Art Being a probationer the respondent had no right to the service Under the terms of his appointment particularly clauses ii and iii extracted above the appointing authority could terminate the services without assigning any reasons Under clause iii of the conditions of appointment the appointing authority had a discretion to extend the period of probation and to terminate the services of the respondent without any notice and without giving any reasons whatsoever In accordance with the recommendation the period of probation was further extended by six months It was then vehemently contended by the respondent that as the appointing authority chose to institute a departmental inquiry against the respondent for dereliction of duty and negligence in not attending to a baby who died due to his carelessness the enquiry should have been carried to its logical end and charge sheet having been framed the provisions of Art In other words the contention was that the real motive behind the termination of the service of the respondent was to inflict a punishment on him and as the appellants did not comply with the requirements of Art In these circumstances therefore it is obvious that as the respondent was merely a probationer the appointing authority did not consider it necessary to continue the enquiry but decided to terminate the services of the respondent as he was not found suitable for the job It is well settled by a long course of decisions of this <ORG> that in the case of a probationer or a temporary employee who has no right to the post such a termination of his services is valid and does not attract the provisions of Art In the absence of any Rules governing a probationer in this respect the authority may come to the conclusion that on account of inadequacy for the job or for any temperamental or other object not involving moral turpitude the probationer is unsuitable for the job and hence must be discharged A probationer whose terms of service provided that it could be terminated without any notice and without any cause being assigned could hot claim the protection of Article An order terminating the services of a temporary servant or probationer under the Rules of Employment and without anything more will not attract Article But if the servant has no right to the post as where he is appointed to a post permanent or temporary either on probation or on an officiating basis and whose temporary service has not ripened into a quasi permanent service as defined in the Temporary Service Rules the termination of his employment does not deprive him of any right and can not therefore by itself be a punishment One test for deter mining whether the termination of the service of a Govern men servant is by way of punishment is to ascertain whether the servant but for such termination had the right to hold the post If he had a right to the post as in the three cases hereinbefore mentioned the termination of his service will by itself be a punishment and he will be entitled to the protection of Article will apply to those cases where the Government servant had he been employed by a private employer will be entitled to maintain an action for wrongful dismissal removal or reduction in rank To put it in another way if the Government has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to terminate the employment at any time then such termination in the manner provided by the contract or the rules is prima facie and per se not a punishment and does not attract the provisions of Art It is also not denied that both under the contract of service and the service rules governing the respondent the <ORG> had a right to terminate his services by giving him one month notice From the undisputed facts detailed by us in an earlier part of the judgment it is manifest that even if misconduct negligence inefficiency may be the motive or the inducing factor which influences the employer to terminate the services of the employee a power which the appellants undoubtedly possessed even so as under the terms of appointment of the respondent such a power flowed from the contract of service it could not be termed as penalty or punishment where <NAME> observed thus Ordinarily and generally the rule laid down in most of the cases by this <ORG> is that you have to look to the order on the face of it and find whether it casts any stigma on the <ORG> servant In such a case there is no presumption that the order is arbitrary or mala fide unless a very strong case is made out and proved by the <ORG> servant who challenges such an order Applying the principles enunciated by this <ORG> in various cases to the facts of the present case the position is that the order impugned is prima facie an order of termination simpliciter without involving any stigma The order does not in any way involve any evil consequences and is an order of discharge simpliciter of the respondent who was a probationer and had no right to the service The short history of the service of the respondent clearly shows that his work had never been satisfactory and he was not found suitable for being retained in service and that is why even though some sort of an enquiry was started it was not proceeded with and no punishment was inflicted on him In these circumstances therefore if the appointing authority considered it expedient to terminate the services of the respondent a probationer it cannot be said that the order of termination attracted the provisions of Art Thus if the appellant found that the respondent was not suitable for being retained in service that will not vitiate the order impugned as held and observed by this <ORG> in the cases cited above For these reasons therefore we are satisfied that the order terminating the services of the respondent was valid and did not involve any stigma and was fully justified in the facts and circumstances of the present case judgment and decree of <ORG> and hold that the order terminating the services of the respondent was valid in law
