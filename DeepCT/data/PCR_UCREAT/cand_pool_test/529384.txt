The Registrar directed him to move <ORG> for the rectification as the respondent had by that time filed a suit in <ORG> for a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from selling any preparation under a mark containing the word <ORG> Me appellant accordingly filed an original petition in <ORG> It was held that i having regard to the method of packing adopted by the appellant he was not guilty of passing off ii the respondent was not entitled to any relief on the ground of the infringement of the mark <ORG> as it was a common word in Ayurvedik phraseology and used in connection with several medicinal preparations and iii the trade name <ORG> Pharmaceutical Laboratories had been use as a trade mark by the respon dent for a very long time and had come to denote exclusively his goods and that the trade mark having been in use from before the specified date February and having acquired factual distinctiveness was registerable under the proviso to of the Trade Marks Act The word distinctiveness cannot mean adapted to distinguish for then the proviso would add nothing to the section and would make no variation in the law as between new marks and old marks which had been in use continuously from before the specified date Since both the trial court and <ORG> found that through long user from onwards the mark of the respondent had become associated exclusively in the market with the pharmaceutical products manufactured by him it would follow that his mark was rightly registered and that he was entitled to protect an invasion of his rights by seeking a perpetual injunction against those who invaded them A A A ii In an action for infringement of a trade mark the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish that the trade mark used by the defendant is deceptively similar Where the similarity between the plaintiff and defendant marks is so close either visually phonetically or otherwise and the Court reaches the conclusion that there is an invitation no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff rights are violated A finding regarding the packing is relevant with respect to the relief on the ground of passing off but plays a limited role in an action for infringement of a registered trade mark by the registered proprietor who has a statutory right to that mark and a statutory remedy under for vindication of his exclusive right to use it In the instant case there being no such error the conclusion reached by both the lower courts that the appellant mark was deceptively similar to that of the respondent cannot be interfered with The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These two appeals by special leave are con cerned with the validity of the respondent firm claim as the registered proprietor of <ORG> Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories used by it on its medicinal preparations The respondent as stated already is a firm and it carries on business at Ernakulam in the same name and style as the Trade Mark now in controversy <ORG> From the very beginning the proprietors used the Trade Mark Navaratna on the products which they manufactured and sold There is evidence that the <ORG> has been having an expanding business in the products which it manufactures and has been selling the same under the above and other cognate names and this has continued ever since There was a similar provision in A of the Cochin Act and availing itself of this provision the respondent firm applied for the registration of the words <ORG> in <ORG> at Bombay Pausing here certain facts have to be set out in relation to the appellant since they are material for understanding the Origin Of the proceedings which have given rise to these appeals This led to the proceedings which have culminated in these appeals By this date however the respondent had filed wit No of from which A No of arises before the District Judge <NAME> for a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from advertising selling or offering for sale any preparations under a trade mark combining the word Navaratne or any similar word etc The original suit was as stated earlier for a perpetual injunction against the appellant for using the word Navaratna and the cause of action for that suit was stated to be that the plaintiff respondent before us being proprietor of the two registered trade marks Navaratna and Navaratna Pharmaceutical Laboratories had an exclusive right to the use of those marks for his medicinal preparations and that the said right was infringed by the defendant appellant before us advertising his goods under the name Navaratna Kalpa with the trade origin of the goods being described as Navaratna Kalpa Pharmacy There was also an allegation that by use of these marks the defendant was passing off his goods as those of the plaintiff It was therefore submitted that the plaintiff could claim no exclusive title to the use of that word which was a common word for the description of the product as a trade mark to designate its pharmaceutical preparations Next it was submitted that even on the basis that the plaintiff was entitled to the use of the word <ORG> either alone or in the combination <ORG> <ORG> Laboratories still the use of the trade mark by the defendant of the words <ORG> Kalpa and <ORG> Kalpa Pharmacy were not either identical with nor deceptively similar to the plaintiffs marks and therefore he was not guilty of any infringement To reach this finding the learned District Judge pointed out that it was brought to his notice that there were several concerns manufacturing and vending Ayurvedic preparations which had for a very long time past either used marks which included that word and had described their products by calling them Navaratna either alone or in combination with other words Dealing next with the question as to whether the mark <ORG> could be validly registered and rights claimed for such a registration the learned Judge answered it in the affirmative pointing out that no evidence was placed before the Court of the use by any other person firm or concern of that name and that there was evidence which was uncontradicted that trade name <ORG> or some variant of the same had been used as a trade mark by the plaintiff for a very long time and had come in the market to denote exclusively the goods of the plaintiff From this judgment the appellant filed an appeal to <ORG> and the learned Judges heard the appeal along with the Original Petition under of the Act filed by the appellant These two appeals have been preferred by the appellant after obtaining special leave from this Court in these two matters respectively He therefore submitted that the plaintiff had no exclusive right to the use of the mark as a registered trade mark and that consequently his claim for the relief of perpetual injunction Under of the Trade Marks Act was not sustainable A trade mark shall not be registered unless it contains or consists of at least one of the following essential particulars namely a the name of a company individual or firm represented in a special or particular manner the signature of the applicant for registration or some predecessor in his business one or more invented words one or more words having no direct reference to the character or quality of the goods and not being according to its ordinary significa tion a geographical name or surname or the name of a sect caste or tribe in India any other distinctive mark provided that a name signature or any word other than such as fall within the description in the above clauses shall not be registerable except upon evidence of its distinctiveness The learned Counsel particularly stressed clause of sub which excluded words having direct reference to the character or quality of the goods from being treated as distinctive and thus qualifying for registrability If the matter had to be decided in terms of alone without reference to the terms of the proviso to sub to which we shall advert presently we see great force in the submission of the learned Counsel I cannot help regarding the attempt on Mr <NAME> part as an instance of that perpetual struggle which it seems to me is going on to enclose and to appropriate as private property certain little strips of the great open common of the English language In the present case the words Pharmaceutical and Laboratories would have a direct reference to the character of the goods since the trade marks to which it is claimed to attach them are medicinal or pharmaceutical products In this connection reference may also be made to a decision of <ORG> to which Mr <NAME> drew our attention He took the view which I share that <ORG> had in the <ORG> case rightly interpreted the opinion of Lord <NAME> in the <NAME> <NAME> case and that this <ORG> in its turn in the <NAME> case endorsed that interpretation Of course where the geographical area is very small there is a possibility of the inherent incapability to attain distinctiveness becoming We do not find any error in the approach of the learned District Judge to this question In the first place there was the intention on the part of the proprietor of the mark to indicate by its use the origin of the goods on which it was used There was also indubitable evidence regarding the recognition of that mark as indicating origin on the part of that section of the public who buy these goods in the course of trade or for consumption This takes us to the consideration of the proper construction of the proviso In support of this submission the learned Counsel relied on the view expressed by Mr <NAME> in his comments on at pages of his Treatise on Trade Mark Act which view he submitted had found judicial acceptance in a decision of <ORG> reported as In the matter of <ORG> Before proceeding further we should add what there is a decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> in which the question of the construction of the proviso came up for consideration The learned Judges however without any discussion of the points involved expressed their opinion that even if the mark came within the prohibition in cl of sub of an old mark i marks in use from before February would qualify for registration if there was evidence of factual a distinctiveness It would be seen that if this argument were accepted the proviso adds nothing to the section and makes no variation in the law as regards old marks which had been in use continuously from before the specified date In this connection some support was sought for the cons truction pressed upon us by the learned Counsel for the appellants by reference to of the Act which reads No person shall be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent or to recover damages for the infringement of an unregistered trade mark unless such trade mark has been continuously in use since before the th day of February by such person or by a predecessor in title of his and unless an application for its registration made within five years from the commencement of this Act has been refused and the Registrar shall on application in the prescribed manner grant a certificate that such application has been refused Here again we do not see any substance in this argument Though there are some observations which might be wider it substantially proceeded on accepting the finding of the Registrar regarding the applicant having failed to establish factual acquired distinctiveness for his mark As we have pointed out earlier there are concurrent findings of fact on this point that through long user from onwards the mark had become associated exclusively in the market with the pharmaceutical products manufactured by the respondent On this matter also there are concurrent findings of the <ORG> below regarding the deceptive similarity of the two marks The finding in favour of the appellant to which the learned Counsel drew our attention was based upon dissimilarity of the packing in which the goods of the two parties were vended the difference in the physical appearance of the two packets by reason of the variation in their colour and other features and their general get up together with the circumstance that the name and address of the manufacture of the appellant was prominently displayed on his packets and these features were all set out for negativing the respondent claim that the appellant had passed off his goods as those of the respondent These matters which are of the essence of the cause of action for relief on the ground of passing off play but a limited role in an action for infringement of a registered trade mark by the registered proprietor who has a statutory right to that mark and who has a statutory remedy in the event of the use by another of that mark or a colourable imitation thereof The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods Vide of the Act conclusion that there is an imitation no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff rights are violated Expressed in another way if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant the fact that the get up packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial whereas in the case of passing off the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff When the two marks are not identical the plaintiff would have to establish that the mark used by the defendant so nearly resembles the plaintiffs registered trade mark as is likely to deceive or cause confusion and in relation to goods in respect of which it is registered Vide A point has sometimes been raised as to whether the words or cause confusion introduce any element which is not already covered by the words likely to deceive and it has sometimes been answered by saying that it is merely an extension of the earlier test and does not add very materially to the concept indicated by the earlier words likely to deceive But this apart as the question arises in an action for infringement the onus would be on the plaintiff to establish that the trade mark used by the defendant in the course of trade in the goods in respect of which his mark is registered is deceptively similar The resemblance may be phonetic visual or in the basic idea represented by the plaintiffs mark It should however be borne in mind that the object of the enquiry in ultimate analysis is whether the mark used by the defendant as a whole is deceptively similar to that of the registered mark of the plaintiff As there are concurrent findings of fact on this matter we do not propose to enter into a discussion of this question de novo since we are satisfied that the conclusion reached is not unreasonable The result is the appeals are dismissed with costs one set of hearing fee
