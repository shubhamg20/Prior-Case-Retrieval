And We do further ordain that from any judgment order or sentence of the said <ORG> at Fort William in Bengal made in the exercise of Original Criminal Jurisdiction or in any criminal case where any point or points of law have been re served for the opinion of the said <ORG> in manner hereinbefore provided by any Court which has exercised Original Jurisdiction it shall be lawful for the person aggrieved by such judgment order or sentence to appeal to Us Our heirs or successors in <ORG> provided the said <ORG> shall declare that the case is a fit one for such appeal and under such conditions as the said <ORG> may establish or require subject always to such rules and orders as We may with the advice of Our Privy <ORG> hereafter make in that behalf The petitioner <NAME> was placed on his trial at the last <ORG> before Mr Justice <NAME> and a Special Jury on charges under Sections and On the th September <ORG> delivered judgment and ordered that the application made by the prisoner under clause do stand dismissed The present application was made on the rd October for a certificate under clause that the case is a fit one for appeal to His Majesty in Council The latter appeals arise either where the <ORG> below does not possess power to grant leave to appeal or where leave to appeal has been refused by the <ORG> below or where the leave to appeal was granted on some special point and the appellant wishes to raise points not included in the leave to appeal Rex <NAME> A <ORG> <NAME> A Victorian Railway Commissioners <NAME> A and <NAME> <ORG> A The judicial pronouncementson the subject fall broadly into two divisions according as they were made in Indian cases or in Colonial cases In the first group of Indian cases the earliest decision which has been brought to our notice is that of <NAME> Reg Important questions of law including a question of jurisdiction were involved in the appeal The appellants were tried on charges of assault and battery in <ORG> at Calcutta before Sir <NAME> and a Jury and were convicted There the petitioners applied for leave to appeal from a conviction for felony at a trial held in <ORG> of Bombay before Sir <NAME> and Sir <NAME> and a Jury who returned a verdict of guilty Dr <NAME> who delivered the judgment of <ORG> ruled that there was no power reserved to the <ORG> by the Charter of <ORG> which conferred on that <ORG> and that <ORG> alone full and absolute power and authority to allow or deny appeals in criminal causes Lord <NAME> observed that there were no doubt very special and exceptional circumstances in which leave to appeal was granted in criminal cases but it would be contrary to the practice of the <ORG> and very mischievous if any countenance were given to the view that an appeal would be allowed in every case in which it could be established that there had been a misdirection by the Judge who tried the case Lord <NAME> observed that taking a view of the whole of the summing up there was nothing in that summing up which called upon their Lordships to indicate any dissent from it nor any necessity to correct what was therein contained looking at the summing up as a whole and looking at each part of what was said by the light of what else was said Sir <NAME> and <NAME> declined to grant leave and ruled that before a certificate could be granted the <ORG> must be satisfied that there was reasonable ground for thinking that grave and substantial injustice might have been done by reason of some departure from the principles of natural justice Reference was made to the decisions in <NAME> <NAME> Attorney General Cox Ex parte Carew A Cox and In Re Dillet A Cox It is worthy of note that in the second case there was a clear indication that even if <ORG> could sit as a <ORG> of criminal appeal it was hardly doubtful that the appeal would fail In the first case Viscount <NAME> pointed out that it would be contrary to their constitutional duty if the <ORG> were to assume the position and function of a <ORG> of Criminal Appeal a <ORG> which could go into questions of evidence and procedure and could deal with the case on the same footing as an ordinary <ORG> of Appeal A does not directly touch the question because there the decision impeached was that of the Governor General in Council which might be treated as a political act an act of State not a decision of a Court from which an appeal lay to His Majesty in Council the appeal was allowed on the ground that the Magistrate who had taken cognizance of the alleged offence and had issued a warrant against a subject of the <ORG> had acted without jurisdiction I A Bom A Cr which was an appeal by special leave in a murder case the appeal was allowed and the conviction was set aside <ORG> came to the conclusion that there was no evidence which could support a conviction for murder or abetment of murder There was no occasion to apply the doctrine in <NAME> <NAME> Moo A at their Lordships of the Judicial Committee when called upon to grant special leave to appeal in civil cases do take into consideration the general importance of the question raised and the fact that it has evoked great difference of judicial opinion In the view we thus take we shall not express an opinion whether there may not be other questions also in the appeal such as the question of the true construction of clause of the Letters Patent which by themselves being the case within the limited category of criminal proceedings reviewable according to established practice by their Lordships of <ORG> On anxious consideration of the character of the questions involved in this case and full recognition of the principles which regulate the functions of <ORG> in respect of criminal proceedings we have come to the conclusion that we should declare that this case is a fit one for appeal to His Majesty in Council under clause of the Letters Patent Counsel for the petitioners stated that they were not in a position to proceed with the petition for leave to appeal as the transcripts of the judgment of <ORG> and of the evidence had not reached them and they asked the <ORG> to make an order or a recommendation to <ORG> for the postponement of the execution of the sentences pending the hearing of the petition In the case before us a certificate has been directed under clause and there is consequently an appeal pending from the sentence There is more than one instance where the <ORG> which had passed the sentence stayed execution thereof pending decision of the questions in controversy by their Lordships of <ORG> see <NAME> <NAME> I A Boul A Cox which was heard shortly afterwards before the <ORG> differently constitued their Lordships looking to the exceptional nature of the case held that the <ORG> should pay to the appellant the costs of the appeal
