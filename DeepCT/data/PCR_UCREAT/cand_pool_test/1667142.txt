The Subordinate Judge gave effect to this contention but made the ordinary preliminary decree for the sum of Rs The three years had expired or had not expired according as computation fell to be made as the defendants urged from the time fixed for payment by the original decree or as the plaintiffs urged from the date of the dismissal of the appeal The Subordinate Judge gave effect to the contention of the plaintiffs It seems to me that this rule the rule regulating application for final decrees in mortgage notions contemplates the passing of only one final decree in a suit for <ORG> upon a mortgage The essential condition to the making of a final decree is the existence of a preliminary decree which has become conclusive between the parties When that decree is passed it is that decree and only that which can be made final in the cause between the parties Their Lordships will therefore humbly advise His Majesty to dismiss the appeal with costs
