Appeals Nos of and of are from a preliminary decree passed by the Subordinate Judge in a suit for the administration of the estate The petitions ask for the revision of orders passed in the suit By his first wife who predeceased him he had a son and three daughters There was no issue of the second marriage and by the third wife he had a daughter who died during the pendency of the administration suit There was no issue of this marriage She denied any right in the plaintiff for the same reason as defendant had advanced namely that the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act and the amending Act of were ultra vires <ORG> The pleadings contain other averments but it is not necessary for the purpose of deciding the questions which arise in the appeals and petitions now under consideration to refer to them The finding of the Subordinate Judge in the administration suit so far as they are relevant to the appeals were i the testator had died intestate except with regard to the legacies ii the residue of the estate devolved upon his heirs according to his personal law iii the testator had no power to give directions with regard to the management of the trust properties which also devolved upon his heirs iv the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act was intra vires the <ORG> by reason of that Act the plaintiff was an heir and was entitled to a half of the residue of the personal estate of the deceased vi the testator widows were entitled to the other half in equal shares vii the Hindu Women Rights to Property Act did not make the plaintiff an heir so far as the trust properties were concerned viii the testator widows alone could claim the right to possession and management of the trust properties ix the estate was of such magnitude that it would be dangerous to entrust the assets to the plaintiff and defendants and without safeguards and it was desirable that the properties should be left in charge of an officer or officers of the <ORG> until safeguards had been furnished and the receivers already appointed should continue to act pending the passing of the final decree Mr <NAME> who appeared on their behalf said that they had no objection to the personal estate of the testator being administered by the <ORG> in the administration suit but that his clients were interested in the proper management of the trusts and they claimed a right to be associated in the management Sub section of Section as it originally stood was in these words When a Hindu governed by <ORG> dies intestate his property and when a Hindu governed by any other school of Hindu law or by customary law dies intestate leaving separate property that separate property shall subject to the provisions of Sub section devolve upon Ms widow along with his lineal descendants if any in like manner as it devolves upon a son Provided that the widow of a predeceased son shall inherit in like manner as a son if there is no son surviving of such predeceased son and shall inherit in like manner as a son son if there is surviving a son or son son of such predeceased son Provided further that the same provision shall apply mutatis mutandis to the widow of a predeceased son of a predeceased son When there is more than one widow the widows together are now entitled subject to the provisions of Sub section to the same share as a son It has however been contended on behalf of defendants and that the personal estate left by the testator was not separate property within the meaning of the Act because the testator was joint with his father and what he died possessed of was property which had come to him as the surviving member of the joint family It was placed on the statute book in order to give a widow and a predeceased son widow a share in the estate of the deceased over which he had a disposing power The testator had full disposing power over all the properties of which he died possessed except with regard to the trust properties and Mr <NAME> who has appeared for defendant and whose arguments have been adopted by Mr <NAME> Iyengar on behalf of defendant has conceded this Lord <NAME> said What is the rule of construction which ought to be applied to such an enactment standing alone It seems to me that unless <ORG> expressly declares otherwise in which case even if it should go beyond its rights as regards the comity of nations the <ORG> of this country must obey the enactment the proper construction to be put on general words used in an English Act of <ORG> is that <ORG> was dealing only with such persons or things as are within the general words and also within its proper jurisdiction and that we ought to assume that <ORG> unless it expressly declares otherwise when it uses general words is only dealing with persons or things over which it has properly jurisdiction But it seems to me that our <ORG> ought not to deal in any way either by regulation or otherwise directly or indirectly with any foreign person or thing which is outside its jurisdiction and unless it does so in express terms so clear that their meaning is beyond doubt the <ORG> ought always to construe general words as applying only to persons or things which will answer the description and which are also within the jurisdiction of <ORG> The Act received the assent of the Governor General on th April but when it was passed by the <ORG> Burma was a part of British India The separation only took place on st April There is here very strong indication that the Act was never intended to apply to any kind of property situate outside British India The last question relates to the rights to possession of the trust properties and this is the only question with which the executors are now concerned In this case there has been no adoption and for the time being the testator directions in that respect must be ignored even if they are all valid as to which we express no opinion The Subordinate Judge dismissed the application because he considered that it had been filed too late and the will itself was in dispute All parties are now agreed that defendant should have been allowed to file the additional written statement and that the question whether she is entitled to these sums shall be decided in the further proceedings which must take place before the final decree is passed They filed them in time but notwithstanding his earlier order the Subordinate Judge refused to allow these costs in the preliminary decree The preliminary decree passed by the Subordinate Judge will be amended in accordance with the directions given in this judgment and the administration of the estate by the Court will be continued on the lines indicated
