<NAME> The assessee in this reference application under section of the Indian Income tax Act is a registered firm of four partners carrying on business as manufacturers of stainless steel ware brass sheets and circles We shall refer to the provisions of this Act and to the nature of the assessees liability a little later He held that the provision made for payment in respect of a statutory obligation would not amount to an expenditure as the amounts had not been credited to the accounts of the respective employees but were only placed under an account the assessee still having domination and control over the fund There was a further appeal by the assessee to <ORG> The <ORG> took the view that the assessee being under a statutory liability under section of the Industrial Dispute Act to pay the employees gratuity at the rate of fifteen days wages for every completed year of service there was nothing wrong for the assessee to make provision in each of the years as the liability is an ascertained one In the view of the <ORG> it is an ascertainable liability of the assessee in respect of which it made a provision in the year of account and that therefore the claim for deduction on the basis of that provision would be permissible in law and though the assessee now asserts that this reserve is also intended for the purposes of meeting a future statutory liability in case of retrenchment there is nothing on record to show that the segregation of this amount from the profit and loss account was made with the specific purpose and object of meeting that liability The assessee having succeeded in establishing its claim for deduction the department applied for a reference under section of the Act to the <ORG> and the <ORG> has referred the following questions Whether the aforesaid sum of Rs or any part thereof can be said to be an ascertained liability in respect of gratuity to the assessees employees due under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act as at the end of the aforesaid previous year so as to constitute a proper deduction in the assessment of the year We shall now refer to the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act to ascertain the nature of the assessees liability in respect of which it desires to forearm itself by building up a reserve fund No workman employed in any industry who has been in continuous service for not less than one year under an employer shall be retrenched by that employer until a the workman has been given one months notice in writing indicating the reasons for retrenchment and the period of notice has expired or the workman has been paid in lieu of such notice wages for the period of the notice the workman has been paid at the time of retrenchment compensation which shall be equivalent to fifteen days average pay for every completed year of service or any part thereof in excess of six months <ORG> held in the <ORG> case that the word retrenchment as defined under the Act has no wider meaning than the ordinary accepted connotation of the word and that it means the discharge of surplus labour or staff by the employer for any reason whatsoever in a continuing industry otherwise than as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action and it has no application where the services of all workmen have been terminated as a result of bone fide closure of business Learned counsel for the department contends firstly that a provision for meeting a future liability which is uncertain and contingent cannot be a proper charge on the business income of an assessee even under the mercantile system of accounting and secondly that even in a case of definite future liability making a provision by constituting a reserve in the assessees accounts would not amount to expenditure without which no deduction can be claimed In our opinion both these contentions are well founded and we have only to see whether these principles apply to the present case and prevent the assessee from the deduction Amounts carried to the reserve fund for anticipated or even inevitable losses or for contingent liabilities are not permissible deductions in computing the business profits and they do not fall within section xv of the Income tax Act While it is true that the profits of a business have to be computed consistent with commercial sense and that the provisions under section of the Act are not exhaustive of all items of permissible deductions there is no warrant for holding that every kind of prudential measure adopted by businessmen should earn allowance in taxation The reason why claims for allowance are made by the assessee in the name of commercial expediency is not an unintelligible secret the trade instincts of the assessee always try to get the better of the statute The principle laid down in that case is that only an ascertained liability justifies an entry in the assessees accounts maintained on the mercantile basis and that deductions are not permissible for anticipated losses or contingent liabilities II page paragraph has been quoted with approval as governing the interpretation of the Indian enactment In computing the profits of a trade it is the normal accountancy practice to allow as an expense any sum in respect of liabilities which have accrued over the accounting period and to make a deduction of such sums from the profits For income tax purposes it was held that a distinction must be drawn between an actual i legal liability which is deductible and a liability which is future or contingent and for which no deduction can be made The money may be expended on grounds of commercial expediency but not of necessity Thus in finding out what profits there be the normal accountancy practice may be to allow as expense any sum in respect of liabilities which have accrued over the accounting period and to deduct such sums from profits The contention on behalf of the revenue is that a provision by way of reserve by the assessee to meet the liability if any to which the assessee may become subject in the event of its sending away a few workmen because of retrenchment of surplus staff is not a liability in praesenti in the year of account but a liability which may arise de futuro on the happening of a particular contingency on the other hand the contention of the assessee is that the possibility of a retrenchment in any running business is not very remote but is something which is usual and ordinary incidental to the carrying on of business and that if the law of the land compels payment of compensation on a particular basis to the retrenched staff a provision to enable payment thereof even by way of anticipation would only amount to a liability in praesenti and not a contingent liability The assessee failed on the ground that in calculating the amount which it claimed to deduct in each year it had ignored the factor of discount The first is Have I adequately stated my profits for the year if I do not include some figure in respect of these obligations The second is Do the circumstances of the case which include the techniques of established accounting practice make it possible to supply a figure reliable enough for the purpose This decision of <ORG> undoubtedly lays down the proposition that it is proper on the part of a businessman to estimate a future liability which is almost definite and is certainly real and make a provision each year to meet that liability and claim them as a proper charge on the revenue receipt The actual decision in the English case which went against the assessee was on the footing that there was no proper evaluation of that liability in the particular year of account We would like to refer to the observations of the learned Law Lords in regard to this aspect of the matter It has calculated what sum would be required to be paid to each employee in respect of retirement benefit if he retired without forfeiture at the close of the year and the aggregate of what is required is set aside in so far as the year has contributed to the aggregate But it seems to me to leave out of account several factors that are essential to the appraisement It is clear that the assessee must fail in this case even on the principle laid down by <ORG> in the English case referred to It is impossible to contend that fifteen days wages for each year in respect of all the employees in the staff would be a proper annual contribution to conserve a fund to answer the claim of retrenched staff or in other words would amount to the present equivalent of the future liability to pay retrenchment compensation as it is obvious that some discount has to be made Having regard to the principles of law adverted to above we are of opinion that the liability of the assessee in respect of retrenchment compensation under section of the Act is not a liability in praesenti but is only a contingent liability which cannot be taken into account as an accrued liability even though the assessee has been maintaining his account books on the mercantile system Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the department is well founded in his submission that there is no expenditure at all incurred by the assessee by the mere process of putting the amount under the gratuity reserve fund At page <NAME> observes But there is no case directly on what is expenditure and if the authorities under the English statute were to be of real assistance the whole of the matter should have been before us In our opinion the assessee is not entitled to claim the deduction and the decision of the <ORG> holding in its favour is erroneous in law The assessee will pay the costs of the department
