A person who purchased certain properties at a <ORG> auction in execution of his own decree on the th of March applied for delivery of possession on the th of February An order confirming the sale was made on the th of April but on the rd of January that is more than days afterwards an application was made on behalf of the judgment debtor for the setting aside of the sale It will thus be seen that the application for delivery of possession of the property would be barred under Article if the time of years allowed by the second column be reckoned from the th of April when the sale was confirmed under Rule of Order XXI of the Civil Procedure Code no application for setting aside the sale having been made by that time but it would be within time if the period of limitation commenced on the th June the date of the order adjudicating upon the application made under Rule to set aside the sale on the ground of irregularity or fraud by which the sale as regards some of the items was set aside and the sale as regards the other items was upheld That rule contemplates that such an order is not to be made until the application to set aside the sale under Rule or or if any has been disposed of and disallowed The question under reference would hardly arise in cases where the application to set aside the sale is made in the ordinary way within the period of days under Article The difficulty has evidently arisen because no application to set aside the sale having been made within days the <ORG> had in the usual course made the order confirming the sale The question then is when the <ORG> entertains an application to set aside the sale after the order confirming the sale had been made but before the period of years allowed to the purchaser for applying for delivery of possession has expired whether time must be reckoned against the applicant from the date of the order of confirmation of sale or whether that order should be treated as not having the effect of making the sale absolute within the meaning of Article but that the sale should be deemed to have so become absolute from the date when the application for setting it aside was disposed of I do not think the fact that the sale was set aside in respect of some of the items included therein and upheld as regards the other items should make any difference as to the application of Article for we are not concerned with the properties the sale of which has been set aside and as regards the rest possession of which alone is sought the point for decision is whether the entertainment of the application to set aside the sale had or had not the effect of preventing the sale becoming absolute within the intendment of Article Rule has primarily in contemplation cases where the application to set aside the sale is made within the limit of days allowed by the law so that any order confirming the sale would be ordinarily made after the disposal of such applications But if the <ORG> in this case was justified and I take it that it was in entertaining the application to set aside the sale after it had made the order confirming the same can it be said that whatever be the result of the application the order confirming the sale remained effective so as to make the sale absolute from the date on which it was drawn up To my mind obviously not The effect of entertainment of the application to set aside the sale after the order of confirmation must having regard to the intention of the legislature as disclosed in this rule and quite apart from any general theory in such connections be to render the order ineffective so as to make the sale absolute If we were to proceed upon an absolutely literal interpretation of the language of Rule without paying due regard to the intention of the legislature this case would have to be treated as lying outside that rule for it requires that the order of confirmation should be made after the disposal of any application to set aside the sale Upon a proper interpretation therefore of Article read with Rule of Order XXI Civil Procedure Code I should hold that where an application is made for delivery of possession of property sold in execution of a decree the sale does not become absolute within the meaning of the third column of Article until the application made to set aside the sale under Rule or or has been disallowed and the sale upheld although an order confirming the sale had been passed before the application to set aside the sale was made It was held that the confirmation of sale dated only from the last order of August st within the meaning of Article of Act XV of which provides one year for a suit to set aside a sale for arrears of <ORG> or for any demand recoverable as such arrears from the date on which the sale is confirmed or would otherwise have become final and conclusive had no such suit been brought At page their Lordships say that they did not base their decision on the provision of Section of the Limitation Act which provides for the exclusion of the time of proceeding bona tide in <ORG> without jurisdiction but because they were of opinion that there was no final conclusive and definitive order confirming the sale while the question whether the sale should be confirmed was in litigation or until the order of the Commissioner of the th January became definitive and opera tive by the final judgment of <ORG> on the st August or in other words that for the purpose of the law of limitation there was no final or definitive confirmation of the sale until that date I do not think that much light would be obtained over the present question by discussing in detail the other rulings of <ORG> cited before us a summary of which is set out in the Order of Reference and which I also had the occasion to discuss previously in Secretary of <ORG> Raja Vadreva Ranganayakamma A Nos and of No doubt there are general observations in some of the cases such as <NAME> <NAME> I A at where it is stated It would be an inconvenient state of the law if it were found necessary for a man to institute a perfectly vain litigation under peril of losing his property if he does not or that the right of plaintiffs to bring an action to recover certain property would be suspended because of certain intermediate litigation See <NAME> <NAME> I and <NAME> <NAME> I in which his title to the property happened to be under investigation But on further consideration I am persuaded that any such deduction would be unjustified if it be meant thereby to introduce a rule of exclusion or suspension of time covering a larger ground than that traversed by Sections and other similar provisions of the Limitation Act I need hardly say that I do not desire to express any opinion on the question of limitation involved in the Appeals Nos and of as a Letters Patent Appeal is now pending from my judgment But as I have already suggested it is not necessary to attempt to deduce any rule of general application in order to answer the question which arises in this case and that the answer as I have stated should be that time should be computed from the date of the order disallowing the petition to set aside the sale and not from the date of confirmation passed before the application to set aside the sale was made That question is whether the existence of the cause of action for an application for delivery is suspended during the pendency of proceedings for the setting aside of the sale and I do not understand it as raising the distinct question whether the order of confirmation which had been passed in the case before the referring Judges had been deprived of the finality which it originally possessed In order to evade them reliance has been placed on decisions of <ORG> the effect of which was stated in the recent judgment in <NAME> Vannilinga Pillai A No of Those cases have been referred to in my order of reference as falling into three classes and I adhere to that classification in supporting the conclusion which the fuller argument we have now heard in my opinion entails that the proceedings in each case were really regarded as in time with reference not to any extension of the period available for taking them but to the adoption of a starting point for limitation which was discovered either where none had been available before or in supersession of one already in existence Thus in the first class of cases referred to those in which the plaintiff after claiming one remedy in good faith but unsuccessfully sought another to which his right was ascertained in his previous proceedings the decision in <NAME> <NAME> I A was based statedly on the fact that from the date on which an agreement to convey property in satisfaction of a debt was held unenforceable a new liability for money paid on a consideration which failed was imposed on the debtor in supersession of his liability under the agreement or for the debt and the dictum relied on here It would be an inconvenient state of the law if it were found necessary for a man to institute a perfectly vain litigation on pain of losing his property can be fairly applied as stating not any general principle but merely an argumentum ab inconvenient in connection with the reference immediately preceding it to the period during which the decree of <ORG> upholding the agreement was in force Another case in this class <NAME> <NAME> I calls for notice because there is no doubt that the judgments in it contain language in which a suspension of the running of time is referred to This principle is of course not one of limitation and its exact scope may come under discussion in another case now pending to which the reference is made in the judgment of the learned Chief Justice But <NAME> <NAME> I is material at present because consistently with it when the limitation applicable to the suit it authorises was considered in <NAME> <NAME> it was held that time ran from the date of the superseding judgment under Article not from the erroneous receipt of the payment under Article and no provision relating to suspension was relied on It has been pointed out that Section of the Limitation Act is inapplicable to the case submitted to us and no other positive provision has been relied on I would therefore answer the question referred in the negative that in the circumstances stated if time has begun to run its running is not suspended <NAME> If the time between when the application to set aside the whole sale was made and when the final order confirming part of the sale was made is deducted then the application of is within the period of three years from the date when the sale became absolute which is the date mentioned in column of Article The matter in controversy was argued in two aspects on behalf of the decree holder purchaser that even if the cause of action for the application for possession as made arose when the sale of the interests of all the judgment debtors was confirmed on in other words that even if the application for possession dated is based on the cause of action for possession of the entire interests which arose on the date when the first order of confirmation was made to put it again differently even if the time of three years began to run From itself notwithstanding that the application was for possession of a fraction of the interests sold on that date the running of time was suspended between and that a new cause of action arose on when the final order confirming the sale of the interests of some only of the Judgment debtors was made and that the time for calculation of the period of limitation for the application of arose only on Their Lordships held that limitation for the suit commenced only from the final order of the <ORG> dated because there was no conclusive and definitive order confirming the sale while the question whether the sale should be confirmed was under litigation and until the order of the Commissioner on became definitive and operative by the final judgment of <ORG> on in other words that for the purposes of the law of limitation there was no final or definitive confirmation of the sale until that date Whereas Article uses the expression when the sale is confirmed Article uses the expression when the sale becomes absolute lf on an application made to set aside the sale an order setting aside the sale in part is passed as it has been passed in this case the sale as made cannot be said to have become absolute though a formal confirmation after the expiry of days had taken place That Principle as I understand it is that whenever proceedings are being conducted between the parties bona fide in order to have their mutual rights and obligations in respect of a matter finally settled the cause of action for an application or for a suit the relief claimable wherein follows naturally on the result of such proceedings should be held to arise only on the date when those proceedings finally settle such rights and liabilities I shall refer to only one more authority the learned judges of <ORG> <ORG> not only do not rely upon Section of the Limitation Act but expressly say We feel grave doubt whether the case falls within that section But they reiy upon the principle of <ORG> decision in <NAME> <NAME> I A and hold that the right of the plaintiffs to bring an action to recover the property was suspended Between the th of April and the nd of February because on the th April they had as defendants in a former suit obtained a decree for the same relief as was claimed in their present action which decree however was reversed on the appeal filed by the plaintiffs of that suit on It is difficult to see under what provision of the Limitation Act the Court held that there was a suspension of the right of suit But as their Lordships of <ORG> have confirmed <NAME> <NAME> Madhusudan <NAME> I Cal approving generally the ratio of its decision we must hold that notwithstanding Section of the Limitation Act there are exceptional cases where such suspension even as regards the running of time on the cause of action for a suit can take place I think that in either aspect I am myself inclined to think that in the present case a new cause of action for this special application for possession of the interests in respect of which alone the sale was finally confirmed arose in the application for possession in in this case is not barred by limitation But I base that conclusion not on the ground that there is a general principle of equity apart from the statute but because in the present case the construction to be placed on the third column of Article of the first schedule is concluded by that decision They have drawn attention to Sections and of the Act and have held that exemptions not covered by these and the other sections should not be imported by <ORG> to relieve a party from the bar of limitation There are other instances of a similar kind But an appeal was taken to the <ORG> of <ORG> against his order and that body admittedly set aside the order though it had no jurisdiction to do so I shall now examine the case before us If this case were before <ORG> I make bold to say to that they would hold that the cause of action really arose only when there was a final decision on the challenge Similar explanation can be given with regard to every one of the cases which are catalogued under the first head I agree with the conclusions come to by the learned Officiating Chief Justice in the Judgment just pronounced
