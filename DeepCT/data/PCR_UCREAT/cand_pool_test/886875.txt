These are two connected applications in revision by three men who were convicted of offences under Section I According to the judgment of the lower <ORG> there is evidence that a bullock was stolen from the house of one <NAME> and that the applicants agreed to take a sum of money to return the bullock There is also evidence that they did in fact take the complainant to the jungle where they pointed out the bullock tied to a tree It is urged in these circumstances that the facts do not warrant a conviction under Section I It is said in the first place that there is no proof that the bullock was stolen because the evidence is only to the effect that the bullock was tied up during the night and was missing next morning In the circumstances of this case even if the bullock did stray at night although there is no reason for thinking that it did yet the person who tied it up in the jungle was in my opinion depriving the owner of possession of it because normally a bullock which went away would return to its owner in the ordinary course and by being tied up it would be prevented from so doing I cannot see that there is any force in this contention and there is no ruling which supports it They had strayed and they were never found and there was therefore nothing whatsoever to suggest that any person had ever taken possession of them It seems to me that the <ORG> below were entitled quite fairly to make the inference that the bullock had either been stolen or misappropriated dishonestly by some person It was certainly said in that case in which the facts were not dissimilar that criminal misappropriation could not be presumed I do not think however that in the present case there is any question of presumption It appears from the judgment that the applicants themselves promised to return the stolen bullock The second argument is that there is nothing in the record to show that the applicants had not used their best endeavours to cause the offenders to be apprehended and convicted of the offence The applicants I am informed did not make any defence on this particular charge in the sense that they gave no explanation of how they discovered the bullock and there was nothing to show one way or the other that they knew or did not know who the offender was There is not one word in the section that suggests that such knowledge is necessary It has been held by two Judges of <ORG> at Calcutta in <NAME> <NAME> A I Cal The clear meaning of the section in my judgment is that it is an offence to receive money for helping any person to recover property stolen or misappropriated and that there is an exception only in favour of a man who can show that he used all means in his power to cause the apprehension of the offender where a person is accused of any offence the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any special exception or proviso contained in the Code or in any law defining the offence is upon him and the <ORG> shall presume the absence of such circumstances I therefore hold that the burden of proving that they had used jail means in their power to bring about the apprehension of the offenders was upon the applicants in the present case and it is quite clear that they never made any attempt to discharge that burden
