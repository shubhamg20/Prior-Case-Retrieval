On October <ORG> issued three notifications one of which appointed October as the date on and from which the management and control of the said undertaking would be taken over by it Article of the Constitution confers a very wide power on <ORG> to issue directions and writs not only for the enforcement of fundamental rights but other legal rights as well The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBARAO This appeal by special leave is against the Judgment and Order dated November of <ORG> at Calcutta dismissing the petition filed by the appellant under Art The facts that have given rise to this appeal may be briefly stated <ORG> was originally constituted by a deed of settlement dated April by the name of <ORG> and it was subsequently registered in England under the provisions of the English Joint Stock Companies Act On July under an agreement entered into between <ORG> and <ORG> the latter was appointed the manager of the former <ORG> in India for a period of years from July <ORG> passed the impugned Act and it received the assent of the President on October On October <ORG> issued three notifications the first declaring that the said Act would come into force on October the second containing the rules framed under the Act and the third specifying October as the date with effect from which the State Government would take over for a period of five years the management and control of the undertaking of <ORG> for the purposes of and in accordance with the provisions of the said Act <ORG> at Calcutta for appropriate writs for restraining the State Government from giving effect to the said Act and for quashing the said notifications In the petition the appellant contested the constitutional validity of the Act on various grounds and in the counter affidavit <NAME> gave the following findings on the contentions raised before him The appellant has no legal right to maintain the petition the appellant cannot question the validity of the Act on the ground that its provisions infringed his fundamental rights under Arts A of the Constitution <ORG> had the Legislative competence to pass the impugned Act by virtue of entry of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution entry of List II also confers sufficient authority and power on <ORG> to make laws affecting gas and gas work and even if the Act incidentally trenches upon any production aspect the pith and substance of the legislation is gas and a work within the meaning of entry of List II The learned Judge rejected all the contentions of the appellant and dismissed the petition by his order dated November of the Constitution <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I <ORG> in exercise of the said power passed the Industries Development and Regulation Act by virtue of entry of said List the two entries in List II namely entries and cannot sustain the Act as entry is subject to the provisions of entry of List I and entry must be confined to matters other than those covered by entry and therefore <ORG> is not Competent to make a law regulating the gas industry Assuming that <ORG> has power to pass the Act by virtue of entry of List II under Art of the Constitution the law made by <ORG> namely the Industries Development and Regulation Act shall prevail and the law made by <ORG> namely the impugned Act be And the view of <ORG> that the validity of the Act could be sustained under entry of List III is wrong as under the impugned Act the <ORG> only takes over the management of the Company and manages it for and on behalf of the Company whereas the concept of requisition under the said entry requires that the <ORG> shall take legal possession of property of the person from whom it is requisitioned The argument of learned counsel for the respondents is that the appellant was only managing the industry and it had no proprietary right therein and therefore it could not maintain the application Article confers a very wide power on <ORG> to issue directions and writs of the nature mentioned therein for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose must ordinarily be the right of the petitioner himself who complains of infraction of such right and approaches the court for relief We do not see any reason why a different principle should apply in the case of a The questions therefore is whether in the present case the petitioner has a legal right and whether it has been infringed by the contesting respondents The petitioner entered into an agreement dated July with respondent No in regard <ORG> In its capacity as Manager the appellant Company was put in charge of the entire business and its assets in India and it was given all the incidental powers necessary for the said management Under the agreement therefore the appellant had the right to manage <ORG> for a period of years and to receive the aforesaid amounts toward its remuneration for its services Whatever may be its character by reason of of the impugned Act it was deprived of certain legal rights it possessed under the agreement Under the agreement the appellant had the right to manage the Oriental Gas <ORG> for a period of years and to receive remuneration for the same But under of the impugned Act it was deprived of that right for a period of five years There was certainly a legal right accruing to the appellant under the agreement and that was abridged if not destroyed by the impugned Act Section authorizes the <ORG> to levy and collect a cess from the industries Chapter III provides for the regulation of scheduled industries section empowers the <ORG> to make or cause to be made a fall and complete investigation of the affairs of any scheduled industry if it is of opinion that there is a likelihood of substantial fall in the volume of production or a marked deterioration in the quality of any article produced or there is likely to be a rise in the price of any article produced therein or that an undertaking is being managed in a manner highly detriment to the scheduled industry concerned and authorizes the Central <ORG> after making the said investigation to issue such directions to the industrial undertaking or undertakings concerned as may be appropriate in the circum stances in order to regulate the production of any article or articles and fix the standards of production to require it to take such steps to stimulate the development of the industry to prohibit from resorting to any act or practice which might reduce its production capacity or economic value or to control the prices or regulate the distribution of articles produced therein Chapter III A confers power an the Central <ORG> to assume management or control of an industrial undertaking in certain cases section A enables it to take control of an industrial undertaking and inter alia provides that on the issue of the notified order under A all persons in charge of management including persons holding office as managers or directors of the industrial undertaking immediately before the issue of the notified order shall be deemed to have vacated their offices as such and that any contract of management between the industrial undertaking and any managing agent or any director thereof holding office as such immediately before the issue of the notified order shall be deemed to have been terminated and the person or persons appointed under the Act shall be empowered to take over the management and conduct the affairs of the Company in the place of the previous management Briefly stated the Central Act declares that it is expedient in the public interest to take under its control the scheduled industries its provisions are designed to provide for the development and regulation of the said industries it enables the Central <ORG> for the purpose of promoting and regulating the said industries to investigate into the affairs of an undertaking to regulate its production supply and distribution arid if necessary to take over the management of the undertaking Its preamble says that it was thought expedient to provide for the increase of the production of gas and improving the quality thereof for supply to industrial undertakings hospitals and other wel fare institutions to local authorities for street lighting and to the public in general for domestic consumption and for that purpose to provide for the taking over for a limited period of the management and control and the subsequent acquisition of the undertaking Sections and provide for payment of compensation for taking over the said management Notwithstanding anything in clauses and Parliament has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the Union List the <ORG> of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the State List Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest The power to legislate is given to the appropriate Legislatures by Art It is also well settled that widest amplitude should be given to the language of the entries <ORG> in that case held that the entry taxes on the sale of goods was not covered by the entry duties of excise and in coming to that conclusion the learned Chief Justice observed Here are two separate enactments each in one aspect conferring the power to impose a tax upon goods and it would accord with sound principles of construction to take the more general power that which extends to the whole of India as subject to an exception created by the particular power that which extends to the provinced only But the underlying principle in the two cases must be the same that a general power ought not to be so construed as to make a nullity of a particular power conferred by the same Act and operating in the same field when by reading the former in a more restricted sense effect can be given to the latter in its ordinary and natural meaning Having regard to the aforesaid principle while giving the widest scope to both the entries we shall adopt the interpretation which reconciles and harmonizes them try in entry of List II Is it different from the meaning of that expression in entry of List I Whatever may be its connotation it must bear the same meaning in both the entries for the two entries are so interconnected that conflicting or different meanings given to them would snap the connection Entry is subject to the provisions of entry and entry of List I Entry of List I provides for industries declared by <ORG> by law to be necessary for the purpose of defence or for the prosecution of war and entry for industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest There is therefore an apparent conflict between the two entries and they overlap each other If industry in entry is interpreted to include gas and gas works entry may become redundant and in the context of the succeeding entries namely entry dealing with trade and commerce and entry dealing with production supply and distribution of goods it will be deprived of all its contents and reduced to useless lumber Article authorizes the <ORG> to legislate for two or more <ORG>s if <ORG> of those <ORG>s give their consent to the said course In this view the alternative argument advanced on behalf of the <ORG> namely that the impugned Act was made by virtue of entry and entry of List III need not be considered We have expressed the view that the <ORG> of a State has the exclusive power to make law in respect of gas industry by virtue of entry of List II and that entry does not comprehend gas industry
