It is urged on behalf of the appellant that the District Judge is wrong in holding the office the subject of this suit to be a religious office and therefore extra commercium In the present case however it has been admitted by the second respondent himself that the office is saleable and as a matter of fact first defendant by whom it was sold to appellant acquired his right to it by purchase Under these circumstances I do not think that second defendant objection is sustainable and I would in allowance of this appeal set aside the decree of the lower <ORG> and restore that of the District Munsif and direct second defendant to pay plaintiff costs both in the lower <ORG> and in this <ORG> As the second defendant alone appealed the decree should not have been reversed when it was found that he had no interest in the subject matter of the suit Neither first defendant nor defendants to appeared before <ORG> to raise the question as to the inalienability of the office in question
