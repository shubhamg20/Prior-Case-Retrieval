These appeals by special leave arise from the judgment of <ORG> dated December made i A Nos and of The admitted facts are that the respondents had entered into an agreement with the appellant to construct inter connecting tunnels for <ORG> as per specification No Schedule to the agreement lakhs was paid to the respondent On a notice issued by the respondent for appointment of an arbitrator in terms of clause of the contract arbitrator clause there was a delay on the part of the appellant i nomination of the arbitrator When the respondent exercised the power after expiry of the time prescribed in the notice appointing a sole arbitrator proceedings under Section of the Arbitrator Act were initiated by the appellant One of the objections raised by the appellant in the proceedings under Section was that under the terms of the contract the claim sought to be put up in the notice given by the respondent was not arbitrable Therefore the first stipulation is dependent upon the Arbitrators deciding as to whether particular dispute would come within the scope of Section or not and only if they consider that it falls within the scope of Arbitration clause they would have the jurisdiction to decide the same Pursuant thereto condoning the delay liberty was given to the appellant to nominate an Arbitrator on its behalf which accordingly was done and dispute was referred to arbitration At this stage it is relevant to mention that some of the claims made by the respondents relate to excavation of hard rock in the tunnel and the rate of claims Against the claims objections were raised by the appellant The respondent filed an application to make the award the rule of the court He reached the conclusion whether or not the dispute or the claim is arbitrable and obviously he was of the opinion that all the claims are arbitrable and he is empowered to decide it either rightly or wrongly When the arbitrator had given a consolidated sum towards all the claims it would mean that he had considered the arbitrability of some of the claims in terms of the contract and that therefore he has not committed any error in reaching that conclusion which is apparent on the face of the record In the absence of any specific reference for deciding that dispute even if incidentally he reaches that decision he gets the jurisdiction and power to decide the question he gets the otherwise also the award cannot be assailed the ground that he reached a wrong decision without any reasons in support thereof Once he specifies the amount to which the respondent is entitled it must be deemed that he had taken into consideration the arbitrability of all the claims including the claim relating to non arbitrability of some of the items and had given the award Thereby consolidated sum in the award is not subject to attack that the award made by the Arbitrator is vitiated by any error of jurisdiction or error of law apparent on the face of the record <NAME> further contends that the contract of arbitration is not part of the record and the umpire had not referred to the agreement as part of the award and that therefore it is not open to the court to look into the contract to find out whether the contractor claimed at the rates higher than what were contracted and the umpire has omitted to consider the non arbitrability of the claims in respect of some of the items In view of the respective contentions the question that arises for consideration is whether the <ORG> was required to give a decision supported by reasons on the non arbitrability of some of the items in terms of the contract It is already seen that the <ORG> prior to the proceedings under Section had gone into the question as to the right of the appellant to question the arbitrability of some of the items and had expressly recorded as seen hereinbefore that if any objection regarding the dispute is raised either parties is at liberty to raise the same and avail of decision by the arbitrator and the arbitrator is required to decide the arbitrability of the claim and if he considers that it falls within the scope of the arbitration clause arbitrability then he would have the jurisdiction to decide the same In the light of the above facts the question arises whether the arbitrator was not obliged to decide the non arbitrability of some of the items claimed by the respondents before while giving a non speaking award and whether a deemed decision could be given credence If this issue specifically raises a question as to jurisdiction of the arbitrator to arbitrate upon the dispute set out in Point No it appears to have been specifically referred to the arbitrator for his decision Then only he gets the jurisdiction to go into the merits This ratio clearly establishes that the arbitrator gets jurisdiction to decide the dispute on merits only when he is specifically called upon to decide the dispute in terms of the contract We find it difficult to agree with this submission for two reasons Firstly the award is not a totally non speaking one inasmuch as it gives as resume of the incentive scheme and the agreement between the parties as also the items of the claim made by the respondent Secondly if there is any challenge to the award on the ground that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to make the award with regard to a particular item inasmuch as it was beyond the scope of reference the only way to test the correctness of such a challenge is to look into the agreement itself In our opinion looking into the agreement for this limited purpose is neither tantamount to going into the evidence produced by the parties nor into the reason which weighted with the arbitrator in making the award a Bench of three judges to which both of us were members had gone into the question whether the arbitrator can go into the question whether there emerged any concluded contract and whether he can get exclusive jurisdiction to decide that question by himself In an application under Section the learned Single Judge of <ORG> had held that the arbitrator has exclusive jurisdiction to decide that question In para it is held thus The clear settled law thus is that the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement shall be decided by the court alone Arbitrators therefore have no power of jurisdiction to decide or adjudicate conclusively by themselves the question since it is the very foundation on which the arbitrators proceed to adjudicate the disputes Therefore it is rightly pointed out by <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant that they had by mistake agreed for reference and that arbitrators cold not decide the existence of the arbitration agreement or arbitrability of the disputes without prejudice to their stand that no valid agreement existed We find no force in the contention when he enlarged his scope of award in a non speaking award can conclusively decide the dispute and give an award in that behalf It was held in paragraph that To constitute an arbitration agreement there must be an agreement that is to say the parties must be ad idem The arbitrator had no power to decide his own jurisdiction The arbitrator is always entitled to inquire whether or not he has jurisdiction to decide the dispute He can refuse to deal with the matter at all and leave the parties to go to the court if he comes to the conclusion that he has no power to deal with the matter or he can consider the matter and if he forms the view that the contract upon which the claimant is relying on and from which if established he alone has jurisdiction he can proceed to the decide the dispute accordingly Whether or not the arbitrator has jurisdiction and whether the matter is referred to or is within the ambit of clause for reference of any difference of dispute which may arise between the parties it is for the court to decide it Therein it was held that An error in law on the face of the award means in their Lordships view that you can find in the award or a document actually incorporated thereto as for instance a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reason for his judgment some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which you can then say is erroneous But there is a distinction between an error apparent on the face of the award and jurisdictional error in passing the award It was stated thus An award may be remitted or set aside on the ground that the arbitrator in making it had exceeded this jurisdiction and evidence of matters not appearing on the face of it will be admitted in order to establish whether the jurisdiction had been exceeded or not because the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside the award whatever might be said about it in the award or by the arbitrator It has to be determined that there is a distinction between dispute as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that jurisdiction should be exercised It has indeed several times been said bluntly that an arbitrator has no power to decide his own jurisdiction and in one case where rules of an institution the arbitrator such power the court will ignore this when asked to enforce the award and decide the question itself However an arbitrator is always entitled to inquire whether or not he has jurisdiction In Law of Arbitration by <NAME> nd Edition at pages it is stated thus An arbitrator cannot by mistake assume jurisdiction over a matter on which he has no jurisdiction If the arbitrator decides a dispute which is beyond the scope of his reference or beyond the subject matter of the reference or he makes the award disregarding the terms of reference or the arbitration agreement or terms of the contract it would jurisdictional error beyond the scope of reference he cannot clothe himself to decide conclusively that dispute as it is an error of jurisdiction which requires to be ultimately decided by the court It may be stated that we do not accept the broad contention of <NAME> that whatever is not excluded specifically by the contract can be subject matter of claim by a contractor When a specific reference has been made to the arbitrator and the parties raise the dispute of arbitrability with the leave of the court by a direction of the court in a proceedings under Section he is to decide the arbitrability of the dispute and make a decision of the arbitrability the dispute and make a decision while giving reasons in support thereof In this case in view of the finding recorded by the court which has become final as referred to earlier the arbitrator umpire was enjoined to decide the arbitrabilty of the claims set up by the respondent and disputed by the appellant He has further stated that after considering all the above aspects and the question of arbitrability or non arbitrability he had made the award on certain aspects It could be seen that if the arbitrator has indicated his mind in the award that he in fact adverted to the arbitrability or non arbitrability of the claim and then made the award it would be indicative of the fact that he had in fact applied his mind considered that question and reached the decision in awarding certain amounts by a non speaking award including the claim in respect of which arbitrability was in issue The Constitution Bench had pointed out in para thus We do not appreciate the contention urged on behalf of the parties who contend that it should be made obligatory on the part of the arbitrator to give reason for the award that there is no justification to leave the small area covered by the law of arbitration out of the general rule that the decision of every judicial and quasi judicial body should be supported by reasons But at the same time it has to be borne in mind that what applies generally to settlement of disputes by authorities governed by public law need not be extended to all cases arising under private law such as those arising under the law of arbitration which is intended for settlement of private disputes It was held thus The trappings of a body which discharges judicial functions and required to act in accordance with law with their concomitant obligations for reasoned decisions are not attracted to a private adjudication of the nature of arbitration as the latter as we have noticed earlier is not supposed to exert the <ORG> sovereign judicial power On the other hand on merits it was contended that there was an error in that behalf In para it was held that it was then contended that the award has purported to grant damages on the basis of escalation of cost and prices and such escalation was not a matter within the domain of the bargain between the parties and having taken that factor into consideration the award was bad Therefore the ratio there is an authority supporting the contention on the need of an arbitrator to give a reasoned decision on arbitrability of the contract or claim in dispute In this regard Section of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act provides thus The arbitral award shall state the reasons upon which it is based unless a the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given or the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms under Section The <ORG> has expressed the legislative judgement that the award shall state reasons upon which it is based unless parties have agreed otherwise or the award is covered on agreed terms under Section of the new Act In other words unless a the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given or the award is an arbitral award on agreed terms under Section of the new Act the award should state the reasons in support of determination of the liability non liability We have set out the relevant portions of the award From a reading thereof it is clear that the arbitrator had considered the claims made on the basis of escalation and damages in a non speaking award of the disputes consisting of arbitrable and non arbitrable claims He awarded a lumpsum amount of Rs It is well settled that in the matter of challenge to the award there are two distinct and different grounds viz that there is an error apparent on the face of the record and that the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction In the case of jurisdictional error there is no embargo on the power of the court to admit the contract into evidence and to consider whether or not the umpire had exceeded the jurisdiction because the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside the award whatever might be said about it in the award or by the arbitrator Only in a speaking award the court can look into the reasoning in the award and correct wrong proposition of law or error of law It is not open to the court to probe the mental process of the arbitrator and speculate when no reasons have been given by the arbitrator as to what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at his conclusion In fact in <ORG> case having noticed that the arbitrator had exceeded his jurisdiction to grant amount de hors the terms of the contract and being a non speaking award the court was unable to speculate as to what extent the award was within the terms of the contract or claims made and to what extent the amount awarded was in respect of non arbitrable dispute On the other hand the contention of <NAME> is that in the event of the conclusion that the arbitrator has exceeded his jurisdiction the entire award would become invalid and it has to be set at naught Having given due consideration to the respective contentions we find force in the contention of Mr <NAME> We find no force in the contention
