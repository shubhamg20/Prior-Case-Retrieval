being polluted by the discharged of sludge or slurry into it from the washeries of the respondent company On a perusal of the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent Nos and it appears that the petitioner has been purchasing slurry from the respondent Nos and for the last several years These petitions were dismissed on the ground of existence of dispute relating to the title of the land In order to feed fat his personal grudge he has taken several proceedings against the respondent company including the present proceedings Infact there is intrinsic evidence in the petition

allowed by this Court and judgment of <ORG> was set aside SC wherein it has been held that the slurry coal deposited on any and continues to be coal and the State Government has no authority in law to deal with the same and the slurry deposited on the Company land belongs to the Company and no other person had authority to collect the same It provides for an extraordinary procedure to safeguard the
