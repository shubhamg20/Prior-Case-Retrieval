This petition raises a short but interesting question of section of the Income tax Act The question is whether a certain intimation received by the Income tax Officer expressing the opinion of the audit department as to the correct interpretation of section could be said to constitute information on which the Income tax Officer could act for the purpose of initiating proceedings for reassessment against the petitioner under section in arriving at the annual value of the properties under section for the purpose of computing the income of the petitioner under the head Income from house property The petitioner by his letter in reply dated th July pointed out to the Income tax Officer that it was not competent to him to reopen the assessment of the petitioner under section and that in any event the amount of municipal taxes was validly allowed as a deduction in computing the income from self occupied properties The Income tax Officer however did not seem to be satisfied with the explanation given by the petitioner and he therefore issued a notice dated th September to the petitioner under section stating that whereas he had reason to believe that the income of the petitioner chargeable to tax for the assessment year had escaped assessment within the meaning of section he proposed to reassess the income for the said assessment year and requiring the petitioner to file a return of his income for the said assessment year within thirty days from the date of receipt for the said assessment year within thirty days from the date of receipt of the notice The petitioner thereupon filed the present petition challenging the validity of this notice issued by the Income tax Officer He also proceeded to state the information in consequence of which according to him he had reason to believe that the income of the petitioner had escaped assessment This intimation received from the audit department according to the Income tax Officer constituted information within the meaning of section and in consequence of this information the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that by reason of wrong allowance of deduction of municipal taxes the income of the petitioner for the assessment year had escaped assessment His case therefore was that the conditions precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction to issue the impugned notice under section read with section were fulfilled and the impugned notice was a valid notice The main question which therefore arises for consideration is whether there was any information in the possession of the Income tax Officer in consequence of which he could be said to have reason to believe that the income of the petitioner had escaped assessment so as to attract the applicability of section It is clear from the language of section that the assessment or reassessment of the escaped income of an assessee under that sub section can be made by the Income tax Officer only if the Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that such income has escaped assessment Two conditions must be satisfied before the Income tax Officer can take action under section i the Income tax Officer should receive information after the original assessment and ii in consequence of such information he should reasonably believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment The contention of Mr <NAME> learned advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner was that the first condition was not satisfied in the present case since the intimation received by the Income tax Officer from the audit department did not constitute information within the meaning of section and there was accordingly no information received by the Income tax Officer in consequence of which he could be said to have reason to believe that income of the petitioner chargeable to tax had escaped assessment that information in the context in which it occurs in section must mean instruction or knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particular or a to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment Now as soon as it is said that information must be derived from an external source the question immediately arises Would it suffice if it is received from any source If an opinion as to the state of the law is expressed by any person and the Income tax Officer come to know about it would it constitute information which would entitle the Income tax Officer to disturb the finality of an assessment and reopen it The argument of the learned Advocate General on behalf of the revenue was that there was no limitation on the nature or character of the external source from which communication as to the state of the law may be derived by the Income tax Officer and we would be rewriting the section if we sought to read any such limitation in it Mr <NAME> on behalf of the petitioner however contended that instruction or knowledge as to the state of the law must be received form some judicial authority such as <ORG> or <ORG> which is competent to declare the law and whose decisions have the effect of binding precedents if it is received from any other external source it would not be information a to the state of the law within the meaning of section We are concerned in this petition only with clause and we shall therefore confine our attention only to that clause The condition precedent on the fulfilment of which alone Income tax Officer can reopen the assessment of an assessee under clause of section is that in consequence of information in his possession the Income tax Officer should have reason to believe that any income of the assessee has escaped assessment He must receive some information subsequent to the assessment and in consequence of that information he should have reason to believe that income of the assessee has escaped assessment But the Income tax Officer cannot reopen an assessment under section unless he receives information from an external source which leads him to believe that income of the assessee has escaped tax Could it be aid in such a case that the former Income tax Officer has received information as to the correct state of the law which would entitle him to reopen the assessment There may be a case where the Income tax Officer realise from some expression of opinion by an income tax lawyer at a seminar or by reason of an argument advanced by an Income tax lawyer in the case of another assessee that the view taken by him in regard to the interpretation of a section was wrong Could it be said that he has received information so as to entitle him to take action under section The view canvassed by the learned Advocate General on behalf of the revenue if taken to its logical end would mean that even in cases such as these the Income tax officer would be entitled to reopen the assessment The dividing line between the mere change of opinion on the part of the Income tax officer and information received from an external source would become blurred Moreover if opinion of any other person can be regarded as sufficient to warrant initiation of proceedings for reopening an assessment it is difficult to imagine why change of opinion on the part of the Income tax officer himself should not be so regarded by the legislature It cannot be a mere opinion of some one who has no authority to pronounce upon the law When we say this we must of course make it clear that we do not accept the argument of Mr <NAME> on behalf of the petitioner that instruction or knowledge as to the correct state of the law can be derived only from a judicial decision of <ORG> or <ORG> Some argument was advanced before us that the even a decision given by a <ORG> on a question of law may constitute information But on this argument also we do not wish to express any opinion It is not possible nor even expedient to formulate a precise definition exclusive or inclusive which would aptly cover all cases where intimation received by the Income tax officer as to the correct state of the law may be regarded as information But one thing appears to us to be fairly clear that opinion as to the state of the law by any and every person cannot constitute information so as to entitle the Income tax Officer to reopen the assessment What ever be the precise point at which a line may be drawn to distinguish opinions as to the correct state of the law which fall within the category of information from those which fall outside it it is clear that the opinion of the audit department as to the correct state of the law of falls on the wrong side of the line We according to allow the petition and make the rule absolute by issuing a writ of mandamus quashing and setting aside the notice dated th September issued by the Income Tax Officer under section of act The respondent will pay the costs of the petition to the petitioner
