A Bombay Bench had expressed the opinion that it would while a Madras Bench had held that Section A would apply only to expenditure on interest incurred after Before the Commissioner Appeals the assessee raised an additional ground challenging the disallowance under Section A on the ground that Section A having been introduced with effect from would therefore be applicable to expenditure incurred on payment of interest on deposits from that date and not to interest paid prior to that date and as the assessee previous year relating to the assessment year ended on provisions of Section A were inapplicable to this year At the hearing before us the learned counsel for the assessee again relied on the aforesaid decision of the Tribunal Madras Bench and emphasized that provisions of Section A operate only in respect of expenditure on interest incurred after It was emphasized by the departmental representative that there was nothing in the aforesaid amendment or the Notes on clauses or in the memorandum to suggest that previous year had any relevance and that it was clear that disallowance of per cent of the interest was to be made out of expenditure on interest incurred in the assessment year irrespective of different previous years followed by the diverse assessees It was further urged that it was an elementary principle of income tax law that the law to be applied is that in force in the assessment year and it is immaterial what previous year the assessee follows We will refer to these decisions later As the Finance Act come into force on the first day of April each year therefore the law to apply is the law in force at the commencement of the year of assessment i the first day of April each year ITR declined to allow retrospective operation to be given to fourth proviso to Section vii inserted by the Income tax Amendment Act which had been brought into force on The assessee by certain deeds of trust and settlement dated had settled properties on his daughters with a provision reserving to himself powers to revoke the settlements and the question was whether for the assessment year the income of accounting year derived from such assets was assessable under Section and the assessee urged that only transfers effected after were hit by Section but <ORG> repelled that contention and held that the law as amended would apply to the assessee To the same effect is the decision of <ORG> in CIT <ORG> ITR where it was held that law and statutory rules applicable for determining an assessment are the law and statutory rules in force for the year of assessment and not those which were in force during the accounting year the income of which is sought to be assessed <ORG> in <NAME> case supra while dealing with double taxation relief under India Burmah Income tax Relief Order held that the law to apply to the claim of the assessee in this case was the law as it stood in the year of assessment namely It was observed that only where there was a change in law even within the course of the assessment year it was the law in force at the commencement of the assessment year that should apply in the absence of any statutory provision to the contrary They rejected the contention that as the Constitution of India had come into force only on the income of the previous year before was not taxable to Indian Income tax However dealing with amendment coming into force after st April they observed Any amendments in the Act which comes into force after the first day of April of a financial year would not apply to the assessment for that year even if the assessment is actually made after the amendments come into force <ORG> explained that its earlier decision in <ORG> case supra had laid down that the amended Act as on st April applied to assessment year and accounting year had no relevance and that though subject of charge was income of the previous year law to be applied was that in force in the assessment year The <ORG> came to this conclusion on analysing the language of Section A as well as the amendment introduced by the Finance Act which according to <ORG> intended the revised percentages to be applicable only prospectively from The first argument is that though there is nothing in Section A to say that the amount disallowed under that Section shall be deemed to be the income of the assessee but the said Section by implication treated the disallowed expenditure on interest as part of the income It was admitted that Section A was introduced by the Finance Act with effect from the assessment year thus giving one year advance notice still it was claimed that sufficient notice was not given to the assessees to arrange their affairs Though the revenue contended that the <ORG> was competent even to retrospectively amend the law and thus assess income which had already accrued in the earlier years the assessee urged that for retrospective legislation there must be specific intention expressed by the <ORG> and that in the present case there was no express declaration of such intention by the <ORG> We have given very careful and anxious consideration to this matter and we find ourselves unable to accept the assessee contentions There is no warrant for equating the disallowed expenditure on interest with deemed income When the <ORG> has full and plenary powers even to make laws retrospective in operation we do not see anything wrong with the <ORG> introducing Section A by the Finance Act and making it effective only one year later i from which would thus be operative in the assessment year Similarly <ORG> in <NAME> case supra at observed It was contended by the learned counsel for the assessee that Section iii came into force on April while the previous year relevant to the assessment year in question was from October to September Section iii therefore did not apply to the case We are unable to accept <NAME> contention that there was any ambiguity regarding the applicability of provisions of Section A or that the applicability of the said provisions to the assessment year would lead to manifestly absurd and anomalous results When the intention of the <ORG> is clear and unequivocal there is no room for trying to go behind the clear language of the Section at under Chapter Construction where the meaning is plain under the heading Meaning and legal effect distinguished observes There is no place for interpretation or construction except where the words of the statute admit of two meanings As <NAME> said Where the words of an Act of <ORG> are clear there is no room for applying any of the principles of interpretation which are merely presumptions in cases of ambiguity in the statute The words themselves alone do in such a case best declare the intention of the law giver at pages under the heading Rule to determine tax liability noted that the Lord <NAME> observed in <NAME> Attorney General LR HL As I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation it is this if the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be At under the head Literal construction of words used the author observed It is no doubt true that in construing fiscal statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax one must have regard to the strict letter of the law and not merely to the spirit of the statute or the substance of the law If the revenue satisfies the <ORG> that the case falls strictly within the provisions of the law the subject can be taxed There is no room for any intendment Thus the rules of interpretation of statutes are quite emphatic that where the language of a statute is clear effect should be given to it however hard the case of the taxpayer may appear to be According to us the provisions of Section A do not lead to any absurd or anomalous results and the intention of the <ORG> is quite clear that the said provisions are to apply in the assessment year and therefore the said provisions would apply irrespective of the fact as to which previous year the particular assessee follows and so long as the previous year followed by the assessee would be relevant for the assessment year the provisions of Section A would apply to that particular assessee Therefore the submission of <NAME> that an assessee should be given adequate notice to arrange his affairs though legally not correct is still factually invalid because the <ORG> did give one year advance notice to the assessees to arrange their affairs The <ORG> has plenary powers to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively and there is no limitation on the <ORG> power to direct from which date a particular fiscal provision would operate It is true that in some cases the <ORG> does specify a date from which date the said provision is to come into force For example under Section A in respect of disallowance of payment of Rs We cannot arrogate to ourselves the power to sit in judgment over the wisdom of introducing a particular fiscal provision with effect from a particular assessment year and we have to give effect to the clear legislative intention as expressed by the <ORG> through the amendment to the Act He upheld the <ORG> action in applying Section A which finding according to us was unnecessary as there was no controversy regarding the disallowance of expenses of Rs and therefore it is immaterial whether Section or proviso to Section A applies in the case of director employees and had given a note that the medical expenses reimbursed to the employees and directors had not been considered as perquisite while computing the aforesaid disallowance The Special Bench observed that the words any payment again is wide enough to cover every payment made by the employer to the employee irrespective of the context in which or the purpose for which the payment is made In other words it would also include a payment made by the employer to the employee which is in the nature of payment made for reimbursement of expenses The Bench then arrived at the conclusion that salary as defined in Explanation includes every cash payment due to or received by an employee He relied on <ORG> order in the assessee case for the assessment year where the Bench had held in paragraphs and a that cash reimbursement made by the assessec company to its employees was not hit by Section A in case of employees and by Section in the case of directors and employee directors <ORG> held that amount paid by way of bonus and commission in cash by the assessee company to employees was not a perquisite within the meaning of Section i in view of the said term whether convertible into money or not used in the said Section which was operative in the assessment year An interpretation Clause is not meant to prevent the word receiving its ordinary popular and natural sense whenever that would be properly applicable but to enable the word as used in the Act when there is nothing in the context or the subject matter to the contrary to be applied to some things to which it would not ordinarily be applicable Reliance was also placed on CGT Dr <NAME> ITR at where <ORG> extracted the observations of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> AIR SC to the effect that there must be compelling words in the statute to show a meaning different from or in excess of the ordinary meaning was intended and where within the framework of the ordinary acceptation of a word every single requirement of the definition Clause was fulfilled it would be wrong to take the definition as destroying the essential meaning of that word We see merit in the revenue contentions While definitions of sa<NAME>ry and perquisite in Section are inclusive in Exp<NAME>nation to Section A an exclusive and exhaustive definition of perquisite was given as per C<NAME>use covering only five categories enumerated therein but in respect of sa<NAME>ry the inclusive definition of Section was adopted which means that what is not covered by five categories of perquisite would fall in the net of sa<NAME>ry in view of sa<NAME>ry inclusive definition in Section Applying the above principle we have to avoid an interpretation which would make the provisions of Section A ineffective in curbing the mischief which the <ORG> intended This is a comprehensive provision by virtue of which all payments made by an employer to an employee whether made in pursuance of a legal obligation or voluntarily are brought under profits in lieu of salary ITR where it was held that house rent allowance paid by the employer company to its employee was a perquisite and the words whether convertible into money or not qualifying the words beneftt amenity or perquisite would not exclude cash payments by the employer to the employee and a contrary construction accepted by the Karnataka Calcutta and Madras High Courts was irrational defeating the very purpose of Section a The Kerala High Court therefore held that house rent allowance received by an employee from an employer was covered by Section a This Clause was substituted by Section a with effect from which put a further ceiling of Rs Thus before there was no controversy whether an expenditure was covered by salary or perquisite We have already noted above the view taken by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra that Section by giving inclusive definition of profits in lieu of salary appearing in Section iv covered in its Sub clause ii any payment due to or received by an employee from an employer For the above reasons we see no ground to depart from the view taken by <ORG> Bombay in <ORG> case supra We may further observe that the position under Section is clearly against the assessee as the above argument is not available to the assessee because the word perquisite does not appear in Section i which only uses the words remuneration or benefit or amenity Under these circumstances the reimbursement of medical expenses to a director by employer company would clearly be hit by Section i because it is an expenditure which results directly or indirectly in the provision of remuneration or benefit or amenity to a director of Mrs <NAME> wife of chairman of board of directors of the assessee company was disallowed by the <ORG> after observing that the assessee was unable to produce any resolution of board of directors to sanction the said visit by the wife who accompanied her husband on the foreign visit and thus according to the <ORG> there was no evidence that her visit served the business interest of the assessee company In the second case <ORG> was considering the case of a director of a company keeping indifferent health and his wife accompanying him on the foreign tour We accordingly uphold the orders of lower authorities on this point
