The appellant thereupon filed an application under Art Having so held <ORG> proceeded to observe that the petitioner would gain nothing if it was further held that the subsequent review by the President was equally invalid on the ground that no opportunity was given to the appellant If the <ORG> deems it proper to reconsider that order then the appellant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity of hearing and of adequately representing big case By the same order of reinstatement a further direction was given that the appellant should be paid full salary men allowance and increment from the date of his suspension till the date of reinstatement after adjusting the amount already paid The President by his order dated February reviewed the matter and modified his earlier order made on appeal by providing that the appellant would be entitled only to subsistence allowance for the period of his suspension After the said order the appellant is said to have made several representations to the President the <ORG> but reconsideration of the order dated February was declined and it was reiterated that the appellant was entitled only to subsistence allowance during the period of suspension The appellant thereupon filed an application under Arts and of the Constitution in <ORG> at Patna in which it was contended on his behalf that the President of <ORG> could not modify the earlier order dated April without giving to the petitioner an adequate opportunity of being heard <ORG> considered this argument to be without merit because according to an earlier Bench decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> Patna the President of <ORG> as appellate authority was empowered only to direct reinstatement of a dismissed teacher and had no jurisdiction to make any order with regard to the payment of any arrears due to him Though the correctness of this decision was questioned before <ORG> by the counsel representing the appellant in that Court the Bench hearing the writ petition did not consider it to be a fit case for reference to a larger bench to re examine the view taken in the case of <NAME> supra Having so hold <ORG> proceeded to observe that the petitioner would gain nothing if it was further held that the subsequent order of the President dated January modifying the earlier order of April was held invalid on the ground that no opportunity of hearing was given to the appellant In this connection the appellant learned counsel drew our attention to of the rules governing the service conditions of teachers in <ORG> framed as per Government resolution dated September In case the Managing Committee violates these rules or fails to carry out the orders and instructions of <ORG> or give effect to the decisions of the <ORG> the <ORG> shall have the right to withdraw recognition of the school or suspend the grant or take such other action or actions as it may think fit According to the submission <ORG> is bound to carry out the orders and instructions of the Board and if the orders dated February and January are not quashed <ORG> may feel reluctant to ignore them Ordinarily <ORG> as a whole has the power to suspend the teacher but in cases of urgency the Secretary in consultation with the President may suspend a teacher but this bust be approved by <ORG> within a fortnight On behalf of the respondents <NAME> appearing for the State of Bihar and <ORG> did not challenge the view taken by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra as represented before us <ORG> might well take a different view and feel that the orders passed by the President of <ORG> reviewing the earlier order dated April having not been specifically quashed and set aside by <ORG> are still operative demanding compliance It is not stated before us that the order dated April was ever got set aside by <ORG> or even assailed by it in appropriate proceedings but we express no considered opinion on that question the same having not been can vassed before us In our view the only just and fair order to be made in these proceedings is to allow this appeal set aside the impugned order of the the <ORG> as also the order made by the President of <ORG> dated February reviewing his earlier order dated April along with the subsequent order of the President of the <ORG> dated January rejecting the appellant representation and reiterating the order that he should be paid subsistence allowance only during his sus pension period If the <ORG> deems it proper to reconsider that order then the appellant must be afforded a reasonable opportunity of hearing and of adequately representing his case This rule embodies the principle of natural justice requiring the appellate authority to hear the parties There is no express provision for review in the rules to which our attention was drawn We are however clear that if the order dated April is to be reconsidered then the appellant must be afforded adequate opportunity of hearing and presenting his case This unwritten right of hearing is fundamental to a just decision by any authority which decides a controversial issue affecting the rights of the rival contestants This right has its roots in the notion of fair procedure It draws the attention of the party concerned to the imperative necessity of not overlooking the other side of the case before coming to its decision for nothing is more likely to conduce to just and right decision than the practice of giving hearing to the affected parties We also express no opinion on the question of the correctness or otherwise of the view taken by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra nor do we express any opinion about the the and effect of referred to above or of any other rule or rules which may be attracted to the appellant case The appellant is entitled to his costs from the contesting respondents
