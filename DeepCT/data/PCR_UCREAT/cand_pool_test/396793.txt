It does not seem have been intended by the <ORG> that any appeal should be entertained against an order made under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure and this will in general prevent an examination of the view taken by the Subordinate Judge of the cause or ground shown under Section on which he has based his assent or refusal to file an award As his decision is thus clothed with finality there is the strongest reason on the principle laid down in the beginning of the judgment just referred to why <ORG> should scrutinize with care from the point of view of its legality the exercise by a Subordinate Judge of a power of so great consequence The Subordinate Judge indeed did not think it did he relied on the arbitrators having as such an implied power to deal with the costs It is certain however that they could not in a private arbitration have such a power unless it was given to them and it must be taken that their award was open to the objection raised by the applicant <NAME>
