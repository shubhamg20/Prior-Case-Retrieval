Section of the Act provided that no appeal arising from a suit or a proceeding instituted or commenced whether prior or subsequent to the enforcement of the Act shall lie to the <ORG> from a judgment and order of one Judge of the <ORG> made in exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made by a court subject to the superintendence of the <ORG> anything to the contrary contained in cl of the Letters Patent of Her Majesty dated th March read with cls of the <ORG> Amalgamation Order of or in any law notwithstanding In appeal by certificate to this <ORG> the question for decision was whether there was an appeal pending before the <ORG> on November i tile date immediately preceding the date of the enforcement of Act of HELD In considering the question as to the maintainability of an appeal when the court fee paid was insufficient to start with but the deficiency was made good later on the provisions of the <ORG> Fees Act and the Code of Civil Procedure have to be read together to form a harmonious whole and no effort should be made to give precedence to provisions in one over those of the other unless the express words of a statute clearly override there of the other Although there is no definition of the word appeal in the Code of Civil Procedure it can be instituted by filing a memorandum of appeal as provided in of the Code But if it is not rejected and time is given to the appellant to make up the deficiency and this opportunity is availed of of the Code which expressly provides that the document is to have validity with retrospective effect as if the deficiency had been made good in the first instance comes into play Appeal from the judgment and decree dated August of <ORG> in Special Appeal No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> In this appeal by certificate granted by <ORG> the only question is whether Special Appeal No of of that court was maintainable in view of the provisions of the Act XIV of abolishing such appeals The said Act styled the High Court Abolition of Let ters Patent Appeals Act came into force on th November Section of the Act provided as follows No appeal arising from a suit or proceeding instituted or commenced whether prior or subsequent to the enforcement of this Act shall lie to <ORG> from a judgment and order of one Judge of the <ORG> made in exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made by a court subject to the superintendence of <ORG> anything to the contrary contained in clause ten of the Letters Patent of Her Majesty dated the th March read with Clause of the High Courts Amal gamation Order or in any law not with standing There was some doubt as to whether the court fee paid in respect of the memorandum at the date of its presentment was sufficient The question before us is whether there was an appeal pending before <ORG> on th November i the date immediately preceding the date of enforcement of the above Act The first respondent herein claiming to be the representative in interest of the mortgagors claimed to have paid the amount of the mortgage money to respondents to herein on th September She filed a suit on September being Suit No of praying inter alia for ejectment from the suit property of the appellant impleaded as defendant No in the suit and another person impleaded as defendant No a sub tenant Rule of Order gives the respondent although he may not have appealed from any part of the decree the right to support the decree on any of the grounds decided against him and further to take any cross objection to the decree which he could have taken by way of appeal provided he files such objection in the appellate court in the manner laid down It is necessary to note the relevant provisions of the Rules of the High <ORG> Allahabad High <ORG> made in exercise of the powers conferred by Art of the Constitution of India and all other powers enabling the court in that behalf with regard to the institution of appeals generally and also Special Appeals provides An appeal shall lie to the <ORG> from the judgment of one Judge made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in respect of a decree or order made in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction by a court subject to the superintendency of the <ORG> where the Judge who passed the judgment declares that the case is a fit one for appeal The memorandum of appeal need not be accompanied by a copy of the judgment appealed from or a copy of the decree or formal order and the time taken in obtaining such copies shall not be excluded in computing the said period of sixty days If the required documents are not supplied or the defects are not removed within the time allowed by the Judge or the Registrar as the case may be the appli cation or memorandum of appeal shall be listed for rejection before the <ORG> When it is found that the court fee paid is deficient the court has power to allow time for the purpose of making the deficiency good this provision of law was strictly construed in the case of <NAME> <NAME> where <ORG> took the view that where a memorandum of appeal was insufficiently stamps when tendered was subsequently stamped sufficiently the affixing of the full stamps would not have a retrospective effect so as to validate the original presentation unless it has been done by order made under the second paragraph of of the Court Fees Act In that case the court allowed the Preliminary objection that as the making good of the deficiency had taken peace after the period of limitation there was before the court no valid appeal in regard whereof a decision could be given on merits In our view in considering the question as to the maintain ability of an appeal when the court fee paid was insufficient to start with but the deficiency is made good later on the provisions of the Court Fees Act and the Code of Civil Procedure have to be read together to form a harmonious whole and no effort should be made to give precedence to provisions in one over those of the other unless the express words of a statute clearly override those of the other In our view it must be treated as pending from the date of presentation not only for the purpose of limitation but also for the purpose of sufficiency as to court fee under of the Code The argument advanced in that case before the court appears to have been to the effect that a plaint which was not sufficiently stamped within the period of limitation was not a valid plaint at all and no sum was found due by him to the plaintiffs under their claim for Rs It was further held that the appeals were not a nullity and on the contrary they were documents duly presented to and accepted by the court and as to the court fee thereon should the valuation be unsatisfactory or in the end insufficient that is validated by the additional payment the result of which payment is that the document namely the memorandum of appeal stands good from its date and the appeals are accordingly not time barred On a parity of reasoning it is difficult to see why if a memorandum of appeal insufficiently stamped is not to be rejected as barred under the Limitation Act why a different conclusion should flow as regards compliance with the Court Fees Act in view of the express provisions of of the Code It was there observed If of the Act i <ORG> Fees Act had stood by itself an unstamped or insufficiently stamped memorandum of appeal chargeable with fees could not have been received by <ORG> for any purpose There is nothing in of the Code which overrides the provisions of <ORG> fees Act it merely postpones the operation of that section for the time being According to <NAME> a legal proceeding is pending as soon as commenced and until it is concluded i so long as the court having original cognizance of it can make an order on the matters in issue or to be dealt with therein of the Limitation Act of as regards the validity of an appeal presented in an irregular form the <ORG> observed that although there was no definition of appeal in the Civil Procedure Code any application by a party to an appellate court asking it to set aside or revise a decision of a Subordinate Judge is an appeal within the ordinary acceptation of the term and that it was no less an appeal because it was irregular and incompetent With due respect we are not impressed by the above reasoning As already noted although there is no definition of the word appeal in the Code of Civil Procedure it can only be instituted by filing a memorandum of appeal But if it is not rejected and time is given to the appellant to make up the deficiency and this opportunity is availed of of the Code expressly provides that the document is to have validity with retrospective effect as if the deficiency had been made good in the first instance
