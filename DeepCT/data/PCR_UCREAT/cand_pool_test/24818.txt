In this batch of writ applications the petitioners challenge the vires of the Orissa Cess Act in so far as it purported to levy cess on lands held for carrying on mining operations and seek mandamus for quashing the demands raised against them and the proceedings taken for recovery of the demands Section defined certain expressions used in the Cess Section prescribed the rate of cess and the manner of assessment fixation of cess year and was as follows Rate of cess assessment of fixation of cess year The cess shall be assessed on the annual value of all lands on whatever tenure held calculated in the manner hereinafter appearing The rate per year at which such cess shall be levied shall be a one hundred per centum of the annual value in the case of lands held for carrying on mining operations and fifty per centum of the annual value in the case of other lands Persons by whom cess payable Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law the cess payable a by a raiyat for the lands he holds and shall be paid by him to the landlord immediately under whom he holds the land by an intermediary in respect of his estate and such cess together with the amount payable to him as cess by intermediaries subordinate to him and the raiyats holding under him shall be paid by him to the intermediary immediately superior to him or to the <ORG> as the case may be by a person for the lands he holds for carrying on mining operations and shall be paid by him to the <ORG> Explanation For the purpose of Clause a landlord shall include the <ORG> Cess shall be paid on such dates and in such manner as may be prescribed Section contained the provisions for appeals Section conferred on <ORG> the power of revision Rule laid down the procedure for revision of valuation A new proviso was inserted after the existing proviso to Sub section of Section of the principal Act and was to to the following effect Provided further that nothing in the preceding proviso shall apply to lands held for carrying on mining operations In Section of the Cess Act a new clause was added as Clause which read as follows by a person for the lands he holds for carrying on mining operations and shall be paid by him to the Government In the case of lands held for carrying on mining operations the annual value shall be the royalty or as the case may be the dead rent payable by the person carrying on mining operation to the <ORG> The cess payable in respect of lands held for carrying on mining operations shall be assessed in the prescribed manner Nothing contained in Sections A shall apply in relation to the assessment of cess in respect of the aforesaid lands and Section of the Cess Act providing for application of the proceeds of the cess was substituted Mr <NAME> the learned Counsel who led the arguments on behalf of the petitioners urged that a the Cess Act in so far as it imposed cess on lands held for carrying on mining operations was unconstitutional the Orissa Legislature lacking legislative competence the field had been taken over by <ORG> by declaration in Section of the Central Act of enacted in exercise of powers under Entry of List I the Cess Act in so far as it purported to levy cess was a piece of colourable legislation in effect purpose and design the <ORG> purporting to impose royalty under the garb of cess By amendment in the <ORG> purported to impose a tax and the imposition after the amendment of was in fact a tax on royalty and he drew attention especially to the statement of objects and reasons of Orissa Act of Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing for another set of petitioners urged that the Central Act of covered the entire field relating to mines and mineral development including the fields of taxation and <ORG> had been denuded of any power to impose tax in respect of mines There was no encroachment on the legislative fields of the <ORG> The <ORG> was not competent to impose tax on lands held for carrying on mining operations To understand fully the contentions raised by the parties it is necessary to give a brief resume of the legislation relating to mines and minerals Under the Government of India Act the subject of Mines arid Minerals was covered by Entry of the <ORG> Legislative List I and Entry of the provincial Legislative List II of the th Schedule Entry Regulation of mines and oil fields and mineral development to which such regulation and development under a <ORG> control is declared by <ORG> law to be expedient in the public interest Entry Regulation of mines and oil fields and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under <ORG> control The Entries have been kept intact in the Constitution and are as follows Entry List I Regulation of mines and minerals development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest The said Act made provisions for regulation of mines and oilfields and for development of mines It came into force on Section contains the declaration It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of Mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided Section of the Central Act of provides that no mining lease shall be granted after the commencement of the Act otherwise than in accordance with the rules made under the Act It also provides that no person shall undertake any prospecting mining operations in an area except under and in accordance with the terms and conditions of a prospecting licence or as the case may be a mining lease granted under the Act and the rules made thereunder Section prescribes the maximum area for which a prospecting licence or mining lease may be granted and Section stipulates the period for which prospecting licence may be granted or renewed and Section the period for which mining leases may be granted or renewed Section fixes the royalties in respect of mining leases the rate being specified in the second schedule in respect of minerals and confers authority on <ORG> to enhance or reduce the rate at which royalty shall be payable Sections to provide the procedure for obtaining prospecting licences or mining leases in respect of lands in which the minerals vest in the <ORG> Section confers power in <ORG> to make rules in respect of minerals Section excludes the application of Sections to to minor minerals Section confers power on <ORG> to make rules in respect of minor minerals Section gives power to modify mining leases granted before th of October Section lays down the special powers of <ORG> to undertake prospecting or mining operations in certain lands Section gives power to <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals and in that behalf gives additional power to it Section provides that any prospecting licence or mining lease granted renewed or acquired in contravention of the provisions of the Act or any rules or orders made thereunder shall be void and of no effect Section makes the provisions of the Act and the rules applicable to prospecting licences or mining leases granted before the commencement of the Act It provides that any rent royalty tax fee or other sum due to the <ORG> under the Act or the rules or under the terms and conditions of any prospecting licence or mining lease may on a certificate of such officer as may be specified by <ORG> be recovered in the same manner as an arrear of land revenue and such due shall be a first charge on the assets of the holders of the licence or mining lease as the case may be It was contended by the counsel for the petitioners that having regard to the declaration in Section of the Central Act of that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of Mines and development of minerals <ORG> was denuded of the power to make legislation in respect of mines and mineral development The field of <ORG> under Entry of List II was taken over by the <ORG> and the imposition of cess on lands held for carrying on mining operations was a trespass upon occupied field It was argued that the imposition of cess in respect of lands held for carrying on mining operations was a piece of colourable legislation as <ORG> was indirectly or covertly doing what it could not do overtly or directly The scheme of distribution has varied with different Constitutions It has both exclusive and concurrent powers though there is no separate list enumerating the concurrent powers Section of the Government of India Act gave <ORG> exclusive power to legislate with respect to matters in List I Section gave <ORG> and subject to Section also to the provincial <ORG> power to legislate in respect of matters in List III and Section gave the Provincial <ORG> subject to Sections and exclusive power to legislate in respect of matters in List II AIR SC Gajendragadkar observed at It is necessary to bear in mind that we are interpreting the words used in the Constitution and it is an elementary cardinal rule of interpretation that the words used in the Constitution which confer legislative powers must receive the most liberal construction and if they are words of wide amplitude they must be interpreted so as to give effect to that amplitude a Constitution <NAME> summarised the position thus When a law is impugned on the ground that it is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it what has to be ascertained is the true character of the legislation To do that one must have regard to the enactment as a whole to its objects and to the scope and effect of its provisions If on such examination it is found that the legislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature then it must be held to be valid in its entirety even though it might incidentally trench on matters which are beyond its competence It would be quite an erroneous approach to the question to view such a statute not as an organic whole but as a mere collection of sections then disintegrate it into parts examine under what heads of legislation those parts would severally fall and by that process determine what portions thereof are intra vires and what are not Notwithstanding that the lists were framed so as to be fairly full and comprehensive it was not long before it was found that the topics enumerated in the two sections overlapped and <ORG> had time and again to pass on the constitutionality of laws made by the Dominion and Provincial legislatures That is to say if a statute is found in substance to relate to a topic within the competence of the legislature it should be held to be intra vires even though it might incidentally trench on topics not within its legislative competence The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond its competence may be an element in determining whether the legislation is colourable that is whether in the guise of making a law on a matter within its competence the legislature is in truth making a law on a subject beyond its competence The whole doctrine re solves itself into the question of competency of a particular legislature to enact a particular law Whether a statute is constitutional or not is thus always a question of power A distinction however exists between a legislature which is legally omnipotent like <ORG> and the laws promulgated by which could not be challenged on the ground of incompetency and a legislature which enjoys only a limited or a qualified jurisdiction If the Constitution of a State distributes the legislative powers amongst different bodies which have to act within their respective spheres marked out by specific legislative entries or if there are limitations on the legislative authority in the shape of fundamental rights questions do arise as to whether the legislature in a particular case has or has not in respect to the subject matter of the statute or in the method of enacting it transgressed the limits of its constitutional powers In other words the letter of the law notwithstanding what is the pith and substance of the Act Does it fall within any Entry assigned to that legislature in pith and substance or as covered by the ancillary power implied in that Entry Can the legislation be read down reasonably to bring it within the legislature constitutional powers If these questions can be answered affirmatively the law is valid Malice or motive is beside the point and it is not permissible to suggest <ORG> incompetence on the score of mala fides Fund Act was challenged on the ground that <ORG> had no power to make the said law in view of the provisions contained in the Mines and In other words if a Central Act has been passed which contains a declaration by <ORG> is required by Entry and if the said declaration covers the field occupied by the impugned Act the impugned Act would be ultra vires not because of any repugnance between the two statutes but because <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass the law What Entry provides is that the legislative competence of <ORG> is subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> and Entry in List I requires a declaration by <ORG> by law that regulation and development of mines should be under the control of the <ORG> in public interest Therefore if a Central Act has been passed for the purpose of providing for the conservation and development of minerals and if it contains the requisite declaration then it would not be competent to <ORG> to pass an Act in respect of the subject matter covered by the said declaration The views expressed in Hingir Rampur case AIR SC supra were reiterated and it was observed by <NAME> at It does not need much argument to realise that to the extent to which <ORG> had taken under its control the regulation and development of minerals so much was withdrawn from the ambit of the power of <ORG> under Entry and legislation of the <ORG> which had rested on the existence of power under that entry would to the extent of that control be superseded or be rendered ineffective for here we have a case not of mere repugnancy between the provisions of the two enactments but of a denudation or deprivation of <ORG> legislative power by the declaration which <ORG> is empowered to make and has made Having regard to the comprehensive provisions contained in the several sections of the Central Act the extent provided included those which fell within the scope of the State Act which was for the regulation and development of mining areas within the State The decisions in <NAME> Rampur case AIR SC and <NAME> case AIR SC were distinguished on the ground that the provisions of the Madras Act had nothing to do and were not concerned with the development of mines and minerals or their regulations No doubt in a sense but in a very remote sense it has relationship to mining as also to the mineral won from the mine under a contract by which royalty is payable on the quantity of mineral extracted But that does not stamp it as a tax on either the extraction of the mineral or on the mineral right Their Lordships held that the Central Act of did not denude <ORG> of its power to impose cess It was urged therein that when by virtue of the declaration in Section of the Central Act of the legislative field covered by Entry of List II passed on to the <ORG> under Entry of List I property tax could not be imposed under Nagar Tatha Gram Nivesh Adhiniyam as amended in The law providing for levy was not in conflict with the powers conferred on <ORG> to regulate and develop the coal mines Since the Central Act was primarily concerned with the development and regulation of declared industries and not with ownership of industrial undertakings <ORG> had the competence to enact the impugned law Summing up their Lordships said in Western Coalfield case AIR SC that the functions powers and duties of Municipalities did not become an occupied field by reason of the declaration contained in Section of the Central Act of Though therefore en account of that declaration the legislative field covered by Entry List II may pass on to the <ORG> by virtue of Entry List I the competence of <ORG> to enact laws for municipal administration will remain unaffected by that declaration The various provisions contained in the Central Act of also indicate that the <ORG> while making the declaration in Section has not taken under its control the field of taxation No provision of the Act or the Rules has been brought to our notice which provides for levy of cess or tax Learned Counsel for the petitioners strongly relied on Section and contended that it contained the provisions regarding taxation It was contended that royalty was tax and the <ORG> having taken over control by declaration in Section of the Central Act of to levy royalty in the field of mining and mineral development the power of <ORG> to impose tax was over borne Royalty was a payment made to the land owner by the lessee ed the mine in return of the privilege of working it It is a levy falling outside the scope of Entry in List I which provides for levy of excise duty by <ORG> but within the scope of the expression tax on mineral rights within the meaning of that expression in Entry of List II Their Lordships further observed para since royalty is not a tax the subject matter of Section of Central Act of is not covered by Entry in the State List It falls squarely under Entry of the Union List because a lessee who is authorised to operate mine and win minerals therefrom pays price of that property is prescribed by <ORG> to the lessor or the owner of the minerals <ORG> In our view royalty is the payment made for the minerals extracted In List II Entries to form one group enumerating the subjects on which <ORG> may make laws If we accept the contention of the petitioners that royalty is tax and Sections and A contains provisions for levy of tax royalty the said sections would be ultra vires for want of legislative competence of <ORG> Act has sought to impose royalty on the mines by way of cess or to reach at the royalty for the purpose of levying cess Section of the Cess Act provides that the cess is to be assessed on the annual value and annual value in case of lands held for carrying on mining operations is defined as the royalty or as the case may be the dead rent payable by the person carrying on mining operations Royalty is defined as meaning the royalty payable under the Central Act of and included any payments made or likely to be made to the <ORG> for the right of raising minerals from the land which shall be calculated on every tonne of such minerals despatched from the lands at the same rate as prescribed under the said Act or such other rate as may be fixed by the <ORG> but not exceeding the amount which would have otherwise been payable as royalty und er the said Act It was contended that assessment of cess with reference to royalty or payments made for the right of raising minerals was tantamount to levying royalty and so the Cess Act was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> It was held at Entry of the Union List speaks both of Regulation of Mines and Minerals Development and Entry is subject to Entry Once this declaration is made and the extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by <ORG> Any legislation by the <ORG> after such declaration and trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is abstracted from the legislative competence of the <ORG> Legislature <ORG> observed that the pith and substance of the provision in the Bihar Act fell within Entry of List II although it incidentally touched land and the field having already been occupied by the Central legislation under Entry of List I <ORG> had no legislative competence <NAME> <NAME> as his Lordship then was in the said decision referred to AIR FC In re Motor Spirit Act and said the provisions of an Act like the Government of India Act should not be cut down by a narrow and technical construction but considering the magnitude of the subjects with which it purports to deal in a very few words it should be given a large and liberal interpretation so that <ORG> to a great extent but within certain fixed limits may be mistress in her own house as the provinces to a great extent but again within theirs When there is an absolute jurisdiction vested in a legislature the laws promulgated by it must take effect according to the proper construction of the language in which they are expressed It is the duty of the courts however difficult it may be to ascertain in what degree and to what extent authority to deal with matters falling within these classes of subjects mentioned in the Central and Provincial Lists exists in each <ORG> and to define in the particular case before them the limits of their respective powers We have to judge the character of the Haryana Act by the substance and effect of its provisions and not merely by the purpose given in the statement of reasons and objects behind it such statements of reasons are relevant when the object or purpose of an enactment is in dispute or uncertain It is not disputed here that the object and effect of the Haryana Act was to acquire proprietary rights to mineral deposits in land exercise of the power contained in Entry of List I was ultra vires because it trenched upon the field covered by Entry of List II For the purpose of levying tax under Entry List II <ORG> may adopt for determining the incidence of tax the annual or the capital value of the lands and buildings It was held para Tax on lands and buildings is directly imposed on lands and buildings and bears a definite relation to it But the adoption of the annual or capital value of lands and buildings for determining tax liability will not make the fields of legislation under the two entries overlapping Vires being challenged it was held at It is true that the education tax is levied on a percentage basis on the annual letting value of the lands and buildings but that is a mode of of determining the quantum of tax imposed on the person who owns lands and buildings Pollock said There is no distinction between the occupying land by passing through a fixed point of space in the air to another fixed point or by passing in the same manner through land or water The word land as used in the statute must be understood in the widest possible sense it includes not only the surface of the earth but everything under it or over it That is the section which creates the liability to pay the tax as distinct from the mode of assessment or the machinery by which it is assessed If a tax is to be levied on property it will not be irrational to correlate it to the annual value the basis of the tax without intending to tax income <NAME> in his Commentary on the Constitution of India has succinctly summarised the law thus In order to determine whether a tax falls under one or other of the taxing powers conferred by the various Entries in the List it is necessary to examine the charging section of the taxing statute as distinguished from the means or machinery or basis of taxation It is therefore difficult to accept the contention of the counsel for the petitioners that as the annual value of lands held for carrying on mining operations is calculated with reference to royalty or other payments paid or payable for the right of raising minerals the cess levied under the Cess Act is not on lands but is royalty or a levy on royalty It was next contended that the Cess Act infringed Article of the Constitution by singling out lands held for carrying on mining operations and for hostile and unequal treatment The First proviso to Section excludes certain types of lands enumerated therein from the application of the Act Whereas the rate of cess per year leviable on all lands except lands held for carrying on mining operations is per cent of the annual value in case of lands held for carrying on mining operations the rate of cess is per cent of the annual value There was no reasonable basis for the differential treatment In order however to pass the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled namely i that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and ii that that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question If there is equality and uniformity within each group the law will not be condemned as discriminative though due to some fortuitous circumstances arising out of peculiar situation some included in a class get an advantage over others so long as they are not singled out for special treatment When a statute divides the objects of tax into groups or categories so long as there is equality and uniformity within each group the tax cannot be attacked on the ground of its being discriminatory although due to fortuitous circumstances or a particular situation some included in a class or group may get some advantage over others provided of course they are not sought out for special treatment AIR SC Lands which are assessable to cess have been classified into two categories namely lands held for carrying on mining operations and other lands The Act does not discriminate within the category of person who hold lands for carrying on mining operations There is equality and uniformity within this group Merely because the tax falls more heavily on lands held for carrying on mining operations it cannot be said that the Act violates the guarantee enshrined in Article Similarly different kinds of property may be subjected to different rates of taxation but so long as there is a rational basis for the classification Article will not stand in the way or such a classification resulting in unequal burdens on different classes of properties The <ORG> has a wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and that a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others We are satisfied that there is an intelligible differentia distinguishing lands held for carrying on mining operations from other lands and the differentia has a rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved There is a presumption of constitutional validity of a statutory provision Assuming that there are the necessary averments we are of the view that the affidavits and the documents filed by one of the petitioners i petitioners in In <NAME> case AIR SC it was held that restrictions which directly and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or movement of trade came within the mischief of Article Though the taxation amounted to restrictions it was only such taxes as directly and immediately restricted trade that would fall within the purview of Article We have already held that the Central Act is referable to Entry of List I whereas the Cess Act has been enacted under the powers conferred on State <ORG> by Entry of List II If the State <ORG> has the legislative competence the petitioners cannot make a grievance that in addition to the amounts stipulated under the lease deed they will be obliged to pay the cess in respect of the lands held by them for mining operations We have also shown that the <ORG> has not the legislative competence to enact a provision for levy of tax on land over which mining operation is carried In fact there is no provision in the Central Act or the Mineral Concession Rules which authorises imposition of tax If the levy is considered as a fee the Act would be stifled at birth for there is no indication of any quid pro quo It was urged by the counsel that the provisions of the Act gave rise to strange and anomalous situations In respect of some land there might be as many leases as types of ores found granted to one person or more Annual value is determined with reference to royalty or dead rent as the case may be paid or payable for lands held for carrying on mining operation It was submitted that whereas in cases of assessments made under Sections and A remedy by way of appeal has been granted to the aggrieved party such a remedy has been withheld in case of assessment under Section of cess on lands held for carrying on mining operations Further the Act conferred revisional powers on the <ORG> to revise any order passed under the Act It depends on the nature of the subject matter other available correctives possible harm flowing from wrong orders and a wealth of other factors Once there is a determination of royalty or dead rent quantification of the cess is an automatic process <ORG> under Section has wide powers to revise any orders passed under the Act or the Rules Resort to the Statement of objects and reasons is permissible when there is ambiguity in the provision or the meaning is not clear Our attention was also drawn to the definition of royalty to its wide and expensive character to show that the object of the <ORG> was mala fide and the legislation was a mere device or pretence Way CLR The claim of all legislatures is to project their minds as far as possible into the future and to provide in terms as general as possible for all contingencies likely to arise in the application of the law We have come to the same conclusions as <ORG> on the points raised before it All the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioners having failed the writ petitions have no merit and are accordingly dismissed
