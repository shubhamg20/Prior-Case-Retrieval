Provisions of the Life Insurance Act which creates <ORG> All the three statutes constituting the three statutory corporations enabled them to make regulations which provide inter alia for the terms and conditions of employment and services of their employees a Regulations under an Act are framed in exercise of a specific power conferred by the statue to make regulations The essence of law is that it is made by the law makers in exercise of specific authority The vires of such of law is capable of being Challenged if the power is absent or has been exceeded by the authority making rules or regulations There is however no substantial difference between rules and regulations inasmuch as both are subordinate legislation under powers conferred by the statute In the case of statutory bodies however there is no personal element whatsoever because of the impersonal character of the bodies A company makes rules and regulations in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act whereas the source of the power for making rules and regulations the case of corporations created by statute is the statute itself A statutory body when it makes rules and regulations does so under the powers conferred by statute creating it regulations made in exercise of the power conferred by the statute which constitute the corporation A corporation had no power to alter or modify or rescind the provisions of the regulations at it discretion which it could do in respect of the terms of contract that it may wish to enter with its employees independent of these regulations as having the right to carry on trade and business A The power to give directions the disobedience of which would be punishable as criminal offences would furnish one of the reasons for characterising the body as an authority within the meaning of Art <ORG> Act confers Power of entry on employees of the <ORG> upon any land or premises for the purposes of lawfully carrying out works by the commission There is nothing strange in the notion of the <ORG> acting through a <ORG> and making it an agency or instru mentality of the <ORG> In other words the question is for whose benefit was the corporation carrying on the business When it is seen from the provisions of that Act that on liquidation of the <ORG> its assets should be devided among the shareholders namely the <ORG> and <ORG> governments and others if any the implication is clear that the benefit of the accumulated income would go to the <ORG> and <ORG> governments I agree with that conclusion Even assuming that the regulations have no force of law I think since the employment under these corporations is public employment an employee would get a status which would enable him to obtain declaration for cent nuance in service if he was dismissed or discharged contrary to the regulations <ORG> is given the power to make regulations and to provide that breach of its regulations would be punishable The whole purpose of the Part III of the Constitution is to confer fundamental rights on the citizen as against the power of the <ORG> or those exercising the power of the <ORG> iii There is no fallacy in equating rules and regulations of a Company with rules and regulations framed by a statutory body Where an institution or Organisation is established by a Statute or under a Statute in principle there is no difference between their powers While rules apply to all matters covered by the statute the scope of the regulations is narrower being usually confined to internal matters of the statutory body such as the conditions of service of its employees of India <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> for the Applicant Intervener <ORG> The following Judgments were delivered RAY There are two questions for consideration in these appeals The Oil and Natural Gas <ORG> Act hereinafter referred to as the Act established the <ORG> as a body corporate having perpetual succession and a common seal <ORG> may if it thinks fit appoint one of the members as Viw Chairman of the <ORG> Under section of the Act the <ORG> may for the purpose of performing its functions or exercising its powers appoint such number of employees as it may consider necessary There was an existing <ORG> set up in pursuance of a resolution of <ORG> No dated th August Every person employed by the said existing <ORG> before the establishment of the <ORG> became an employee of the <ORG> in accordance with the provisions contained in section of the Act Section states that <ORG> may by notification in <ORG> make rules to give effect to the provisions of the Act The rules provide inter alia for the term of office of and the manner of filling casual vacancies among the members and their conditions of service the disqualifications for membership of the <ORG> and the procedure to be followed in removing a member who is or becomes subject to any disqualification the procedure to be followed in the discharge of functions by members the conditions subject to which and the mode in which contracts may be entered into by or on behalf of the <ORG> and some other matters Every rule made under section of the Act shall be laid as soon as may be before <ORG> as mentioned in the section Both Houses may agree to or annul the rule or modify Under section of the Act the <ORG> may with the previous approval of <ORG> by notification in <ORG> make regulations not inconsistent with the Act and the rules made thereunder for enabling it to discharge its functions under the Act The regulations provide inter alia for the terms and conditions of appointment and service and the scaler of pay of employees of the <ORG> the time and place of meetings of the <ORG> the procedure to be followed in regard to the transaction of business at such meetings the maintenance of minutes of meetings of the <ORG> and the transmission of copies thereof to <ORG> the persons by whom and the manner in which payments deposits and investments may be made on behalf of the <ORG> the custody of moneys required and the maintenance of accounts Section states that <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette make rules to carry out the purposes of this Act and the rules made thereunder to provide for all matters for which provision is expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Act The regulations may provide inter alia for the powers and functions of the <ORG> which may be delegated to the Zonal Managers the method of recruitment of employees and agents of the <ORG> and the terms and conditions of service of such employees or agents the terms and conditions of service of persons who have become employees of the <ORG> under section of the Act the number term of office and conditions of service of members of Boards constituted under section of the Act the manner in which the Fund of the <ORG> shall be maintained the form and manner in which policies may be issued and contracts binding on the <ORG> may be executed Section of the Act enacts that <ORG> may make rules in consultation with <ORG> not inconsistent with the provisions of this Act and to give effect to the provisions of the Act and where there is any inconsistency with rules and regulations the rules shall prevail section of the Act enacts that the Board may with the previous approval of <ORG> make regulations not inconsistent with the Act and the rules made thereunder to provide for all matters for which provision is necessary or expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Act The regulations provide inter alia for the holding and conduct of elections under this Act including the final decision of doubts or disputes regarding the validity of the election the manner in which and the conditions subject to which the shares of the <ORG> may be held and transferred the manner in which general meeting shall be convened the procedure to be followed thereat the duties and conduct salaries allowances and conditions of service of officers and other employees and of advisers and agents of the <ORG> Regulations provide the terms and conditions of employment and thereafter the employment of each person is contractual The origin and source of the power to make regulations is statutory Regulations have the force of law inasmuch as the statutory authorities have no right to make any departure from the regulations The Rules Publication Act in England defines rule making authority to include every authority authorised to make any statutory rules Subordinate legislation is made by a person or body by virtue of the powers conferred by a statute The reason is that it goes to the root of the power of such corporations and the declaration of nullity is the only relief that is granted to the aggrieved party Similarly if such an instrument authorises or requires the doing of any act the principles to be applied in determining whether a person injured by the act has any right of action in respect of the injury are not different from those applicable whether damage results from an act done under the direct authority of a statute Re <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> The authority of a statutory body or public administrative body or agency ordinarily includes the power to make or adopt rules and regulations with respect to matters within the province of such body provided such rules and regulations are not inconsistent with the relevant law These statutory bodies cannot use the power to make rules and regulations to enlarge the powers beyond the scope intended by the legislature Rules and regulations made by reason of the specific power conferred on the statute to make rules and regulations establish the pattern of conduct to be followed Rules and regulations have been distinguished from orders or determination of statutory bodies in the sense that the orders or determination are actions in which there is more of the judicial function and which deal with a particular present situation The authority making rules and regulation must specify the source of the rule and regulation making authority To illustrate rules are always framed in exercise of the specific power conferred by the statute to make rules Similarly regulations are framed in exercise of specific power conferred by the statute to make regulations The essence of law is that it is made by the law makers in exercise of specific authority The vires of law is capable of being challenged if the power is absent or has been exceeded by the authority making rules or regulations The Life Insurance <ORG> Act as well as the Industrial Finance <ORG> Act confers power on the <ORG> to make regulations as Lo the method of recruitment of employees and the terms and conditions of service of such employees or agents Regulations under the Act provide inter alia the terms and conditions of appointment and scales of pay of the employees of the <ORG> There is a legal compulsion on the <ORG> to comply with the regulations the Life Insurance <ORG> Act and the Industrial Finance <ORG> Act though there is no specific provision comparable to section of the Act the terms and conditions of employment and conditions of service are provided for by regulations The rules under Article on the other hand constitute not only the constitutional rights of relationship between the <ORG> and the Government servants but also establish that there must be specific power to frame rules and regulations The provisions in the Stamp Act contain provisions for stamping of documents The source of the power for making rules and regulations in the case of <ORG> created by a statute is the statute itself The reason is that the termination contravened the provisions contained in the regulations <ORG>s Act conferred power upon the State Government by section to make rules under the Act It was treated as a rule inasmuch as sec tion of <ORG>s Act which conferred power to frame regulations did not confer any power to frame powers regulating the exercise of the power of dismissal of officers of servants of the <ORG> This Court held that under the rules dismissal removal or reduction of an officer or servant might be effected only after affording him a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him In <NAME> case this Court also said that the order of dismissal involving punishment must be exercised con sistently with the rules or regulations framed under the Statute In the <ORG> case there were regulations framed under the Act Paragraph of the circular which became an integral part of the regulations inter alia stated that where the Committee of its own decided that the poor performance of a Field Officer was not due to circumstances beyond his control or that he had made no efforts and not shown inclination or willingness to work the services of such Field Officer would be terminated There was also in existence a Field Officer order which was issued in exercise of the powers conferred on <ORG> by section of the Act This Court held that the regulations to be framed by the <ORG> were not to be inconsistent either with the Act or with orders made under section of the Act In the <ORG> case reliance was placed upon the decision of <NAME> <NAME> for the view that not all by laws have the force of law The regulations made under power conferred by the statute are subordinate legislation and have the force and effect if validly made as the Act passed by the competent legislature regulations made in exercise of the power conferred by the statute which constituted that <ORG> In the Indian Airlines <ORG> case under section of the Air <ORG>s Act the <ORG> had the power to make regulations not inconsistent with the Act and the rules made by <ORG> thereunder The <ORG> had no power to alter or modify or rescind the provisions of these regulations at its discretion which it could do in respect of the terms of contract that it may wish to enter with its employees independent of these regulations This Court held that in regard to the master servant cases in the employment of the <ORG> or of other public or local authorities or bodies created under statute the courts have decided in appropriate cases the dismissal to be invalid if the dismissal is contrary to rule of natural justice or if the dismissal is in violation of the provisions of the statute Where a <ORG> or a public authority dismisses an employee in violation of the mandatory procedural requirements on grounds which are not sanctioned or sup ported by statute the courts may exercise jurisdiction to declare the act of dismissal to be a nullity There is no substantial difference between a rule and a regulation inasmuch as both are subordinate legislation under powers conferred by the statute In cases of statutory bodies there is no personal element whatsoever because of the impersonal character of statutory bodies In the case of statutory bodies it has been said that the element of public employment or service and the support of statute require observance of rules and regulations The expression other authorities in Article has been held by this Court in the <ORG> case to be wide enough to include within it every authority created by a statute and functioning within the territory of India or under the control of <ORG> This Court further said referring to earlier decisions that the expression Other authorities in Article will include all constitutional or statutory authorities on whom powers are conferred by law The <ORG> itself is envisaged under Article as having the right to carry on trade and The Electricity Supply Act showed that the <ORG> had power to give directions the disobedience of which is punishable us a criminal offence The power to issue directions and to enforce compliance is an important aspect The power of the <ORG> to make rules and regulations and to administer the Act was said to be in substance the sovereign power of the <ORG> delegated to the <ORG> The Court gave two reasons as to why <ORG> was not within the province of the government Again it is difficult to understand why in the event of an emergency powers should be given to the Postmaster General to direct that the broadcasting stations of the <ORG> should be deemed to be in possession of Her Majesty if it be the fact that such stations are already used for purposes of exercising functions required and created for purposes of the Government Section of the said Act states that no mining lease shall be granted after the commencement of the Act otherwise than in accordance with the rules made under the Act Section of the said Act confers power on <ORG> to make rules for regulating grant of mining leases of prohibiting grant of leases Section of the said Act wafers power on <ORG> to make rules for the conservation and development of mineral oils Section of the said Act states that any rule made under any of the provisions of the Act may provide that any contravention thereof shall be punishable with the imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees or with both Entry No in List I speaks of regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Section of the Act confers power on any employee of the <ORG> authorised by it to eater upon any land or premises and there do such things as may be reasonably necessary for the purpose of lawfully carrying out any of its works or to make survey examination or investigation preliminary or incidental to the exercise of powers or the performance of functions by the <ORG> under the Act Under Article subject to the provisions of the Constitution the executive power of the <ORG> shall extend to the matters with respect to which <ORG> has power to make laws and to the exercise of such rights authority and jurisdiction as are exercisable by <ORG> by virtue of any treaty or agreement The Life Insurance Act is an Act to provide for the nationalisation of life insurance business in India by transferring all such business to the <ORG> established for the purpose and to provide for the regulation and control of the business of the <ORG> and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto It became the duty of very person in possession custody or control of property appertaining to the controlled business of an insurer to deliver the same to the <ORG> forthwith The <ORG> was empowered to reduce the amounts of insurance under contracts of life insurance in such manner and subject to such conditions as it thought fit Where any industrial concernt which is under a liability to the corPoration makes any default in re payment or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of the a agreement with the <ORG> the <ORG> shall have the right to take over the management or possession or both of the concern as well as the right to transfer by way of lease or sale and realise the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to the <ORG> <ORG> shall have the power to supersede the <ORG> and appoint a new <ORG> in its place to function until a properly constituted <ORG> is set up <ORG> may issue directions to auditors requiring them to report to it upon the adequacy of measures taken by the <ORG> for the protection of its shareholders and creditors In the <ORG> case it was said that the power to give directions the disobedience of which must be punishable as a criminal offence would furnish one of the reasons for characterising the body as an authority within the meaning of Article The power to make rules or regulations and to administer or enforce them would be one of the elements of authorities contemplated in Article on behalf of the <ORG> it was contended that <ORG> as well as Industrial Finance <ORG> was not granted immunity from taxation and therefore the liability to be taxed would indicate that the <ORG> was not a <ORG> authority The Oil and Natural Gas <ORG> Act confers power of entry on employees of the <ORG> upon any land or premises for the purpose of lawfully carrying out works by the <ORG> The Life Insurance Act provides that if any person lawfully withholds or fails to deliver to the <ORG> any property which has been transferred to and vested in the <ORG> or wilfully applies them to purposes other than those expressed or authorised by the Act he shall on the complaint of the <ORG> be punishable with the imprisonment which may extend to one year or with fine which may extend to one thousand of rupees or with both The Industrial Finance <ORG> Act states that whoever in any bill of lading warehouse receipt or other instrument given to the <ORG> whereby security is given to the <ORG> for accommodation granted by it wilfully makes any false statement or knowingly permits any false statement to be made shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine which may extend to two thousand rupees or with both Further whoever without the consent in writing of the <ORG> uses the name of the <ORG> in any prospect or advertisement shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees or with both For the foregoing reasons we hold that rules and regulations framed by <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> have the force of law In Civil Appeal No of the declaration granted by <ORG> that the order removing <NAME> from service is null and void and that he continues in service is upheld In <ORG> <NAME> this Court had occasion to consider the question whether the <ORG> was an authority within the meaning of the expression other authorities in Article of the Constitution <NAME> delivering the judgment for the majority pointed out that the expression other authorities in Article would include all constitutional and statutory authorities on whom powers are conferred by law Justice <NAME> who delivered a separate judgment agreeing with the con clusion reached by the majority preferred to adopt a slightly different meaning to the words other authorities He said that authorities constitutional or statutory would fall within the expression state as defined in Article only if they are invested with sovereign power of the <ORG> namely the power to make rules or regulations which have the force of law Though this would be sufficient to make the <ORG> a state according to the decision of this Court in the Rajasthan Electricity Board Case supra there is a larger question which has a direct bearing so far as the other two Corporations are concerned viz whether despite the fact that there are no provisions for issuing binding directions to third parties the disobedience of which would entail penal consequence the corporations set up under statutes to carry on business of public importance or which is fundamental to the life of the people can be considered as state within the meaning of Article That Article reads The question whether a corporation set up under a statute to carry on a business of public importance is a state despite the fact that it has no power to issue binding directions has to be decided on other considerations Therefore there is nothing strange in the notion of the state acting through a corporation and making it an agency or instrumentality of the <ORG> Second they exercise power more indirectly though not less powerfully over the unorganized citizens whose lives they largely control through standardized terms of contract through price policy through the tempo of production and the terms and conditions of labour Article provides that no <ORG> shall make any law which takes away or abridges the right guaranteed by Part III In other words until some law is passed or some action is taken through officers or agents of the <ORG> there is Do action by the <ORG> He said that inn keepers are exercising a quasi public employment and that law gives them special privileges and they are charged with certain duties and responsibilities to the public These decision do not rest on the basis that the entity or organization must wield authority in the sense it must have power to issue commands in the Austinian sense or that it must have the sovereign power to pass laws or regulations having the force of law Some clue however to the considerations which might impel the court in one direction or the other may be obtained from an examination of the cases in this area But in all these cases it has been found that there was an element of control exercised by the <ORG> Therefore it may be stated generally that <ORG> financial aid alone does not render the institution receiving such aid a state agency It may give the organization the power of eminent domain it may grant tax exemptions or it may give it a monopolistic status for certain purposes As a part of the cooperative effort by the city and the private company the plans for the project were subject to approval of the city and the company profits dividends and power to dispose of the property were subjected to regulation by state law For the representative is clothed with power not unlike that of a legislature which is subject to constitutional limitations on its power to deny restrict destroy discriminate against the rights of those for whom it legislates and which is also under an affirmative constitutional duty equally to protect those rights The difficulty here is well stated by Justice <NAME> in <NAME> and <NAME> Banton dealing with the constitutionality of a New York statute which limited the fees charged by theatre ticket brokers But if we are to yield to fashionable conventions it seems to me that theatres are as much devoted to public use as anything well can be many people the superfluous is the necessary and it seems to me that government does not go beyond its sphere in attempting to make life livable for them <ORG> said When this Court came to sustain the federal taxing power upon a transportation system operated by a <ORG> it did so in ways familiar in developing the law from precedent to precedent It has taken English and American <ORG> many years to concede that the exercise of an industrial or commercial activity on behalf of the state does not deprive such activity of its governmental character I would draw the same conclusions from the relevant provisions of the Industrial Finance <ORG> Act which have also been referred to in the aforesaid judgment This Court took the view that <ORG> was a corporate body and has a separate personality and therefore the business carried on by it was its own business When it is seen from the provisions of that Act that on liquidation of the <ORG> its assets should be divided among the shareholders namely the <ORG> and <ORG> governments and others if any the implication is clear that the benefit of the accumulated income would go to the <ORG> and <ORG> governments I do not think there is any basis for the apprehension expressed that by holding that these public corporations are state within the meaning of Article the employees of these corporations would become government servants I also wish to make it clear that I express no opinion on the question whether private corporations or other like organisations though they exercise power over their em ployees which might violate their fundamental rights would be state within the meaning of Article The second question for consideration is whether an order of removal or dismissal from service contrary to the regulations framed by these corporations in the exercise of power conferred in that behalf would enable an employee to a declaration against them for continuance in service or would give rise only to a claim for damages This will depend upon the question whether the regulations framed by these corporations would have the force of law and even if they have not the force of law whether the employment is public employment and for that reason the employee would obtain a status which would enable him to obtain the declaration Even assuming that the regulations have no force of law I think since the employment under these corporations is public employment an employee would get a status which would enable him to obtain declaration for continuance in service if he was dismissed or discharged contrary to the regulations The law has adhered to the age old rule that an employer may dismiss the employee at will The conditions have now vastly changed and it is difficult to regard the contract of employment with large scale industries and government enterprises conducted by bodies which are created under special statutes as mere contract of personal service And there are a number of cases in which even contracts for permanent employment i for indefinite terms have been held unenforceable on the ground that they lack mutuality of obligation But these cases demonstrate that mutuality is a high sounding phrase of little use as an analytical tool and it would seem clear that mutuality of obligation is not an inexorable requirement and that lack of mutuality is simply as many courts have come to recognize an imperfect way of referring to the real obstacle to enforcing any kind of contractual limitation on the employer right of discharge i lack of consideration If there is anything in contract law which seems likely to advance the present inquiry it is the growing tendency to protect individuals from contracts of adhesion from over reaching terms often found in standard forms of contract used by large commercial establishments The same philosophy seems to provide an appropriate answer to the argument which still seems to have some vitality that the servant cannot complain as he takes the employment on the terms which are offered to him A specialist surgeon wag denied protection which is given to a hospital doctor a University professor as a servant has been denied the right to be heard a dock Labourer and an undergraduate have been granted it examples can be multiplied One may accept that if there are relationships in which all requirements of the observance of ruler of natural justice are excluded and I do not wish to assume that this is inevitably so these must be confined to what have been called pure master and servant cases which I take to mean cases in which there is no element of public employment or service no support by statute nothing in the nature of an office or a status which is capable of protection Lord <NAME> in interpreting the word permanent in that case said it seems to me of considerable importance in interpreting its use in a contract of service that such a contract cannot be specifically enforced Declaration is not specific performance but it has the same effect in practice where a public authority is concerned which will invariably act in accordance with the law as de clared In <NAME> <ORG> Lord <NAME> Said The power of the court to make declarations when it is a question of determining the rights of two parties to a contract is now almost unlimited or limited only by the discretion of the court The discretion which should guide the court must be in tune with the modern conditions of life and should result in reversal of present day attitude He said An executive agency must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its action to be judged According if dismissal from employment is based on a defined procedure even though generous beyond the requirements that bind such agency that procedure must be scrupulously observed He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with that sword I agree with the conclusions of my Lord the Chief Justice <NAME> In his judgment in Writ Petition No of as Lord the Chief Justice has quoted with approval the decision of this <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> SCR <ORG> Dividends declared by the company entirely went to the coffers of the <ORG> The Memorandum of Association and the Articles of Association of the company conferred large powers on <ORG> in eluding the power to give directions as regards the functioning of the Company In dealing with the question whether the company could be said to be carrying on its business pursuant to the authority of <ORG> this Court observed An incorporated company as is well known has a separate existence and the law recognises it as a juristic person separate and distinct from its members Therefore the mere fact that the entire share capital of the respondent company was contributed by <ORG> and the fact that all its shares are held by the President and certain officers of <ORG> does not make any difference It is true that besides <ORG> having contributed the entire share capital extensive powers are conferred on it including the power to give directions as to how the company should function the power to appoint A The question whether a corporation is an agent of the <ORG> must depend on the facts of each case Such an inference that the corporation is the agent of the <ORG> may be drawn where it is performing in substance governmental and not commercial functions cf This Court held that the <ORG> had its independent existence and by the law relating to corporations it was distinct even from its members though the question for decision therein was whether Article of the Constitution applied to the employee in question <ORG> may if it thinks fit appoint one of the members as Vice Chairman of the <ORG> The <ORG> may for the purpose of performing its functions or exercising its powers appoint such number of employees as it may consider necessary The regulations provide inter alia for the terms and conditions of appointment and service and the scales of pay of employees of the <ORG> the time and place of meeting of the <ORG> the procedure to be followed in regard to the transaction of business at such meetings the maintenance of minutes of meetings of the <ORG> and the transmission of copies thereof to <ORG> the persons by whom and the manner in which payments deposits and investments may be made on behalf of the <ORG> the custody of moneys required and the maintenance of accounts Under of the Act the <ORG> may with the previous approval of <ORG> by notification in <ORG> make regulations not inconsistent with the Act and the rules made thereunder to provide for all matters for which provision is expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Act The regulations may provide inter alia for the powers and functions of the <ORG> which may be delegated to the Zonal Managers the method of recruitment of employees and agents of the <ORG> and the terms and conditions of service of such employees or agents the terms and condition of service of persons who have become employees of the <ORG> under section of the Act the number term of office and conditions of service of members of boards constituted under section of the Act the manner in which the Fund of the <ORG> shall be maintained the form and manner in which policies may be issued and contracts binding on the <ORG> may be executed Section of the Act enacts that the Board may with the previous approval of <ORG> regulations not inconsistent with the Act and the rules made thereunder to provide for all matters for which provision is necessary or expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of this Act The regulations provide inter alia for the holding and conduct of elections under this Act including the final decision of doubts or disputes regarding the validity of the election the manner in which and the conditions subject to which the shares of the <ORG> may be held and transferred the manner in which general meetings shall be convened the procedure to be followed thereat the duties and conduct salaries allowances and conditions of service of officers and other employees and of advisers and agents of the Corp oration On behalf of the employees the contention was that as the source of the power to make regulations is the statute the regulations are themselves law Where by any Central Act or Regulation a power to issue any notification order scheme rule form or bye law is conferred then expressions used in the notification order scheme rule form or bye law if it is made after the commencement of this Act shall unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context have the same respective meanings as in the Act or Regulation conferring the power There are a number of statutes on the Statute Book in India where the word regulation is used to refer to the regulations made by bodies other than the <ORG> Though rule is defined as including a regulation made as a rule it cannot be said that regulation making power con ferred on the three organisations in question is a rule making power Under the legislative practice in India the rule making power is conferred on the <ORG> and the power to make regulations is conferred on bodies or organisations created by the statute The Air <ORG>s Act which deals with <ORG> and <ORG> confers power on <ORG> to make rule under section with regard to terms and conditions of service of the General Manners and such categories of officers as may be specified from time to time under sub section of section Under section the <ORG>s have the power to make regulations among other things regarding terms and conditions of service of officers and other employees of the <ORG> other than the General Manager and officers of any other categories referred to in section Under the All India <ORG> of Medical Sciences Act <ORG> has the power to make rule under section including the power to make rules regarding the conditions of service of members of the <ORG> the allowances to be paid to the President and members of the <ORG> and the number of officers and employees that may be appointed by the <ORG> and the manner of such appointment Under section the <ORG> has the power to make regulations regarding the allowances if any to be paid to the Chairman and the members of <ORG> and of standing and ad hoc committees and the tenure of office salaries and allowances and other conditions of service of the Director and other officers and employees of the <ORG> including teachers appointed by the <ORG> On the other hand under the Central Silk <ORG> Act it is <ORG> that has the power to make rules regarding the staff which may be employed by the <ORG> and the pay and allowances leave and other conditions of service of officers and other employees of the <ORG> The <ORG> has no power to make regulation Under the Chartered Accountants Act it is the <ORG> that has the power to make regulations about various matters <ORG> has however the power to direct the <ORG> to make any regulations or to amend or revoke any regulations already made within such period as it May specify in this behalf There is however no rule making power conferred on <ORG> Under the Indian Coconut <ORG> Act <ORG> has the power to make rules including many others the power for regulating grant of pay and leave to officers and servants of the <ORG> as also the pensions gratuities compassionate allowances and travelling allowances The power of the <ORG> to make regulations is however very limited and relates only to demandIng security from officers and servants of the <ORG> and <ORG> Under the Coir Industry Act <ORG> has power to make rules and <ORG> has no power to make any regulations Under the Coir Industry Act <ORG> has the power to make regulations and the <ORG> to make bye laws regarding the appointment promotion and dismissal of its officers and other employees other than the Secretary and the creation and abolition of their posts as well as the conditions of service of its officers and other employees other than the Secretary including their pay leave leave allowances pensions gratuities compassionate allowances and travelling allowances and the establishment and maintenance of a provident fund for them Under the Cost and Works Accountants Act only the <ORG> has the power to make regulations and the Government has no power to make rules Under the Damodar Valley <ORG> Act <ORG> has the power to make rules and the <ORG> to make regulations among other things regarding making of appointments and promotion of its officers and servants and specifying other conditions of service of its officers an servants Under the Dentists Act the State <ORG>s alone have the power to make rules including rules regarding the term of office and the powers and duties of the Registrar and other officers and servants of <ORG> The State Councils have no powers to make any regulations The Deposit Insurance <ORG> Act enables the <ORG> to make regulations but confers no power on the <ORG> to make rules Under the Electricity Supply Act the State Governments have the power to make rules and the Board makes regulations Under the Employees State Insurance Act the Central Government has the power to make rules in respect of certain matters and the State Governments in respect of certain other matters but the Corporation has the power to make regulations regarding the method of recruitment pay and allowances discipline superannuation benefits and other conditions of service of officers and servants of the Cor poration other than the principal officers The State Governments have the power to make rules regarding the conditions of service of staff employed in the hospitals dispensaries and institutions mansions of this Act is that the regulations made by the Corporation shall be published in <ORG> and thereupon shall have effect as if enacted in the Act This also illustrates the provision of Cl The Faridabad Development <ORG> Act confers the power to make rules on <ORG> but no power is given to the <ORG> to make any regulations The Indian Medicine Central <ORG> Act confers the power to make rules on <ORG> and the power to make regulations on <ORG> including the power to make regulations regarding the tenure of office and the powers and duties of the Registrar and other officers and servants of the <ORG> and the appointment powers duties and procedure of inspectors and visitors The Industrial Development <ORG> of India Act confers powers on <ORG> of the <ORG> to make regulations but no rule making power on the <ORG> The International Airports <ORG> Act confers power on the Central <ORG> to make rules and on the <ORG> to make regulations including regulations regarding the conditions of service and the remuneration of officers and other employees appointed by it The Khadi and Village Industries <ORG> Act confers the power to make rules on <ORG> and the power to make regulations on the <ORG> including regulations regarding the terms and conditions of appointment and service and the scales of pay of officers and servants of the <ORG> other than the Secretary and the Financial Adviser to the <ORG> which are to be re gulated by rules made by the <ORG> Under the Life Insurance <ORG> Act the power to make rules is with <ORG> and the power to make regulations with the <ORG> Under the Major Port Trusts Act <ORG> has the power to make rules and <ORG> for the port the power to make regulations including the power regarding the appointment promotion suspension removal and dismissal of its employees their leave leave allowances pensions gratuities compassionate allowances and travelling allowances and the establishment and maintenance of <ORG> or any other fund for their welfare and the terms and conditions of service of persons who become employees of the <ORG> The Indian Medical <ORG> Act confers power on <ORG> to make rules and on the <ORG> to make regulations including the tenure of office and the powers and duties of the Registrar and other officers and servants of the <ORG> the appointment powers duties and procedure of medical inspectors and visitors The Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act confers the power to make rules on <ORG> and the power to make regulations on <ORG> The National Co operative Development <ORG> Act confers the power to make rules on <ORG> and the power to make regulations on the <ORG> My learned brothers say that the regulations under the Oil Natural Gas <ORG> Act provide for the terms and conditions of appointment and service and scales of pay of the employees of the <ORG> regulations are imperative and the administrative instruction is the entering into contract with the particular person but the form and content of the contract is prescriptive and not statutory I have extracted the power to make regulations found in the various statutes merely to show that the power to make regulations may be of different kinds An institution like <ORG> which has its offices and employees all over But if there is breach of those conditions it cannot be said that there is a breach of any statutory provision While rules apply to all matters covered by the statute the scope of the regulations is narrower being usually confined to internal matters of the statutory body such as the condi tions of service of its employees The Corporation has a complete discretion in framing the regulations and giving such protection thereunder to its employees as it thinks fit It is true that they have to offer terms and conditions as laid down in the regulations Indeed there is no obligation on them to make regulations regarding the terms and conditions of service of their employees It has been held by this Court that in the case of public servants though the Gov ernments have power to make rules under the proviso to Art A statutory body makes regulations under the powers conferred by the statute creating that body The fact that a <ORG> like <ORG> is created by the statute itself and a company come into existence in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act does not make any difference to this situation There is no reason in principle why a different result should follow just because a corporation happens to be established by a statute whereas it is different in the case of a company Whether an institution or <ORG> is established by a statute or under a statute in principle there is no difference between their powers that is why <ORG> is given even the power to make regulations to provide that a breach of its regulations would be punishable The whole purpose of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution is to confer fundamental rights on the citizen as against the power of the <ORG> or those exercising the power of the <ORG> <NAME> quoted with approval the remarks of <NAME> against whose judgment <ORG> was being heard to the effect So I come to the conclusion that however widely one may be inclined to extend the conception of an act or function of government the <ORG> has not taken the path of engagaing itself in a broadcasting service or of entrusting it to any agent When this <ORG> came to sustain the federal taxing power upon a transportation system operated by a <ORG> it did so in ways familiar in developing the law from precedent To precedent But that principle would not apply for the purpose of determining the status of its employees under Article The decision in <NAME> <NAME> KB is very much in point in deciding the questions that arise in the present case He was given powers over this corporation which were as great as those possessed by a man who held all the shares in a private company subject however to a duty to account to <ORG> for his stewardship They must give him any information he wanted He was given power to give them directions of of a general nature and they were bound to obey The only fact in this case which can be said to make <ORG> a servant or agent of the <ORG> is the control over it which is exercised by the Minister of Transport but there is ample authority both in this <ORG> and in <ORG> for saying that such control as he exercises is insufficient for the purpose In the absence of any such express provision the proper inference In <NAME> <NAME> OB In regard to by laws it was said <NAME> But first it seems necessary to consider what is a bylaw A by law of the class we are here considering I take to be an ordinance affecting the public or some portion of the public imposed by some authority clothed with statutory powers ordering something to be done or not to be done and accompanied by some sanction or penalty for its non observance It necessarily involves restriction of liberty of action by persons who come under its operation as to acts which but for the bye law they would be free to do or not do as they pleased Further it involves this consequence that if validly made it has the force of law within the sphere of its legitimate operation SCR Justice Shah pointed out that The question whether a corporation is an agent or servant of the <ORG> must be decided on the facts of each case By that section it was <ORG> that was given the power to alter whether by way of reduction or otherwise the remuneration and other terms and conditions of service to such an extent and in such manner as it thought fit That power so conferred was to be exercised notwithstanding any thing contained in sub section or in the Industrial Disputes Act or In any other law for the time being in force or in any award settlement or agreement for the time being in force The order therefore had statutory effect and the order of termination of services of the employee was therefore in contravention of the statutory provision There is no provision in the Act which has attempted to lift the veil from the face of the corporation and thereby enable the shareholders to claim that despite the form which the <ORG> has taken it is the shareholders who run the trade and who can claim the income coming from it as their own pointed out It is not difficult to realise the significance and importance of making such a distinction particularly at the present time when in the pursuit of their welfare ideal the <ORG>s of the <ORG>s as well as the <ORG> of India naturally and legitimately enter into many commercial and other undertakings and activities which have no relation with the traditional con cept of governmental activities in which the exercise of sovereign power is involved which may be conveniently described as nongovernmental or non sovereign citizens who have a cause of action for damages should not be precluded from making their claim against the <ORG> When the majority further went on to observe The expression other authorities is wide enough to include within it every authority created by a statute anti functioning within the territory of India or under the control of <ORG> It can only be with regard to authority exercising governmental or quasi governmental functions On the other hand there are provisions in the Electricity Supply Act which clearly show that the powers conferred on the <ORG> include power to give directions the disobedience of which is punishable as a criminal offence that the fact that the <ORG> carried on activities in the nature of trade or commerce could be a ground for excluding it from the scope of word <ORG> but for the fact that it was given powers to give directions the disobedience of which was punishable as a criminal offence We need not now pause to consider whether where a body carries out functions both with regard to trade and commerce and also exercises powers which only a <ORG> can exercise like giving directions the disobedience of which is punishable as a criminal offence the obligations and restrictions which are imposed by the Constitution on the exercise of those powers by the <ORG> should not be confined to those powers and with regard to the carrying on the trade and commerce it should not be treated as any other ordinary commercial concern The power to make rules and regulation and to administer the Act is in substance the sovereign power of the <ORG> delegated to the <ORG> The expression authority in its etymological sense means a body invested with power to command or give an ultimate decision or enforce obedience or having a legal right to command and be obeyed it would be necessary to bear in mind not only whether against the authority fundamental rights in terms absolute arc intended to be enforced but also whether it was intended by the Constitution makers that the authority was invested with the sovereign power to impose restrictions on very important and basic fundamental free Those authorities which are invested with sovereign power i power to make rules or regulations and to administer or enforce them to the detriment of citizens and others fall within the definition of <ORG> in Art They merely govern the internal management business or administration of a society and may be binding between the persons effected by them but are neither law nor do they have the force of law The Jurisdiction granted to the <ORG> by the Industrial Disputes Act is not the jurisdiction of merely administering existing laws and enforcing existing contracts The <ORG> has the jurisdiction even to vary contracts of service between employer and employees Further in the Andhra Act there is no prohibition that the conditions of service prescribed are not to be altered On the facts of this case it was held that a breach had been committed by the appellant of regulation but such an order made in breach of the regulations would only be contrary to the terms and conditions of relationship between the appellant and the respondent and it would not be in breach of any statutory obligation because the Act does not guarantee any statutory status to the respondent nor does it impose any obligation on the appellant in such matters It then held that Though made under the power conferred by statute the regulations merely embody the terms and conditions of service in the <ORG> but do not constitute a statutory restriction as to the kind of contracts which the <ORG> can make with its servants or the grounds con which it can terminate therm That being so and the <ORG> having undoubtedly power to dismiss its employees the dismissal of the respondent was with jurisdiction and although it was wrongful in the sense of its being in breach of the terms and conditions which governed the relationship between the <ORG> and the respondent it did subsist My learned brothers have referred to <NAME> case SCR and state that as it was decided by the Constitution Bench <ORG> case SCR and <ORG> case SCR Supp SCR are in direct conflict with former decision in <NAME> case Nor was the question whether the regulations under consideration in that case were of a statutory character raised or decided One was that if the regulations are held to be law the remedy under the Industrial Disputes Act would not be available to the employees of these Corporations because under the Industrial Disputes Act the Tribunals have the right to form a new contract for the parties if the employment is a matter of contract but it cannot do so if it is a matter of statute and the decision that the regulations are law would have the result of causing detriment to the interest of the employees It might have had its place in the context of th Century There is no question of personal service in a large commercial or industrial Organisation and this consideration need not therefore stand in the way of our accepting the employees contention if it is otherwise acceptable The power of the owner in hire purchase agreement and the power of the mortgages under of the Transfer of Property Act to sell the mortgaged property by exercising his right of private sale can be usefully compared in connection with the powers conferred on <ORG> The test laid down for deciding what is a <ORG> in the <ORG> case that is of commanding other people to do or not to do a thing on pain of punishment is not there The protection given to <ORG> servants india have no parallels anywhere in the world Till then there was no statutory protection given to them See <NAME> case supra and <NAME> case supra Many a time have the learned Judges of this <ORG> felt unhappy about the time of the <ORG> being taken for days together by petty matters relating to <ORG> servants and wished that there were a separate <ORG> for dealing with these matters There is no question there of any negotiations I have read the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> with great interest and respect for the vast amount of learning and philosophical consideration that he has bestowed on the subject It is obvious therefrom however that he realises that the earlier decisions of this <ORG> do not support the view taken by him or my other learned brethren Rules and Regulations of the <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> have the force of law in Civil Appeal No of the declaration granted by <ORG> that the order removing <NAME> from service is null and void and that he continues in service is upheld of the Constitution for the reasons given in this judgment
