<ORG> Hyderabad for short the Tribunal had referred the following question under of the Gift tax Act for short the Act for the opinion of <ORG> Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was right in holding that the release by the assessee who was one of the partners in the firm of <ORG> of his rights in the assets of the firm for a consideration of Rs Briefly stated the facts leading to the filing of this appeal are as follows However he reduced the total value of the gift by Rs The appellant took up the matter in further appeal before the <ORG> <ORG> referring to the various decisions and for the reasons stated in the impugned judgment took the view in favour of the <ORG> Hence it is unnecessary for us to go into that question The learned counsel for the appellant seriously contended that <ORG> manifestly erred in answering the question in favour of the <ORG> contrary to the ratio and principles stated in the case of <NAME> supra We have carefully considered the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties In order to appreciate the respective contentions of the parties and to resolve the controversy we consider it appropriate to extract definitions of Gift and Transfer of property from Section of the Act xii gift means the transfer by one person to another of any existing movable or immovable property made voluntarily and without consideration in money or money worth and includes the transfer or conversion of any property referred to in section deemed to be a gift under that section Explanation The word transaction in clause of Section xxiv takes its colour from the main clause it must be a transfer of property in some way An interpretation clause which extends the meaning of a word does not take away its ordinary and popular meaning <NAME> then a judge of <ORG> after examining several authorities came to the conclusion that partition is really a process in and by which a joint enjoyment is transformed into an enjoyment in severalty We have to understand the meaning of those words in the context in which they are used Therefore there is no question of his either diminishing directly or indirectly the value of his own property or of increasing the value of the property of anyone else It is held that from a perusal of these provisions it would be abundantly clear that whatever may be the character of the property which is brought in by the partners when the partnership is formed or which may be acquired in the course of the business of the partnership it becomes the property of the firm and what a partner is entitled to is his share of profits if any accruing to the partnership from the realization of this property and upon dissolution of the partnership to a share in the money representing the value of the property It is further held that the partners own jointly or in common the assets of the partnership and therefore the consequence of the distribution division or allotment of assets to the partners which flows upon dissolution after discharge of liabilities is nothing but a mutual adjustment of rights between the partners and there is no question of any extinguishment of the firm rights in the partnership assets amounting to a transfer of assets within the meaning of Section of the Income tax Act If there is a sale or transfer of assets by the assessee to a person the position would be different Hence there was no element of transfer in such a case On principles and in view of the clear ratio the decision of <NAME> supra of this Court supported the case of the appellant which decision was rightly applied by the <ORG> to the facts of the case <ORG> in relation to the said decision has stated thus Be that as it may it is not for us to express any opinion on the said criticism In our opinion however the ratio of the said decision has no application to the distribution of assets as between partners whose shares inter se are specific and determined at any given point of time Section of the Estate Duty Act defines property in the following terms Further <ORG> committed an error in stating that the said decision had no application to the distribution of the assets as between the partners whose shares inter se are specific and determined at any given point of time and that the said decision had to be read and understood in the light of the subsequent decision of this Court in <NAME> case As in the case of <ORG> the coparceners do not have exclusive rights on any specific property of the family the property allotted to their shares become specified only on partition the same is the position in the case of partner of a firm In our considered view the principles stated in <NAME> case equally apply to case of allotment or adjustment of properties among the partners upon dissolution of a firm Mr Justice <NAME> rightly observed if we may say so with respect that Words in the section of a statute are not to be interpreted by having those words in one hand and the dictionary in the other The word transaction in section of the Gift tax Act takes its colour from the main clause that is it must be a transfer of property in some way We find that <NAME> case supports the view taken in <NAME> case Added to this Section of the Estate Duty Act defining property came up for consideration in <NAME> case We may state here itself that the words and expressions defined in one statute as judicially interpreted do not afford a guide to construction of the same words or expressions in another statute unless both the statutes are para materia legislations or it is specifically so provided in one statute to give the same meaning to the words as defined in other statute The same view is taken in Addl We now refer to the cases relied on by <ORG> to support its view There was also no change in the share capital standing in the name of the assessee In this situation when at the time of the reconstitution of the firm a annas share out of <NAME> annas share in the partnership firm was given to his minor sons it was taken as transfer of property by way of gift and as such it was taxable But the present case stands entirely on a different footing Having regard to all aspects and for the reasons stated above we conclude that <ORG> committed an error in answering the question in negative i in favour of the <ORG> and against the assessee appellant
