If in a suit instituted by a landlord for ejectment of his tenant with the permission of the District Magistrate obtained under Section of the Temporary Control of Rent and Eviction Act <ORG> on being moved by the tenant to pass an appropriate order under Section on the record of the case granting permission passes an order suspending the operation of the permission what is its effect on further proceedings in the suit pending in court If the above mentioned suit is decreed in the landlord favour and the tenant files an appeal and during its pendency the State Government passes an order purporting to be one in exercise of the power conferred by Section directing that the permission granted by the District Magistrate would have effect after a certain date which date is subsequent to the date of the decree under appeal what is its effect on the decree There has been little argument at the bar about the power of <ORG> to pass an interim order suspending the operation of the permission of the District Magistrate As the order cannot be read in evidence it can have no effect on the decree under appeal He then filed an application under Section of the Act before <ORG> on April Pursuant to the permission granted by the District Magistrate the respondent filed the instant suit when the application under Section was pending before <ORG> It was contended before the learned Additional Civil Judge that this order had the effect of invalidating the proceedings in the suit as no suit could be filed before December Two questions have been raised on behalf of the appellant It is next urged that the order under Section resulted in nullifying the proceedings in the suit altogether as the permission to institute the suit could be effective only after December On behalf of the respondent it was submitted that when the orders purporting to suspend the permission granted by the District Magistrate and subsequently making the permission effective only after December were passed the suit had already been instituted and no subsequent order could have any effect upon the validity of the proceedings in the suit It was urged that therefore the State Government had no jurisdiction to pass the aforementioned order under Section A further argument raised on behalf of the respondent to meet the second contention of the appellant is that the State Government had no jurisdiction to attach any condition to the permission granted by the District Magistrate It appears to me that the central issue in controversy is whether upon a suit being instituted upon permission duly obtained from the District Magistrate a subsequent order made by the State Government under Section could have any legal effect upon the proceedings in the suit Section of the Act declares Subject to any order passed under Sub section no suit shall without the permission of the District Magistrate be filed in any civil court against the tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on one or more of the following grounds Learned counsel for the appellant contends that the permission granted by the District Magistrate under Section is dependent for its validity upon an order passed in revision by the Commissioner under Section and an order passed by the State Government under Section and that it is immaterial that the suit for ejectment has already been instituted before the orders under Section and were passed Reference was also made to the decision in <NAME> State of Civil Misc All which reaffirmed the view taken in Dr <NAME> case All supra On the other hand reliance is placed for the respondent on the view taken by one of us in <NAME> <NAME> All and it is urged that the provisions of the section merely bar the institution of a suit for ejectment that the bar is removed if the District Magistrate grants permission and that once permission is granted the bar is raised and a landlord can enter a court and that any subsequent order can have no effect It is true that the permission to sue granted by the District Magistrate is subject to any order passed in revision by the Commissioner under Section and thereafter by the State Government under Section but it the order under Section or Section is to have any effect in law it must be passed before the suit is instituted There is nothing in the Act which expressly makes the proceedings in a suit dependent upon an order subsequently passed under Section or Section and the words subject to any order passed under Sub section in Section do not make the validity of the proceedings in a pending suit dependent upon any such order There is nothing in the Act it appears to me which requires the landlord to wait before he institutes a suit and that being so there can be no question of a landlord hurrying or rushing to a court to institute the suit There is no period of limitation within which the tenant must have recourse to the remedy under Section and upon a suit instituted by the landlord for ejectment a tenant may prolong the proceedings by resorting to the remedies available to him by appeal to the first appellate court and then to this court and even further to <ORG> and he may at a very late stage of the litigation approach <ORG> under Section and succeed in obtaining an order quashing the permission and thus nullifying the entire proceedings in the litigation If there is a lacuna in the statute or if the statute contains a detective provision it is a matter for the <ORG> to remedy As the provision stands it merely imposes a ban upon the institution of the suit and it does not make the validity of the proceedings in the suit dependent upon any order passed alter the suit has been instituted I am not convinced that the <ORG> intended that a suit for ejectment filed after permission was granted must fail because subsequently the order granting permission was quashed or modified by a superior administrative authority My answer to the two questions referred is that the suit having been instituted after permission to do so was granted neither the subsequent order under Section by the State Government suspending the operation of the permission nor the later order under that provision purporting to make the permission operative after a certain date can have any effect on the proceedings in the suit or the decree passed in it I agree with my brother <NAME> The words subject to any order passed under Sub section govern the ban on the filing of a suit in civil court without the District Magistrate permission Only the filing of a suit is subject to any order passed under Sub section of Section There is no sense in saying that the ban is subject to an order which has no connection with it It must be this ban which is affected by the order passed under Sub section in order that it is subject to it No such order however is contemplated by Section at all The circumstances on which the ban rests must exist at the time of the filing of the suit they cannot come into existence subsequently in the absence of an express provision giving retrospective effect to them Now no retrospective effect is given to an order passed under Sub section When there is the District Magistrate permission at the time of the filing of the suit the ban does not operate and there is nothing in Sub section to suggest that any subsequent event such as the passing of an order under Sub section can bring it into operation Sub section does not deal with the passing of an order affecting the ban either imposing it or restricting it There is absolutely nothing in the Act barring the provisions under consideration suggesting that the legislature had such an intention and it is not open to the <ORG> to make a wild guess at the legislature intention and to place upon the words used by it the interpretation to effectuate it even though they are not capable of bearing it A <ORG> can only construe a statute and cannot construct one and there is no problem of construing when the words used in a statute bear only one meaning The provision in Sub section imposes a Restriction upon a landlord right to sue for ejectment of a tenant whose tenancy has been terminated in accordance with the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act Section imposing a restriction upon this right can be said to restrict his right to hold and dispose of property and also to discriminate him from another person who has been kept out of possession by the trespasser it section infringes the rights guaranteed by Articles and of the Constitution it must be reasonable in order to be valid Sub section of Section does not refer to any order passed by <ORG> under Sub section the ban is not expressed to be subject to such an order It is immaterial that an order passed by the Commissioner under Sub section is declared to be subject to <ORG> order this provision does not make the ban subject to <ORG> order If the permission granted by the District Magistrate is cancelled by the Commissioner before the suit is filed it may be said that the ban comes into operation and that it is a case of without the permission of the District Magistrate because of the cancellation In such a case the words subject to any order passed under Sub section are redundant even without them the ban would exist The power to pass an order is one thing and the effect of the order another The only order that would have any effect on a suit already filed is one directing that it must be deemed to have been filed without the permission or that it must be dismissed An order simply cancelling the District Magistrate permission has not the effect of such an order The question whether the Commissioner has power under Sub section to pass an order that the suit though filed with the District Magistrate permission must be deemed to hive been filed without it or that it must be dismissed has not been raised before us The District Magistrate if concerned only with the question whether the filing of the suit should be permitted or not he has no other jurisdiction under Sub section The Commissioner when trying to revise his order has not any greater jurisdiction than him and cannot pass any order which could not have been passed by him Since the District Magistrate has no jurisdiction over the suit after it has been instituted the Commissioner also has no jurisdiction after it has been instituted and cannot in his order under Sub section require it to be dismissed So it appears to me that though what he can do under Sub section is expressed in wide language he cannot pass either of the orders which only would have effect upon the suit already filed If the District Magistrate has refused permission the ban comes into operation and no suit can be filed When <ORG> passes an order under Sub section there are several possibilities Another is that the District Magistrate and the Commissioner both refused permission and <ORG> maintain their refusal or grant the permission Under Section <ORG> has jurisdiction in a case granting or refusing to grant permission for the filing of a suit for eviction referred to in Section In the instant case the permission was granted by the District Magistrate and the State Government had jurisdiction under Section to call for the record of the case disposed of by him and to make such order as it thought necessary When the whole provision in Sub section deals with the stage of the filing of a suit and the District Magistrate has no jurisdiction to pass any order after the suit has been filed the State Government can have no jurisdiction to interfere with a suit after it has been filed such as that of staying further proceedings in it Section deals not only with a casa of granting or refusing to grant permission but also with an order passed under Section or under Section A because power has been conferred upon it over the records of any of these three kinds of cases what it can do is expressed in such wide language The width of the power conferred by Section must be limited by the scope of Sub sections and of Section The State Government exercising jurisdiction under Section in respect of permission granted under Section does not exercise jurisdiction over the civil Court in which a suit has been filed on the basis of the permission Consequently it has no jurisdiction to pass any order against it or directing it to do or not to do a certain act It has no jurisdiction to stay proceedings in the suit or to direct that it should not be decreed This means that any order passed by <ORG> has no effect on them The provisions of Sub sections and have not been given retrospective effect and there is no justification for implying that orders under these sub sections cancelling the District Magistrate permission renders the suit filed on its basis one filed without it Our learned brother has not considered the meaning of the words subject to used in Sub section and has not considered what is subject to an order passed under Sub section I have explained above that according to the rules of grammar the words subject to any order passed under Sub section can be read only with the words no suit shall be filed If sanction is required if certain circumstances exist it is to be seen whether they exist or not on the day on which the legal proceeding is taken cognizance of
