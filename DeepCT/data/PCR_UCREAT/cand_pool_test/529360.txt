There is no doubt that under <ORG> a member of a Marumakkattayam <ORG> on his conversion to <ORG> would forfeit all interest in the <ORG> property The proposition that conversion has the effect of depriving the convert of his right of survivorship which may often be a most valuable right as when the joint family consists of an old father and two brothers one of whom becomes a convert appears to be opposed to the express provisions of the Statute that conversion is not to involve any forfeiture of property or rights Now that was not a case governed by Act XXI of or the earlier Bengal Regulation VII of as the family had been converted to Christianity long before they were passed and the property in suit had all been acquired after conversion and it seems to me with great respect that in the observations at page on which reliance is placed as to conversion severing the convert from the family and putting an end to the co parcenership Lord <NAME> was merely stating the undoubted effect under <ORG> of conversion to another religion and was not considering the effect of Act XXI of on cases governed by it Indeed he expressly says so at page and points out that Act XXI had no application to the case Such then being the state of the case so far as the Hindu Law is concerned we must next consider whether there is any other Law which determines the rights over the property of a Hindu becoming a convert to Christianity This contention their Lordships rejected observing at page that The effect of the legislations of and was that on <NAME> abandonment of Hinduism <NAME> did not acquire any enforceable right to his father share in the joint family property which he could either assert himself or transmit to his heirs for enforcement in <ORG> These observations may however have been made with reference to the case then set up that the properties in suit were all the self acquired properties of <NAME> On the whole I have come to the conclusion that there is nothing in any of the decisions to prevent us from giving effect to what appears to me to be the plain bearing of Act XXI of and I must therefore hold that the plaintiffs are not entitled to a partition of the tarwad property by reason of their not being Hindus and that the Appeal fails and must be dismissed with costs The question of the plaintiff right to succeed to the office of <ORG> is not before us and I express no opinion about it as it may involve other considerations That case might have been decided upon the short points that after <NAME> died all the family being Christians were governed in matters of succession by the Indian Succession Act that plaintiff having an interest in the property of her deceased husband <NAME> had a right under Section of the Transfer of Property Act to institute a suit for redemption and that in a suit for redemption all persons interested should be joined as parties I agree with the conclusions arrived at by my <NAME> and <NAME> whose judgments I have had the advantage of perusing It is clear that a member of a tarwad has no right to claim partition as tarwad property is indivisible and no one member nor even all but one can enforce a division upon any who object If a member while a Hindu has no right to claim partition against the will of the other members of the tarwad it is difficult to see how he acquires the right by apostacy It is argued that conversion severs the co parcenary and that consequently gives rise to a claim for partition and separate enjoyment The obligations consequent upon and connected with the tie must as it seems to their Lordships be dissolved with it Parcenership may be put an end to by severance effected by partition it must as their Lordships think equally be put an end to by severance which the Hindu Law recognizes and creates He may renounce the old law by which he was bound as he has renounced his old religion or if he thinks fit he may abide by the old law notwithstanding he has renounced his old religion It seems to me that these observations do not necessarily lead to the result that when by the very nature of the property no right to partition exists before conversion mere severance of the co parcenary would give a person that right The contention was that the property was the joint property of <NAME> children that the plaintiff who was no member of the tarwad had no right to redeem and that the right vested in the surviving children of <NAME> and <NAME> which I have already set but are borne in mind I do not think conversion makes the convert a tenant in common and even if it did I do not think it further gives him a right to partition on the analogy of a <NAME> family I would dismiss the Second Appeal with costs of defendants Nos to and to
