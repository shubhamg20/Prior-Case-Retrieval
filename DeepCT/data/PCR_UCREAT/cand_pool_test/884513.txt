He submitted an interim report on To that extent the order granting licence to parties for each of the cities was set aside It is borne out by records that out of the seven criteria in evaluating the financial bid six parameters alone were taken into consideration The matter has been reconsidered in the light of the judgment delivered by <ORG> in this case The English decision on this aspect which will support the contention is <ORG> <NAME> In law there is no degree of bias Therefore there is a breach of the fundamental condition of the bid <ORG> had been rejected at various stages of consideration on the ground that there was criminal complaint investigation pending against it <ORG> noted that no material had been brought on record to show that there was any complaint against <ORG> There are five glaring errors in the selection The counter affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> does not mention that there was a delay by <ORG> as held by <ORG> On the contrary the facts disclose there was no delay whatever There is a <ORG> inquiry pending against it SCC at paragraph this Court has held that there is an obligation to communicate the reasons Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for <ORG> in opposing the arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants submits that service operation should not be read in a narrow sense Hence there is no question of <ORG> condoning the defect In the case of <ORG> there is an unconditional compliance The documents filed by the respondent clearly show that there is a surplus of approximately three crore rupees available from the foreign collaborator in the first year There was no <ORG> inquiry on the date of the above judgment No doubt there is a failure in the first instance to state about compliance with Chapters and IV This is an accidental omission Other argument is advanced that there is a defect in the compliance statement It must be left to the authorities The contrary arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants against this respondent are not tenable There is a possibility of fallibility inherent in all fact findings There is no mention of any particular criterion on the basis of which the selection was to be made In this case there is no such reasonable likelihood Even if this condition has been relaxed in favour of certain bidders there is nothing wrong With regard to the foreign collaborator of <ORG> there was no change In any event where the judgment of <ORG> had been given effect to and a proper evaluation has been done no interference is warranted This shows that there was lack of candour on the part of the <ORG> It is mentioned that <ORG> was taken into consideration Having regard to the above arguments we propose to deal with the matter from the following five aspects However it must be clearly stated that there are inherent limitations in exercise of that power of judicial review Of course if the said power is exercised for any collateral purpose the exercise of that power will be struck down It is not intended to take away from those authorities the powers and AC All ER All ER discretions properly vested in them by law and to substitute the courts as the bodies making the decisions In the leading judgment of Lord <NAME> of Killowen the approach to be adopted by the court was set out In an extempore judgment Lord <NAME> drew attention to the fact that the word unreasonable had often been used in a sense which comprehended different grounds of review He summarised the principles as follows The <ORG> is entitled to investigate the action of the local authority with a view to seeing whether or not they have taken into account matters which they ought not to have taken into account or conversely have refused to take into account or neglected to take into account matter which they ought to take into account Once that question is answered in favour of the local authority it may still be possible to say that although the local authority had kept within the four comers of the matters which they ought to consider they have nevertheless come to a conclusion so unreasonable that no reasonable authority could ever have come to it Thus in <ORG> <ORG> the Secretary of <ORG> referred to a number of factors which led him to the conclusion that a non resident bar in a hotel was operated in such a way that the bar was not an incident of the hotel use for planning purposes but constituted a separate use <ORG> analysed the factors which led the Secretary of <ORG> to that conclusion and having done so set it aside Such a situation as a state court expressed it many years ago is not a case of the blind leading the blind but of one who has always been deaf and blind insisting that he can see and hear better than one who has always had his eyesight and hearing and has always used them to the utmost advantage in ascertaining the truth in regard to the matter in question If the decision making body is influenced by considerations which ought not to influence it or fails to take into account matters which it ought to take into account the court will interfere In exercising these powers the courts will take into account any reasons which the body may give for its decisions If it gives no reasons in a case when it may reasonably be expected to do so the courts may infer that it has no good reason for reaching its conclusion and act accordingly There are no talismanic words that can avoid the process of judgment Sir <NAME> in <ORG> ex <ORG> observed thus We are sitting as a public law court concerned to review an administrative decision albeit one which has to be reached by the application of judicial or quasi judicial principles and finality unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary Within the bounds of legal reasonableness is the area in which the deciding authority has genuinely free discretion With the question whether a particular policy is wise or foolish the court is not concerned it can only interfere if to pursue it is beyond the powers of the authority In the arguments there is some general misapprehension of the scope of the reasonableness test in administrative law There is no unfettered discretion in public law A public authority possesses powers only to use them for public good It is not possible for courts to question and adjudicate every decision taken by an authority because many of the Government Undertakings which in due course have acquired the monopolist position in matters of sale and purchase of products and with so many ventures in hand they can come out with a plea that it is not always possible to act like a quasi judicial authority while awarding contracts this Court held thus SCC para the Government had the right to either accept or reject the lowest offer but that of course if done on a policy should be on some rational and reasonable grounds Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for <ORG> argued that there are clear instances of arbitrariness It has alsomade distinction between loans from public financial institutions and banks Therefore there is a confusion on the part of <ORG> about this requirement with loans from the banks Therefore no dividend would have been paid to their foreign collaborators participating in the equity of company When a subscriber goes into the area of another operator who has a roaming agreement with his another operator the details of the subscriber available in the HLR Home Location Register of the home MSC Mobile Switching Centre are obtained by the visitor MSC and placed in the VLR Visitor Location Register How should the test of disqualification for likelihood of bias be formulated A more common formulation of the test is Would a member of the public looking at the situation as a whole reasonably suspect that a member of the adjudicating body would be biased Another common formulation is Is there in fact a real likelihood of bias There is no need on either formulation to prove actual bias indeed the courts may refuse to entertain submissions designed to establish the actual bias of a member of an independent tribunal on the ground that such an inquiry would be unseemly Seldom indeed will one find a situation in which reasonable persons adequately apprised of the facts will reasonably suspect bias but a court reviewing the facts will hold that there was no real likelihood of bias In ninety nine cases out of a hundred it is enough for the court to ask itself whether a reasonable person viewing the facts would think that there was a substantial possibility of bias Unlike allegations of bias by reason of the pecuniary interest of the decision maker however allegations of bias founded upon a personal involvement will only result in disqualification where there is a real likelihood that a hearing will not be fair But not all family relationships will disqualify and by way of contrast on the circumstances of one particular case it was said that a board of adjustment could decide an application by a company for permission to develop a free parking area despite the fact that an employee of the company was the wife of one board member and the fact that a third or fourth cousin of another board member was the president of the company Disqualification on the basis of personal involvement is not of course limited to the above two situations but may result whenever there is a sufficient nexus between the decision maker and a party to justify the appearance that this nexus may influence the decision reached of <NAME> <ORG> ex <NAME> dissented only on the inference to be drawn from the facts <NAME> of the grounds of his application might create a more sinister impression than the full facts as found by this court all or most of which would have been available to the applicant had he pursued his inquiries on learning that Mr <NAME> was a member of <ORG> and none of these further facts was disputed at the hearing of this motion In <ORG> <NAME> it was held thus All ER in considering whether there was a real likelihood of bias the court does not look at the mind of the justice himself or at the mind of the chairman of the tribunal or whoever it may be who sits in a judicial capacity It does not look to see if there was a real likelihood that he would or did in fact favour one side at the expense of the other The court looks at the impression which would be given to other people Even if he was as impartial as could be nevertheless if right minded persons would think that in the circumstances there was a real likelihood of bias on his part then he should not sit We accept the view of Cross expressed in <NAME> <ORG> that there is really little if any difference between the two tests If a reasonable person who has no knowledge of the matter beyond knowledge of the relationship which subsists between some members of the tribunal and one of the parties would think that there might well be bias then there is in his opinion a real likelihood of bias Of course someone else with inside knowledge of the character of the members in question might say Although things don look very well in fact there is no real likelihood of bias In our opinion there is and can be no doubt about the validity of this principle and we are prepared to assume that this principle applies not only to the justices as mentioned by <NAME> but to all tribunals and bodies which are given jurisdiction to determine judicially the rights of parties There is a good deal of shallow talk that the judicial robe does not change the man within it When there is ground for believing that such unconscious feelings may operate in the ultimate judgment or may not unfairly lead others to believe they are operating judges rescue themselves It is not enough to show that even if there was misconduct on his part the award was unaffected by it and was in reality just arbitrator must not do anything which is not in itself fair and impartial There must in my opinion be reasonable evidence to satisfy us that there was a real likelihood of bias In this case as noted above the crucial test is whether there was a real likelihood of bias As to how Mr <NAME> the son of Mr <NAME> came to be appointed in <ORG> is explained in the additional affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> Respondent by Mr <NAME> Corporate Personnel Manager of <ORG> including Respondent Company There are officers of his rank As such he could exercise all the powers under Section of the Indian Telegraphs Act of Such a <ORG> has the right to grant cellular operating licences to the successful party and also reject any bids without assigning any reason An adjudicator who is subject to disqualification on the ground of bias or interest in the matter which he has to decide may in certain circumstances be required to adjudicate if there is no other person who is competent or authorised to be adjudicator or if a quorum cannot be formed without him or if no other competent tribunal can be constituted Since we have reached this conclusion we are not going to the other questions argued by Mr <NAME> whether <ORG> or <ORG> could urge this point relating to bias After finding that only three companies qualified for selection on the following note was made by Mr <NAME> Adviser Operations The financial bid which was approved by the apex committee was given to the short listed bidders and these were received and opened on It is evident that the bidder has serious reservations about financial conditions and operative conditions and if granted a licence there is a possibility of litigation <ORG> on an exclusive basis While making the final selection it should be borne in mind that <ORG> has got a problem which is explained in the notes of <ORG> placed below On the Chairman TC made the following note In pursuance of the orders of the <ORG> a Committee consisting of Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister in his capacity as Chairman <ORG> Secretary <ORG> Secretary <ORG> and <ORG> was appointed to make recommendations regarding selection of the franchisees to provide Cellular Mobile Telephone Service in the four metro cities <ORG> indicated the parameters in which it stated that the committee decided to consider foreign companies who have experience of operating a cellular system of at least five years and who have developed a reasonable sized network subscribers Inter alia it stated in the report of <ORG> Also since GSM technology is only now beginning to come into commercial operation the <ORG> decided to consider foreign companies who have experience of operating a cellular system of at least years and who have developed a reasonable sized network subscribers There was no mention of <ORG> At the beginning of there were already some million subscribers The reliance placed by Mr <NAME> and learned Solicitor General on paragraph Even otherwise the respondents say that this had no impact in the case of <ORG> as its collaborators included <ORG> who was one of the largest service providers in Experience of providing service was an important consideration and experience of <ORG> in computing <ORG> foreign collaborators was correctly included in the computations and thus its experience exceeded lakh lines Therefore there is nothing wrong in the same There is no change in joint venture Mr <NAME> has rightly placed reliance on the abovesaid two rulings relevant passages are quoted as under Para of the note makes it clear that the <ORG> took the view that para alone incorporated the minimum pre qualifying eligibility conditions and the data called for under para was in the nature of general requirements They only decided in view of the contentions raised by the appellant that para should als be treated as part of the pre qualifying conditions that they would make it specific and clear in their future NITs that only the fulfillment of pre qualifying conditions would be mandatory The first is that the party issuing the tender has the right to punctiliously and rigidly enforce them Thus if a party does not strictly comply with the requirements of para or VI of the NIT it is open to the <ORG> to decline to consider the party for the contract and if a party comes to court saying that the <ORG> should be stopped from doing so the court will decline relief The requirements in a tender notice can be classified into two categories those which lay down the essential conditions of eligibility and the others which are merely ancillary or subsidiary with the main object to be achieved by the condition It further observed We therefore find that stand of the petitioner that any undue preference had been given to some of the companies cannot be upheld It should not loom large because there was a confusion as to who was competent authority to receive the application Therefore obviously there is no reference to either Chapter III Operating Conditions or Chapter IV Financial Conditions There is no remedy no escape We find great force in this submission I have examined the case again Any delay in allotment of licence to <ORG> on account of the <ORG> investigations will have the least adverse effect in Madras for lack of competition to other licensee There was nothing on the record of the respondents to suggest that any <ORG> enquiry was pending against this company There was no FIR and no preliminary report adverse to the company and we feel the ghost of <ORG> has been unnecessarily brought into play However since the company has not complained we will leave the matter at that Therefore as on the date of selection there was no adverse report against <ORG> That matter has been reconsidered in the light of the judgment delivered by <ORG> in this case and a revised list of provisionally selected bidders in the cities of Bombay Delhi Calcutta and Madras has been prepared Therefore there is a clear violation of the principle of natural justice a joint venture company has not been formed as stipulated in the tender and there is no indication of the equity structure or the extent of participation of the foreign collaborators In view of the foregoing we thus reach the conclusion that <ORG> could not claim the experience of <ORG> Civil Appeals arising out of SLP No of SLP No of and TC No of will stand dismissed with no order as to costs
