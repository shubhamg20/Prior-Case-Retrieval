In the course of the execution proceeding the parties appear to have come to terms the judgment debtor agreeing to pay the decretal amount in instalments extending over several years the last date being th January The decree holder filed an application for execution on loth January for recovery of the balance claimed by attachment and sale of the property of the judgment debtor He admitted that the last application for execution was for the arrest of the judgment debtor which had been struck off on nd August on a compromise having been entered into between the parties for the payment of the amount by instalments It however held that the original execution case was still pending and the Court had the right to reopen it at any time and pass fresh orders The first question that arises in this case is whether a compromise can ha validly entered into in an execution proceeding and to be treated as a decree capable of execution While an application for execution dated st March was pending and a warrant for the arrest of the judgment debtor had been issued the parties entered into a compromise and a written application was filed in <ORG> on th August signed both by the judgment debtor and the decree holder They agreed that the decretal amount should be paid in nine instalments spread over four years The judgment debtor paid all the first instalments in due time On the same date the decree holder filed the present application for execution claiming Rs The case was referred to a larger Beach because it involved questions of law of some importance The appeal as an appeal must fail on a ground which was neither brought to the notice of the learned single judge of this Court nor was it suggested before the Bench which referred the case to us nor has it been pressed before us on behalf of the respondent As the point involves a question of jurisdiction it can be taken up in the Letters Patent Appeal even for the first time where it was held that an order passed in execution by <ORG> was not a decree within the meaning of Section Civil and that no appeal lay from it to the District Judge A right of appeal from an order in execution has been conferred by Section and the appeal lies to the <ORG> which can hear an appeal from the decree in the suit But Section provides that no appeal shall lie from any order passed in appeal Accordingly no second appeal lay to the High <ORG> from the order passed by the District Judge in the execution appeal before him Accordingly we have no power to interfere with the order passed by the District Judge on appeal There was room for argument under the old Tenancy Act that a civil revision could be entertained from an order passed by the District Judge even in a revenue appeal that under Section Tenancy Act only selected provisions of the Civil Procedure Code are made applicable to cases under this Act and list Schedule clearly excludes the provisions of Section Civil Both Section and the heading in list Schedule show that Section is not applicable to suits and other proceedings under this Act It follows that <ORG> has no power to revise orders passed by a District Judge however ultra vires irregular or illegal it may be It was observed in <NAME> case A I All The learned advocate for the respondent contends that it would be anomalous to allow revision from the order of the original <ORG> which has been affirmed by the District Judge when <ORG> has no power to interfere with the order of the District Judge If the order of the District Judge proceeds on grounds which do not appeal to <ORG> it may in spite of that order set aside the order of <ORG> if it is open to any one of the three objections mentioned in the section It therefore seems to me that a revision from the order of the Assistant Collector lies if there has been a want of jurisdiction a failure to exercise jurisdiction or illegality or material irregularity irrespective of the question whether an appeal has been filed before the District Judge This civil revision would have been ordinarily cognizable by a single Judge but we also have jurisdiction to interfere in revision suo moto There is accordingly nothing to prevent us from interfering As will be pointed out later <ORG> failed to record any finding that there was any fraud of the judgment debtor which prevented the execution of the decree at some time within years immediately before the present application for execution and yet applied Section a to the case Even before the Bench which heard this appeal first there was no suggestion that the prayers in the earlier and the later applications were substantially the same As mentioned above one of the questions which the Bench considered would arise in the case was whether when a new relief is claimed the present application can be treated as one for revival of the old one It does not purport to be an application for a revival of the previous application and there is no suggestion in it that the previous application is still pending There was no concealment of any fact nor any misrepresentation on the part of the judgment debtor Indeed the fact that the judgment debtor paid the eighth instalment even alter the expiry of years and at tempts to pay the ninth instalment also shows that he had no intention in to stop payment as soon as years expired <ORG> did not record any definite finding that at the time of the compromise the judgment debtor had the dishonest intention of pleading limitation after the years had expired The learned advocate for the decree holder supports the decree of the learned Judge of this <ORG> on the ground that there was a subsequent order for the payment of money at certain dates within the meaning of Section The learned single Judge of this <ORG> has naturally followed the <ORG> ruling in <NAME> <NAME> All where it was laid down that a subsequent order directing payment of money in Section means a subsequent order made by the <ORG> which male the decree an acting as that <ORG> and not an order of a <ORG> executing the decree The learned Judges added that in all probability the section contemplates orders made under Order Rule Section contains the substantive provision of the Cole whereas Order It Section is accordingly of a wider scope and there is no reason to confine it to the particular orders passed under Order Rule The view taken in <NAME> case All that Section contemplates a subsequent order passed by the original <ORG> and not the execution <ORG> has been followed by other <ORG>s as well expressly dissented from the view taken in <NAME> case All and held that the expression any subsequent order cannot be limited to orders passed by the Court which passed the decree but means any order made by a competent Court I would say with great respect that such a position is utterly untenable The function of an execution <ORG> is to execute the decree as it finds it and not to substitute a new decree there for even though the substitution may be with the consent of the parties Such an agreement may be a binding contract between the parties enforceable by a separate suit but it cannot take the place of the original decree and become itself capable of execution But the Allahabad case was based on an interpretation of Sections and of the old Code and reference was also made to Section A of the Code of for which there is no corresponding provision in the new Code The general observations made by the learned Judge were in the nature of an obiter dictum In view of the opinion expressed by their Lordships of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> All Now Order Rule makes Rule of that order inapplicable to execution proceedings and there is therefore no obligation on an execution Court to record a compromise as it would have to do in a pending suit that the word suit in Order Rule was used in a broad sense as including not only the stages of suit to its termination by the decree of the first Court but as including its appellate stage and proceedings in execution of the decree made in the suit But unless passed at the time of the passing of the decree such an order can be passed only on the application of the judgment debtor with the consent of the decree holder Had the legislature intended that the <ORG> has always an inherent power to accept a compromise of this kind entered into between the parties the short period of limitation would not have been prescribed But where the decree is self contained the mere fact that the contingency mentioned in it has occurred subsequently would not justify the making of a fresh executable order by the <ORG> which had become functus officio after the passing of the decree On the contrary in some cases it has been suggested that if an order purporting to have been passed under Section corresponding to Order Rule has been passed on an application filed more than six months after the decree it cannot be treated as an order under that section inasmuch as the <ORG> on that date had no jurisdiction to pass an order under that section more than six months having elapsed from the date of the decree Banarsi Das Ramzan A I hah Just as a decree passed in a suit which was time barred is binding on the parties and the question of limitation is by implication deemed to have been decided against the defendant so an order for payment by instalment is binding on the judgment debtor When the <ORG> prevents the judgment debtor from impugning such an order it is not giving effect to any contract to get out of the law of limitation but is enforcing the principle of res judicata against him When the decree holder takes advantage of such an order he is not trying to extend the period fixed in Section by any contract between the parties but he is merely urging that there is in existence a subsequent order binding on the parties although it so happens that that order had been passed on a time barred application without any objection Where the execution <ORG> happens to be the same <ORG> which made the decree one need not be too technical in insisting that the order must have been pissed by the original <ORG> acting as such and not acting in the execution department On the other hand if an execution <ORG> merely records a compromise entered into between the parties it does not necessarily pass an order of its own Order is defined in Section as the formal expression of any decision by a civil <ORG> which is not a decree As the operative portion of the judgment of <NAME> was correct I would dismiss the appeal but in the exercise of my revisional jurisdiction I would set aside the order of the Assistant Collector on the ground of material irregularity and dismiss the application for execution for the reasons given above After some applications for execution had been made from time to time an application was made on sfc March The decree holder refused to accept this amount on the ground which was correct that it was insufficient and the day after the expiry of the date fixed for payment he made an application for execution By Section Agra Tenancy Laws an appeal to the District Judge is allowed in the case of an execution of a decree for profits but by Section no further appeal is allowed It does appear that <ORG> has no jurisdiction to interfere in revision with the order of a District Judge passed by him in a revenue matter on appeal The result is that where a Revenue Court passes a right order and on appeal the District Judge passes a wrong order and the District Judge Order is otherwise capable of being revised by this Court the District Judge order cannot be touched If he had found on evidence however flimsy that such was the case there would have been no case for <ORG> for interference Now I come to the question whether the compromise which was entered into by the parties on th August was in the nature of a subsequent order within the meaning of Clause Section Civil By Section no application for execution shall be entertainable by a <ORG> executing a decree if it was made more than years after the date of the decree or more than years after the date fixed for payment by the decree or by any subsequent order But before I take up this question I would like to say one word about an argument which prevailed before the learned District Judge and which was The principal question that arises is whether an order passed by an execution <ORG> as such by which it accepts as in the present case a compromise and directs that the terms of the compromise should be carried out and orders the judgment debtor to pay the decretal amount on the dates fixed amounts to or not a subsequent order within the meaning of Section Where the decree says that a certain sum of money is to be paid at once it will not be open to an executing <ORG> to say that the decretal amount shall be paid in a different way i by instalments and on dates convenient to the judgment debtor But for the purpose of such an order the parties must go to the <ORG> which passed the decree and within six months of the making of the decree as provided by Article Schedule Lim It may be that where the parties approach the <ORG> which passed the decree after six months and the delay is overlooked by the parties and the <ORG> and then an order as contemplated by Order Rule is passed and is not set aside on appeal the order will be binding on the parties on the ground of res judicata but that is not the case here In this case it cannot be pretended that the parties were approaching the <ORG> to exercise its powers under Order Rule Civil even if we assume that the Assistant Collector <ORG> was the very <ORG> which had made the decree for profits in I am of opinion therefore that on principle the subsequent order must be an order made by the <ORG> which passed the decree and not an order made in the course of execution But Section a is no longer the law and Order Rule clearly states that the rule as to withdrawal and adjustment of suits does not apply to proceedings in execution of a decree or order is one of the few exceptions I have in mind Before leaving the case I might notice the last argument of the learned Counsel for the respondent namely in the case of a decree directing delivery of property what would be a subsequent order within the meaniug of Section if it be not an order made in the execution department For reasons already given I am clear that an order made in the execution of a decree cannot be a subsequent order within the meaning of Section Section Civil allows the <ORG> to make such orders as may be necessary in the ends of justice and it is conceivable that there may be a case in which in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction as recognize by the said Section a <ORG> may direct a certain property to be delivered at a date other than the date already fixed by the decree passed In the result I would set aside the judgment of <NAME> on the ground that he had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal upholding his decree dismissing the appeal to <ORG> take up the case in revision and setting aside the order of execution passed on the respondent application of th January would direct the said application to stand dismissed I have had the advantage of seeing the judgment of my brother <NAME> and as I am in practical agreement with him it is not necessary for me to discuss every point The facts are very fully set out in the judgment of my brother and there is only one further fact to which I shall have to refer later Where an appeal has in fact been filed the section give us no power to revise the order of the District Judge but does give <ORG> power to revise the order of the subordinate <ORG> in this case <ORG> We can on the hypothesis we are considering set aside the order of the trial Court but it is right and does not require to be set aside while we cannot touch the order of the District Judge though it is very wrong wrong actually within Clauses a or Section Taken as a whole the result in my view should be to incline the <ORG> strongly if there was room for the view to hold that power with it to act under Section Civil but that power is excluded by Section and Schedule list Tenancy Act for it is impossible without undue straining of language to hold that an appeal is not a proceeding No other view therefore is possible than that our revisional power is restricted to Section Tenancy Act and further it is clear that we have power to revise under Section the order of the Assistant Collector an if we did so revise it the order of the District Judge in appeal can only be treated as a nullity As to whether there are grounds for our interference agree with my brother that the Assistant Collector did not in fact find that any fraud was committed within the period of years The order is itself ambiguous and I think that as we shall be holding in this case that <ORG> has no power to vary the terms of the decree we should not assume that the Assistant Collector was passing an order which he had no power to pass unless his action is capable of no other interpretation I think therefore that he did not pass any order and the question whether he would have power to pass such an order so as to extend the period of limitation under Section Civil does not arise But I would add that if it be treated as an order I agree that <ORG> has no power to pass such an order There is only one further point to which need briefly refer and that is the question whether the proceeding of th January was merely a continuation of the original application of March or whether that application had finally terminated on th August and the application of th January was an entirely new proceeding I agree with the order proposed by <NAME> We dismissthe appeal but in the exercise of our revisional jurisdiction we set aside the order of the Assistant Collector dated thFebruary and dismiss the application for execution In the circumstances of this case we direct that the parties should bear their own costs throughout
