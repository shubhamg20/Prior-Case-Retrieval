We think that the whole amount decreed became due on the first default in payment of the instalments viz on the th June so that three years and nine days had elapsed when the plaintiff made his present application for execution The principles however on which that case was decided apply in this case There is not in the last clause of Article of Schedule II of Act IX of which clause relates to decrees payable by instalments any provision similar to that in Article of the same schedule with respect to promissory notes or bonds payable by instalments where such notes or bonds provide that if default be made in payment of one instalment the whole shall be due fixing that the period of limitation shall begin to run from the time of the first default unless where the obligee waives the benefit of the provision and then when fresh default is made The first question of the learned Judge we whether a decree payable by instalments with proviso as aforesaid is barred if application for execution of the same be not made within three years from the date on which any one instalment fell due and was not paid must be answered in the affirmative and his second question as to whether the payment of instalments subsequent to default in payment of the first instalment at the date specified gives to the judgment creditor a fresh starting point must be answered in the negative
