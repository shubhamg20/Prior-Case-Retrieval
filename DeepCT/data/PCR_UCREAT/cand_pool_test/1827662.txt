Before us it has been contended that the plaintiffs are not entitled to possession as under Section of the Bengal Tenancy Act the oral sub lease to them is not valid against defendant No who for this purpose it is argued stands in the position of landlord So clearly the doctrine of merger would not help the appellant Then is there anything in the Act which assists him Our attention has been drawn to Section and there no doubt it is provided that where the entire interests of the landlord and the raiyat in the holding became united in the same person by transfer succession or otherwise the occupancy right shall cease to exist but nothing in this section shall prejudicially affect the rights of any third person It may be a question whether it can be said on the facts of this case that entire interest of the raiyat has united with that of the landlords then there is a continuing intermediate interest between that of the landlord and the undertenant which still furnishes an answer to any claim under Section The result is that in my opinion the conclusion at which <ORG> arrived is correct and this appeal must be dismissed with costs This objection is I think well founded whether the question can be raised in a future suit or proceeding must be determined in that suit or proceeding and its determination cannot be anticipated in this suit which is accordingly dismissed with costs
