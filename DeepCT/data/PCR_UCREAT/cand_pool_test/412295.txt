This appeal adds another case to the long list of cases which have reference to the effect of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure The facts of the present case are of an unusual nature and there is no reported decision which directly covers it In <NAME> assigned his rights to one <NAME> who remained in possession of the property as a monthly tenant of <NAME> until when he purchased the property from <NAME> The suit out of which this appeal arises was filed by the appellant against <NAME> and <NAME> for possession A second appeal to this Court followed and was heard by <NAME> who agreed with the District Munsif on the question of the application of Section but granted him leave to file an appeal under Clause of the Letters Patent The question which falls for decision is in what capacity did <NAME> obtain possession of the property from his sister If he obtained possession of the property in the same capacity as he held at the time of the sale in execution the appeal fails but if he obtained it in another capacity the appeal succeeds As <NAME> has pointed out in his judgment so far as this <ORG> is concerned it is well settled that proceedings by a decree holder who has become the auction purchaser for delivery of possession must be deemed to relate to the execution or discharge or satisfaction of the decree within the meaning of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure The learned Judge referred in this connection to the decisions of the <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> I Mad There are numerous decisions which support the judgments in the cases just cited The effect given to Section by this <ORG> has not been accepted without criticism by all the learned Judges who have had to consider the question doubted whether proceedings taken by a decree holder who had purchased property to obtain possession did relate to the execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree but in view of the earlier decisions they felt constrained to follow them <NAME> observed that if the matter were res Integra he would be disposed to hold that the right to sue for possession was not a question relating to the execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree where the plaintiff represented a decree holder who had purchased land in execution of the decree This appeal must therefore be decided on the basis that a decree holder who purchases property in execution cannot institute a suit to recover possession from the judgment debtor or some one who stands in the shoes of the judgment debtor and his remedy is confined to an application where the period of limitation is only three years At the time she purported to do so he had no interest in the property There is substance in the argument but it is not necessary for the purpose of deciding this appeal to pause to inquire whether there is any flaw because if <NAME> cannot in law be deemed to have entered into possession of the property in as the assignee of the tenancy entered into possession without right and was therefore in the eyes of the law a trespasser The moment the sale took place his rights in the property ceased and when his sister put him in possession in he went into possession without any rights unless in the circumstances he could be deemed to be assignee of the tenancy For the reasons indicated I am firmly of the opinion that the case does not fall within the purview of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure and I would allow the appeal with costs throughout
