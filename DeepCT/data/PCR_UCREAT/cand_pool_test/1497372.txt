The main contention of the petitioners is that the tanned hides and skins imported from outside and sold inside the State are under of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules subject to a higher rates of tax than the tax imposed on hides and skins tanned and sold within the State and this discriminatory taxation offended Art Sales Tax of the kind under consideration cannot be said to be a measure regulating any trade or a compensatory tax levied for the use of trading facilities Sales Tax which has the effect of discriminating between goods of one State and goods of another may affect the free flow of trade and it will then offend against Art Section of the Madras General Sales Tax Act provides that the rules made thereunder shall have effect as if enacted in the Act and of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules would fall within a law made by <ORG> What that rule provides is a step necessary fur the imposition of tax in view of ss and and therefore the impugned rule is a part of the enactment which imposes the tax Subject to the provisions of this Act a every dealer shall pay for each year a tax on his total turnover for such year and the tax shall be calculated at the rate of three pies for every rupee in such turnover Section of the Act provides for exemptions and reductions of tax in certain cases Clause vi thereof provides that the sale of hides and skins whether tanned or untanned shall be liable to tax under section sub section only at such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed Section empowers <ORG> to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act It is contended for the petitioner that the effect of this rule is that tanned hides or skins imported from outside the <ORG> and sold within the <ORG> are subject to a higher rate of tax than the tax imposed on hides or skins tanned and sold within the <ORG> inasmuch as sales tax on the importer hides or skins tanned outside the <ORG> is on their sale price while the tax on hides or skins tanned within the <ORG> though ostensibly on their sale price is in view of the proviso to cl ii of sub The impugned rule therefore fixed that single point with respect to the sale of raw hides or skins at the last purchase by the dealer in the <ORG> and with respect to the sale of tanned hides or skins at the first sale of such tanned hides or skin by the dealer in the <ORG> would be such restrictions as directly and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or movement of trade Taxes may and do amount to restrictions but it is only such taxes as directly and immediately restrict trade that would fall within the purview of Art a rational and workable test to apply would be Does the impugned restriction operate directly or immediately on trade or its movement Our conclusion therefore is that when Art provides that trade shall be free throughout the territory of India it means that the flow of trade shall run smooth and unhampered by any restriction either at the boundaries of the States or at any other points inside the States themselves It is the free movement or the transport of goods from one part of the country to the other that is intended to be saved and if any Act imposes any direct restrictions on the very movement of such goods it attracts the provisions of Art and its validity can be sustained only if it satisfies the requirements of Art Regulatory measures or measures imposing Compensatory taxes for the use of trading facilities do not come within the purview of the restrictions contemplated by Art Sales tax which has the effect of discriminating between goods of one <ORG> and goods of another may affect the free flow of trade and it will then offend against Art It enables the imposition of taxes on goods from other <ORG>s if similiar goods in the <ORG> are subjected to similiar taxes so as not to discriminate between the goods manufactured or produced in that <ORG> and the goods which are imported from others <ORG>s We do not agree with the contentions for the respondents Section vi provides that the sale of hides or skins whether tanned or untanned shall be liable to tax under only at such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as may be prescribed This rule was made by the Governor in the exercise of power confer red on him under of the Act and would therefore have statutory force In fact sub of provides that the rules shall have effect as if enacted in the Act What the rule provides is a step necessary for the imposition of the tax in view of ss and and therefore the impugned rule is a part of the enactment which imposes the tax The fact that the impugned rule was made in order to prescribe the single point in the series of sales by successive dealers at which the tax on sale of hides or skins was to be levied in view of ss and of the Act does not justify the making of such a rule which discriminates between the tax imposed on goods imported from outside the State and the goods produced or manufactured in the State Sub rule of the rule deals with the sale of raw hides and skins He too will have to pay more for tax even though the hides and skins are tanned within the <ORG> merely on account of his having imported the hides and skins from outside and having not therefore paid any tax under sub It is urged for the respondent <ORG> that to consider discrimination between the imported goods and goods produced or manufactured in the <ORG> circumstances and situations at the taxable point must be similar and that the circumstance of hides or skins tanned within the <ORG> and on which tax had been paid earlier at the time of their purchase in the raw condition is sufficient to consider such hides or skins to be different from the hides or skins which had been tanned outside the <ORG> At the time of sale of those hides or skins in the tanned state there was no difference between them as goods and the hides or skins tanned outside the <ORG> as goods We are therefore of opinion that the privisions of discriminate against the imported hides or skins which had been purchased or tanned outside the <ORG> and that therefore they contravene the provisions of Art We therefore allow this petition with costs holding the impugned rule invalid and order the issue of a writ of mandamus to the State of Madras and <ORG> under the Act to refrain from enforcing any of the provisions of and direct them to refund the tax illegally collected from the petitioner
