He was confirmed in that post in and continued to serve in it till November when his services were lent to <ORG> of <ORG> which was then located in the <ORG> House He was interrogated by them on June when he made a statement in answer to their questions After obtaining some extension of time the appellant sent his explanation by a letter addressed to <NAME> and did not say that he desired to be heard in person The appellant replied to that letter on September and asked to be supplied with a copy of the police report in order to enable him to make a representation against the action proposed to be taken against him Next on October a solicitor acting for the appellant addressed a letter to the Secretary to the <ORG> of India and asked for a copy of the police report as also copy of the allegations on which the charges had been framed and the <ORG> had taken action It was said that copies of those documents were vitally necessary and without them the appellant was unable to show cause against the proposed action In the meantime the Secretary to <ORG> by each of his letters had gone on extending the time for showing cause The <ORG> took note of the appellant complaint that he had not been supplied with a copy of the police report but held that since the facts set out in the police report had all been included in the statement of facts accompanying the charges and those facts had all been admitted by the appellant he had not been placed at any disadvantage by no copy of the police report being supplied to him The <ORG> also took note of the fact that the appellant had not yet submitted any reply to the notice issued to him under Article of the Constitution and advised that he might be given one more chance to submit his explanation It recommended that the appellant should be either dismissed from service or removed from service with a rider that he should not be re employed by <ORG> in any capacity though it realized that there was practically no difference between the two forms of punishment proposed If the <ORG> thought that the appellant should be given a further opportunity to submit his explanation it would have been more logical for the <ORG> to wait before it expressed its views till such notice was given and the appellant either submitted or failed to submit an explanation Since the appellant never submitted any explanation although a further chance to do so was given to him as advised by the <ORG> there is no reason to think that there were circumstances in the case in which the report of the <ORG> might have been otherwise The points were that by the order of August the appellant had been reduced in rank and since he had been given no opportunity to show cause against such reduction the order was void Thirdly it was contended that the appellant had not been given reasonable opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken against him inasmuch as he had not been supplied with a copy of the police report He held that reduction in rank as contemplated by Article of the Constitution meant reduction by way of imposing a penalty but there was nothing to show that the appellant had been reverted to his permanent substantive post of an appraiser because Government wanted to punish him by such reversion If he had been properly reverted as the learned Judge held he had been the appellant had not been dismissed by an authority subordinate to the authority who had appointed him Nor was the appellant complaint that he had not been given a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the proposed action well founded because the appellant had not even tried to show and it was not a fact that either the Enquiry Officer or the dismissing authority had been influenced in any manner by the police report or taken It into account in any manner by the police report or taken it into account in coming to his decision Before us it was contended that the view taken by the learned Judge on each of the three points was erroneous The order is contained in a notification dated August which was after <ORG> had made its report and after the period fixed by the fourth and the last notice issued to the appellant to show cause against the action proposed to be taken against him had expired dated January in order to enable him to take such further action in the matter as he might deem fit to take We caused the notification to be traced out and placed before us and upon examining It Mr <NAME> who appears for the respondents contended that the explanation of the order of August was to be found there By the notification of so far as it is material for our present purpose power to impose the penalties specified in the fourth column on members of services and holders of posts specified in column is delegated to the authorities specified in column But the delegation is subject to the condition that where the officer to be punished has been lent to the punishing authority the power to remove or dismiss him shall not be deemed to have been delegated to and shall not be exercised by any authority other than the lending authority The conclusion is thus inescapable that the notification does not apply to the case of the appellant because the post of Controller of Exports held by him at the time of his reversion is not mentioned in it and secondly in the absence of any delegation of the power to Impose penalties on him as a Controller of Exports the power remained with the President who obviously cannot be regarded as the punishing authority as contemplated by the notification The order of suspension passed against him and the notice issued to him informing him that it had been decided to hold an enquiry against him in respect of certain charges were issued by and in the name of the President acting through the Secretary to the Government of India in <ORG> The notice to show cause against the proposed action of dismissal was also issued by that Secretary Had there been a delegation of the power to impose penalties upon the appellant to some other authority the steps taken in the course of the disciplinary action launched against him would have been taken by that authority and not by and in the name of the President The contention of the appellant with regard to the order has merely been that it reduced him in rank and therefore he was entitled to have an opportunity for showing cause against it which had not been given to him On the other hand the contention has been that so far as the jurisdiction to make the order was concerned the order was made with jurisdiction but it was a bad and ineffective order because in making it in the manner in which it had been made the provisions of the Constitution had been violated Had the appellant taken the point that the order was bad not only for the reason that no opportunity for showing cause against it had been given to him but also for the reason that it had been passed without jurisdiction or authority the respondents might have produced the appropriate provisions wherever contained in accordance with which the order had been made It also appears to me to be clear that whatever might have been the provision or power under which the order was made it was made with the object of replacing the appellant under the authority who it was thought could deal with him best since the appellant substantive permanent post was held under him Turning now to the first of the points taken in the appeal I am in entire agreement with the learned trial Judge that by the order of August there had been no reduction in rank of the appellant within the meaning of Article of the Constitution I had occasion to consider in the case of <NAME> General Manager <ORG> I what the words reduced in rank in Article meant and I heard nothing from Mr <NAME> to induce me to alter the view which I then expressed That conclusion I reached from the natural implication of the word reduced from its use in the article in juxtaposition with the words dismissed or removed and the obvious connation of the words dismissed or removed or reduced in rank with the same words used in Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules and other similar rules to designate categories of penalty It is not necessary for me to repeat at length the various steps of reasoning by which I arrived at the conclusion Mr <NAME> however contended that the view taken of Article in the earlier case was not correct He pointed out that the expression dismissed or removed or reduced in rank occurred not in a legislative Act but in the Constitution and a Constitution he contended must be so read as to provide for all possible contingencies To my mind there are several answers to this contention In the second place all that Article provides for is that a reasonable opportunity for showing cause against the proposed action must be given to the officer proceeded against If any officer finds himself treated in the manner assumed by Mr <NAME> I think he will find ample ground for challenging the superior officer action in the rules and conditions of service applicable to him because so far as I am aware there are no rules or conditions of service which empower a superior authority to dismiss or reduce in rank an officer subordinate to him except by way of imposing a penalty and except on a finding of good cause It says that certain varieties of action shall not be taken against any person until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him In both of these decisions it has been held that the words dismissed or removed have been used in Article in the same sense as in Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules There cannot be a different decision with regard to the words reduced in rank There is nothing to show in the present case and it is not contended that the order of August was passed against the appellant by way of punishing him He may have been reduced in rank in the physical sense but since his reversion to his substantive post was not ordered by way of imposing a penalty on him there was no reduction in rank in the sense contemplated by Article Mr <NAME> made some reference to the appellant appointment in the temporary post of an Executive Officer in a substantive capacity He did so with a view to establishing that the appellant had been reduced in rank in a physical sense because although he had held higher posts it might be held that there could be no reduction in rank from a post in which a person was only officiating The whole of <ORG> was a temporary establishment and it would appear from the orders exhibited by the Administrator that in the office of the Executive Officer was no longer surviving The appellant has thus proved that he was reduced in rank in the physical sense but for reasons I have already given there was still no reduction in rank within the meaning of Article It seems to me that there is also a further consideration for which it must be held that the order of August did not attract the operation of Article of the Constitution Quite apart from what the words reduced in rank in the article mean it seems to be clear that the reduction contemplated is a reduction by a substantive order made for its own sake and an order which is as it were an end itself The appellant was undoubtedly entitled to an opportunity for showing cause against the proposed dismissal which was the ultimate end of the proceedings but I am altogether unconvinced that he was also entitled to an opportunity for showing cause against every subsidiary or the ancillary step taken in the course of the proceedings launched against him before it was taken As I read Article the words reduced in rank occurring there seem to me to contemplate a reduction in rank which is made for its own sake and is in that sense a final action and not a reduction which is in itself of a neutral character and is only made for administrative reasons by way of taking an intermediate step in furtherance of some other and graver action There remains the third point about the denial of a reasonable opportunity for showing cause against the proposed action From the language in which it was formulated in the petition the complaint would seem to be that no chance to show cause against the proposed action had been given in fact In the course of the argument before us however Mr <NAME> submitted that he would also argue that the failure of <ORG> to supply hid client with a copy of the statement made by him on June also amounted to denying him a reasonable opportunity and that it was solely because he himself had failed to see the distinction between the police report and the statement made to the police that the latter document had not been specifically mentioned It is a remarkable circumstance that at the time of furnishing his explanation in answer to the charges the appellant did not ask for a copy of the police report and furnished his explanation apparently without being inconvenienced in any way by his not having a copy of the document It was only after he had been asked to show cause against the proposed action that he asked for a copy of the police report It is obvious from the language of the letter dated September by which he first asked for it that he wanted it not because he thought it had been taken into consideration in arriving at the findings against him but because he hoped that there might be something in it in his favour which he might utilize in his defence Their lordships were concerned with the proper construction of the phrase a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him While the rule provided that the civil servant should be first informed of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and afforded an opportunity for defending himself against the charges the Statute only spoke of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken But their lordships then proceeded to examine the position where the procedure prescribed by Rule is followed and the officer concerned is first served with a copy of the charges in writing and given an opportunity for showing cause against them before he is called upon by a second notice to show cause against the action proposed to be taken It is thus clear that in their lordships view if the officer concerned has had an opportunity for showing cause against the charges he will not have a second opportunity for doing so when called upon to show cause against the action proposed to be taken but will then be limited to showing cause against the punishment proposed as a result of the findings the findings being no longer challengeable But even assuming that the appellant was entitled when called upon to show cause against the action proposed to be taken to show cause against the findings as well I am unable to see how it could be said that by not being supplied with a copy of either the police report or his statement to the police a reasonable opportunity for showing cause had been denied to him In fact no copy of the Enquiry Officer report was produced by the appellant before the learned Judge although he had a copy in his possession nor was any argument addressed to the <ORG> with regard to it Mr <NAME> contended that according to the Collector of <ORG> he had gone through the records of the case and the records would include the police report Indeed it seems to me that what the appellant was asked to explain was perfectly clear It seems to me on reading this charge that what the statement of June contains is set out in the charge itself The charge says what the appellant had done on his own showing and the own showing is said to have been contained in the statement made to the police The statement made by him to the police is also said to have been in explanation of the wealth referred to in the first charge For the reasons given above it appears to me that the failure of the <ORG> to supply the appellant with a copy of the police report or a copy of his statement made to the police on June did not make the opportunity given to him to show cause against the proposed action less than a reasonable opportunity and that therefore the provisions of Article were not violated The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs so far as this <ORG> is concerned
