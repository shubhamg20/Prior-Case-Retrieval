There remains however this further point which until a few years ago was one of much contention in India He not only did so but he brought a suit which contained an application for an injunction against the registration by the donee of the deed of gift In granting leave to appeal in this case <ORG> delivered in admirably brief form the reasons why the decision if allowed to stand would upset the law in India as now settled and put it in conflict with the latest decisions The point of law involved in the case is whether a donor can revoke a gift before the gift deed has been registered on the ground that the gift is not completed until the deed is registered Registration does not depend upon his the donor consent but is the act of an officer appointed by law for the purpose who if the deed is executed by or on behalf of the donor and is attested by at least two witnesses must register it if it is presented by a person having the necessary interest within the prescribed period Neither death nor the express revocation by the donor is a ground for refusing registration if the other conditions are complied with It would be a waste of words and time to go further than that judgment and it is sufficient to say that it appears to rule the present case Their Lordships will accordingly humbly advise His Majesty that the appeal should be allowed and the decree of the Subordinate Judge restored with costs in the Courts below and before their Lordships
