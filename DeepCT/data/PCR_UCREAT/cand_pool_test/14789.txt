We are informed that for some reason or other there was next a general order permitting parties to file additional written statements After asserting her title she added in paragraph that the appellant claim to the house was barred by the law of limitation and that he had at all material times knowledge of the property having been purchased and owned by her and submitted that the present case comes within the general rule laid down in that case and not within the exception then recognised If by the order complained of some question of substance relating to the controversy in suit had been decided whether directly or indirectly but nevertheless finally so far as <ORG> was concerned it might be contended that the order although an order allowing an amendment of written statement was a judgment and therefore an appeal from it would lie under Clause of the Letters Patent Mr <NAME> contended that no such question had been decided by the order appealed from in the present case and indeed there had been no decision of anything at all and therefore it could not possibly be said that the learned Judge had passed a judgment Mr <NAME> attempted to persuade us that the exception mentioned by Mr <NAME> was not the only exception made by the case on which he was relying but that the case had also decided that if an amendment affected some right accrued to another party or prejudiced him otherwise even then an appeal would lie from the order permitting the amendment I need hardly point out that the word prejudice must be read in relation to the context in which it was being used and it cannot certainly be taken to mean that if any embarrassment of any kind was caused by an amendment to another party to the suit that by itself would be sufficient to make the order permitting the amendment a judgment What <NAME> was trying to do in the earlier case was to repel the contention that the order allowing the amendment in that case was a judgment and what he said had a clear reference to the terms of Clause of the Letters Patent When the definition of judgment speaks of a decision of a question touching the merits of the controversy between the parties it means controversy regarding the rights to the subject matter of the suit or matter and not controversy about the grounds upon which such rights are asserted or denied As I pointed out in my judgment cited today by Mr <NAME> in the case of a plaint it was always thought that if an amendment merely allowed the plaintiff to state a new cause of action or to ask a new relief or to include a new ground of relief an order permitting such an amendment decided nothing and affected no rights because the right of the plaintiff adversaries to contest his claim on the new cause of action or to deny his right to the new relief or to challenge the new ground on which the relief was being asked What the order decides in such a case is that the plaintiff will be allowed to make these claims and not that the claims were being rightly made and similarly even when an amendment of a written statement introduces a new defence an order permitting the amendment merely decides that the particular defendant shall he allowed to set up that plea but not that the plea is well founded As has been said in such cases the order permitting the amendment is merely an order regulating the procedure of the <ORG> regarding the manner in which the parties will state their cases to it and therefore their substantive rights are in no way affected by such an order If the substantive rights which are the rights in controversy between the parties in the suit or cause or matter an not affected by an order permitting an amendment such an order cannot amount to a judgment and In my view the order in the present case only permits respondent No to make the case which she was seeking to make by her amendment and except that respondent No will be entitled on the strength of that order to try to prove that plea it has no further effect on any rights of anybody It is accordingly dismissed with costs to respondent No
