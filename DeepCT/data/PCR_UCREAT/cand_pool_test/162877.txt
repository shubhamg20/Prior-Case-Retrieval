It may be broadly stated thus Has <ORG> jurisdiction to execute a decree sent to it for that purpose under Section of the Code when that decree has been passed in a suit the value or amount of the subject matter of which was in excess of the pecuniary limits of its ordinary jurisdiction On the one side it is contended that Section contains no limitation as regards the pecuniary jurisdiction of the <ORG> to which a decree may be sent for execution similar to that contained in Section that by Section the <ORG> to which a decree is sent for execution is expressly vested with the same powers in executing it as if the decree had been passed by itself that if there is any force in the limitation sought to be imposed the provisions of Section regarding the rateable distribution of assets would in many cases be unfairly restricted in their operation And we have been referred to the case of <NAME> Venkata Krishnayya I Mad in which <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> held that Section gave an extraordinary jurisdiction to a <ORG> to execute a decree in a suit beyond its pecuniary jurisdiction sent to it for execution On the other hand it is said that the proceedings in execution are merely a continuation of the suit and that a <ORG> which has no jurisdiction to try the suit can have no jurisdiction to execute a decree made in that suit The Madras decision proceeds upon the principle that Section of the Code confers an extraordinary jurisdiction which is limited by no restriction such as is to be found in Section It seems to us that the learned Judges who decided that case overlooked the provisions of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure which appears to contain words which we think were expressly intended to limit the jurisdiction which would otherwise he given by Section We are also of opinion that there are other indications in the Code going to show that as <NAME> said in the Bombay case a <ORG> which could not have entertained the suit is incompetent to deal with it in execution It is contended that the word suits in this clause must be limited to proceedings in the cause up to the passing of the decree and that it does not therefore operate to curtail the power of a <ORG> to execute a decree We see no sufficient reason for giving the word this restricted meaning On the other hand there would appear to be several weighty reasons for assigning it a wider signification so as to cover all proceedings in a suit including the proceedings in execution We have been unable to discover any provision in the Code which could if uncontrolled by this clause have operated to give a <ORG> jurisdiction to try a suit in excess of the limits of its pecuniary jurisdiction On the other hand Section if uncontrolled by Section gives to a <ORG> a very wide in fact a practically unlimited jurisdiction in many important matters in respect of suits the amount or value of the subject matter of which may exceed the pecuniary limits of its ordinary jurisdiction By Section the <ORG> executing a decree sent to it has the same powers in executing the decree as if it had been passed by itself and its order in executing such decree is made subject to the same rules in respect of appeal as if the decree had been passed by itself Accordingly if the decree of a District or Subordinate Judge can be sent to a Munsif for execution the Munsif has jurisdiction to try all questions relating to the execution of the decree limitation claims to attached property complaints of resistance or obstruction and generally all questions under Section and the appeal from his orders would lie in every case to the District Judge no matter what might be the value of the suit questions arising in the execution of decrees are frequently quite as important as the questions in issue in suits and appeals and there would seem to be no reason why the limitation of jurisdiction thought necessary in respect of hearing the original Suit should not be also necessary in respect of trying questions relating to the execution of the decree There are other considerations which go to bear out the view that the jurisdiction conferred by Section must be considered as qualified by the last clause of Section Section itself contains a clause empowering <ORG> at Calcutta Madras Bombay or Rangoon to execute decrees sent to them in certain cases but such a decree must have been passed in a case cognizable in <ORG> or as Act VII of more clearly puts it in a suit of which the value as set forth in the plaint did not exceed two thousand rupees and which as regards its subject matter is not excepted by the law for the time being in force from the cognizance of either a Presidency or <ORG> In other words we have here a distinct recognition of the rule which appears to be contained in Section that no <ORG> can execute a decree passed in a suit the value of the subject matter of which would have been in excess of its pecuniary jurisdiction Section refers to a case in which a <ORG> which passed a decree may have ceased to exist or to have jurisdiction to execute it But the Code of everywhere assumes that the power to execute a decree is not a power possessed by all <ORG>s indiscriminately but is subject to restrictions of jurisdiction I A their Lordships of <ORG> said It appears to their Lordships that an application for the execution of a decree is an application in the suit in which the decree was obtained The rule will accordingly be made absolute with costs Section A decree may be executed either by the Court which passed it or by the Court to which it is sent for execution under the provisions hereinafter contained The <ORG> which passed a decree may on the application of the decree holder send it for execution to another <ORG> a if the person against whom the decree is passed actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain within the local limits of the jurisdiction of such other Court or if such person has not property within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court which passed the decree sufficient to satisfy such decree and has property within the local limits of the jurisdiction of such other Court or if the decree directs the sale of immoveable property situate outside the local limits of the jurisdiction of the Court which passed it or if the <ORG> which passed the decree considers for any other reason which it shall record in writing that the decree should be executed by such other <ORG> The Court which passed a decree may of its own motion send it for execution to any Court subordinate thereto The <ORG> to which a decree is sent under this section for execution shall certify to the <ORG> which passed it the fact of such execution or where the former <ORG> fails to execute the same the circumstances attending such failure If the decree has been passed in a case cognizable by <ORG> and the <ORG> which passed it wishes it to be executed in Calcutta Madras Bombay or Rangoon such <ORG> may send to the <ORG> of Small Causes in Calcutta Madras Bombay or Rangoon as the case may be the copies and certificate respectively mentioned in Clauses a and of Section and such <ORG> of Small Causes shall thereupon execute the decree as if it had been passed by itself If the <ORG> to which a decree is to be sent for execution is situate within the same district as the <ORG> which passed such decree such <ORG> shall send the same directly to the former <ORG> But if the <ORG> to which the decree is to be sent for execution is situate in a different district the <ORG> which passed it shall send it to the District <ORG> of the district in which the decree is to be executed Powers of Court in executing transmitted decree Appeal from orders in executing such decrees Section The Court executing a decree sent to it under this chapter shall have the same powers in executing such decree as if it bad been passed by itself All persons disobeying or obstructing the execution of the decree shall be punishable by such Court in the same manner as if it had passed the decree And its orders in executing such decree shall be subject to the same rules in respect of appeal as if the decree had been passed by itself
