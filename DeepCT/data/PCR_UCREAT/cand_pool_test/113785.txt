So far as that section furnishes us with a guide by analogy as to whether this order is appealable or not the conclusion is that it is not so because no provision is made by the Code of Civil Procedure for an appeal against an order made whether in pursuance of the directions of this <ORG> or otherwise by <ORG> founded on the ground that security insufficient in point of quality has been accepted declined to act upon that view in a case under Act XXVII of an appeal with reference to a security order in which the <ORG> in considering whether Section of that Act did or did not provide an appeal for such a case held that it did not saying with reference to an authority cited in favour of the appeal there is nothing which affirms this <ORG> power to hear an appeal as to any other matters than those which are connected with the propriety or otherwise of an order made granting a certificate apparently considering that the question of the kind now before us as to security is not one involving the question of the propriety or otherwise of the granting of a certificate We think that we must hold that no appeal lies in this case The appeal will accordingly be dismissed and we think that the parties should bear their own costs Section The granting of such certificate may be suspended by an appeal to <ORG> which Court may declare the party to whom the certificate should be granted or may direct such further proceedings for the investigation of the title as it shall think fit the Court may also upon petition after a certificate shall have been granted by <ORG> grant a fresh certificate in supersession of the certificate granted by <ORG> such fresh certificate shall not affect any payments made to the person to whom any former certificate may have been granted without notice that the same has been superseded but shall entitle the person named therein to receive all moneys that may have been recovered under the first certificate from the person to whom the same may have been granted
