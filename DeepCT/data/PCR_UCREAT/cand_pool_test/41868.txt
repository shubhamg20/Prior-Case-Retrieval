Per <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The Bihar Land Reforms Act XXX of is not a law in respect of a matter mentioned in entry of List II viz lands and land tenures but a law in respect of acquisition of property a matter covered by entry of List II ii The obligation to pay compensation for property ac quired by the <ORG> is not an obligation imposed by entry of List II read by itself or in conjunction with entry of list III or by the spirit of the Constitution Consequently an objection to the validity of a statute in respect of acquisition of property on the ground that it does not provide for payment of compensation is an objection on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of art and the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to entertain such an objection in respect of a statute mentioned in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution is barred by art Per <NAME> Assuming that the obligation to pay compensation is also implicit in entry of List II in itself or read with entry of List III even then the validity of the Act cannot be questioned by reason of arts iii Section of the Act which empowers the <ORG> Government to frame rules providing for the proportion in which compensation shall be payable in cash and in bonds and the manner of payment of such compensation does not involve any delegation of legislative powers especially as the legislature has itself provided in that the compen sation shall be payable in cash or in bonds or partly in cash and partly in bonds and fixed the number of instalments in which it should be paid The words subject to in entry of List II only mean that whenever a law is made by a <ORG> Legislature in exercise of its legislative power under entry that law will be subject to the provisions of a law made by the <ORG> under entry of List III The words do not mean that when a <ORG> makes a law under entry it must lay down the principles on which compensation payable for property acquired is to be determined and the form and manner in which it should be given The power conferred thereunder on the legislatures is not coupled with any duty on the legislature to exercise such power and the principle laid down in <NAME> Bishop of Oxford A has therefore no application to the Lists <NAME> Whatever may be the position as regards the acquisition of money as such it is not correct to say that a law made under entry of List II cannot authorise acquisition of choses in action like arrears of rent due from the tenants which are covered by the term property used in that entry and in art The facts that gave rise to these appeals and petition are stated in the judgment The Court delivered judgment as follows PATANJALI SASTRI These appeals and petitions which fall into three groups raise the issue of the constitutional validity of three State enactments called The Bihar Land Reforms Act Bihar Act XXX of The Chief Jus tice in his judgment dealt with the above Cases and Peti tion and also Petitions Nos to to and of relating to the Madhya Pradesh Abolition of Proprietary Rights Estates Mahals Alienated Lands Act and Cases Nos to of relating to the Uttar Pradesh Zamindari Abolition and Land Reforms Act The constitutionality of these Acts having been challenged in the respective <ORG> on various grounds the Bihar Act was declared unconstitu tional and void on the ground that it contravened article of the Constitution the other grounds of attack being rejected while the other two Acts were adjudged constitu tional and valid The appeals are directed against these decisions Petitions have also been filed in this Court under article by certain other zamindars seeking determi nation of the same issues The common question which arises for consideration in all these appeals and petitions is whether the three State Legislatures which respectively passed the three impugned statutes were constitutionally competent to enact them though some special points are also involved in a few of these cases As has been stated various grounds of attack were put forward in the courts below and all of them having been repeated in the memoranda of appeals and the petitions they would have required consideration but for the amendment of the Constitution by the Constitution First Amendment Act hereinafter referred to as the Amendment Act which was passed by the provisional <ORG> during the pendency of these proceedings That Act by inserting the new articles A and purported to protect generally all laws providing for the acquisition of estates or interests therein and specif ically certain statutes including the three impugned Acts from attacks based on article read with other relevant articles of Part III of the Constitution The result is that the impugned Acts can no longer be attacked on the ground of alleged infringement of any of the rights conferred by the provisions of Part III It will be noted however that articles A and afford only limited protection against one ground of chal lenge namely that the law in question is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part This is made further clear by the opening words of article I A notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part The existence of a public purpose and an obligation to pay compensation being thus the necessary concomitants of compulsory acquisition of private property the term acquisition must be construed as importing by necessary implication the two conditions aforesaid The words subject to the provi sions of entry of List III in entry reinforce the argument as these words must be taken to mean that the power to make a law with respect to acquisition of property should be exercised subject to the condition that such law should also provide for the matters referred to in entry in other words a two fold restriction as to public purpose and payment of compensation both of which are referred to in entry is imposed on the exercise of the law making power under entry In any case the legislative power conferred under entry is a power coupled with a duty to exercise it for the benefit of the owners whose properties are compulsorily acquired A under a law made under entry For all these reasons the State Legislatures it was claimed had no power to make a law for acquisition of property without fulfilling the two conditions as to public purpose and payment of compensation He argued that the impugned Acts were not passed in accordance with the procedure prescribed in article which provides No such law as is referred to in clause made by <ORG> shall have effect unless such law He placed no reliance upon entry of List II or entry of List III He appeared to concede what Mr <NAME> so strenuously contested that those entries concerned as they were with the grant of power to <ORG> to legislate with respect to matters specified therein could not be taken as a matter of construction to import an obligation to pay compensation He relied on certain American decisions and text books as supporting the view that a constitutional prohibition can be derived by implication from the spirit of the Constitution where no express prohibition has been enacted in that behalf Articles A and barred only objections based on alleged infringements of the funda mental rights conferred by Part III but if from the other provisions thereof it could be inferred that there must be a public purpose and payment of compensation before private property could be compulsorily acquired by the <ORG> there was nothing in the two articles aforesaid to preclude objec tion on the ground that the impugned Acts do not satisfy these requirements and are therefore unconstitutional In addition to the aforesaid grounds of attack which were common to all the three impugned statutes the validity of each of them or of some specific provisions thereof was also challenged on some special grounds These contentions are in my judgment devoid of of substance and force and I have no hesitation in rejecting them No property movable or immovable shall be acquired for public purposes under any law authorising such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property acquired and either No such law as is referred to in clause made by <ORG> shall have effect unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent If any bill pending at the commencement of this Constitution in the <ORG> of a State has after it has been passed by such <ORG> been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent then notwithstanding anything in this Constitution the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause Nothing in clause shall affect a The provisions of any existing law other than a law to which the provisions of clause apply or the provisions of any law which the State may here after make i for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty or ii for the promotion of public health or the preven tion of danger to life or property or iii in pursuance of any agreement entered into between the Government of the Dominion of India or the Government of India and the Government of any other country or otherwise with respect to property declared by law to be evacuee property A Saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates etc Notwithstanding anything in the forego ing provisions of this Part no law providing for the acqui sition by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is incon sistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions con tained in article A none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Fart and notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent <ORG> to repeal or amend it continue in force estates and rights therein and what is more important for our present purpose the non obstante clause in article overrides all other provisions in the Constitution including the List of the Seventh Schedule whereas a law which falls within the purview of article a A could only prevail over the foregoing provisions of this Part Putting aside the latter articles for the moment it is plain that under article the three impugned stat utes are protected from attack in any court on the ground that they contravene the provisions of article The clause was evidently worded in that form as it was copied with minor variations from section of the Government of India Act which was undoubtedly designed to give effect to the recommendation of <ORG> in para It is thus clear that section was intended to secure fulfilment of two conditions subject to which alone legislation authorising expropriation of private property should be lawful and it seems reasonable to con clude that article was also intended to impose the same two conditions on legislation expropriating private property In other words article must be under stood as also providing that legislation authorising expro priation of private property should be lawful only if it was required for a public purpose and provision was made for payment of compensation This was precisely the objection raised both by Mr <NAME> and Dr <NAME> to the constitutional validity of the impugned statutes and such objection really amounts to calling those laws in question on the ground that they contravened the provisions of article though learned counsel stoutly denied that they were relying on the provisions of article As pointed out already article A operates as an exception to article read with article only in respect of laws authorising acquisition of estates and rights therein and this exception is to be deemed to have been part of the Constitution from its commencement But it has no application to laws authorising acquisition of other kinds of property and as regards these the requirements as to public purpose and payment of compensation are still enforced by the express provisions of article It is true that under the common law of eminent domain as recognised in the jurisprudence of all civilized coun tries the <ORG> cannot take the property of its subject unless such property is required for a public purpose and without compensating the owner for its loss But when these limitations are expressly provided for and it is further enacted that no law shall be made which takes away or abridges these safeguards and any such law if made shall be void there can be no room for implication and the words acquisition of property must be understood in their natu ral sense of the act of acquiring property without import ing into the phrase an obligation to pay compensation or a condition as to the existence of a public purpose There are indications in article itself to show that the expression acquisition of property in entry of List II does not in itself carry any obligation to pay compensa tion Similarly clause which excepts certain categories of laws from the operation of clause contemplates laws being made without a public purpose or payment of compensation Such laws can be made by <ORG> only under entry which must there fore be taken to confer a legislative power unfettered by any implied restrictions It was said that the words subject to the provisions of entry in List III must be taken to mean that the law making power under entry could only be exercised subject to the two conditions as to public purpose and payment of compensation both of which are referred to in entry Those words in my opinion mean no more than that any law made under entry by <ORG> can be displaced or overridden by <ORG> making a law under entry of List III That they cannot bear the interpreta tion sought to be put upon them by Mr <NAME> is clear from the fact that similar words do not occur in entry of List I which confers on <ORG> the power of making laws with respect to acquisition or requisitioning of property for the purposes of the <ORG> For if the restrictive conditions as to public purpose and payment of compensation are to be derived only from those words then it must follow that in the absence of those words in entry <ORG> can make laws authorising acquisition or requisitioning of property without a public purpose and a provision for compensation The fact is that the law making power of both <ORG> and <ORG> Legislatures can be exercised only subject to the aforesaid two restric tions not by reason of anything contained in the entries themselves but by reason of the positive provisions of article and as laws falling under article or under articles A and cannot be called in question in a court of law for non compliance with those provisions such laws cannot be struck down as unconstitutional and void It was further contended that the power to make a law under entry of List III was a power coupled with a duty because such law was obviously intended for the benefit of the expropriated owners and where the <ORG> has authorised such expropriation it was also bound to exercise the power of making a law laying down the principles on which such owners should be compensated for their loss Reliance was placed in support of this somewhat novel contention on the well known case of <NAME> Bishop of Oxford That case however has no application here While certain powers may be granted in order to be exercised in favour of certain persons who are intended to be benefit ed by their exercise and on that account may well be re garded as coupled with a duty to exercise them when an appropriate occasion for their exercise arises the power granted to a legislature to make a law with respect to any matter cannot be brought under that category It cannot possibly have been intended that the legislature should be under an obligation to make a law in exercise of that power for no obligation of that kind can be enforced by the court against a legislative body It was said that article provides a special safeguard which in order to ensure that no hasty or unjust expropriatory legislation is passed by <ORG> requires for such legislation the assent of both the Gover nor and the President and to make this clear the words law and legislature were deliberately used in clause a In article for instance the word is clearly used in the sense of the <ORG>s of legis lature and excludes the Governor Turning now to the special points arising in particular cases it was urged by Mr <NAME> that section of the Bihar Act which provides that all arrears of rent royal ties and cesses due for any period prior to the date of the vesting of the estates in <ORG> shall vest and be recoverable by the <ORG> was unconstitutional and void In the first place there was no public purpose to be served by the acquisition of such property Whatever may be the position as regards the acquisi tion of money as such it is not correct to say that a law made under entry of List II cannot authorise acquisition of choses in action like arrears of rent due from the ten ants which are covered by the term property used in that entry and in article of the face value of the entire arrears must as it seems to me be considered reasonable and fair compensation for taking them over It was said that there was no evidence to show that it was usual for the zemindars to incur such expenditure and that the deduction was a mere contrivance to reduce the compensation payable for the acquisition of their estates Power was given to <ORG> under section to frame rules providing for the proportion in which compensa tion shall be payable in cash and in bonds and the manner of payment of such compensation It was argued that while the Constitution conferred power on the legislatures under entry of List III to make laws with respect to the principles on which compensation for property acquired was to be determined and the form and the manner in which such compensation was to be given it was not competent for <ORG> to delegate this essential legis lative power to the executive government The legislature has applied its mind to the form in which compensation has to be paid and has fixed the number of equal instalments in which it should be paid It has also provided for payment of interest on the compensation amount in the meantime It was contended by Mr <NAME> that the Madhya Pradesh Act was not duly passed as no question was put by <ORG> at the third reading of the bill on the motion that it be passed into law as required by the provisions of rule of the rules governing legisla tive business then in force and that the omission was not a mere irregularity of procedure which the court is barred from enquiring into under article of the Constitu tion There is in my opinion no sub stance in the objection Mr <NAME> raised a further contention that in regard to the malguzari lands covered by the Madhya Pradesh Act articles A and could be of no assistance to the <ORG> as such lands are not estates within the meaning of clause of article A with the result that It was conceded by the learned Advocate General of Madhya Pradesh that these malguzari lands could not be regarded as estates within the meaning of article A read with the Tenancy Acts in force in Madhya Pradesh but he contended that inasmuch as article purported to validate specifically the Madhya Pradesh Act among others and as that article was not limited in its application to estates the objection could not prevail There is nothing in article to indi cate that the specific mention of certain statutes was only intended to illustrate the appli cation of the general words of article A The decision cited affords no useful analogy But a short and obvious answer is that there was no contravention of any guarantee or assurance given by the <ORG> under the covenant of merger as the estates in question are sought to be acquired only as the private property of the <NAME> and not otherwise There is therefore no force in this objec tion The Act was published in <ORG> on the th September and on the same day a notification under section of the Act was pub lished declaring that the Act would come into force imme diately The respondent filed a petition in <ORG> at Patna under article of the Con stitution challenging the constitutionality of the said Bihar Land Reforms Act and praying for a writ in the nature of mandamus to be issued on the State of Bihar re straining it from acting in any manner by virtue of or under the provisions of the said Act The validity of the Act was attacked before <ORG> on the following grounds That it contravened article of the Consti tution That article had no application That the Act was unconstitutional as it contravened article of the Constitution The foundation of Mr <NAME> attack on the vires of the Act mainly rests on the contention that it is implicit within the language of entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution that property could not be acquired without payment of compensation the only effect of a compulsory power of acquisition against the individual being that there is the power to oblige him to sell and convey property when the public necessities require it but that the power to take compulsorily raises by implication a right to payment in other words there is a concomitant obligation to pay and the power to acquire is inseparable from the obligation to pay compensation and as the provi sions of the statute in respect of payment of compensation are illusory it is unconstitutional As regards article of the Constitution it is said that it deals with the fundamental right regarding property which is expressed in the clause in negative lan guage The provisions of articles and A and though they deprive the expropriated proprietor of his rights provided in Part III of the Constitution do not in any way affect the ambit of entry and empower <ORG> to make a law for compulsory acquisition of property without payment of compensation in the true sense of that term Emphasis is laid on the words subject to the provi sions of entry contained in entry and it is contended that the exercise of legislative power under entry is conditional on exercise of power under entry that one could not be exercised without the other and that the power conferred by the two entries had to be construed on the assumption that the acquisition was to be paid for It is further contended that the legislative power in entry is a power coupled with duty which the legislature was bound to exercise for the benefit of the person whose property was taken in exercise of the legislative power under entry To appreciate the contentions raised by Mr <NAME> on the question of the competence of <ORG> to enact the Bihar Land Reforms Act it is necessary to refer to its provisions and to see on what subjects the legisla ture has purported to enact the law Its preamble gives no indication as to the nature of these reforms except that it provides for the constitution of <ORG> to advise <ORG> on the agrarian policy whatever that expression may mean It enacts that the interests of the proprietor or tenure holder in any building or part of a building comprised in such estate or tenure and used primarily as office or cutchery for the collection of rent of such estate or tenure and his interests in trees forests fisheries jalkars huts bazars and ferries and all other sairati interests as also his interest in the subsoil including any rights in mines and minerals whether discovered or undiscovered or whether being worked or not inclusive of such rights of lessee of mines and minerals comprised in such estate or tenure other than the interests of <ORG> or under <ORG> shall vest absolutely in the <ORG> free from all incumbrances Normally it has no relation to and cannot be re garded as an incident of the transference of the estates Section gives a right of appeal to a party aggrieved against the Collector order In section it is provided that all mines comprised in the estate or tenure as were in operation at the commencement of this Act and were being worked directly by the proprietor or tenure holder shall be deemed to have been leased by <ORG> to the proprietor of tenure holder Sections and make provisions relating to the investigation of debts of proprietors and tenure holders and lay down the procedure for payment of those debts Certain directions are given in sections and regarding the procedure to be adopted by the compensation officer when the proprietor has only a certain share in an estate and where certain trusts have been created by the tenure holder or proprietor and the highest at any amount exceeding Rs To illustrate in the case of the <NAME> of Darbhanga whose estate has a gross income of nearly forty eight lakhs the cost of management according to this calculation would work out to a sum of nine and a half lakhs which on the face of it looks startling it can hardly have any relation to the costs actually incurred The section also lays down the method of assessment of compensation in the case of persons who have only a share in the zamindari or have other minor interests in the tenures or estates where the estate or tenure is held in trust etc Section provides for the constitution of a commission called <ORG> There is no scheme of land reform within the framework of the statute except that a pious hope is ex pressed that the commission may produce one It also in an indirect manner forfeits the <ORG> exchequer part of the compensation money which would have been payable to the proprietors or tenureholders if the net income was not reduced by deduction from the gross income of items of artificial nature which have no relation to any actual expenses Both these provisions will be separately dealt with hereinafter as in my opinion the enactment of these provisions is unconstitutional Having held that the Bihar Act is constitutional as regards transfer of estates to the <ORG> and that this is mainly an enactment under legislative head of List II it is convenient now to examine the contention of Mr <NAME> to the effect that in the contents of the power conferred on the legislature by this entry their exists a concomitant obligation to pay compensation and that as the provisions regarding payment of compensation are illusory the Act is unconstitutional and that article of the Constitution does not afford any protection against this attack Power to take property for public use has been exercised since olden times who wrote of this power in his work De Jure Belli et Pacis as follows The property of subjects is under the eminent domain of the <ORG> so that the <ORG> or he who acts for it may use and even alienate and destroy such property not only in the case of extreme necessity in which even private persons have a right over the property of others but for ends of public utility to which ends those who founded civil socie ty must be supposed to have intended that private ends should give way These two therefore have not the same origin they do not come for instance from any im plied contract between the <ORG> and the individual that the former shall have the property if it will make compen sation the right is no mere right of pre emption and it has no condition of compensation annexed to it either precedent or subsequent but there is a right to take A Shorn of all its incidents the simple definition of the power to acquire compulsorily or of the term eminent do main is the power of the sovereign to take property for public use without the owner consent Authority is universal in support of the amplified definition of eminent domain as the power of the sovereign to take property for public use without the owner consent upon making just compensa tion To my mind our Constitution has raised this obligation to pay compensation for the compulsory acquisition of property to the status of a funda mental right and it has declared that a law that does not make provision for payment of compensation shall be void Power to take was mentioned in entry while the condition for the exercise of that power was embodied in article and there was no duty to pay compensation implicit in the content of the entry itself I am therefore of the opinion that Mr <NAME> is not right in his contention that unless adequate provision is made by a law enacted under legislative power conferred by entry of List I for com pensation the law is unconstitutional as entry itself does not authorize the making of such a law without provid ing for compensation Then it was said that entry of List II was linked up with entry of the Concurrent List by the words subject to occurring therein and that the validity of any law made in exercise of legislative power under entry was conditional on the simultaneous exercise of the legislative power under entry and because there has been no valid exercise of this power the provisions of the impugned Act regarding the determination of compensation being illusory the legisla tion under entry fails It is by force of the provisions of article that it becomes obligatory to legislate providing for compensation under entry of the Concurrent List in order to give validity to a law enacted under entry and not by reason of the use of the wards subject to in the wording of the entry Lastly it was urged that the legislative power conferred in entry of the Concurrent List is a power conferred for the benefit of the expropriated owner and that the legisla ture is bound to exercise this power for his benefit whenev er it takes property under its compulsory powers in other words it was said that the power conferred by the entry was coupled Reference was made in this connection to the observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> of <ORG> The principle of that decision is that where power is conferred in the nature of a trust there is an obligation to exercise it for the benefit of the cestui que trust Failure to make a law under entry cannot make a law made under entry bad The crucial point for determination in these appeals is to discover the extent to which article of the Constitu tion or the new articles A and a have deprived the expropriated proprietor of his rights or remedies in re spect of this matter and of the guaranteed right to get compensation for property acquired reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent then notwithstanding anything in this Constitution the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part no law providing for the acquisi tion by the State of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is incon sistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part Provided that where such law is a law made by the Legis lature of a State the provisions of this Article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration the President has received his assent Without prejudice to the generality of the provi sions contained in article A none of the Acts and Regu lations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or even to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part and notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent legislature to repeal or amend it continue in force The language of article is unequivocal in its terms and states that when a Bill has received the assent of the President according to the procedure prescribed in article and then notwithstanding anything in this Constitution the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause The whole purpose of the clause is to make the obligation to pay compensation a condition prece dent to the compulsory acquisition of property The words of the clause preceding the word unless are merely de scriptive of the law the validity of which would be ques tionable if there was no provision for determination and for payment of compensation for the property taken in its con tents The mandate of the clause is that such a law must contain a provision for payment of compensation to the expropriated proprietor It has no reference to anything that may be implied within the language of that clause This is also the view taken by the learned Judges of <ORG> The sovereign power to acquire property compul sorily is a power to acquire it only for a public purpose There is no power in the sovereign to acquire private property in order to give it to private persons Having determined the scope of article it is now convenient to examine the extent of the protection given by article to the impugned statute took away that remedy in the case of the Bihar and other zamindari estates and substituted for it the procedure of article and compliance with which would be sufficient to make the laws valid and effective However repugnant the impugned law may be to our sense of justice it is not possible for us to examine its contents on the question of quantum of compensation Private property cannot be acquired for a private purpose the right to legislate under entry postulates the existence of a public purpose and the contention is that there was no public purpose behind the Act The learned Judges of <ORG> negatived this contention on the ground that the question whether there was a public purpose in support of the acquisition of the es tates had been by implication decided by <ORG> and therefore the <ORG> could not go into this matter This decision was reached in view of the provisions of clauses and of article which were interpreted to mean that <ORG> gave their express ap proval to this legislation The protection which <ORG> gave under clauses and was confined to the latter requirement I would therefore hold that there is a public purpose for the impugned Act within the meaning of clause of article Das said as follows There is I think clear indication in the Constitution of India itself that the expression public purpose is to be understood in a wide and comprehensive sense Further more there is indication that <ORG> representing the people of India which made the Constitu tion was itself aware of the existence of legislation of the nature of impugned Act One may I think say that there was an implied declaration by <ORG> that such legislation was for a public purpose and such declaration will be given deference by the courts until it is shown to involve an impossibility Finally it was urged that there was nothing definite or tangible in the Act or in the views of the legislatures which gave any indication of the public purpose for which the estates were being acquired and all that could be gath ered was that the legislature did not know its own mind at all and on a vague notion of some future policy directed the acquisition of the estates In my opinion it will not serve any useful purpose to examine each and every argument that was addressed to us by the learned counsel Be that as it may it seems to me that in spite of the criticism levelled against the Act by the learned counsel it cannot be said that the Act would fall because it fails to postulate a public purpose The legislature is the best judge of what is good for the community by whose suffrage it comes into existence and it is not possible for this <ORG> to say that there was no public purpose behind the acquisition contemplated by the impugned statute The phrase public purpose has to be construed according to the spirit of the times in which particular legislation is enacted and so construed the acquisition of the estates has to be held to have been made for a public purpose These observations however have no application to the acquisition of arrears of rent The same observations apply to clause of the statute It is a well accepted proposition of law that property of individuals cannot be appropriated by the <ORG> under the power of compulsory acquisition for the mere purpose of adding to the revenues of the <ORG> II at Constitutional Limitations is founded on the superior claims of the whole community over an individual citizen but is applicable only in those cases where private property is wanted for public use or demanded by the public welfare and that no instance is known in which it has been taken for the mere purpose of raising a revenue by sale or otherwise and the exercise of such a power is utterly destructive of individual right Taking money under the right of eminent domain when it must be compensated in money afterwards is nothing more or less than a forced loan Money or that which in ordinary use passes as such and which the Government may reach by taxa tion and also rights in action which can only be available when made to produce money cannot be taken under this power at page has expressed a contrary opinion and reference has been made to the decision in Cincinnati Louisville etc It was held in that case that a Bill to restrain the enforce ment of a <ORG> statute regulating fire insurance rights was a valid law in the <ORG> of Kansas It was not necessary to decide in this case whether under the compulsory acquisition power the <ORG> has the power to acquire choses in action or money but it cannot be seriously disputed that such an acquisition amounts to a forced loan and that the desired result can be more appositely obtained in exercise of the police power of the <ORG> than of the power of eminent domain or compulsory acquisition of property and that com pensation in such a ease is the same amount of money that is being taken and in the case of a chose in action the amount of money that it would produce It stands on the same footing as other debts due to zamindars or their other movable properties which it was not the object of the Act to acquire As <NAME> stated the only purpose to support this acquisition is to raise revenue to pay compensation to some of the zamindars whose estates are being taken This purpose does not fall within any definition however wide of the phrase public purpose and the law therefore to this extent is unconstitutional It was said that the Act while pretending to comply with the Constitution evades and invades it that the Act merely pretends to comply with the Constitution when it says that it provides for payment of compensation but in effect it has produced a scheme for non payment of compensation by shift and contri vance Reference was made to certain provisions of the Act of a confiscatory nature already noticed in this judgment In a nutshell it was contended that the object of the Act was to acquire properties of the zemindars by pay ment of compensation so called out of the moneys belonging to the zemindars themselves and that in some cases they had not only to give up their estates for nothing but would have to pay something in addition to the <ORG> if the princi ples specified in the Act were to apply It was pointed out in the case of the Maharaja of Darbhanga that his zemindari would be acquired by the <ORG> Government without paying anything but that the Maharaja would have to pay out of his own money six lakhs to the Government The conclusion to my mind is irresistible that the intention is to take over the great estates in the province paying no compensation or the most inadequate compensation and out of the considerable profits which are likely to be derived from them to take over in course of time the remaining estates and tenures In other words a comparatively small minority belonging to this particular class are to be expropriated without compensation or with the most inadequate compensation in order that when the great majority are expropriated they receive compensa tion which will not be inadequate and may quite possibly in many cases be more then adequate Mr <NAME> vehemently contended that the statute was a fraud on republican Constitution which promised to deprive no one of his property without payment of compensation that it pretended to make elaborate provisions for paying it but that by shift and contrivance it has provided for the eva sion of its payment Reliance was placed in this connection on the observations of <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> of <NAME> which are in these terms Our judgment is founded upon the language of the Stat ute Eliz In <ORG> <ORG> it was observed It is well settled that a public body invested with statutory powers such as those conferred upon the corpora tion must take care not to exceed or abuse its powers It must keep within the limits of the authority committed to it It must act in good faith It is by no means easy to impute a dishonest motive to the legislature of a State and hold that it acted main fide and maliciously in passing the Bihar Land Reforms Act or that it perpetrated a fraud on the Constitution by enacting this law He contended that under this head it was open to the <ORG> or <ORG> to make a law laying down the principles which may result in non payment of compensation or which may result in not paying any compensation whatsoev er This head of legislation seems to have been expressly mentioned in the Concurrent List not only in view of the accepted principle of law that in cases of compulsory acqui sition of property compensation has to be made but also in view of the clear and mandatory provisions of article which require that a law authorising the taking or acquisi tion of property will be void if it does not provide for payment of compensation for the property acquired or does not either fix the amount of compensation or specify the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given I know of no principles for determination of compensation which result in its nonpayment except in the Act under notice Reference was made in this connection to <ORG> in which it was held that the descriptive words under the legislative head collection of rents are wide enough to permit legislation in respect of remission of rents and that under item of the Government of India Act the legislative head forests include the power to legislate with respect not only to afforestation but also to disafforestation and that the legislative head fisheries would include the power to legislate on the prohibition of fishing altogether Their Lordships of <ORG> made the following observations which appear at page of the report at In that view their Lordships are unable to regard the prohibi tive enactments of the Canadian statute as regulations of trade and commerce there is marked distinction be tween the prohibition or prevention of a trade and the regulation or governance of it Could it be said by any reasonable person that such a piece of legislation was legislation on princi ples of determining compensation or of making payment of compensation This provision therefore in my opinion has been inserted in the Act as a colourable exercise of legis lative power under entry and is unconstitutional on that ground The real question to decide in all such cases is whether what remains is so inextricably bound up with the part declared invalid that what remains cannot independently survive or as it has sometimes been put whether on a fair review of the whole matter it can be assumed that the legislature would have enacted at all that which survives without enacting the part that is ultra vires Looking at the Act as a whole it seems to me that the offending provisions of the Act are not so inextricably bound up with the part that is valid as to hit or kill the remainder also Reference was made to section of the Act which runs as follows The amount of compensation so payable in terms of a compensation Assessment roll as finally published shall be paid in cash or in bonds or partly in cash and partly in bonds Section of the Act empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act It seems clear that the Act has made sufficient provi sion for enforcing its provisions if section is read with the provisions contained in section and it cannot be said that the Act is unenforceable for this reason First ly it was said that the Constitution having in entry of List III of the Seventh Schedule vested authority in the legislature to make laws on the question of the principles as to the payment of compensation and the manner and form of its payment in other words it having trusted these matters to the care judgment and wisdom of the legislature it had no power to delegate these matters to the executive Second ly it was contended that section delegated essential legislative power to the executive which it was incompetent to do The legislature applied its mind to the question of the method and manner of payment of compensation It gave <ORG> the power to determine matters of detail after having settled vital matters of policy It cannot be said in this case that any essential legislative power has been delegated to the executive or that the legislature did not discharge the trust which the Constitution had reposed in it The rest seem to me to be unsubstantial but it is necessary to notice a few of them upon which great stress was laid by the learned counsel This argument really has no force because the provisions as to assessment of compensation enacted in the Land Acquisition Act only apply to acquisi tions that are made by notification under that Act Its provisions have no application to acquisitions made under either local or central laws unless they are specifically made applicable by the provisions of these statutes Mr <NAME> who appeared in three cases Nos and of urged that as regards trust proper ties the Bihar legislature had no power to acquire them without payment of full compensation as certain educational and charitable institutions would thereby be seriously affected The constitutionality of a statute passed by a competent legislature cannot be challenged on the ground that the law made is not reasonable or just The result is that the provisions of the Bihar Land Reforms Act contained in sections and are held not constitutional A writ of mandamus will issue to the State Government not to give effect to the two provisions mentioned above and held unconstitutional I will make no order as to costs in any of these appeals and petition <NAME> had the advantage of going carefully through the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> and I concur entirely in the conclusions arrived at by him In my opinion the Bihar Land Reforms Act of is not unconsti tutional with the exception of the provisions contained in section and of the Act and these provisions alone must be held to be void and inoperative I agree with the line of reasoning adopted by my learned brother in this connection and there is nothing further which I can usefully add For my part I would be prepared to assume that clause of article relates to everything that is provided for in clause either in express terms or even impliedly and consequently the question of the existence of a public purpose does not come within the purview of our enquiry in the present case Even then I would hold that the same reasons which have weighed with my learned brother in declaring section of the impugned Act to be unconstitutional apply with equal if not greater force to section of the Act and I have no hesitation in agreeing with him as regards his decision on the constitutionality of this provision of the Act though I would prefer to adopt a different line of reasoning in support of the same Such arrears could not vest in the <ORG> as a normal result of acquisition of any estate or interest therein and it is conceded by the learned Attorney General that article A of the Constitution has no application so far as these arrears of rent are con cerned It cannot be disputed that in every Government there is inherent authority to appropriate the property of the citizens for the necessities of the <ORG> and constitutional provisions do not confer this power though they generally surround it with safeguards Thus eminent domain is an attribute of sovereign power supposed to be tempered by a principle of natural law which connects its exercise with a duty of compensation Possibly under the impression that the sacredness of private property should not be confided to the uncertain virtues of the party in power for the time being the Con stitution makers of our country have declared it as one of the fundamental rights that no property shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purpose unless the law directing its appropriation makes provision for compensation in the manner laid down in article Clause of article does not do away with the obligation to pay compensation it merely lays down that laws which are re ferred to in clause of the article would be immune from judicial scrutiny on the ground of inadequacy of the Vide Cooley on Constitutional Limitations Vol The clause presupposes however that the enactment is the result of a valid exercise of a legislative power conferred on the legislature by the appropriate entries in the Legislative Lists and if the legislature acts outside these entries or under the pretence of acting within them does something which is in flat contradiction with its contents clause of article could not be invoked to afford any protection to such legislation Money as such and also rights in action are ordinarily excluded from this List by American jurists and for good reasons There could be no possible necessity for taking either of them under the power of eminent domain Money in the hands of a citizen can be reached by the exercise of the power of taxation it may be confiscated as a penalty under judicial order and we can even conceive of cases where the <ORG> seizes or confiscates money belonging to or in the hands of a citizen under the exercise of its police powers on the ground that such fund may be used for unlawful purposes to the detriment of the interest of the community But as <NAME> has pointed out taking money under the right of eminent domain when it must be compensated by money afterwards could be nothing more or less than a forced loan and it is difficult to say that it comes under the head of acquisition or requisitioning of property as described in entry of List II and is embraced within its ordinary connotation It seems to me that there is no difference in principle between them because a chose in action can be available to the acquiring authority only when it is made to produce money Otherwise it is useless alto gether Assuming however that entry of List II is wide enough to include acquisition of money or a right of action I have no hesitation in holding that in providing for compensation in respect of such acquisition the legislature has made a colourable use of entry of List III and has thereby defeated the purpose of that entry altogether I do not however agree with the learned Attorney General for the reasons already given by my learned brother in his judgment that legislation under this head need not provide for any compensation at all and that a legislative provision which declares that no compensation is to be given comes within the ambit of this legislative head But when a legislature has a limited or qualified power and has got to act within a sphere circumscribed by legislative entries the question whether in purporting to act under these entries it has in substance gone beyond them and has done certain things which cannot be accomplished within the scope of these entries is really a question affecting the competency of the legislature This could not possibly have been the real intention of the legislature and I do not think that there is any item in the long legislative lists framed by the Constitution which empowers the legislature to interfere with the legal rights of the landlord in this manner apart from special circumstances like indebtedness or otherwise and impose upon him an onerous obligation to which he is not a consenting party On January when our Constitution came into force the Bill which eventually became the Act was pending before <ORG> After the Bill had been passed by <ORG> it was reserved for the consideration of the President The provisions of the Act have been analysed and summarised in the judgment just delivered by <NAME> and it is not necessary for me to burden this judgment by recapitulating the same As the issues involved grave questions of interpretation of the Constitu tion the suits and applications were placed before a Spe cial Bench of <ORG> and were disposed of on March Article is in these terms If any Bill pending at the commencement of this Consti tution in the <ORG> of a State has after it has been passed by such <ORG> been reserved for the considera tion of the President and has received his assent then notwithstanding anything in this Constitution the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause The respective <ORG> of those States however upheld the validity of the respective State legislations and the aggrieved proprietors came up to this Court either on appeal or on substantive application under article therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part Provided that where such law is a law made by the Legis lature of a State the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent The legal validity of the Constitution First Amendment Act has been recently upheld by this Court and all Courts must give effect to the two new articles which are now substantive parts of our Constitution It has not been disputed that the provisions of the above two newly added articles have to be taken into consideration in disposing of these appeals Learned counsel appearing for the respondents accept the position that as a result of the constitutional amend ments the impugned Act has been removed from the opera tion of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution including article and that the respondents cannot there fore complain of the breach of the equal protection of the laws under article which was the only ground on which the respondents succeeded in <ORG> Learned counsel however maintain that although they cannot now challenge the constitutionality of the Act on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any of the provi sions of Part III of the Constitution it is nevertheless open to them to call the Act into question on other grounds founded on other parts of the Constitution or on general principles of law Accordingly Mr <NAME> formulates the following five principal grounds of attack against the Act namely A On a proper interpretation of articles and read with entry in List II and entry in List III <ORG> had no power to enact the said Act inasmuch as it makes no provision for the payment of just compensation for the proposed acquisition of the zamindaries and tenures Even if the Court does not accept the correctness of the arguments based on entry in List II and entry in List III and holds the respondents barred from going into the question of compensation by reason of articles A and the respondents are still entitled to chal lenge the Act on the ground that the proposed acquisition is not for a public purpose Nor is it claimed in view of articles A and that it is still open to the respondents to call in question the validity of the impugned Act on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges the provision for compensation made in article What is urged is that the obligation to provide for compensation is not a provision to be found exclusively in article a but that it is also provided for in other parts of the Constitution and that in so far as such obligation is found provided else where the impugned Act can well be challenged on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges the provisions of those other parts of the Consti tution for that ground of challenge has not been taken away by articles A and by reason of the delimit ing words used therein The State power to acquire private property is in essence a power to compel the owner to sell his property when the public interest requires it In England Lord <NAME> in Attorney General De <ORG> described the obligation to pay compensation as a necessary concomitant to taking It follows therefore that the obligation to pay compensation is inseparable from and is implicit in the power of acquisi tion On a plain reading of entry in List II the power to make law with respect to matters specified therein is subject to that is to say conditional upon the exercise of legislative power under entry in List III It is urged that <ORG> having purported to exercise its power to make a law for compulsory acquisition of property under entry in App The arguments thus developed by Mr <NAME> undoubtedly have the merit of attractive ingenuity and apparent cogency and certainly call for very careful consid eration To cut at the root of the above argument the learned Attorney General appearing for the appellant <ORG> contends that the impugned Act is a law made with respect to matters mentioned in entry in List II and not under entry in List II This line of reasoning found favour with <NAME> but was rejected by <NAME> and <NAME> There is no doubt that land in entry in List II has been construed in a very wide way but if land or land tenures in that entry is held to cover acquisition of land also then entry in List II will have to be held as wholly redundant so far as acquis tion of land is concerned a conclusion to which I am not prepared tO assent On this point I find myself in agreement with <NAME> and <NAME> and I cannot accept the arguments of the learned Attorney General to the contrary That the obligation to pay compensation is concomitant to that is to say accompanies the power of compulsory taking of private property by the <ORG> cannot be disputed This indicates that the power of acquisition and the obligation to pay compensation are two separate and distinct concepts although the second follows the first If the obligation to pay compensation were an integral part of the concept or the meaning of taking itself then this part of the Fifth Amendment was wholly unnecessary It follows therefore that the expres sion acquisition does not by itself and without more import any obligation to pay compensation It is urged by Mr <NAME> that entry in List III really implements the obligation implicit in entry in List II and the two entries are complementary to each other If this obligation were not implicit in entry in List II then where else it is asked is the obligation to pay compensation to be found The obvious answer is that obligation is to be found in article in Part III of our Constitution The obligation to pay compensation may be introduced as a part of the legislative power itself in which case it becomes a composite power namely a power to make law with respect to acquisition circumscribed by the obligation to provide for compensation But there is no overriding necessity of constitutional law that I know of or that has been brought to our notice which requires that the obliga tion to pay compensation for the acquisition of property must be made part and parcel of the very legislative power to make a law with respect to the compulsory acquisition of private property What do we find in our Constitution We find that under article <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect inter alia to matters specified in entry in List I namely acquisition or requisitioning of property lot the purposes of the <ORG> that the <ORG> Legislatures have exclusive power to make laws with respect inter alia to matters specified in entry a in List II namely the acquisition or requisitioning of property except lot the purposes of the <ORG> subject to the provision of entry of List III and that both <ORG> and the <ORG> Legisla tures may make laws with respect to matters set forth in entry in List III namely the principles for determining the compensation and the form and manner of giving such compensation The scheme of our Constitution obviously is to provide the three things separately namely the power of making a law for acquisition of property in article read with entry in List I and entry in List II the obliga tion of such law to provide for compensation in article and the power of making a law laying down the princi ples for determining such compensation in article read with entry in List III In other words it is not necessary to treat the obligation to pay compensation as implicit in or as a part or parcel of these legislative heads themselves for it is separately and expressly provided for in article I agree with <NAME> that the words subject to have not the meaning sought to be given to them by Mr <NAME> but that they mean but not so as to indicate that the scope of entry in List II is restricted that is to say that the subjectmatter of entry in List III is not within the content of entry in List II Mr <NAME> finally urges that if the obligation to provide for compensation is not implicit in the word acquisition in entry in List II and if that obligation is not to be read into that entry even in view of the words subject to at the end of it even then if the <ORG> exercises its power to make a law with respect to acquisition of property under entry in List II it is the duty of the <ORG> <ORG> to make a law also with re spect to matters specified in entry in List III on the principle that as entry in List III confers a power on the <ORG> for the protection of the interest of persons whose property is compulsorily acquired such power must Article does not make it obligatory for <ORG> or the <ORG> <ORG>s to make a law under any of the entries in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule Article protects a law of the description mentioned therein against the provisions of article It follows there fore that what is sought to be protected by article is a law for the acquisition or taking possession of proper ty which does not amongst other things provide for compen sation or does not fix the amount or specify the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given for otherwise there would be no necessity for any protection The question at once arises as to whether there is any legislative entry in List under which a law for acquisition or taking possession of property without compen sation can be made by <ORG> To test the validity of Mr <NAME> argument and to avoid the compli cation arising out of the residuary powers of <ORG> under article and entry of List II I have taken the case of a law of acquisition made by the legislatures of a <ORG> which also come within article Is there then any entry in List II under which <ORG> can make a law for acquisition without compensation or public purpose Obviously there is none except entry in List II If that entry by itself or read with entry in List III has any implication as suggested namely that a law for acquisition of property made under entry in List II without a provision for compensation will be beyond the legislative competency of the <ORG> Legislatures then there is no other entry under which such a law can be made by <ORG> and there can therefore be no point in making a provision in article for protecting against article a law which on this hypothesis Article postulates a law which offends against and so far as the <ORG> Legislatures are concerned there is no entry in List II except entry under which such an offending law may be made by the <ORG> Legislatures This circumstance unmistakably establishes that entry in List II by itself or read with entry in List III has not any such implication as is imputed to it A law of this kind in so far as such law provides for acquisition of property must necessarily be made by <ORG> If Mr <NAME> contentions were correct a law for the promotion of health or the prevention of danger to life or property involving the acquisition of property without a provision for compensa tion which is what is sought to be protected from article can never be made for the obligation to provide for compensation is according to him implicit in entry in List II by itself or read with entry in List III and there is no other entry under which a law may be made by <ORG> with respect to acquisition of property Similar arguments may as well be founded on article A for that article also protects a law from article which is in Part III of the Consti tution It is suggested that article A postulates a valid law made by a competent legislature within the ambit of its legislative powers In my judgment for the reasons stated above the major premise in the arguments advanced by Mr <NAME> under the first head namely that the obligation to pay compensation is implicit in entry in Lis II by itself or read with entry in List III is un sound The obligation to provide for compensation being as I hold a provision of article and not being implicit in or a part and parcel of the legislative power itself under entry in List II read by itself or in conjunction with entry in List III the impugned Act cannot by virtue of articles A and be called in question on the ground that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions of clause of article that is to say that it does not provide for compensation Assuming that the obligation to pay compensation which is expressly provided in article is also implicit in entry in List II by itself or read with entry in List III the respondents cannot Article and the added articles debar the respondents from question ing the validity of the Act on the ground inter alia that it contravenes or is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by the provisions of clause of article This obligation to provide for compensation is no doubt one of the provisions of article but if as contended by Mr <NAME> the self same provision be found elsewhere in the same Constitution entry in List II or entry in List III then that provision must also be regarded as having been covered by article and the two added articles for otherwise those articles will be rendered nugatory Further it must be borne in mind that article which applies notwithstanding anything in this Constitution will by force of the very words protect the Act against even legislative incompetency if any arising out of the alleged noncompliance with the suggested implied provisions if any of entry in List II and entry in List III It will be noticed that the argument that the Act is unconstitutional is founded on the assumption that it has not laid down any principle for determining compensation as required by entry in List III and that the provision for compensation is wholly illusory The real underlying implica tion of these arguments as I understand them is that the principles are not good enough in that they do not produce fair compensation Therefore there is nothing wrong when calculating the net income of a landlord to deduct something which the landlords should and some of them often do in practice spend under this head If a principle has been laid down in the Act but that principle does not in fact produce any compensation in any rare case or adequate compensation in some cases then the real complaint should be not that no principle has been laid down but that the principle laid down does not produce what may be called just compensation On the other hand even if it is held that no principle has in fact been laid down by the Act as contended then that fact not only amounts to a breach of the provisions of entry in List III but also constitues a breach of the provisions of article which clearly and emphatically requires the law to either fix the compensation or lay down the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be given and a breach of this provision call it a provision of article or one of entry in List III It should also be remembered that article by reason of the words notwithstanding anything in this Constitution occurring therein will also protect the Act even against the alleged legislative incom petency arising out of the noncompliance with all provisions of the Constitution relating to the payment of compensation or the existence of a public purpose including the supposed requirement of producing actual compensation said to be implicit in the provisions of entry in List III On the authority of a passage in Willis Constitutional Law it is argued that the power of eminent domain cannot be exercised with respect to money and choses in action besides certain other unusual forms of property I paragraph and the case of Cincinnati <ORG> cited therein that the modern view is that the right of eminent domain can be exercised on choses in action In any case we are consider whether arrears of rent are property in the sense in which that expression is used in our Constitution and understood in our law Therefore it can equally be acquired by the <ORG> as a species of property It is finally urged that the Act makes no provision for payment of compensation for taking this item of property Apart from this the argument completely overlooks the fact that the arrears of rent are not really cash in the till of the proprietor or tenure holder but is only a debt due by the tenants Even if it be inadequate the grievance will be not that no princi ple has been laid down in the Act as required by entry in List III but that the principle so laid down does not produce adequate compensation and there is therefore a contravention of the provisions of article Re Ground The second point urged by Mr <NAME> is that even if the Court does not accept the argument as to the necessity for providing for compensation being implicit in entry in List II and entry in List III and holds that the respondents are by reason of the provisions of articles A and debarred from questioning the validity of the Act on the ground that it does not provide for compensation the respondents are nevertheless entitled to challenge the Act on the ground of the absence of a public purpose The contention put forward on behalf of the respondents is that the necessity for the existence of a public purpose as a condition precedent to compulsory acquisition of private property is not a provi sion of article but is a requirement of entry in List II or entry in List III The words for public purposes do occur in article but it is said that there is a distinction between a provision and an assumption the other condition is that no property can be taken unless the law which authorises such appropriation contains a provision for payment of compensation in the manner laid down in the clause It confers a fundamental right in so far as it protects private property from <ORG> action In its positive form clause will read Any person may be deprived of his property by authority of law The only limitation put upon the <ORG> action is the requirement that the authority of law is a prerequisite for the exercise of its power to deprive a person of his proper ty These three limita tions constitute the protection granted to the owner of the property and is the measure of his fundamental right under this clause Unless these limitations were provisions of the article the article would have afforded no immunity at all If the requirement of a public purpose were not a provision of article then it will obviously lead us to the untenable conclusion that <ORG> will be free under its residuary powers under article and entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to make a law for acquiring private property with out any public purpose at all and to the still more absurd result that while <ORG> will have to provide for com pensation under article in a law made by it for acqui sition of property for a public purpose it will not have to make any provision for compensation in a law made for acqui sition of property to be made without a public purpose at the end of entry in List II which are supposed to import the provisions of entry in List III into entry in List II is not well founded and it becomes obvious when we look at entry in List I There are no words at the end of that entry as subject to etc Besides turning to entry in List III I find nothing in support of Mr <NAME> contention If the provision of clause of article as to the necessity for the existence of a public purpose as a prerequisite to compulsory acquisition of property is also to be regarded as implicit in those two legislative entries surely articles A and and in particular article which contain the words nothwithstanding anything in this Constitution will protect the Act from such implied provision for reasons I have already ex plained Assuming that the necessity for the existence of a public purpose is not a provision of article but is a provision only of entry in List and or of entry in List III and that consequently articles A and do not preclude the respondents from challenging the validity of the Act on the ground of the legislative incom petency arising out of the absence of a public purpose the question still remains whether there is in fact a public purpose within the meaning of our Constitution to support the Act It is to be noted that there is no recital of any public purpose in the Act itself but it is conceded that this circumstance is not fatal to the validity of the Act It is claimed that apart from the absence of any such recital there is no indication whatever as to the existence of any public purpose in any of the operative provisions of the Act It is not disputed that as a result of this enactment a very large sum of money now payable by the tenants as and by way of current rent and arrears of rent to their respective landlords will be intercepted by the <ORG> but it is urged on the authority of certain passages in <NAME> Constitu tional Limitations th Edn That the Act has no public purpose to support it is sought to be established by saying that in Bihar the recorded proprietors are about in number and that assuming that there are four persons in a family nearly five and a half million people will be ruined as a result of this legislation although the actual tillers of the soil will derive no benefit whatever therefrom for they will remain where they are and will have to continue as heretofore to pay their rent instead of to their present landlords to the <ORG> which they will find is no better than a ruthless machine unsusceptible to any humane feeling This leads me to a consideration of what is a public purpose within the meaning of our Constitution We have been referred to some American authorities for ascertaining the meaning and implication of public use an expression which obviously is of a more limited import than the expression public purpose used in our Constitution The learned author thereupon proceeds to discuss the more restricted meaning given to that expression It should be borne in mind that <ORG> in that case had to consider the meaning of the words public purposes occurring in a lease of the th century Our Constitution as I understand it has not ignored the individual but has endea voured to harmonise the individual interest with the para mount interest of the community Further the moment even this regulated freedom of the individual becomes incompatible with and threatens the freedom of the community the <ORG> is given power by article to deprive the individual of his life and per sonal liberty in accordance with procedure established by law subject of course to the provisions of article Likewise our Constitution gives protection to the right of private property by article not absolutely but subject to reasonable restrictions to be imposed by law in the interest of the general public The words public purposes used in article indicate that the Constitution uses those words in a very large sense If therefore the <ORG> is to give effect to these avowed purposes of our Constitution we must regard as a public purpose all that will be calculated to promote the welfare of the people as envisaged in these directive prin ciples of <ORG> policy whatever else that expression may mean It cannot be overlooked that the directive principles set forth in Part IV of Constitu tion are not merely the policy of any particular political party but are intended to be principles fixed by the Consti tution for directing the <ORG> policy whatever party may come into power Further it must always be borne in mind that the object of the impugned Act is not to authorise the stray acquisition of a particular propery for a limited and narrow public purpose but that its purpose is to bring the bulk of the land producing wealth under <ORG> ownership or control by the abolition of the system of land tenure which has been found to be archaic and non conducive to the gener al interest of the community It is impossible to say that there is no public purpose to support the Act Would <ORG> have thought fit to protect these Acts unless it were con vinced that this Act was necessary in the general interest of the community I find myself in agreement with <NAME> and <NAME> that these circumstances also clearly indi cate that <ORG> regarded this Act as well supported by a public purpose Assuming says he that there is in the Act a general public purpose for compulsory acquisition of zamindaries and tenures there cannot conceivably be any public purpose in support of the Act in so far as it authorises the taking of the arrears of rent or the taking away of to per cent One may just as well say that there is no public purpose in the acquisition of for ests or of mines and particularly of undeveloped mines for such acquisition has no bearing on a scheme of agrarian reforms in that it does not improve or affect the conditions of the tillers of the surface of the soil of the gross assets as acquisition or confiscation at all but I regard it for reasons stated above as a part of a principle laid down by the Act for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation as required by arti cle and entry in List III As however I have taken the view that no part of the Act is bad for want of a public purpose I need not pursue any further the question of the severability of the Act or to refer to the judicial decisions relied on by learned counsel on both sides I ask myself as to why must it be characterised as a fraud I find nothing in the Constitution which says that the arrears of rent must not be acquired and therefore there is no necessity for any covert attempt to do what is not prohibited I have already dealt with the question of absence of a provision for just compensation while dealing with Mr <NAME> first point and I repeat that the obligation to provide for compensation is not implicit in entry in List II by itself or read with entry in List III but is to be found only in article that under entry in List III the Act has laid down a principle for determining compensation and therefore there can be no question as to legislative incompetency for any alleged non compliance with any sup posed requirement said to be implicit in these entries If the principles so laid down in the Act do not in any rare case produce any compensation or do not produce adequate compensation in some cases such absence of compensation may be a contravention of article but in view of arti cles A and and particularly due to the words notwithstanding anything in this Constitution occurring in article it cannot be made a ground of attack on the Act even though such ground is formulated in a different but attractive language namely as a fraud on the Constitu tion I however repeat that ii I took a different view I would still have the same difficulty as to the inseverability of the different provisions of the Act as I have hereinbe fore indicated It has therefore failed to discharge the duty which was expressly left to its knowledge wisdom and patriotism When I look at the matter on the basis of the principles laid down in that case by the late Chief Justice and my learned brothers to which Mr <NAME> has referred I have to overrule his contention all the same Here section clearly indicates that the <ORG> has applied its mind to the problem and it has laid down the principle that the compensation may be paid in cash or in bonds or partly in cash and partly in bonds and that ii a payment is to be made either wholly or partly in bonds these bonds may be either negotiable or non negotiable and non transferable Having laid down the principle the <ORG> has by a rule made under section left it to the <ORG> to determine the pro portion in which the compensation shall be payable in cash and in bonds and the manner of such payment of compen sation It has no application to lands acquired under other statutes and therefore the provision for compensation of the Land Acqui sition Act cannot apply to acquisitions under the Bihar Act and therefore the doctrine of occupied field can have no application In my opinion there is no substance in this contention For reasons stated above I allow these appeals <NAME> which have given rise to these cases have been fully set out in the judgment just now delivered by my learned brother <NAME> and need not be repeated Ordinarily I would have stopped with the expression of my agreement but having regard to the importance of the question argued and the stakes in volved I desire to add a few words of my own on some of the points discussed Article of our Constitution provides No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law There are three modes of deprivation a destruction acquisition and requisition In the case of acquisition there is an element of permanency and in the case of requisition there is an element of temporariness When we come to entry of List Concurrent List we find these words Principles on which compensation for property acquired or requisitioned for the purposes of the <ORG> or of a <ORG> or for any other public purpose is to be determined and the form and the manner in which such compensation is to be given From very early times law has recognized the right of <ORG> compulsorily to acquire private properties of individuals for a public purpose and this has come to be known as the law of eminent domain override or disregard this ordinary princi ple if it sees fit to do so but it is not likely that it will be found disregarding it without plain expres sions of such a purpose This principle is embodied in article of our Con stitution in these terms No property movable or immovable including any inter est in or in any company owning any commercial or indus trial undertaking shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given We shall not here trouble ourselves with sub clauses and of the article and with articles A and which were introduced by way of amendment under the Constitution First Amendment Act dated No resort can be had to anything implicit or hidden when the statute makes an ex press provision on the same subject Entry means nothing more than a power conferred on the <ORG> for achieving this end The power is conferred but there is no duty cast to provide for compensation For any statement that the payment of compensation is a primary condition for acquisition of property for a public purpose we have to look at the provisions of the Constitution itself and this we find in article as stated already There is nothing in <NAME> case that supports the argument he consider ation of the President and has received his assent then notwithstanding anything in this Constitution the law so assented to shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause The Bill which subsequently became The Bihar Land Reforms Act was pending at the commencement of the Constitution in the legislature of the State and after it was passed by the legislature it was reserved for the consideration of the President and received his assent Therefore the bar that it shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause becomes applicable True compensation has to be provided for by reason of sub clause of the article but sub clause postulates an exception and the right to challenge the validity of the Act on the ground that no compensation has been provided for or that the compensation is really illusory or inadequate is taken away of this Part no law providing for the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part Provided that where such law is a law made by the Legis lature of a State the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent Article provides Validation of certain Acts and Regulations Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article A none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or even to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsist ent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights con ferred by any provisions of this Part and notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent <ORG> to repeal or amend it continue in force In the face of these almost insuperable obstacles <NAME> candidly admitted that he could urge nothing as regards the adequacy or the illusory nature of the compensation provided in the Act if he was not able to convince the <ORG> on his main point that he could challenge the offend ing Act on grounds other than those mentioned in Part III of the Constitution and that there was something in entries No of the State List and No of the Concurrent List read together which imposed on <ORG> an obligation to provide lot the payment of just or proper compensation and that the non observance of this obligation entitles him to challenge the validity of the Act as unconstitutional Under the Land Acquisition Act I of a declaration by the <ORG> that land is needed for a public purpose shall be conclusive evidence that the land is so needed and <ORG> cannot go into the question whether the public purpose has been made out or not There is no such provision in any article of the Constitution with which we have to deal The existence of a public purpose is not a provision or condition imposed by article as a limitation on the exercise of the power of acquisition When the legislature declares that there is a public purpose behind the legislation we have of course to respect its words It stands on no better footing than if the Act sought to take over the cash on hand or in the banks of the zamindars proprietors or tenureholders Property of individuals cannot be appropriated by the <ORG> under the power of eminent domain for the mere purpose of adding to its reve nues taxation is the recognised mode to secure this end <NAME> says in his Constitutional Law at page While as stated above any and all property is in general subject to the exercise of the power of eminent domain there are certain rather unusual forms of private property which cannot thus be taken II of his book on Constitutional Limita tions at page From this statement however must be excepted money or that which in ordinary use passes as such and which the Government may reach by taxation and also rights in action which can only be available when made to produce money neither of which can it be needful to take under this power In the footnote he points out Taking money under the right of eminent domain when it must be compensated in money afterwards could be nothing more or less than a forced loan only to be justified as a last resort in a time of extreme peril where neither the credit of the government nor the power of taxation could be made available The question has arisen whether money can be taken by eminent domain and it has been held or intimated at least in so far as a state or When the merger took place the city of Brooklyn was given power to purchase or to condemn the property of the company within years but it did neither In the legislature passed another Act authorising the City of Brooklyn to condemn the property of the company provided the necessary proceedings were commenced within one year after the passing of the Act On error <ORG> confirmed the condemnation and rejected the argument that there was any impairment of the contract Where the legislative action is arbitrary in the sense that it has no reasonable relation to the purpose in view there is a transgression by the legislature of the limits of its power
