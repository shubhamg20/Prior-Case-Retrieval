In the assessment year the relevant accounting year ending on March the assessee received dividends on the said shares amounting to Rs The Income tax Officer rejected the contentions of the assessee and held that the funds of the assessee remained invested in a concern in which the persons referred to in Sub section of Section of the Act viz Being aggrieved the assessee preferred an appeal from the assessment to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner It was held that as no funds of the assessee had been invested in the said shares and that as the assessee had received the shares themselves by way of donation the provisions of Section read with Section had no application and that the dividend received by the assessee from the said shares was exempt from income tax It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> before the Tribunal that as the assessee continued to hold the said shares even after April the assessee ceased to be entitled to claim exemption from income tax in respect of the dividends received from the said shares under Section by reason of the provisions of Section It was contended on behalf of the assessee before the <ORG> that the expressions fund and invest which were not defined in the Income tax Act had to be construed with reference to their dictionary meaning It was contended on behalf of the assessee that the assessee had received the said shares qua shares by way of donation It was contended that only where there was a positive action by an assessee to make an investment out of funds already in its possession the provision of Section a would be attracted Section it was submitted would become operative only in cases where the funds of the assessee were invested by it in any concern in which the persons referred to in Section had a substantial interest and the investment was continued beyond June The <ORG> held further that in view of the meaning of the expressions fund and invest as found in the dictionaries it was necessary for the <ORG> to establish that the investment had been made by the assessee out of its funds in a concern in which the persons referred to in Section had a substantial interest and that such investments continued beyond June The <ORG> held that on the facts the provisions of Section had no application and the assessee was entitled to claim exemption from income tax in respect of the dividend received from the said shares On an application of the <ORG> under Section the <ORG> has referred the following question as a question of law arising out of its order for the opinion of this court Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and on a proper interpretation of Sections and of the Income tax Act the <ORG> was justified in holding that the assessee would be entitled to claim exemption in respect of dividend income of Rs Income from property held for charitable or religious purposes Subject to the provisions of Sections to the following income shall not be included in the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt of the income a income derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes to the extent to which such income is applied to such purposes in India and where any such income is accumulated or set apart for application to such purposes in India to the extent to which the income so accumulated or set apart is not in excess of twenty five per cent Section not to apply in certain cases Nothing contained in Section or Section shall operate so as to exclude from the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt thereof in the case of a trust for charitable or religious purposes or a charitable or religious institution any income thereof ii if any part of such income or any property of the trust or institution whenever created or established is during the previous year used or applied directly or indirectly for the benefit of any person referred to in Subsection As the assessee held on to the said shares the funds of the assessee continued to remain invested in the company in which the persons specified in Section had a substantial interest An asset or group of assets set aside for a specific purpose A sum of money or other liquid assets set apart for a specific purpose or available for the payment of debts or claims In the plural this word has a variety of slightly different meanings as follows moneys and much more such as notes bills cheques drafts stocks and bonds and in broader meaning may include property of every kind Money in hand assets cash money available for the payment of a debt legacy etc Corporate stocks or government securities in this sense usually spoken of as the funds Assets securities bonds or revenue of a <ORG> or Government appropriated for the discharge of its debts Generally working capital sometimes used to refer to cash or to cash and marketable securities An asset or group of assets within any organization separated physically or in the accounts or both from other assets and limited to specific uses Example a trust fund created by a will an endowment fund a sinking fund Current assets less current liabilities on an accrual basis working capital a term used in cash flow statements When used in connection with the word fund in its second meaning they connote that for the purposes of the account in which the fund finds a place the payment is debited to that fund an operation which of course has no relation to the actual method of payment or the particular cash resources out of which the payment is made In the assessment year involved the accounting year ending on March the question arose whether the assessee was entitled to exemption from income tax in respect of the said amounts donated under Section The learned advocate for the assessee reiterated the submissions made on behalf of the assessee before the <ORG> a sum of money or other resources the principal or interest of which is set apart for a specific objective to commit money in order to earn a financial return It was submitted that the assessee having received the said shares by way of donation the same could not be deemed to be funds in his hands nor could it be held that the assessee had invested its funds in the said shares within the meaning of the said Section Some time in the assessee settled the income from all its properties as also income derived from business carried on by it in trust for carrying out charitable objects as set out in the trust deed In the assessment year involved the assessee claimed exemption under Section which was rejected by the Income tax Officer It was held that in order to constitute an investment money must be laid out in such a manner as to acquire some species of property which would bring an income to the investor In this connection he drew our attention to Section as amended by the Finance Act with effect from April It appears to us that in construing Section the meaning of the expression fund will have to be determined not only with reference to dictionaries or to commercial parlance or to the principles of accountancy but also in the context of the said section itself If any other meaning is given to the expression funds the same will not be available for investment or capable of being invested The expression invest in Section in our view connotes a positive act on the part of the trust whereby the funds of the trust are laid out or committed in any particular property or business or transaction with the object of earning profit or financial advantage or return It has to be established that a trust having assets in the form of money or cash or a credit balance in a bank account or in any other form capable of being invested was by a positive act and pursuant to a decision of the trust laid out or committed in a concern of a nature specified before it can be held that such an investment comes within the mischief of Section It appears from the facts as found that the assessee in the instant case received the shares of the company by way of donation Apart from the acceptance by the assessee of the said shares there was no decision or action on the part of the assessee Some light is thrown on the point by the amendment incorporated in Section by the Finance Act noted hereinbefore Under the said amended section the benefit conferred by Section stands withdrawn not only where the funds of the trust are invested or remain invested in a manner other than that prescribed but also where the trust holds any shares in a company other than a <ORG> company or a statutory corporation after a specified date Therefore the user or the application of any property of the assessee for the benefit of persons referred to in Section if any occurred prior to June We answer the question referred in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee
