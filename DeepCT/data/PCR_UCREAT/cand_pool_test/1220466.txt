Shortly thereafter the first respondent preferred a petition in <ORG> wherein it was prayed that of the Act should be declared ultra vires and the arbitrator should be directed to forbear from awarding compensation on the principles laid down in the section Its vires were to be decided on the anvil of the Constitution as it stood before the said amendment It has no relation to the value of the land on the date of the notice under which may be many years after the date of requisition In assessing the just equivalent of the value of the property at twice the price which the requisitioned property would have fetched in the open market had it been sold on the date of requisition the arbitrator would be acting arbitrarily inasmuch as he would be proceeding on a formula for which there is no rational basis The expression have regard to in sub cl Appeal from the judgment and order dated August of <ORG> in Misc The notification was to the effect that the land was being acquired I by <ORG> <ORG> that it would vest in the <ORG> from the date of the notification and there was a declaration of vesting in the notification itself The arguments advanced on behalf of <ORG> were that of the Act did not infringe any of the Articles of the Constitution mentioned in the petition and that the petitioner was entitled to no relief because of the delay in presentation of the petition to <ORG> <ORG> negatived the contentions put forward oil behalf of <ORG> and allowed the petition holding that cl including the words whichever is less of sub of of the Act was ultra vires Art In order to appreciate the contention put forward on behalf of <ORG> it is necessary to refer to a few sections of the Act It is agreed between the parties that the property which was originally requisitioned in was to be treated as requisitioned under of the Act Under it became competent to <ORG> if it was of opinion that it was necessary to acquire the property already subjected to requisition for a public purpose to acquire the same by publishing in <ORG> a notice to the effect that <ORG> had decided to acquire the property in pursuance of the section Under cl it is open to the Central <ORG> to nominate a person having expert knowledge as to the nature of the property requisitioned or acquired to assist the arbitrator in which case the person to be compensated has a similar right of nominating his assessor the arbitrator shall after hearing the dispute make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to him to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom such compensation shall be paid and in making the award he shall have regard to the circumstances of each case and the provisions of sub sections and so far as they are applicable Sub ss namely i pecuniary loss due to requisitioning ii expenses on account of vacating the requisitioned premises iii expenses on account of reoccupying the premises upon release from requisition and iv damages other than normal wear and tear caused to the property during the period of requisition including the expenses that may have to be incurred for restoring the property to the condition in which it was at the time of requisition Its vires is to be decided on the anvil of the Constitution as it stood before the said amendment Whether such principles take into account all the elements which make up the true value of the property appropriated and exclude matters which are to be neglected is a justiciable issue to be adjudicated by the court of an anterior date which might have no relation to the value of the land when it is acquired may be many years later cannot but be regarded as arbitrary Any principle for determining compensation which denies to the owner this increment in value cannot result in the ascertainment of the true equivalent of the land appropriated After noting that it was a matter of common knowledge that land values had risen steeply after the last world war the judgment proceeded To deny to the owner of the land compensation at rates which justly indemnify him for his loss by awarding him compensation at rates prevailing ten years before the date on which the notification under was issued amounts in the circumstances to a flagrant in fringement of the fundamental right of the owner of the land under Art On October judgments were delivered in two cases where the law on the subject came to be examined again A reference was made to the earlier cases and it was said that <NAME> case laid down the following principles The expression compensation in Art of the Constitution meant just equivalent of what the owner has been deprived of The principles laid down by the legislature shall be only for the determination of the compensation so defined Whether the principles have taken into account the relevant elements to ascertain the true value of the property acquired is a justiciable issue and The fixation of an anterior date for the ascertainment of the value of the property acquired without reference to any relevant circumstances which necessitated the fixing of an earlier date for the purpose of ascertaining the real value is arbitrary a twofold argument was put up before us by learned counsel for the appellant It was argued that cl It was urged that the first portion of sub cl reading the arbitrator shall after hearing the dispute make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to him to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom such compensation shall be paid was mandatory while the succeeding portion reading and in making the award he shall have regard to the circumstances of each case and the provisions of subsections and In other words the contention was that although the arbitrator had to consider the various circumstances mentioned in sub and modes prescribed in sub those circumstances or modes nowhere fettered his powers of awarding compensation We cannot accept this proposition It has no relation to the value of the land at the date of the notice under which may be many years after the date of requisition No grounds were shown and no circumstances were brought to our notice which necessitated the fixing of the date of requisition as the one for ascertaining the real value of the property In assessing the just equivalent of the value of the property at twice the price which the requisitioned property would have fetched in the open market if it had been sold on the date of requisition the arbitrator would be acting arbitrarily inasmuch as he would be proceeding on a formula for which there is no rational basis The expression have regard to in sub cl There this Court observed that the fixing of an anterior date for arriving it the market value of the land did not ispo facto invalidate the acquisition but that there might be circumstances which would justify such a fixation and it was there pointed out that it was for the <ORG> to show that fixation of compensation at the market value of an anterior date did not amount to violation of the constitutional guarantee In that case also the validity of the Madras Act had to be examined with reference to Art In this case however there is no such difficulty We cannot therefore accept the proposition that the impugned clause satisfies the requirements of Art the compensation on July and the petitioner approached the Court on September <ORG> was not satisfied that there was delay and said In any case having regard to the importance of the points raised and assuming that there was delay we would certainly condone the delay
