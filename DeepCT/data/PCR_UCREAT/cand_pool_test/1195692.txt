The Income tax Officer subsequently reopened the assessment under Section of the Income tax Act hereinafter to be referred to as the Act on the ground that the capital gains arising to the assessee on account of the transfer of a property had not been brought to tax He then sold this one half interest in the property to his daughter <NAME> on September for Rs The Income tax Officer therefore came to the conclusion that the income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment Section of the Act is to the following effect If a the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return under Section for any assessment year to the Income tax Officer or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year or notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in Clause a on the part of the assessee the Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for any assessment year Even though there is no decision directly on the point guidelines are supplied by some of the decisions of <ORG> and the various <ORG> cited at the <ORG> Decisions are however uniform on the points to be satisfied before a reassessment under Section can be resorted to and they are The Income tax Officer should receive information after the original assessment and In consequence of such information he should reasonably believe that the income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment It was on this information according to the revenue that the Income tax Officer entertained the plea that the income had escaped assessment I that information in the context it occurs in Section must mean instruction or knowledge derived from an external source concerning facts or particulars or as to law relating to a matter bearing on the assessment It must not be a mere information of some one who has no authority to pronounce upon the law There the original assessment of the assessee for was made by the Income tax Officer treating the assessee income from bank deposits as earned income and accepting her claim for deduction of salary paid to her daughter in law as expenditure Thereafter the revenue audit staff working under the Comptroller and Auditor General of India while scrutinising the assessments brought to the notice of the department that the Income tax Officer had wrongly treated the interest income as business income and had wrongly allowed the assessee claim with regard to the salary paid to her daughter in law Thereupon the Income tax Officer issued notices under the section and made reassessments Though the reassessment might be the result of a change of opinion on the part of the Income tax Officer the change of opinion was not on his own initiative or on his own reconsideration of the available material it was one brought about as a result of information from an external source which came into his possession subsequent to the original assessments and The Comptroller and Auditor General of India has the statutory right to scrutinise the proceedings of all departments of the Government including the income tax department and to point out any defects or mistakes in such proceedings which adversely affect the revenues of the <ORG> On the other hand <ORG> has widened the scope and ambit of external source as is evident from the following observation in the judgment Jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to reassess income arises if he has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment No decision was brought to our notice which would in so many terms restrict the scope of external source to judgments or orders of courts and <ORG> under the Act a Division Bench of <ORG> interpreting the scope of the word information which has come into his possession under the section has observed We are unable to accept the extreme proposition that nothing that can be found in the record of the assessment which itself would show escape of assessment or under assessment can be viewed as information which led to the belief that there has been escape from assessment or under assessment Suppose a mistake in the original order of assessment is not discovered by the Income tax Officer himself on further scrutiny but it is brought to his notice by another assessee or even by a subordinate or a superior officer that would appear to be information disclosed to the Income tax Officer Previously there was another firm the partners of which were one <NAME> and his three major and minor sons That firm carried on business from January to July when <NAME> died There was no need for dissolving the old partnership Subsequently the Income tax Officer issued a notice under section and initiated proceedings under Section But finally the <ORG> upholding the contention held that the Income tax Officer was not justified in reopening the assessment under Section as he had no information within the meaning of the sub section We are therefore of the view that the proceedings initiated in the present case under Section on the basis of the audit note are legal and valid Question answered in the affirmative A copy of this judgment will be sent under the seal of the court and the signature of the Registrar to <ORG> Cochin Bench
