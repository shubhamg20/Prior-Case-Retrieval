We think that Section of the Civil Procedure Code does not take away the right of appeal which is given by Clause of the Letters Patent We agree in the view taken by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> Shivlal Khubchand I Bom One very cogent reason which has induced us to take this view and which seems almost conclusive upon the point is that if the appeal under Clause of the Charter were taken away a judgment in this <ORG> of a Judge in a Division Bench who agreed with the <ORG> below upon a question of fact would be absolutely final However important the case might be no appeal would lie to <ORG> from that judgment This is clear from Section of the Civil Procedure Code which enacts that no appeal shall lie to Her Majesty in Council from the judgment of one Judge of the High <ORG> or of one Judge of a Division <ORG> or of two or more Judges of the High <ORG> where they are equally divided in opinion We are of opinion therefore that the question referred to us should be answered in the affirmative
