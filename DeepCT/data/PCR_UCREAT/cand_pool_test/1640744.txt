All the aforesaid appeals have been filed against the judgments and orders of <ORG> at Cuttack which have been passed placing reliance on its earlier judgments in similar cases The appeal has been preferred against the judgment and order dated of <ORG> at Cuttack in Writ Petition Civil No of However the said Notification was applicable only in such cases where the post has been granted the benefit of grant in aid Scheme by and person manning that post had a good academic record i per cent or its equivalent grade in a Masters Course Respondent did not make any representation before any authority to get the benefit of the said Notification dated rather approached <ORG> on by filing Writ Petition Civil No of seeking a direction to <ORG> to pay the pre revised pay scale with effect from placing reliance on the various orders passed by <ORG> earlier in cases of other persons in case OJC No of On the other hand it has been submitted by learned counsel for the appellants that factual and legal issues involved in these cases have never been considered either by <ORG> or by this Court in proper perspective Therein the question arose as to whether the respondent herein had been appointed by following the procedure prescribed by the law for making the appointment As the <ORG> had raised the issue that respondent had been appointed without following any procedure known in law for this purpose her appointment itself was illegal and void It is pointed out by the learned counsel for the respondents herein that <ORG> at Bhubneshwar had condoned the deficiency of eligibility qualification by passing general orders from time to time Thus the question does arise as to whether the delay and laches could be condoned all together giving the respondents the impetus of the earlier judgments in cases of persons who had been diligent enough to approach the <ORG> within a reasonable period It has been further submitted by learned counsel for the respondents that teachers in government colleges have also been granted the said benefit though not entitled and the respondents herein cannot be given hostile treatment in case the impugned judgments and orders herein are not upheld Considering the rival submissions made by learned counsel for the parties we are of the view that as the questions raised hereinabove had never been considered by any of the courts and involve substantial questions of law of public importance the cases require proper adjudication Rule Condition of eligibility of candidates Provided that upper age limit may be relaxable in respect of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes and such other categories as may be specified by <ORG> from time to time for recruitment to the similar or corresponding post under the <ORG> iii <ORG> passed a resolution dated and condoned the deficiency of qualification of different non government college teachers The Universities which have made order of condonation after the concerned <ORG> may refer the matter to <ORG> and secure their concurrence for condonation While dealing with the aforesaid issues we have taken into consideration all submissions made by all the counsel involved in these group matters It also connotes the whole course of scholastic instruction which a person has received Education connotes the process of training and developing the knowledge skill mind and character of students by formal schooling AIR SC this Court extensively quoted the Report of <ORG> i Radhakrishnan Commission wherein grave concern was expressed observing that there is negligence in applying criteria of merit in the selection of teachers In view of the above it is evident that education is necessary to develop the personality of a person as a whole and in totality as it provides the process of training and acquiring the knowledge skills developing mind and character by formal schooling Even if the names of candidates are requisitioned from <ORG> in addition thereto it is mandatory on the part of the employer to invite applications from all eligible candidates from the open market by advertising the vacancies in newspapers having wide circulation or by announcement in <ORG> as merely calling the names from the <ORG> does not meet the requirement of the said Article of the Constitution Therefore continuation of a person wrongly appointed on post does not create any right in his favour After considering the provisions of the Secondary Education Services Commission Rules and Intermediate Education Act this Court came to a conclusion that lacking eligibility as per the rules advertisement cannot be cured at any stage and making appointment of such a person tantamounts to an illegality and not an irregularity thus cannot be cured A person lacking the eligibility cannot approach the court for the reason that he does not have a right which can be enforced through court AIR SC this <ORG> while dealing with the same issue held that once it is established that there is no power to relax the essential qualifications the entire process of selection of the candidate was in contravention of the established norms prescribed by advertisement Once it is most satisfactorily established that <ORG> did not have the power to relax essential qualification the entire process of selection so far as the selected candidate is concerned gets vitiated They were bound by the rules AIR SC this Court held Even assuming that there is a power of relaxation under the Regulations the power of relaxation cannot be exercised in such a manner that it completely distorts the Regulations In the very first appeal the respondent filed Writ Petition on claiming relief under the Notification dated without furnishing any explanation for such inordinate delay and on laches on her part Section of the Limitation Act makes it obligatory on the part of the court to dismiss the Suit or appeal if made after the prescribed period even though the limitation is not set up as a defence and there is no plea to raise the issue of limitation even at appellate stage because in some of the cases it may go to the root of the matter However the doctrine of limitation being based on public policy the principles enshrined therein are applicable and writ petitions are dismissed at initial stage on the ground of delay and laches In such an eventuality the petition may be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches and the court may refuse to grant relief for the initial period in case of an unexplained and inordinate delay This <ORG> has consistently rejected the contention that a petition should be considered ignoring the delay and laches in case the petitioner approaches the <ORG> after coming to know of the relief granted by the <ORG> in a similar case as the same cannot furnish a proper explanation for delay and laches A litigant cannot wake up from deep slumber and claim impetus from the judgment in cases where some diligent person had approached the <ORG> within a reasonable time Thus even if some other similarly situated persons have been granted some benefit inadvertently or by mistake such order does not confer any legal right on the petitioner to get the same relief Once the court comes to the conclusion that a wrong order has been passed it becomes the solemn duty of the court to rectify the mistake rather than perpetuate the same It is the educational authorities of the State which grant recognition to <ORG> for opening or running an educational institution Procedural fairness is an implied mandatory requirement to protect against arbitrary action where Statute confers wide power coupled with wide discretion on an authority AIR SC came across with an illegal order passed by the statutory authority violating the provisions of Articles and of the Constitution It appears to have been passed by the Government to oblige the respondents emphasis added xv The cases had been entertained and relief had been granted by <ORG> without considering the issue of delay and laches merely placing reliance upon earlier judgments obtained by diligent persons approaching the courts within a reasonable time xvi The authority passed illegal orders in contravention of the constitutional provisions arbitrarily without any explanation whatsoever polluting the entire education system of the State ignoring the purpose of grant in aid scheme itself that it has been so provided to maintain the standard of education Thus it clearly makes out a case of deciding a case without any application of mind xix The grievance of the respondents that not upholding the orders passed by <ORG> in their favour would amount to a hostile discrimination is not worth acceptance for the reason that Article of the Constitution envisages only positive equality In view of the above it stands crystal clear that a teacher who had been appointed without possessing the requisite qualification at initial stage cannot get the benefit of grant in aid scheme unless he acquires the additional qualification and therefore question of grant of <ORG> pay scale would not arise in any circumstance unless such teacher acquires the additional qualification making him eligible for the benefit of grant in aid scheme The cumulative effect therefore comes to that such teacher will not be entitled to claim the <ORG> pay scale unless he acquires the higher qualification i Phil Ph Thus we pass the following directions i In case of dispute regarding possessing of marks the authorities Secretary of Higher Education Director of Higher Education may examine the factual position and decide the case of individual teachers in accordance with law laid down in this case ii If a person did not possess the requisite qualification on the date of appointment and was not entitled for grant in aid scheme unless he completes the deficiency his case would be considered from the date of completing the deficiency for grant of <ORG> pay scale
