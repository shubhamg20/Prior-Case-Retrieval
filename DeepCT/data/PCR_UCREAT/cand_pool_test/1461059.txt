The assessee is a Limited Company having its Head Office in Calcutta HEADNOTE It has inter alia a Cotton Mill situated in West Pakistan where it carries on business of manufacturing and selling cotton fabrics It is now well settled that the way in which entries are made by an assessee in his books of account is not determinative of the question whether the assessee has earned any profit or suffered any loss The question arising in the case is whether the loss sustained by the assessee was a trading loss and if it was a trading loss whether it would be liable to be deducted in computing the taxable profit of the assessee under Sec The argument which found favour with <ORG> was that because the devaluation was an act of the sovereign power it could not be regarded as a loss arising in the course of the business of the assessee or incidental to such business is plainly erroneous It is not the factor or circumstance which caused the loss that is material in determining the true nature and character of the loss but whether the loss has occurred in the course of carrying on the business or is incidental to it If there is a loss in trading asset it would be a trading loss whatever be its cause because it would be a loss in the course of carrying on the business It is of course not easy to define precisely what is the line of demarcation between fixed capital and circulating capital but there is a well recognised distinction between the two concepts It is clear from the authorities that where profit or loss arises to an assessee on account of appreciation or depreciation in the value of foreign currency held by it on conversion into another currency such profit or loss would ordinarily be trading profit or loss if the foreign currency is held by the assesses on <ORG> account or as trading asset or as part of circulating capital embarked in the business But if on the other hand the foreign currency is held as a capital asset or as fixed capital such profit or loss would be of capital nature If these two amounts were employed in the business in West Pakistan and formed part of the circulating capital of that business the loss of Rs lakhs resulting to the assessee on remission of these two amounts on account of alterations in the rate of exchange would be a trading loss but if instead these two amounts were held on capital account and mere part of fixed capital the loss would plainly be a capital loss Ordinarily the <ORG> would have called for a supplementary statement of the case from the <ORG> but since both the parties agreed that it would be proper that the matter should go back to the <ORG> with a direction to the <ORG> either to take additional evidence itself or to direct the Income Tax Officer to take additional evidence and make a report the <ORG> made an order accordingly and directed the tribunal to dispose of the case on the basis of the additional evidence and in the light of the law laid down in the Judgment The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> These appeals by special leave are directed against a judgment of <ORG> answering the first question referred to it by the <ORG> in favour of the <ORG> and against the assessee There were in all five questions referred by the <ORG> but questions Nos to no longer survive and these appeals are limited only to question No for the assessment year in respect of remittances of profit from Pakistan was not allowable as a deduction Since there are two assessment years in regard to which the question arises there are two appeals one in respect of each assessment year but the question is the same <ORG> will briefly state the facts as that is necessary for the purpose of answering the question The assessee is a limited company having its head office in Calcutta It has inter alia a cotton mill situate in West Pakistan where it carries on business of manufacturing and selling cotton fabrics This profit obviously accrued to the assessee in West Pakistan and according to the official rate of exchange which was then prevalent namely Pakistani rupees being equal to Indian rupees this profit which may for the sake of convenience be referred to as Pakistan profit amounted to Rs But by the time these remittances came to be made the rate of exchange had as pointed out above once again changed to Pakistani rupees being equal to Indian rupees and the amounts received by the assessee in terms of Indian rupees were therefore the same namely Rs The assessee thereupon preferred the present appeal after obtaining certificate of fitness from <ORG> The first question that arises for consideration is whether the assessee suffered any loss on the remittance of Rs That takes us to the next and more important question whether the loss sustained by the assessee was a trading loss The argument which found favour with <ORG> was that the loss was caused on account of devaluation of the Pakistani rupee which was an act of the sovereign power and it could not therefore be regarded as a loss arising in the course of the business of the assessee or incidental to such business This argument is plainly erroneous and cannot stand scrutiny even for a moment The loss is as much a trading loss as any other and it makes no difference that it is occasioned by devaluation brought about by an act of <ORG> It is not the factor or circumstance which causes the loss that is material in determining the true nature and character of the loss but whether the loss has occurred in the course of carrying on the business or is incidental to it If there is loss in a trading asset it would be a trading loss whatever be its cause because it would be a loss in the course of carrying on the business It is of course not easy to define precisely what is the line of demarcation between fixed capital and circulating capital but there is a well recognised distinction between the two concepts If there is any loss resulting from depreciation of the foreign currency which is embarked or adventured in the business and is part of the circulating capital it would be a trading loss but depreciation of fixed capital on account of alteration in exchange rate would be a capital loss We will first refer to the English decisions on the subject for they are quite illuminating There the appellants who carried on business as fur and skin merchants and as agents were appointed sole commission agents of a company for the sale in Britain and elsewhere of furs exported from Russia on the terms inter alia that they should advance to the company a part of the value of each consignment The question arose whether this profit formed part of the trading receipts of the appellants so as to be assessable to tax <NAME> held that the exchange profit arose directly in the course of the appellants business with the company and formed part of the appellants trading receipts for the purpose of computing their profits assessable to income tax under Case I of Schedule The learned Judge pointed out that the profit which arises in the present case is a profit arising directly from the business which had to be done because the business was conducted on a dollar basis and the appellants had therefore to buy dollars in order to make the advances against the goods as prescribed by the agreements The profit accrued in this case because they had to do that thereafter as a trading concern in this country re transferring or re exchanging into sterling Since the dollars were purchased for the purpose of carrying on the business as sole commission agents and as an integral part of the activity of such business it was held that the profit arising on retransfer or re exchange of dollars into sterling was a trading profit falling within Case I of Schedule This decision was accepted as a correct decision by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> Ltd We may then refer to the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> Kelly In these circumstances they sell this surplus stock of dollars and it seems to me quite impossible to say that the dollars have lost the revenue characteristic which attached to them when they were originally bought and in some mysterious way have acquired a capital character In my opinion it does not make any difference that the contemplated purchasers were stopped by the operation of <ORG> or <ORG> orders if that were the case nor is the case affected by the fact that the purchase was under a <ORG> requisition and was not a voluntary one The last English decision to which we may refer in this connection is Davis <ORG> supra <ORG> held that it was a capital profit not subject to income tax and the argument which found favour with it may be stated in the words of <ORG> who delivered the main judgment I find nothing in the facts of this case to divest those deposits of the character which it seems to me they originally bore that is to say the character of loans by the agents to the company given no doubt to provide the company with a security but nevertheless loans As loans it seems to me they must prima facie be loans on capital not revenue account which perhaps is only another way of saying that they must prima facie be considered as part of the company fixed and not of its circulating capital As appears from what I have said above the evidence does not show that there was anything in the company mode of dealing with the deposits when received to displace this prima facie conclusion That takes us to the two decisions of this Court which have discussed the law on the subject and reiterated the same principles for determining when exchange profit or loss can be said to be trading profit or loss There the assessee which was a limited company carrying on business of locomotive boilers and locomotives had for the purpose of its manufacturing activity to make purchases of plant and machinery in the United States The result was that there was a balance of The consequence of this alteration in the rate of exchange was that the assessee found it more expensive to buy American goods and the Government of India also imposed some restrictions on imports from the United States and the assessee therefore with the permission of <ORG> repatriated to India depends on whether the act of keeping the money i for capital purposes after obtaining the sanction of <ORG> was part of or a trading transaction There is no doubt that the amount of was a revenue receipt in the assessee business of commission agency Instead of repatriating it immediately the assessee obtained the sanction of <ORG> to utilise the commission in its business manufacture of locomotive boilers and locomotives for buying capital goods In our view it was not a trading transaction in the business of manufacture of locomotive boilers and locomotives it was clearly a transaction of accumulating dollars to pay for capital goods the first step to the acquisition of capital goods If the assessee had repatriated and then after obtaining the sanction of <ORG> remitted to the A Mr <NAME> does not contest that any profit made on devaluation would have been a capital profit But in our opinion the fact that the assessee kept the money there does not make any difference specially as we have pointed out that it was a new transaction which the assessee entered into the transaction being the first step to acquisition of capital goods This Court held that the act of retaining in the United States for capital purposes after obtaining the sanction of <ORG> was not a trading transaction in the business of manufacture of locomotive boilers and locomotives but it was clearly a transaction of accumulating dollars to pay for capital goods the first step in the acquisition of capital goods and the surplus attributable to was therefore capital accretion and not profit taxable in the hands of the assessee It would thus be seen that the test applied by this Court was whether the appreciation in value had taken place in a capital asset or in a trading asset or in other words in fixed capital or in circulating capital and since the amount of though initially a trading receipt was set apart for purchase of capital goods and was thus converted into a capital asset or fixed capital it was held that appreciation in its value on conversion from dollar currency to rupee currency was a capital profit and not a trading profit The assessee in this case was a public limited company carrying on the business of banking in India and it had opened a branch in Karachi on th November was on the finding of fact reached by the <ORG> authorities held on capital account and not as part of the circulating capital em barked in the business of banking it was held by this Court that the profit arising to the assessee on remittance of this amount on account of alteration in the rate of exchange was not a trading profit but a capital accretion The law may therefore now be taken to be well settled that where profit or loss arises to an assessee on account of appreciation or depreciation in the value of foreign currency held by it on conversion into another currency such profit or loss would ordinarily be trading profit or loss if the foreign currency is held by the assessee on revenue account or as a trading asset or as part of circulating capital embarked in the business But if on the other hand the foreign currency is held as a capital asset or as fixed capital such profit or loss would be of capital nature If these two amounts were employed in the business in West Pakistan and formed part of the circulating capital of that business the loss of Rs On account of alteration in the rate of exchange would be a trading loss but if instead these two amounts were held on capital account and were part of fixed capital the loss would plainly be a capital loss The question whether the loss suffered by the assessee was a trading loss or a capital loss cannot therefore be answered unless it is first determined whether these two amounts were held by the assessee on capital account or on revenue account or on revenue account or to put it differently as part of fixed capital or of circulating capital We would have ordinarily in these circumstances called for a supplementary statement of case from the <ORG> giving its finding on this question but both the parties agreed before us that their attention was not directed to this aspect of the matter when the case was heard before the <ORG> Authorities and the <ORG> and hence it would be desirable that the matter should go back to the <ORG> with a direction to the <ORG> either to take additional evidence itself or to direct the Income Tax Officer to take additional evidence and make a report to it on the question whether the sums of Rs The <ORG> will on the basis of this additional evidence and in the light of the law laid down by us in this judgment determine whether the loss suffered by the assessee on remittance of the two sums of Rs We accordingly set aside the order of <ORG> and send the case back to the <ORG> with a direction to dispose it of in accordance with the directions given by us and in the light of the law laid down in this judgment
