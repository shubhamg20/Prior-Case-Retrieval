<NAME> Ltd is a private limited company having its registered office at Chawri Bazar Delhi When the respondents had thus to face several criminal proceedings they filed three writ petitions in <ORG> against the Union of India the State of Punjab and others hereinafter called the appellants By their Writ petition No of they prayed for a direction order or writ restraining the appellants from enforcing or giving effect to clause or the said notification as well as a writ or order quashing the criminal proceedings commenced against them The order passed on this writ petition has given rise to Criminal Appeal No of It appears that under some of the criminal proceedings filed against the respondents orders for search had been passed by the trial Magistrate on May The notification issued by the Controller on December was challenged by the respondents on the ground that it was issued under a clause which was invalid and was otherwise unreasonable and void Thus the main point which calls for our decision in this group of appeals is whether clause of the Order is valid or not Rule of the Rules authorised <ORG> inter alia so far as appears to it necessary or expedient for securing the defence of British India or the efficient prosecution of war or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community to provide by order for controlling the prices or rates at which articles or things of any description whatsoever may be sold or hired and for relaxing any maximum or minimum limits otherwise imposed on such prices or rates This Ordinance was issued to provide for the continuance during a limited period of powers to control the production supply and distribution of and trade and commerce in certain commodities which were treated as essential for national economy Under this clause <ORG> was authorised to direct by a notified order that the power to make orders under clause shall in relation to such matters and subject to such conditions if any as may be specified in the direction be exercisable by a such officer or authority subordinate to <ORG> or such <ORG> or such officer or authority subordinate to a <ORG> as may be specified in the direction The provisions of the Defence of India Act and the Rules framed thereunder came into force to meet the emergency created by the war but even after the war came to an end and hostilities ceased the emergency created by the war continued and the economic problems facing the country needed the assistance of similar emergency provisions This clause shows that in exercise of the powers conferred on the Controller by the proviso to it the Controller has to take into account the requirements of persons holding stocks the requirements of persons needing such stocks the transport facilities available and any other factor including a strike or lock out affecting the production or fabrication That takes us to clause the validity of which falls to be considered in the present appeals Power to fix prices The Controller may from time to time by notification in the Gazette of India fix the maximum prices at which any iron or steel may be sold a by a producer by Stockholder including a Controller Stockholder and by any other person or class of persons For the purpose of applying the prices notified under sub clause the Controller may himself classify any iron and steel and may if no appropriate price has been so notified fix such price as he considers appropriate Provided that the Controller may direct that the maximum prices fixed under sub clause or shall not apply to any specified stocks of iron or steel and may in respect of such stocks specify the maximum prices at which such iron or steel may be sold and communicate the same in writing to the persons concerned and any person or persons holding such stocks of iron and steel for which prices have been so specified shall at the time of the sale of such iron or steel or part thereof mention the number and date of the order of the Controller in every Cash Memo Bill or other document evidencing the sale or disposal out of the respective stocks to which the order of the Controller applies No producer or stockholder or other person shall sell or offer to sell and no person shall acquire any iron or steel at a price exceeding the maximum prices fixed under sub clauses or Clause gives power to <ORG> to give directions to the Controller or other authorities in respect of the procedure to be followed by them in exercising their powers and generally for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Order The appellants contention is that if clause is considered in the light of the scheme which the Order has in view it cannot be said that the said clause is violative of Arts What does the Order purport to do It purports to prescribe a scheme for the guidance of the Controller or other authorities specified in it when they exercise their powers and attempt to effectuate the policy of the Act Instead of passing a bare notified order authorising the Controller to take appropriate steps to effectuate the policy of the Act the Order purports to give him additional guidance by making several relevant provisions in regard to the production supply and sale of steel and iron First of all the Controller has to classify iron and steel into different categories according as they are tested or untested <ORG> has to be established by him for equalising freight and he has to take into account the concession which is payable to each producer or class of producers under existing valid agreements and any other disadvantages Having fixed maximum prices as prescribed by clause the provision confers power on the Controller to grant exemptions to specified stocks of iron and steel falling under the said proviso After thus prescribing the procedure for fixing the maximum prices and after indicating some of the factors which have to be considered in fixing the maximum prices sub clause of clause imposes a statutory prohibition against the specified persons from selling or offering to sell iron and steel at a price exceeding the maximum price fixed under sub clause In our opinion therefore if clause is considered as a part of the composite scheme evidenced by the whole of the Order and its validity is examined in the light of the provisions of ss and of the Act it would be difficult to sustain the plea that it confers on the delegate uncanalised or unbridled power We are inclined to hold that the power conferred on <ORG> by and on the authority specified by is canalised by the clear enunciation of the legislative policy in and that clause seeks further to canalise the exercise of the said power and so it is not a case where the validity of the clause can be successfully challenged on the ground of excessive delegation We have referred to this aspect of the matter at some length because it appears to have influenced the final conclusion in the judgment under appeal In support of this contention reliance is placed on the provisions of of the English Prices of Goods Act It appears that of the said Act prohibits sale of price regulated goods at more than permitted price and defines the expression basic price as the price at which in the ordinary course of business in the case of which those goods were to be sold agreed to be sold or offered for sale at the st day of August In deciding the nature and extent of the guidance which should be given to the delegate <ORG> must inevitably take into account the special features of the object which it intends to achieve by a particular statute Having regard to the nature of the problem which the <ORG> wanted to attack it may have come to the conclusion that it would be inexpedient to limit the discretion of the delegate in fixing the maximum prices by reference to any basic price It is of course true that though clause may not be unconstitutional on the ground of excessive delegation its validity can still be attacked on the ground that it violates Arts and inasmuch as the power conferred on the Controller by the said clause puts an unreasonable restriction on the respondents fundamental rights guaranteed under Art In support of this argument he has relied on the decisions of this <ORG> in We will presently refer to these decisions but before we do so we may mention the material facts on which the contention is raised The challenge to the validity of the criminal proceedings pending against the respondents can be made on three alternative grounds it can be urged that ss and of the Act are ultra vires and if that is so neither the Order subsequently issued nor clause nor the fixation of prices would be valid In so far as the argument proceeds on the assumption that the authority conferred on the Controller by clause is uncanalised or unbridled or unguided we have already held that the clause does not suffer from any such infirmity In their writ petition the respondents had challenged the validity of the notification issued by the Controller on December mainly if not wholly on the ground that it was issued under clause which itself was void It is alleged on their behalf that they had purchased the commodity from the controlled stockholders at the rate of Rs But apart from it the petitions do not show that the respondents seriously challenged the validity of the notification on this aspect of the matter The impugned clause it was however held had conferred on the licensing authority unrestricted power without framing any rules or issuing any directions to regulate or guide this discretion Besides the power could be exercised not only by the State Coal Controller but by any person to whom he may choose to delegate the same and it was observed that the choice can be made in favour of any and every person We have already indicated that the powers exercisable by the Controller under clause are in terms made subject to the general power of <ORG> to give directions prescribed by clause and which empower <ORG> to prescribe the terms and prices on which the commodity in question could be sold were upheld as valid Mr <NAME> contends that in upholding these two clauses this <ORG> has taken into account the formula prescribed by Schedule III and it appeared to the <ORG> that the application of the formula did not on the whole lead to any unreasonable result Such a contention finds no support in the decision in the case of Now it appears that the impugned clause empowered the <ORG> to requisition the stock at a price lower than the selling price thus causing loss to the persons whose stocks are freezed while at the same time the <ORG> was free to sell the same stocks at a higher price and make a profit The case of the respondent which illustrated this vicious tendency of the impugned clause was treated as a typical case which showed how business of grain dealers would be paralysed by the operation of the clause That takes us to the decision of this Court in the case of <NAME> on which the appellants strongly rely It cannot be said that there is no force in this contention The orders passed by <ORG> on the writ petitions filed by the respondents before it would therefore be set aside and the said petitions dismissed I have had the advantage of perusing the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> I agree with his conclusion The question raised in this case is whether clause of Iron and Steel Control of Production And Distribution Order violates the fundamental rights enshrined in Art I do not propose to express my view on any other question raised in this appeal
