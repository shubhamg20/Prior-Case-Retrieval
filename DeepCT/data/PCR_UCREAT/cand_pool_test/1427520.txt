The appellant an existing operator filed a revision against that order to <ORG> under A but <ORG> held that a revision did not lie The appellant then filed a writ petition in <ORG> and <ORG> dismissed it holding that at the stage of existing operators were not entitled to be heard by <ORG> and since the order of <ORG> was good on merits it was not necessary to decide whether a revision lay to <ORG> In appeal to this Court HELD Unlike does not say expressly that representations could be made by existing operators and others The expression in that <ORG> may having regard to the matters mentioned in sub only means that the Authority shall have regard to the matters mentioned in sub cls a to of and has nothing to do the right of making representations But whether or not an existing operator has an implied right to be heard before an order under is made he can be aggrieved by an order made under that section increasing or decreasing the number of stage carriages depending on the circumstances of the case and has therefore a right of revision under A the only condition for filing a revision being that it should be against an order made by <ORG> against which no appeal lies Since a revision could be filed under A against the order under the aggrieved operator need not approach <ORG> first to review its order Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment dated November of <ORG> of tile <ORG> dismissing the writ petition filed by tile appellant seeking to quash tile order of <ORG> <ORG> had by this order rejected the appellant revision petition against the decision of <ORG> oil the ground that a mere decision of <ORG> limiting the number of stage carriages under of the Motor Vehicles Act IV of hereinafter referred to as the Act could not form the subject matter of a revision application It was of the view that when <ORG> actually proceeds to fill Lip the vacancies which it has decided to create then the persons whose interests would be adversely affected would have a right of representation before <ORG> and in the case of their representation being rejected by <ORG> the will have a right of appeal before <ORG> Procedure of <ORG> in considering application for stage carriage permit <ORG> shall in considering an application for a stage carriage permit have regard to the following matters namely a the interests of the public generally the advantages to the public of the set vice to be provided including the saving of time likely to be effected thereby and any convenience arising from journeys not being broken the adequacy of other passenger transport services operating or likely to operate in the near future whether by road or other means between the places to be served the benefit to any particular locality or localities likely to be afforded by the service the operation by the applicant of other transport services including those in respect of which applications from him for permits are pending the condition of the roads included in the proposed route or area and shall also take into consideration any representations made by persons already providing passengers transport facilities by any means along or near the proposed route or area or by any association representing persons interested in the provision of road transport facilities recognised in this behalf by <ORG> or by any local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction any part of the proposed route or area lies Provided that other conditions being equal an application for a stage carriage permit from a co operative society registered or deemed to have been registered under any enactment in force for the time being shall as far as may be be given preference over applications from individual owners <ORG> shall refuse to grant a stage carriage permit if it appears from any time table furnished that the provisions of this Act relating to the speed at which vehicles may be driven are likely to be contravened provided that before such refusal an opportunity shall be given to the applicant to amend the time table so as to conform to the said provisions <ORG> may having regard to the matters mentioned in sub section limit the number of stage carriages generally or of any specified type for which stage carriage permits may be granted in the region or in any specified area or on any specified route within the region Revision <ORG> may either on its own motion or on an application made to it call for the record of any case in which an order has been made by <ORG> and in which no appeal lies and if it appears to <ORG> that the order made by <ORG> is improper or illegal <ORG> may pass such order in relation to the case as it deems fit Provided that <ORG> shall not entertain any application from a person aggrieved by an order of <ORG> unless the application is made within thirty days from the date of the order Provided further that <ORG> shall not pass an order under this section prejudicial to any person without giving him a reasonable opportunity of being heard It would be noticed that sub of does not expressly say whether any representations can be made by persons already providing transport facilities or by associations representing persons interested in the provision of the transport facilities or by any local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction the route or area lies a to are exhaustive but this point does not arise and we need not say anything as to this If we look at the section it would be noticed that A is very wide in terms the only condition necessary for filing a revision is that it should be against an order made by <ORG> and against which no appeal lies We are unable to say that no existing operator can be aggrieved by an order made under increasing or decreasing the number of stage carriages it would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case In a particular case it may be to his advantage and he then would not file a revision against it but if he files a revision when an order made under is prejudicial to his interests there is no ground for denying him the right to approach the revisional authority and seeking its order But assuming that it is so this does no affect the right of revision conferred by A But assuming that it can be revised by <ORG> till the order is in operation it is binding on everybody and if a revision can be filed against the order under A the aggrieved operator cannot be compelled to approach <ORG> first to revise its order This argument in a way concedes that an operator can be a person aggrieved by an order under
