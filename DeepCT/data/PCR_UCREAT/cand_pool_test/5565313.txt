The petitioner instituted Title Suit No of seeking a decree for declaration that he is a monthly tenant under the defendant no the opposite party herein in respect of the flat the suit property as well as permanent injunction restraining the defendant no from disturbing his peaceful possession and enjoyment of tenancy right in respect thereof The appeal was dismissed by judgment and decree dated January and the judgment and decree of the trial <ORG> stood affirmed Soon thereafter the opposite party instituted a suit against the petitioner being Title Suit No of for recovery of possession of the selfsame suit property that was the subject matter of the earlier suit by and between the parties on the ground that the petitioner is a trespasser as well as for damages By judgment and order dated January the appeal was dismissed and the judgment and decree of the trial <ORG> stood affirmed The petitioner after dismissal of Title Appeal No of had also filed a second appeal before this <ORG> registered as A No of However the said appeal is yet to be admitted under Order XLI Rule of the Code and therefore there is no question of stay On consideration of a separate petition filed by the opposite party the <ORG> granted liberty to the bailiff to break open the padlock of the suit property if necessary for the purpose of execution of the decree On the same day the petitioner filed a revisional application before this <ORG> being No of as Their Lordships then were laid down the law which runs thus A court executing a decree cannot go behind the decree between the parties or their representatives it must take the decree according to its tenor and cannot entertain any objection that the decree was incorrect in law or on facts Again when the decree is made by a court which has no inherent jurisdiction to make it objection as to its validity may be raised in an execution proceeding if the objection appears on the face of the record where the objection as to the jurisdiction of the court to pass the decree does not appear on the face of the record and requires examination of the questions raised and decided at the trial or which could have been but have not been raised the executing court will have no jurisdiction to entertain an objection as to the validity of the decree even on the ground of absence of jurisdiction To allow this point to be taken for the first time in the executing <ORG> could almost be a travesty of justice and would give a very long scope to judgment debtors who after failing at all levels during trial put up pleas of non executability which was very much available at the time of trial which would be totally against larger interest of the society because a litigation fought to the end at the trial stage would be set at naught by taking pleas available earlier and not taken either knowingly or even unknowingly There is no worthy reason to upset the order of the executing <ORG> At this stage a certificate is prayed for by Mr <NAME> for leave to file appeal before <ORG> Urgent photostat certified copy of the order if applied for be given to the parties at an early date
