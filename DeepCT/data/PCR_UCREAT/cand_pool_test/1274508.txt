HEADNOTE For the purpose of making it easier to secure permits in respect of non nationalised routes and to simplify the procedure for this purpose of the Motor Vehicles Act was amended by inserting A of the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act if <ORG> is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to grant permits to all eligible applicants it may by notification in the gazette issue a direction accordingly On appeal it was contended i that <ORG> issued the impugned notification without applying its mind as such a notification under A could have been is sued only in public interest ii that the deletion of would have the effect of removing the limit on the number of permits for intra region routes but that fact would not prevent the imposition of a limit for the number of permits for inter region routes and that the impugned notification is violative of the rights of the appellants under Art Dismissing the appeal HELD There is no infirmity in the impugned notification Sub section of A gives power to <ORG> to issue directions in respect of non nationalised routes and areas by means of notification in case the Government is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to grant permits to all eligible applicants Any measure which results in larger number of buses operating on various routes would necessarily eliminate or in any case minimise long hours of waiting at the bus stands A There is no valid basis for the inference that if there is no limit on the number of permits for intra region routes limit on the number of permits for inter region routes would have to be imposed There is no valid basis for holding that the impugned provisions were violative of Art There is nothing in the notification which prevents the appellants from acquiring holding and disposing of their property or prevents them from practising any profession or from carrying on any occupation The fact that some others have also been enabled to obtain permit for running buses cannot constitute a violation of the appellants right founder the above two clauses of Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The short question which arises in this appeal filed on certificate against the judgment of <ORG> is the validity of section A inserted in the Motor Vehicles Act by Act No of and the notification dated March issued under that section The material part of section of the Motor Vehicles Act Act No of as it stood before the amendment made by section A in Uttar Pradesh read as under <ORG> shall in considering an application for a stage carriage permit have regard to the following matters namely a the interest of the public generally the advantages to the public of the service to be provided including the saving of time likely to be effected thereby and any convenience arising from journeys not being broken the adequacy of other passenger transport services operating or likely to operate in the near future whether by road or other means between the places to be served the benefit to any particular locality or localities likely to be afforded by the service the operation by the applicant of other transport services including those in respect of which applications from him for permits are pending the condition of the roads included in the proposed route or area and shall also take into consideration any representations made by persons already providing passenger transport faci lities by any means along or near the proposed route or area or by any association representing persons interested in the provision of road transport facilities recognised in this behalf by <ORG> or by any local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction any part of the proposed route or area lies <ORG> may having regard to the matters mentioned in sub section limit the number Of stage carriages genarally or of any specified type for which stage carriage permits may be granted in the region or in any specified The material part of section A reads as under The <ORG> Government may issue such directions of a general character as it may consider necessary or expedient in the public interest in respect of any matter relating to road transport to the <ORG> <ORG> or to any Regional <ORG> and such <ORG> shall give effect to all such directions Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power where the State Government is of opinion that it is in the public interest to grant stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas for which schemes have been published under section or contract carriage permi ts or public carrier permits to all eligible applicants it may by notification in the <ORG> issue a direction accordingly and thereupon all transport authorities as well as <ORG> constituted under section shall proceed to consider and decide all applications appeals and revisions in that behalf including any pending applications appeals and revisions as if a in section i for sub section the following sub section were substituted i <ORG> Transport Authority shall in considering an application for a stage car riage permit have regard to the following matters namely a the interest of the public generally the advantage to the public of the service to be provided including the saving of time likely to be effected thereby and any convenience arising from journeys not being broken the benefit to any particular locality or localities likely to be afforded by the service and shall also take into consideration any representation made by any local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction any part of the proposed route or area lies ii sub section were omitted The impugned notification dated March roads as under WHEREAS the state government is of opinion that it is in the public interest to grant stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas for which schemes have been published under section of the Motor Vehicles Act contract carriage permits and public carrier permits to all eligible applicants Now therefore in exercise of the power conferred by section A of the Motor Vehicles Act the Governor is pleased to direct that stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas aforesaid contract carriage permits and public carries permits shall be granted according to the provision of the said Act to all eligible applicants The following Statement of Objects and Reasons was given when introducing the Bill which after being passed by the legislature took the shape of the amending Act Operators engage in a race for securing permits for stage carriages on non nationalised routes Due to limitation on the number of permits this business is controlled by a few persons Therefore with a view to making it easier to secure permits in respect of non nationalised routes and to introducing simplicity in procedure and to providing greater employment and securing equitable distribution thereof it was con sidered necessary to amend sections and of the Motor Vehicles Act suitably It has accordingly been pro vided that in the case of non nationalised routes if <ORG> is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to grant permits to all eligible applicants it may by notification in the <ORG> issue a direction accordingly The result would be that it would be permissible to issue any number of such permits having regard to the interest of the public generally the advantage to the public of the service to be provided including the saving of time likely to be effected thereby and any convenience arising from journeys not being broken as also the benefit to any particular locality or localities likely to be afforded by the service <ORG> has also to take into consideration any representations made by a local authority or police authority within whose Sub section of section A clothes <ORG> with power to issue directions of a general character as it may consider necessary or expedient in the public interest in respect of any matter relating to road transport <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred apparently by sub section of section A has issued the impugned notification dated March in respect of routes or areas for which schemes have not been published under section of the Motor Vehicles Act According to the notification contract carriage permits and public carrier permits shall except in respect of routes or areas mentioned above be granted according to the provisions of the said Act to all eligible applicants It has been argued on behalf of the appellants that <ORG> issued the impugned notification without applying its mind as such a notification under sub section of section A could have been issued only in public interest Sub section of section A gives power to <ORG> to issue direction in respect of non nationalised routes and areas by means of notification in case that Government is of the opinion that it is in the public interest to grant permits to all eligible applicants It hardly need much argument to show that the larger number of buses operating on different routes would be for the convenience and benefit of the travelling public and as such would be in the public interest Any measure which results in larger number of buses operating on various routes would necessarily eliminate or in any case minimise long hours of waiting at the bus stands We arc not impressed by this argument for we find no valid basis for the inference that if there is no limit on the number of permits for intra region routes limit on the number of permits for inter region routes would have to be imposed There is nothing in the notification which prevents the appellants from acquiring holding and disposing of their property or prevents them from practising any profession or from carrying on any occupation The fact that some others have also beer enabled to obtain permits for running buses cannot constitute a violation of the appellants rights under the above two clauses of article of the Constitution The above provisions are not intended to grant a kind of monopoly to a few bus operators to the exclusion of other eligible persons No right is guaranteed to any private party by article of the Constitution of carrying on trade and business without competition from other eligible persons Clause of article gives a right to all citizens subject to article to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business It is an enabling provision and does not confer a right on those already practising a profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business to exclude and debar fresh eligible entrants from practising that profession or from carrying on that occupation trade or business
