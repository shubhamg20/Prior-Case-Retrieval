The Income Tax Officer rejected the aforesaid contention of the assessee observing that at no time had the assessee claimed any deduction on account of deterioration or damage to goods and that there was no justification to recognise a practice as claimed by the assessee of valuing its stock otherwise that in accordance with the well recognised prin ciple of accounting which require the stock to be valued at either cost raw material plus expenditure or market value whichever was lower Recalculating the value of the opening and closing stocks by adding the overhead expenditure the Income tax Officer made an addition of Rs for the assessment year and allowed a deduction of Rs for the assessment year On appeal <ORG> held that there was no evidence to show that the goods in stock dete riorated in value and that there was no justification for excluding the overhead expenditure in valuing the stock and if it was in the interest of the business to value stock solely with reference to cost of raw materials and without including the overhead expenditure such valuation was not appro <NAME> priate to the computation of income chargeable under the Income Tax Act <ORG> in a reference at the instance of the <ORG> noticed that though there was no evidence of dete rioration of the goods in stock came to the conclusion that having regard to the consistent practice of the assessee the <ORG> was not justified in rejecting the assessee method of valuation of its stock in trade In the appeals by the <ORG> to this Court it was contended on behalf of the assessee that for a number of years the <ORG> did not question the method of accounting regularly employed by the assessee that it was during the assessment years in question that the objection was raised for the first time on the ground that overhead expenditure was not included in the value of the stock that the Assess ing Officer had exceeded his jurisdiction by adding the overhead expenditure to the cost of raw material especially because of the short durability of paint and that the As sessing Officer has not appreciated that the method adopted by the assessee is a well recognised method among account ants of repute Section of the Income Tax Act confers sufficient power upon the officer nay it imposes a duty upon him to make such computation in such manner as he determines for deducing the correct profits and gains This means that where accounts are prepared without disclosing the real cost of the stock in trade albeit on sound expert advise in the interest of efficient administration of the company it is the duty of the Income Tax Officer to determine the taxable income by making such computation as he thinks fit Any system of accounting which excludes for the valuation of the stock in trade all costs other than the cost of raw material for the goods in process and finished products is likely to result in a distorted picture of the true state of the business for the purpose of computing the chargeable income The question to be determined by the Assessing Offi cer in exercise of his power under section is whether or not income can properly be deduced from the accounts main tained by the assessee even if the accounts are correct and complete to the satisfaction of the Officer and the income has been computed in accordance with the method regularly employed by the assessee There is no estoppel in these matters and the Officer is not bound by the method followed in the earlier years
