The petitioner filed his returns before the Sales tax Officer and claimed exemption of sales tax under the said notification The petitioner pleaded that lie was entitled to exemption because he belonged to the class of manufacturers to which the notification referred After this judgement was pronounced the impugned Act was passed by the legislature on August and was published on September containing one operative provision in It provided that notwithstanding anything contained in any judgement decree or order of any court the word manufacturer occuring against item in the schedule to the notification of the <ORG> dated July as amended by another notification of the st July shall mean and shall always be deemed to have meant a person who by his own labour works up materials into suitable forms and a person who owns or runs a manufactory for the purpose of business with respect to the articles manufactured therein and iii that the retrospective operation of the impugned section should be struck down as unconstitutional because it imposes an unreasonable restriction on the petitioner fundamental right under Art And if the State <ORG> was given the power either to grant or withdraw the exemption that could not possibly affect the legislature competence to make any provision in that behalf either prospectively or retrospectively ii It would be difficult to accept the argument that because the retrospective operation may operate harshly in some cases therefore the legislation itself is invalid The facts on which the petitioners rely are similar and so we shall mention the facts in the first group consisting of writ petitions Nos of He is a merchant who carries on business in bullion and specie and gold and silver ornaments at Berhampur and as such merchant he has been registered as dealer under the Orissa Sales Tax Act Act No of After the said Act came into force <ORG> purporting to exercise its authority under of the said Sales Tax Act issued a notification exempting certain articles from the operation of the charging section of that Act This notification was issued on July Durinh the course of his business the petitioner manufactures gold ornaments by supplying the gold to the artisans and getting ornaments prepared by them under his supervision and when the ornaments are so prepared he sells them in his shop and has been showing the value of gold and the cost of manufacture separately Consistently with this plea the petitioner filed his returns before the Sales tax Officer at Berhampur and had been claiming exemption of Sales tax on the sales as being entitled to exemption under the said notification The petitioner resisted this attempt to re open the assessment and he pleaded that he was entitled to claim exemption under the notification because he belonged to the class of manufacturers to which the notification referred The main controversy before <ORG> was about the precise denotation of the word manufacturer used in the notification Against this judgement the State of Orissa has filed appeals to this Court and they are numbered as Civil Appeals Nos to of This Act received the assent of the Governor on September and was published on September It contains one operative provision in Section provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment decree or order of any court the word manufactu rer occurring against item in the schedule to the notification of <ORG> dated July as amended by another notification of the st July shall mean and shall always be deemed to have meant a person who by his own labour works up materials into suitable forms and a person who owns or runs a manufactory for the purpose of business with respect to the articles manufactured therein Section of the parent Sales tax Act is the charging section and is the section which confers on <ORG> power to issue a notification exempting from the tax the sale of any goods or class of goods and likewise withdraw any such exemption subject to such conditions and exceptions as it may deem fit The argument is the power to grant exemption having been conferred on <ORG> it was validly exercised by <ORG> and though the legislature may withdraw such exemption it cannot do so retrospectively Section in substance declares that the intention of the delegate in issuing the notification granting exemption was to confine the benefit of the said exemption only to persons who actually produce old ornaments or employ artisans for that purpose And if <ORG> was given the power either to grant or withdraw the exemption that cannot possibly affect the legislature competency to make any provision in that behalf either prospectively or retrospectively Therefore there is no substance in the argument that the retrospective operation of of the impugned Act is invalid They give gold to the artisans paying the artisans their labour charges and when the ornaments are thus produced they charge commission before they are sold to the customers The counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent State has also averred that the petitioners sometimes sell goods manufactured by firms outside the State of Orissa and in no case had they manufactured ornaments themselves Besides one of the objects of the impugned Act appears to be to make it clear that the legislature intends to benefit the goldsmiths who actually make gold ornaments and that object can be carried out only if exemption is granted to persons who keep in their continuous employment artisans who produce gold ornaments It was also suggested by Mr <NAME> that the result of the impugned provision is to deny the benefit of the exemption to the poorer classes of persons who are engaged in the business of manufacturing gold ornaments and in that con nection he has commented on the fact that the notification gives the benefit of the exemption to persons who run manu factories but it denies that benefit to persons who carry on the work of producing gold ornaments on a smaller scale and so are unable to run a manufactory Mr <NAME> also argued that the retrospective operation of the impugned section should be struck down as unconsti tutional because it imposes an unreasonable restriction on the petitioners fundamental right under Art But it would be difficult to accept the argument that because the retrospective operation may operate harshly in some cases therefore the legislation itself is invalid Incidentally it is not clear from the record that the petitioners did not recover sales tax from their customers when they sold the gold ornaments to them
