On December as the settlement of a dispute that was then outstanding between herself and the respondent the appellant entered into an agreement through her husband as her attorney with the respondent for the sale to him of two sets of oil wells None of these sites were conveyed to the respondent and accordingly he instituted in against the appellant the proceedings which have given rise to this appeal He sets out the contract of December he refers to the fact that the sites allotted in had been duly transferred and alleges that ten out of the twelve sites had been received in and he concludes in this way Out of these that is out of the ten for the plaintiff asked the defendant to deliver three sites which still remained due to the plaintiff but she refused to do so Section of that Code enacts that The <ORG> may at any time and on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may think fit amend any defect or error in any proceeding in a suit and all necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real question or issue raised by or depending on such poceeding and by Order VI Rule The <ORG> may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy between the parties It has been urged on behalf of the respondent that that contract could not proceed to operate until twelve sites had in fact been allocated There is nothing to show that the allocation of the total of the twelve sites is a condition precedent to the grant of the three If that be right it follows that she could have satisfied the contract in and it was shortly afterwards in that the plaintiff himself alleged that the refusal had taken place The defendant was herself called by the plaintiff as a witness though for reasons of which there is no explanation the plaintiff does not appear to have entered the witness box and on being called she says that the plaintiff came and asked me for the three remaining well sites in or but I refused to give them to him It is quite true that there is other evidence to suggest that what took place on that occasion was more in the nature of an evasion than of a direct refusal but if the plaintiff is going to assert that in fact the reason for the omission to satisfy the contract was not due to a refusal on the defendant part he certainly was bound to have gone into the box to have answered a statement so specific and so direct by the other party to the contract called as his own witness Their Lordships think that there was at that date a refusal and that consequently in any circumstances the Indian Limitation Act would have prevented this suit from being instituted on February The rights of equity which prevail in British Burma are rights which are given to people who are vigilant and not to those who sleep and unless there can be clearly established some reason which threw upon the defendant the entire blame for the delay that had occurred or unless indeed it can be shown that the real right of action had only accrued a short time before the proceedings were instituted such a lapse of time would be fatal to any action for specific performance of a contract As their Lordships have already expressed their view that the Indian Limitation Act defeats the suit it is therefore unnecessary to add anything further on the cross appeal Their Lordships will accordingly humbly advise His Majesty that the appeal should be allowed and that the cross appeal should be dismissed with costs to the defendant here and in the Courts below
