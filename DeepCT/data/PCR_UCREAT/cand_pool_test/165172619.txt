According to <NAME> brother <NAME> PW at about <NAME> and <NAME> came to his house and enquired about <NAME> On receiving this information <NAME> enquired from <NAME> and <NAME> the whereabouts of <NAME> but they informed him that they had seen him across the river with some boys Similarly <NAME> did not say anything about <NAME> going to the river although she saw him at about or on th May As such it was not possible to lend credence to the testimony of the prosecution witnesses and the accused were entitled to the benefit of doubt The appeal was allowed by a judgment and order dated th March <ORG> came to this conclusion on the basis of the doctor statement that the death took place between and hours before he conducted the post mortem examination In the absence of any explanation offered by them the last seen theory would apply and it must be held that <NAME> and <NAME> had murdered <NAME> The primary submission made on their behalf was to the effect that <ORG> ought not to have interfered in the acquittal by <ORG> particularly in a case of circumstantial evidence In <NAME> supra it has been stated that <ORG> can exercise the power or jurisdiction to reverse an order of acquittal in cases where it finds that the lower court has obstinately blundered or has through incompetence stupidity or perversity reached such distorted conclusions as to produce a positive miscarriage of justice or has in some other way so conducted or misconducted himself as to produce a glaring miscarriage of justice or has been tricked by the defence so as to produce a similar result Therefore we referred to the passage in <NAME> and find that what was stated was as follows There is in their opinion no foundation for the view apparently supported by the judgments of some Courts in India that <ORG> has no power or jurisdiction to reverse an order of acquittal on a matter of fact except in cases in which <ORG> has obstinately blundered or has through incompetence stupidity or perversity reached such distorted conclusions as to produce a positive miscarriage of justice or has in some other way so conducted itself as to produce a glaring miscarriage of justice or has been tricked by the defence so as to produce a similar result It was held in Chandrappa as follows An appellate court has full power to review reappreciate and reconsider the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded The Code of Criminal Procedure puts no limitation restriction or condition on exercise of such power and an appellate court on the evidence before it may reach its own conclusion both on questions of fact and of law Such phraseologies are more in the nature of flourishes of language to emphasise the reluctance of an appellate court to interfere with acquittal than to curtail the power of the court to review the evidence and to come to its own conclusion An appellate court however must bear in mind that in case of acquittal there is double presumption in favour of the accused The reformulation of the principles in Ganpat is as follows i There is no limitation on the part of the appellate court to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded and to come to its own conclusion iv An order of acquittal is to be interfered with only when there are compelling and substantial reasons for doing so <ORG> is not expected to merely substitute its opinion for that of <ORG> only because the first two principles in <NAME> and <NAME> permit it to do so and because it has the power to do so it has to correct an error of law or fact significant enough to necessitate overturning the verdict of <ORG> Looked at from this perspective it was submitted by learned counsel for the <ORG> that there cannot be two reasonable views of the events that took place It was submitted that there was no doubt that <NAME> crossed the river Ganges with Shyamal and Prosanta and they went to a secluded and uninhabited place across the river There was also no mention of the attendance of <NAME> or the dress worn by <NAME> In other words they did not mention any of the events said to have taken place in their presence on the evening of th May <NAME> PW wife of the boat owner <NAME> also turned hostile and stated that their boat was as usual tied to the ghat and she could not say whether it was taken by any person on that date However what is even more important is that <NAME> stated in Court that on the morning of th May he had told his father <NAME> and <NAME> that he had seen the abovementioned five persons cross the river in a boat the previous evening It is clear that there is considerable padding in the testimony of the three crucial witnesses namely <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and there are unexplained additions made by them However <ORG> did not take into consideration the view of <ORG> based on the evidence on record that it was doubtful if the five persons mentioned above boarded the boat belonging to <NAME> to cross the river as alleged by the prosecution Following the principles laid down in several decisions of this Court beginning with <NAME> <ORG> of Maharashtra it is clear that the chain of events must be so complete as to leave no room for any other hypothesis except that the accused were responsible for the death of the victim Under the circumstances we are unable to agree with learned counsel for the <ORG> and are of the opinion that there was really no occasion for <ORG> to have overturned the view of <ORG> which was not only a reasonable view but a probable view of the events The significance of this is only with respect to the time of death and has no reference to the persons who may have caused the death of <NAME> Consequently there was no occasion for <ORG> to set aside the acquittal of <NAME> and <NAME>
