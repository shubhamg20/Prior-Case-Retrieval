By the impugned judgments the Writ Petitions filed by the land owners challenging the notification under Sections and of the Land Acquisition Act hereinafter called the Act for short relating to Yamuna Expressway <ORG> were dismissed by <ORG> A notification dated was issued by <ORG> under Section read with Sections and of the Act In fact in the year itself <ORG> had taken a decision for the construction of Yamuna Expressway which sometimes earlier was named as Taj Expressway which was to proceed from Greater Noida to Agra Legal notices were served by those who were affected but ultimately the <ORG> came out with a notification dated under Section read with Sections and of the Act It is mainly the complaint of the appellants that they had purchased the land long time back and their names were duly mutated in the <ORG> records and they had thereafter raised constructions over the land in question and in those constructions they were running their business like shops cold storage etc It was pointed out that the compensation was payable by the private party under the scheme and therefore also this could not be viewed as a public purpose It recorded a finding that there was no mala fide on the part of anybody The Commission had also come to the conclusion that the Agreement with the <ORG> was arrived at after proper scrutiny on the part of the Government Officers and there was no mala fide on the alleged connection of one <NAME> or his father with the <ORG> While considering the amendment made by the petitioner to the Writ Petition by which fresh challenges were thrown against the Agreement dated <ORG> came to the conclusion that there was no procedural infirmity in the contract having been awarded to the <ORG> It also recorded that there was proper publication of the Notice Inviting Tender NIT in various national Dailies and that parties had responded to the NITs <ORG> therefore recorded a finding that there was nothing shady and the entire process was transparent it cannot be said that this acquisition would come under Part II of the Land Acquisition Act and in fact it must be considered to be under Part VII of the Act since it virtually amounts to acquisition of land for <ORG> a company respondent No The learned Counsel have specifically averred that the whole process was extremely transparent and that there was necessity of this land considering the public purpose involved and that all care was taken to safeguard the interests of the farmers and that the creation of this Expressway and creation of five townships would immensely help the general public residing on the Eastern Bank of Yamuna particularly and the residents of UP generally Section thereof provides for constituting an authority by a notification Under Section of the said Act the authority is empowered to allot its properties by way of lease or otherwise on such terms and conditions as it may deem fit This Project however did not proceed as there was no eligible bidder and ultimately the selection process was dropped Writ Petition No of came to be filed by one <NAME> challenging the Notification dated issued under Section of the Act as also the Notification dated issued under Section of the Act Ultimately the Writ Petition of <NAME> was dismissed by a judgment dated and that of others including <NAME> came to be dismissed on It is on this historical backdrop that we have now to consider the correctness or otherwise of these two judgments which pertain to more or the less same subject but with slight variation By the judgment dated <ORG> dismissed the Writ Petition holding that a the entire process of acquisition was in accordance with the provisions of the Act and this was not a colourable exercise of powers the land in instant case was indeed acquired for public purpose namely construction of Yamuna Expressway Project the land was not acquired for company and as such the procedure under Chapter VII was not applicable It was also urged in that case that the entire cost of the acquisition was to be borne by the <ORG> and the <ORG> had to pay the entire dues towards acquisition cost and therefore there was no public purpose in this acquisition and the so called public purpose appearing in the Notification was a camouflage More or the less same contentions with some difference were raised in <NAME> case also the judgment which also disposed of the Civil Misc <NAME> learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants vehemently urged that this acquisition in the first place is colourable exercise of power It was further urged that the so called Concession Agreement dated was one sided inasmuch as even if it was terminated the land which was given to the <ORG> for development would have remained unaffected It was further urged that considering the length of the lease period of years the land was virtually given to the <ORG> for ever and it was nothing but transferring the same in favour of the <ORG> The first and foremost thing which we must keep in mind while deciding these matters is that at least in the present two matters <NAME> case decided on and <NAME> case decided on the subject related only to the acquisition of few hectares of land as compared to the acquisition of large chunk which has not been challenged It has been strongly argued on behalf of the <ORG> the <ORG> and <ORG> that the major activity of land acquisition process is over Of course that by itself may not be the only reason to hold against the appellants petitioners however that fact will have to be kept in mind while deciding the issues which cover the whole acquisition process which acquisition is for the purpose of development of million square meters of land It came in existence only later on We also cannot ignore the fact that a full fledged enquiry was got done by the State by constituting <ORG> under the Chairmanship of Mr Justice <NAME> We have already made reference to that judgment Nobody has so far argued that any specific partial treatment was offered to the <ORG> nor has it been pointed out at any stage that there was anything amiss with the tendering process or that the tender of contract to the <ORG> herein was a foregone conclusion It was also pointed out that the offers were invited on the basis of a global tender and as many as parties entered the fray and that it is only thereafter that the present respondent <ORG> was chosen for the award of the tender It was pointed out that the lease is going to be for years after which the whole land is going to revert back to the <ORG> <ORG> so also the whole land acquired and used actually for the purpose of the highway would also go back to the <ORG> after the period of years during which the <ORG> would have the right to levy and collect the toll Here of course there is no question of any agreement with the <ORG> as the three eventualities described under Section of the Act are not available for the simple reason that the basic idea for the acquisition under Part VII of the Act is the total transfer of the ownership of the acquiring land in favour of the <ORG> We are not much impressed by this argument in view of the fact that there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that this is an acquisition for the <ORG> basically on account of the fact that the acquired land is not to vest with the <ORG> We therefore do not accept the argument that this was either a colourable exercise of power or was meant for the <ORG> During the debate our attention was invited to Section of the Act which contains a definition for public purpose Creation of a corridor for fast moving traffic resulting into curtailing the traveling time as also the transport of the goods would be some factors which speak in favour of the Project being for the public purpose We must at this stage take into account the argument that the whole compensation is coming wholly from the <ORG> and not from the <ORG> or from <ORG> Even if we accept for the sake of argument that all this compensation is coming from the <ORG> we must firstly bear it in mind that the <ORG> gets no proprietary or ownership rights over the Project assets Secondly it must be borne in mind that the Concession Agreement has been executed in February whereas the acquisition process started somewhere in the month of September This argument proceeds on the basis of Clause of the Concession Agreement When it goes into the coffers of <ORG> it is the <ORG> who would make the payments of the estimated compensation and thereby it would be as if the compensation is paid not by the <ORG> but by <ORG> The respondents have relied on the law laid down in <NAME> Case cited supra more particularly paragraphs and therein Further it was argued that the five parcels of land which is being acquired for the development of five industrial townships could not be said for the public purpose nor could it be said to be a part of the present integrated scheme cited supra same question cropped up which has been mentioned in Paragraphs and of the judgment suggesting that there was no public purpose and in fact it was an acquisition for a private Company under Part VII of the Act and therefore the power of eminent domain would have no application to such case It will not be necessary for us to repeat all the case law and the questions raised and considered in these paragraphs such as industrial policy of the State acquisition for Company etc In fact while considering the contention regarding the industrial policy of the State the <ORG> has taken into consideration the oft quoted case of <ORG> Vs State of Uttaranchal Ors SCC where this <ORG> has come to the conclusion that in the absence of illegality or violation of law a <ORG> of law will not interfere in the policy matters In this judgment again the <ORG> has extensively considered the question as to whether and under what circumstances the acquisition could be said to be the acquisition for the Company We have already considered this question that in the present case there is nothing to indicate that the acquisition is for the <ORG> i for <ORG> It is only therefore that we are at pains to point out that the Government was only using the <ORG> for implementing its policy <ORG> in that case held that the acquisition was for a public purpose and there was no need to comply with the provisions of Part VII of the Act Ultimately this Court came to the conclusion that the acquisition made by the <ORG> of Andhra Pradesh could not be faulted as it was in pursuance of policy decision for development of the city of Hyderabad and in pursuance of that policy an integrated <ORG> was taken up for development of the city of Hyderabad into a business cum leisure tourism infrastructure centre The Court also came to the conclusion that <ORG> <ORG> in the reported decision was a nodal agency like <ORG> in the present case which was to generate the revenue and help the development of infrastructure for industrialization of the area We have no doubt that in the present case also the Expressway as well as the five parcels which are to be developed are part of an integrated and indivisible <ORG> The Court has also found that where the power of eminent domain is exercised mala fide or for collateral purposes and de hors the Act or in an irrational or unreasonable manner or when the purpose is no public purpose and the fraud on statute is apparent <ORG> can undoubtedly interfere There is no occasion for declaring the transfer of land to be null and void AIR SC more particularly the observations in paragraph therein where <ORG> of this Court observed that if the purpose of acquisition is not related to a public purpose then a question may well arise whether in making the declaration there has been on the part of the <ORG> a fraud on the power conferred on it by the Act It was urged that there was a conflict in this decision and the decision in <NAME> Case cited supra This was a case where the petitioners who were the owner of the agricultural lands had challenged the acquisition of lands for <ORG> It was claimed that the land was being acquired for public purpose i setting up <ORG> of <ORG> at various villages In that view the Court further came to the conclusion that the <ORG> not having followed the provisions of Sections and of the Act the whole process had suffered illegality The Court also considered the decision in <NAME> Case cited supra and distinguished the same by making a comment to the following effect But we must hasten to add that the Bench did not have any occasion to consider the question as to whether the State is entitled to take recourse to the provisions of both Part II and Part VII of the Act simultaneously Ultimately the Court came to the conclusion that the necessary provisions not having been found the view of <ORG> was not correct whereby it had upheld the land acquisition holding it to be for the public purpose We have closely seen the judgment however the factual situation in the judgment is quite different We also do not think that there is any serious conflict between the decision in <NAME> Case cited supra and the decision in Devinder Singh <NAME> We find from the order of <ORG> that <ORG> has considered the question of public purpose keeping in mind the correct principles of law We are therefore of the opinion that the contention raised by the learned Counsel for the appellants that this acquisition was not for the public purpose for various reasons which we have discussed is not correct This takes us to the next point pertaining to the application of Sections and of the Act The learned Counsel for the appellants have vociferously urged that there was no necessity whatsoever to apply the urgency clause to these acquisitions and further to avoid the enquiry under Section A of the Act It was pointed out that this Project was slumbering since and it was in order to infuse fictitious urgency that a reference to the Commonwealth Games was made The respondents on the other hand argued that there was material available before the Government justifying the invocation of the urgency clause The respondents argued that in fact <ORG> has returned the finding that there was material before <ORG> for dispensing with the enquiry under Section A of the Act and that finding was based on the examination by <ORG> of the records of <ORG> It was pointed out that going through the ordinary procedure for acquisition of land would have taken years for disposal of the objections while land was urgently required for public purpose in this case the construction of interchange under <ORG> which was absolutely essential for the purposes of running the highway Writ Petition No of <ORG> took stock of the allegations regarding malafides and dispensing with the enquiry under Section A of the Act by referring to Paragraph Nos and of the Reply filed on behalf of <ORG> through an affidavit of one <NAME> <ORG> Agra wherein it was pointed out that the Project was on the mammoth scale and there was a great deal of possibility of encroachments if the Project was allowed to linger <ORG> then took stock of the plea raised on behalf of the respondents on the basis of more than judgments of this Court The Court then referred to the delay on account of the litigations from till and referred to the contention raised on behalf of the appellants relying on the judgment in <ORG> Anr It then recorded a finding in the following words In order to verify whether there was any material with <ORG> to form an opinion and to exercise its powers under Section and Section of the Act dispensing with enquiry under Section A of the Act and that <ORG> had applied its mind on such material we summoned the records of the three concerned notifications <NAME> Addl Advocate General assisted by <NAME> Addl Chief Standing Counsel has produced the records alongwith the material collected by the Collectors District Magistrate and placed before <ORG> for forming an opinion He has taken us through the various documents and forms on which the Collectors have recommended on Forms alongwith justification of their recommendations as well as its summary given in the office note placed before <ORG> <ORG> has been given the regulating powers The village Kuberpur is in the notified area of <ORG> and which urgently requires the proposed land for construction of interchange for <ORG> In case of any delay there is a strong possibility of encroachment on the land which will affect the Project of <ORG> in public interest of land for I A for construction of Yamuna Expressway with the recommendation of the District Magistrate and justification for invoking urgency clause was placed before <ORG> and was recommended and signed by the Under Secretary and Special Secretary <ORG> on Secretary <ORG> <ORG> on Principal Secretary Industrial Development on and by the Secretary to the Chief Minister on the same day on The proposals were accepted by <ORG> for acquisition and for invoking urgency clause for construction of Yamuna Expressway by I A Ultimately <ORG> wrote a finding in the following words The record produced before us by <ORG> enclosing the material of invoking urgency clause and the satisfaction of <ORG> on the said material has satisfied us that <ORG> had sufficient material and had applied its mind to record its opinion that there was urgency to acquire the land to dispense with the enquiry under Section A of the Act We have deliberately quoted the above part of the <ORG> judgment only to show the meticulous care taken by the <ORG> in examining as to whether there was material before <ORG> to dispense with the enquiry under Section A of the Act We are completely convinced that there was necessity in this <ORG> considering the various reasons like enormousness of the <ORG> likelihood of the encroachments number of appellants who would have required to be heard and the time taken for that purpose and the fact that the <ORG> had lingered already from till We do not see any reason why we should take a different view than what is taken by the <ORG> In that decision also we had reiterated that the satisfaction required on the part of <ORG> in dispensing with the enquiry under Section A is a matter subject to satisfaction and can be assailed only on the ground that there was no sufficient material to dispense with the enquiry or that the order suffered from malice It was also found on facts in <ORG> cited supra that there was no charge of malafide levelled against the exercise of power and there was material available in support of the satisfaction on the part of the <ORG> justifying the invocation of the provisions of Section <ORG> in the present matter went a step ahead and examined the bulky original record itself to find that there was full material available cited supra there was unexplained delay after issuance of Section notification which is not the case here Every case has to be decided on its own facts In view of the law laid down in the last judgment on this issue i <ORG> etc cited supra we are of the clear opinion that the challenge by the appellants on the ground that there was no urgency and therefore the enquiry under Section A of the Act should not have been dispensed with cannot be accepted There is no merit in the appeals
