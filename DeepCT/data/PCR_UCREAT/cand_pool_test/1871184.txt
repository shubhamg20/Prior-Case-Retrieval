The Deputy Collector held that Section A of the Civil Procedure Code did not apply to sales under Act of and there was no other law under which he could set aside the sale The findings have been sent and at the further hearing of the rule a preliminary objection has been taken that we have no jurisdiction to interfere with the orders of the Deputy Collector and Collector passed under Act of and reliance is placed on the case of <NAME> <NAME> Act In this case <NAME> and <NAME> held that the power of control and superintendence given by Section of the Charter Act was in reference to the General Appellate Jurisdiction of the <ORG> and not to particular cases in which that jurisdiction is extraordinarily exercised or to a superintendence vested in the Commissioner and <ORG> by the express provisions of the Act Very soon after the above case was decided the case of <NAME> <NAME> Act in which <NAME> said It is clear that the Collector <ORG> is a <ORG> over which at the time of the passing of the Charter Act the Sudder <ORG> possessed Appellate Jurisdiction and therefore it is clear that the th section of the Charter Act gives us a superintendence over such <ORG>s for the purpose to which I have already alluded the purpose is set out in the earlier part of the judgment and is to compel them to do any act which by law they should do to command them to execute all powers with which they are vested and to restrain them from meddling when they have no jurisdiction It may be noted that there is no provision for such restitution in Act of and the order must have been made in accordance with the general Civil Procedure Code Then in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Sir <NAME> and <NAME> held that Act of confers upon <ORG> merely a limited jurisdiction and <ORG> under its general power of control has the right to prevent them for exceeding that jurisdiction In this case the attachment and sale order passed by a Collector in respect of properties of the judgment debtor other than the tenure in arrear was set aside by <ORG> as it was not shown that the Collector was satisfied that execution could not be obtained against the person and moveable property of the judgment debtor We have therefore no doubt that we have jurisdiction to interfere under Section of the Charter Act On the merits of the case it is contended by the learned vakil for the petitioner firstly that the learned Deputy Collector had no jurisdiction to hold the sale of other lakhiraj property of the petitioner in the manner in which he did it and that on that ground the sale and all subsequent proceedings are ultra vires and void and secondly that the learned Deputy Collector was quite competent to entertain the application under Section A of the Civil Procedure Code and in refusing to do so refused to exercise a lawful jurisdiction There is nothing to show that any attempt was made to execute the decree against the person or the moveable property of the petitioner All that the learned Deputy Col lector says is on the th February the decree holder made an affidavit that the tanki tenure for which he had obtained a decree for arrears having been allotted for the sheba of Jagganath temple other properties of the judgment debtor may be sold for realization of the decretal amount and according to his prayer the mafi kharida land acres were sold This would naturally attract all the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code with regard to sales from attachment to delivery of possession at least and there is no special provision in Act of dealing with these matters Reliance is placed for this contention on the case of <NAME> <NAME> A there is no discussion of the reasons pro and con and no reference is made to what the law is after sale in such cases we should have felt ourselves somewhat embarrassed by this case if it were not for the further <ORG> had held that there was no provision for such a transfer in Act of and the transfer was therefore incompetent Their Lordships in setting aside the order of <ORG> say that <ORG> Courts deciding suits under Act of are Civil Courts and there is nothing in the Act of which provides for any execution beyond his Collector jurisdiction and there is nothing to forbid the conclusion that such executions are left to the operations of Act XXXTTI of or the corresponding portion of Act VIII of This and other reasons given for the decision seem to leave no room for doubt that their Lordships thought that except upon points expressly provided for by Act of the procedure of <ORG> when trying questions arising under that Act must be governed by the Civil Procedure Code The discussion was confined to the question of limitation and the case of <NAME> I Calc I A that it held that there being nothing in Act of to prohibit the Collector acting under that Act from transferring an execution case from his own file to the file of <ORG> the procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code might be followed in the matter of the transfer of the decree for execution to some other <ORG>s and they distinguish it as not specifically dealing with Section of I A does not hold that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code might be followed as if the Collector had a discretion in the matter but their Lordships say These considerations lead to the conclusion that the Rent <ORG>s established by Act of must be held to fall within Section of Act VIII of of the same year I A cannot stand in the way of our holding that Section A of the Civil Procedure Code was applicable to the present case and the learned Deputy Collector failed to exercise a lawful jurisdiction vested in him by law
