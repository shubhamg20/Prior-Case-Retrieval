The <ORG> also framed rules under Section read with Section called the Company Law <ORG> Procedure Rules Rule of which empowered the Chairman of the <ORG> to distribute the business of the <ORG> among himself and other member or members and to specify the cases or classes of cases which were to be considered jointly by the <ORG> On February under the power vested in him by Rule the Chairman passed an order specifying the cases that had to be considered jointly by himself and the only other member of the <ORG> and distributing the remaining business between himself and the member On May an order was issued on behalf of the Company Law <ORG> under Section of the Companies Act appointing four inspectors to investigate the affairs of the appellant company on the ground that the <ORG> was of the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that the business of the appellant company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors members or any other persons and that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud misfeasence and other misconduct towards the company and its members Soon afterwards the appellants filed a petition under Art of the Constitution for the issue of a writ quashing the order of the <ORG> on the grounds inter alia that the order had been issued mala fide that there was no material on which such an order could have been made etc One of the affidavits filed in reply to the petition was by the Chairman of the Company Law <ORG> in which it was contended inter alia that there was material on the basis of which the impugned order was issued and he had himself examined this material and formed the necessary opinion within the meaning of sec In the course of replying to some of the allegations in the petition it was stated in paragraph of the affidavit however that from memoranda received from some ex directors of the company and other examination it appeared inter alia that there had been delay bungling and faulty planning of the company main project resulting in double expenditure that the company had incurred huge losses there had been a sharp fall in the price of the company SCI shares and some eminent persons had resigned from the <ORG> of Directors of the company because of differences with the Managing Director on account of the manner in which the affairs of the company were being conducted In the appeal to this <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the appellants That the order was made made fide on account of the competing interests of a firm in which the Minister in charge of the department was interested and also because of his personal hostility against the second petitioner who was the managing director of the company that <ORG> had erred in deciding the petition on the footing that the first respondent <ORG> was an independent authority and that it was its Chairman who on his own had formed the requisite opinion and passed the order and therefore the motive or the evil eye of the Minister was irrelevant <ORG> also erred in failing to appreciate that even though the impugned order was by the Chairman as under it had to receive and in fact received the Minister agreement if the Minister mala fides were established that would vitiate the order furthermore in the circumstances of the case Per <NAME> and <NAME> The decision to order the investigation was taken by the Chairman of the respondent <ORG> and there was nothing to indicate that in arriving at that decision he was influenced by the Minister Although in a case of this kind it would be difficult for a petitioner to have personal knowledge in regard to an averment of mala fides where such knowledge is wanting he must disclose his source of information so that the other side gets a fair chance to verify it and make an effective answer there is undoubtedly ample power in <ORG> to order attendance of a deponent in court for being cross examined <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> dissenting The circumstances disclosed in paragraph of the affidavit must be regarded as the only materials on the basis of which the respondent <ORG> formed the opinion before ordering an investigation under Section The next requirement is that there are circumstances suggesting the inferences stout in the Section An examination of the affidavit filed by the Chairman of the respondent <ORG> showed that the material examined by the Chairman merely indicated the need for a deeper probe It is also not reasonable to say that the clause permitted the <ORG> to say that it has formed the opinion on circumstances which in its opinion exist and which in its opinion suggest an intent to defraud or a fraudulent or unlawful purpose The words in the opinion of govern the word there are circumstances suggesting and not the words may do so The formation of an opinion must therefore be as to whether there are circumstances suggesting the existence of one or more of the matters in sub cls There is a difference between not forming an opinion at all and forming an opinion upon grounds which if a court could go into that question at all could be regarded as inapt or insufficient or irrelevant Per <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> As it could not be said that the investigation had been ordered either at the instance of ex directors of the company or on the sole basis of the memoranda submitted by them there was no contravention of the provisions of Sections and of the Act Per <NAME> and <NAME> Bearing in mind the fact that the power conferred by Section is merely administrative the allocation of the business of the <ORG> relating to the exercise of such power must be regarded as a matter of procedure However under ss and <ORG> may frame rules regulating the procedure of the <ORG> and generally to carry out the purpose of the Act In this background by conferring on <ORG> the additional power of framing rules regulating the procedure of the <ORG> and generally to carry out the purposes of <ORG> must have intended that the internal Organisation of the <ORG> and the mode and manner of transacting its business should be regulated entirely by rules framed by the <ORG> The <ORG> had therefore power to frame the Company Law <ORG> Procedure Rules In the exercise of the power conferred by this rule the Chairman assioned the business under to himself When it spoke of procedure in sub section it spoke of the procedure of the <ORG> As constitlited The lacuna in the Act must have felt otherwise there was no need to enact sub section A Sections and gave power to different authorities i the Registrar and the <ORG> provided powers which are different in extent and nature exercisable in sets of circumstances and in a manner different from one another Therefore there is no question of discriminatory power having been vested in the <ORG> under these Sections to pick and choose between one company and the other But an investigation directed under section is essentially of an exploratory character and it is not as if any restriction is placed on the right of the concerned company to carry on its business and no restrictions are imposed on those who carry on the company affairs <NAME> <NAME> On May Mr <NAME> Secretary of <ORG> issued an order on behalf of <ORG> made under of the Companies Act appointing persons as Inspectors for investigating the affairs of <ORG> appellant No I before us since its incorporation in the year and to report to <ORG> inter alia all the irregularities and contravention in respect of the provisions of the Companies Act or of any other law for the time being in force and the person or persons responsible for such irregularities and contravention The order was made by the Chairman of the <ORG> Mr <NAME> on behalf of the <ORG> by virtue of the powers conferred on him by certain rules to which we shall refer later The writ petition is directed against respondents the first of which is <ORG> Apart from the relief of quashing the order of May the appellants sought the issue of a writ restraining <ORG> and the Inspectors from giving effect to the order dated May and also sought some other incidental reliefs <ORG> rejected the contentions urged before it on behalf of the appellants and dismissed the writ petition Thereafter a permit for importing the requisite machinery was granted to the <ORG> Certain negotiations took place between the <ORG> and <NAME> in the course of which an undertaking was given by <NAME> on at behalf of the collaborators that the work would be completed with necessary alterations and modifications in accordance with the report of <ORG> and that the collaborators would spend an additional amount upto pound as may be required for the purpose It is said that the plaint was producing at that time only per cent of its installed capacity but that according to the assurance given by <NAME> it would yield full production by April The suggestion is that as the licence of <ORG> was revoked and as they were not even given sole selling agency for the sale of the products of barium chemicals Mr <NAME> wanted action to be taken under this provision either for penalising appellant No or putting pressure on it A lengthy argument was addressed before us by Mr <NAME> bearing on the question of mala fides in the course of which he referred us to certain documents He also wanted us to bear in mind the sequence in which certain events occurred and said that these would indicate that the former Finance Minister must have been instrumental in having an order under made by the Chairman of the <ORG> We find no substance in the argument The decision to take action was already taken by the Chairman and there is nothing to indicate that in arriving at that decision he was influenced by the Finance Minister Now it does seem from certain material brought to our notice that negotiations with <ORG> were revived by appellant No because of the difficulties which were being experienced in the working of the collaboration agreement with <ORG> No material however is placed before us from which it could be reasonably inferred that had the negotiations with <ORG> fructified One more point was urged in connection with this aspect of the argument and it is that the appellants were not given an opportunity to cross examine Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> Mr <NAME> said that as the appellants had made out a prima facie case of mala fides in their affidavits and as these allegations had been denied by the respondents <ORG> was in error in refusing permission to the appellants to cross examine the persons who swore the affidavits on the side of the respondents There is nothing to show that <ORG> thought that a prima facie case of mala fides had been made out The court has to find the facts and if it finds that it can do so without cross examination it is not compelled to permit cross examination We have no reason to think that <ORG> could not have ascertained the facts on the affidavits themselves Coming to the second point it would be desirable to repro duce which reads thus Without prejudice to its powers under section <ORG> a shall appoint one or more competent persons as inspectors to investigate the affairs of a company and to report thereon in such manner as the Central Government may direct if i the company by special resolution or ii the <ORG> by order declares that the affairs of the company ought to be investigated by an inspector appointed by <ORG> and may do so if in the opinion of <ORG> there are circumstances suggesting i that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors members or any other persons or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose or in a manner oppressive of any of its members or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose or ii that persons concerned in the formation of the company or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud misfeasance or other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members or iii that the members of the company have not been given all the information with respect to its affairs In view of the fact that <ORG> by virtue of the powers conferred by ss and delegated its powers under to them <ORG> we shall read as if in place of the words <ORG> there are the words <ORG> or for brevity <ORG> The words in the opinion of govern the words there are circumstances suggesting and not the words may do so The formation of an opinion must therefore be as to whether there are circumstances suggesting the existence of one or more of the matters in sub cls Quite obviously there is a difference between not forming an opinion at all and forming an opinion upon grounds which if a court could go into that question at all could be regarded as inapt or insufficient or irrelevant order to do justice then the <ORG> would have no objection to producing the same for the <ORG> perusal provided it is not shown to the petitioners In paragraph Mr <NAME> has categorically stated that the order of May was passed after careful and independent examination of the material by the Chairman and that it was issued in proper exercise of the powers conferred upon it Turning to paragraph of the affidavit we find that Mr <NAME> has clearly reiterated that there was ample material before the <ORG> on which it could and did form the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that as stated in the order of May the business of the company was being conducted with intent to defraud creditors members and other persons and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members It is in that paragraph alone that the appellants had specifically raised the contention that the recital in the order as to the existence of material is not correct and that in point of fact there was no material before the <ORG> to form the said opinion What is said therein is that there are circumstances suggesting that the business of the appellants is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors members and others and that it has to be borne in mind that what the <ORG> is to be satisfied about is whether the circumstances suggest any of these things and not whether they establish any of these things Now the first of its conclusion is to the effect that the materials show that there was delay bungling faulty planning of the project and that this resulted in double expenditure for which the collaborators had put the responsibility upon the Managing Director that is appellant No There is no doubt that few share holders have the means or ability to act against the <ORG> The Government thought it right to take power to step in where there was reason to suspect that the <ORG> may not have been acting in the interests of the shareholders who would not be able to take the steps against a powerful body like the <ORG>and to take steps for protection of such interests As we have said the section gives the exploratory power only The powers are exercised for ascertaining facts and therefore before they are finally known all that is necessary for the exercise of the powers is the opinion of the Board that there are circumstances which suggest to it that fraud and other kinds of mismanagement mentioned in sub cls individual might think that the facts suggest otherwise It cannot be said that from a huge loss incurred by a company and the working of the company in a disorganised and un businegslike way the only conclusion possible is that it was due to lack of capability It would be destroying the beneficial effective use of the powers given by the section to say that the <ORG> must first show that a fraud can clearly be said to have Coming to the third point of Mr <NAME> pointed out that four ex Directors of the <ORG> who had resigned submitted a memorandum to Mr <NAME> while he was holding the office of Finance Minister in which grave allegations were made concerning the affairs of the <ORG> and the management of the <ORG> by the second appellant It also empowers the <ORG> to require the applicants to furnish security for such amount not exceeding one thousand rupees as it may think fit for the payment of the costs of the investigation The matter was enquired into by the Regional Director of the <ORG> at Madras and he in his report sent to the <ORG> in September suggested an urgent and comprehensive investigation into the affairs of the <ORG> The matter was then considered by the Secretary of <ORG> in charge of investigation <NAME> I A and he also expressed his agreement that there was need for a deeper probe into the affairs of the company Then again in paragraph he has stated as follows Accordingly the matter was put up to me at the end of November and after consideration of all the material on record I formed the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting the need for action under section of the Companies Act There is therefore no contravention of the provisions of SS and of the Act As already stated the appellant had challenged the provisions of on the ground that they are violative of the fundamental rights under Arts We agree with our learned brother that the action proposed under being merely exploratory in character the fundamental right of <NAME> to carry on business is not affected thereby In the circumstances therefore we do not think that there is anything more that we need say The validity of this rule is challenged by Mr <NAME> on the ground that this amounts to sub delegation of a delegated power and is ultra vires the Act By another notification of the same date <ORG> has made and published rules made by it in exercise of its powers under read with rule of which reads thus Distribution of business The Chairman may with the previous approval of <ORG> by order in writing distribute the business of the <ORG> among himself and the other member or members and specify the cases or classes of cases which shall be considered jointly by the <ORG> In this connection he has referred us to sub A of which was subsequently added but not made retrospective by an amendment of the Act which confers an express power on <ORG> to enable the Chairman to distribute the powers and functions of the <ORG> To sum up then our conclusions may be stated thus The discretion conferred on <ORG> by to order an investigation and delegated by it to <ORG> is administrative that it could be validly exercised by the Chairman of the <ORG> by an order made in pursuance of a rule enacted by <ORG> under read with that the exercise of the power does not violate any fundamental right of the company that the opinion to be formed under is subjective and that if the grounds are disclosed by the <ORG> the <ORG> can examine them for considering whether they are relevant The attack on the order thus fails and the appeal is dismissed with costs The action is challenged as without jurisdiction because not the Board but the Chairman alone acted as mala fide because no honest opinion was formed on the matters which under the section give rise to the power but on irrelevant and extraneous material and further because the order was passed under the influence and malice of a Minister of <ORG> who was interested in another <ORG> belonging to his sons and sought this means to oust a rival The power to call for information is conferred on the Regisrar in two different ways A further power is conferred after December on the Registrar who may after being authorised by a Presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate First Class enter any place search and seize any document relating to the <ORG> its managing agents or Secretaries and treasurers or managing director or manager if be has reason to believe that it may be destroyed or tampered with if in the opinion of <ORG> there are circumstances suggesting i that the business of the company is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors members or any other persons or otherwise for a fraudulent or unlawful purpose or in a manner oppressive of any of its members or that the company was formed for any fraudulent or unlawful purpose ii that persons concerned in the formation of the company or the management of its affairs have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud misfeasance or other misconduct towards the company or towards any of its members or iii that the members of the company have not been given all the information with respect to its affairs which they might reasonably expect including information relating to the calculation of the commission payable to a managing or other director the managing agent the secretaries and treasurers or the manager of the company As soon as may be after the commencement of the Companies Amendment Act <ORG> shall by notification in the Official Gazette constitute a Board to be called <ORG> to exercise and discharge such powers and functions conferred on <ORG> by or under this Act or any other law as may be delegated to it by that Government <ORG> shall consist of such number of members not exceeding five as <ORG> deems fit to be appointed by that Government by notification in the Official Gazette No act done by <ORG> shall be called in question on the ground only of any defect in the constitution of or the existence of any vacancy in <ORG> The <ORG> was constituted on February by a notification and by a notification of even date in exercise of the powers conferred by cl a of sub of read with sub of of the Companies Act <ORG> delegated its powers and functions to the <ORG> under among others Simultaneously acting in exercise of the powers conferred by sub of read with sub of <ORG> made the Company Law <ORG> Procedure Rules and one such rule dealt with distribution of business to the following effect That is how action was taken in the name of the <ORG> but by the Chairman and is the subject of challenge for the reason that a power delegated to the <ORG> as a whole cannot be delegated to an individual member in the absence of a provision such as sub A added recently to enabling the solidarity of the <ORG> to be broken with the previous approval of <ORG> may by order in writing authorise the chairman or any of its other members or its principal officer whether known as secretary or by any other name to exercise and discharge subject to such conditions and limitations if any as may be specified in the order such of its powers and functions as it may think fit and every order made or act done in the exercise of such powers or discharge of such functions shall be deemed to be the order or act as the case may be of the <ORG> When it spoke of procedure in sub section it spoke of the procedure of the <ORG> as constituted The lacuna in the Act must have been felt otherwise there was no need to enact sub section A The argument of the learned Attorney General that sub A was lot needed at all does not appeal to me There is nothing to show that this was done on purpose to cover up a conspiracy to do harm to the <ORG> The whole project had hung fire and capital was eaten into a rapid rate because there were technical defects in the setting up of the plant and machinery This brings me to the third and the last question namely whether mala fides or the ultra vires nature of the action has been established in this case to merit interference at our hands The question naturally divides itself into two parts The first is whether there was any personal bias oblique motive or ulterior purpose in the act of the chairman The next requirement is that there are circumstances suggesting etc These words indicate that before <ORG> forms its opinion it must have before it circumstances suggesting certain inferences As my brother <NAME> has put it trenchantly It is not reasonable to say that the clause permitted the government to say that it has formed the opinion on circumstances which it thinks exist Since the existence of circumstances is a condition fundamental to the making of an opinion the existence of the circumstances We have to see whether the Chairman in his affidavit has shown the existence of circumstances leading to such tentative conclusions The report was next considered by two Under Secretaries arid by the Secretary of the Company Law board who all agreed that there was need for a deeper probe into the affairs of the Company The matter was then placed before the Chairman who formed the opinion that there were circum stances suggesting the need for action under There was considerable delay in taking up the matter and this was explained as occasioned by the language riots and other more pressing occupation Had the matter rested there it would have been a question whether this Court should interfere with a subjective opinion when the affidavit showed that there were materials for consideration I leave that question to be decided in another case where it arises It may be mentioned that in paragraph of the affidavit the Chairman also stated With reference to paragraph of the petition I have already stated above that there was ample material before the Board on which it could and did form the opinion that there were circumstances suggesting that the business of the company was being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors members and other persons and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company had in connection therewith been guilty of fraud misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members In my opinion there is nothing to show that the reports which were being received from September or the report of <ORG> indicated fraud A straight forward affidavit that there were circumstances suggesting any of these inferences was at least necessary The second and the third circumstance merely establish that there was loss in making this project work and that a part of capital had been lost In the other part of the affidavit the Chairman has merely repeated but has not stated how he came to the conclusion and on what material Coming now to the affidavit of Mr <NAME> I find that he merely repeats what was stated in the affidavit of the Chairman On the other hand they emphasise only that there was mismanagement and losses which necessitated a deeper probe As to the constitutionality of I agree with my brethren <NAME> and <NAME> and have nothing to add <NAME> The order dated May was passed by the Chairman of <ORG> Mr <NAME> submitted that only the <ORG> could pass an order under <ORG> could delegate its function under to the <ORG> but it had no power to authorise the Chairman to sub delegate this function to himself and consequently <ORG> Procedure Rules made by <ORG> on February and the Chairman order of distribution of business dated February delegating the function of the <ORG> under to the Chairman are ultra vires the Companies Act and the impugned order is invalid The naming of I delegate to do an act involving a discretion indicates that the delegate was selected because of his peculiar skill and the confidence reposed in him and there is a presumption that he is required to do the act himself and cannot redelegate his authority In <NAME> Ward the Court held that where a drainage board constituted by an Act of Parliament was authorised by it to delegate its powers to a committee the powers so delegated to the committee must be exercised by them acting in concert and it was not competent to them to apportion those powers amongst themselves and one of them acting alone pursuant to such apportionment could not justify his acts under the statute One of the members of the <ORG> has to be appointed a Chairman and this necessarily implies that the <ORG> shall consist of at least two members However under ss and <ORG> may frame rules regulating the procedure of the <ORG> and generally to carry out the purposes of the Act In the context of I am inclined to construe this rule making power liberally The Central <ORG> has power to constitute the Company Law <ORG> to delegate its functions to the <ORG> and to control In this background by conferring on <ORG> the additional power of framing rules regulating the procedure of the <ORG> and generally to carry out the purposes of the <ORG> must have intended that the internal Organisation of the <ORG> and the mode and manner of transacting its business should be regulated entirely by rules framed by the <ORG> The <ORG> had therefore power to frame the Company Law <ORG> Procedure Rules authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the <ORG> In the exercise of the power conferred by this rule the Chairman assigned the business under to himself We find however that <ORG> had under ss and ample power to frame rules authorising the Chairman to distribute the business of the <ORG> Sections a and enable <ORG> to make an order appointing an inspector to investigate the affairs of a company in different sets of circumstances and the contention that is discriminatory and is violative of Art Appellant No who is the managing director of the company is not a citizen but even assuming that imposes restrictions on his right of property or his right to carry on his occupation as managing director those restrictions are reasonable and are imposed in the interests of the general public I am all the more persuaded to come to this conclusion having regard to the fact that in paragraph of his affidavit the Chairman has disclosed the circumstances which he took into account in passing the order In paragraphs and of his affidavit the Chairman stated that he had various materials on the basis of which he passed the order No reasonable person who had given proper consideration to these circumstances could have formed the opinion that they suggested any fraud as mentioned in the order dated May The appeal is allowed and the impugned order is set aside <NAME> The appellant company is a public limited company registered on July having its registered office at Ramavaram in Andhra Pradesh and the second appellant was at all material times and is still its managing director He then started negotiations with <NAME> of Hannover West Germany to collaborate with him in setting up a plant On April a meeting of the company directors was held in New Delhi which was attended by one <NAME> a representative of <ORG> and also by the General Manager of <ORG> Certain proposals were discussed and it was decided that the company should give notice to <ORG> canceling the agreement with them On May the first respondent passed the impugned order which inter alia stated In the opinion of <ORG> there are circumstances suggesting that the business of <ORG> is being conducted with intent to defraud its creditors members and other persons and further that the persons concerned in the management of the affairs of the company have in connection therewith been guilty of fraud misfeasance and other misconduct towards the company and its members On May the second appellant submitted a representation to the chairman of the first respondent Board
