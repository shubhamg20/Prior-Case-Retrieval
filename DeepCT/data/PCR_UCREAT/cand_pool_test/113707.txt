The appellants filed a petition under Art But the discretion is judicial if the petitioner makes a claim which is frivolous vexatious or prima facie unjust or which may not appropriately be true in a petition invoking extraordinary jurisdiction the <ORG> may decline to entertain the petition The questions of fact raised by the petition in this case are elementary Public bodies are as much bound as private individuals to carry out representations or facts and promises made by them relying on which other persons have altered their position to their prejudice The obligation arising against an individual out of his representation amounting to a promise may be enforced ex contractu by a person who acts upon the promises when the law requires that a contract enforceable at law against a public body shall be in certain form or be executed in the manner prescribed by statute and if the contract be not in that form the obligation may still be enforced against the body in appropriate cases in equity A public body is not exempt from liability to carry out its obligation arising out of representations made by it relying upon which a citizen has altered his position to his prejudice There is undoubtedly a clear distinction between a representation of an existing fact and a representation that something will be done in future The former may if it amounts to a representation as to some fact alleged at the time to be actually in existence raise an estoppel if another person alters his position relying upon that representation A representation that something will be done in future may result in a contract if another person to whom it is addressed acts upon it A representation that something will be done in future may involve an existing intention to act in future in the manner represented If the representation is acted upon by another person it may unless the statute governing the person making the representation provides otherwise result in an agreement enforceable at law if the statute requires that the agreement shall be in a certain form no contract may result from the representation and acting thereupon but the law is not powerless to raise in appropriate cases an equity against him to compel performance of the obligation arising out of his representation The Judgment of the Court was delivered by Civil Appeal No of <NAME> <ORG> of Bombay dismissed in limine a petition filed by <ORG> hereinafter called the <ORG> for the issue of a writ restraining the respondent Municipality from enforcing the provisions of the Maharashtra Municipalities Act of relating to the levy assessment collection recovery of octroi and in particular and Ss to thereof and from enforcing the Maharashtra Municipalities Octroi Rules and from acting upon resolutions passed by <ORG> dated September and September and from levying assessing collecting recovering or taking any other step under the Act rules or the resolu tions and for an order restraining the Municipality of Ulhasnagar from levying assessing collecting any octroi on the goods imported by the <ORG> within the limits of <ORG> for a period of years from the date of its first imposition At a special meeting held on December <ORG> considered the letters written by <ORG> dated November and December drawing the attention of the Municipality to the circumstances in which the Industrial Area was included and retained in the local limits of the Ulhasnagar District Municipality and continued to reman within the local limits of the Municipality and advised the Municipality to pass a resolution confirming such exemption and honour the commitments of its predecessor CI NP merits any representation of a tax payer for exemption from payment of octroi and if any such representation was made by the factories situate in the Industrial Area the <ORG> would consider the same and take such action as it would deem fit There is undoubtedly a clear distinction between a represen tation of an existing fact and a representation that something will be done in future The former may if it amounts to a representation as to some fact alleged at the time to be actually in existence raise an estoppel if another person alters his position relying upon that representation But between a representation of a fact which is untrue and a representation express or implied to do something in future there is no clear antithesis A representation that sotmething will be done in future may involve an existing intention to act in future in the manner represented Public bodies are as much bound as private individuals to carry out representations of facts and promises made by them relying on which other persons have altered their position to their prejudice The obligation arising against an individual out of his representation amounting to a promise may be enforced ex contractu by a person who acts upon the promise when the law requires that a contract enforceable at law against a public body shall be in certain form or be executed in the manner prescribed by statute the obligation may be if the contract be not in that form be enforced against it in appropriate cases in equity In <ORG> <ORG> this Court held that the Government is not exempt from the equity arising out of the acts done by citizens to their prejudice relying upon the representations as to its future conduct made by the Government He does not know and cannot be expected to mow the limits of their authority and he ought not to suffer if they exceed it The question is whether the character of an act done in force of a statutory prohibition is affected by the fact that it had been induced by a misleading assumption of authority A public body is in our judgment not exempt from liability to carry out its obligation arising out of representations made by it relying upon which a citizen has altered his position to his prejudice Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the <ORG> urged that the petition filed by the <ORG> apparently raised questions of fact which in the view of <ORG> could not appropriately be tried in the exercise of the extra ordinary jurisdiction under Art But <ORG> has not said so and on a review of the averments made in the petition this argument cannot be sustained The questions of fact raised by the petition in this case are elementary The order passed by <ORG> is set aside and the case is remanded to <ORG> with a direction that it be readmitted to the file and be dealt with and disposed of according to law We had during the pendency of the appeal in this Court made an order restraining the levy of octroi duty Since we have granted special leave against the order dismissing the petition we do not deem it necessary to consider whether the order rejecting the application for certificate was erroneous
