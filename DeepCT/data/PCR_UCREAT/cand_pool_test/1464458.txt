HELD There was enough material and evidence referred to by the <ORG> while recording its finding that the shares in question had been purchased by the assessee with a view to acquire the managing agency and control of the textile mill and that the shares did not constitute stock in trade of the assessee These courts only exercise advisory jurisdiction in such references The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> whereby that court answered the following two questions in a reference made to it under section of the Indian Income Tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act i Whether there was material for the finding that the shares in question were purchased by the assessee with a view to acquire the managing agency and the control of the company or the shares constituted his stock in trade ii Even if the shares in question did not constitute the stock in trade of the assessee whether the profit made on the sale of shares did not constitute capital gain chargeable to income tax under section of the Act On the first question the answer of <ORG> was that there was no material for the finding that the shares in question were purchased by the assessee with a view to acquire the managing agency and control of the company In response to a notice issued by the income tax officer the assessee wrote letter dated March in the course of which he stated I have already brought to your honour notice in the course of assessment proceedings and would like to confirm that I had certain share transaction in which there has been appreciation to the tune of Rs It may also be noted here that if the price ruling at the time of the transfer was to be taken into account perhaps there is no profit An application was thereafter filed on behalf of the respondent for stating a case to <ORG> The question with which <ORG> was concerned was whether there was material before the <ORG> for arriving at the finding that the shares in question had been purchased by the assessee with a view to acquire the managing agency and control of <ORG> Perusal of the judgment of <ORG> shows that <ORG> did not discuss this aspect of the matter These courts only exercise advisory jurisdiction in such references If <ORG> finds that there is no such evidence to support the finding of fact of the <ORG> this circumstance would give rise to a question of law and can be agitated in a reference It is also well established that when a <ORG> acts on material which is irrelevant to the enquiry or considers material which is partly relevant and partly irrelevant or bases its decision partly on con jectures surmises and suspicions and partly on evidence then in such a situation an issue of law arises and the finding of the <ORG> can be interfered with The finding may also be interfered with if it be found to be so unreasonable that no person acting judicially and properly instructed as to the relevant law could have arrived at it It was found by the <ORG> that the shares in question were out of the lot sold by <ORG> to <ORG> It was also found that the shares had been transferred to the assessee at the original price at which these shares had been sold by the <ORG> and not at the price which was prevailing at the time of transfer <ORG> in arriving at the conclusion that the shares in question had been purchased not with a view to obtain the managing agency but as a stock in trade has referred to the fact that the assessee took loan for the purchase of those shares and subsequently transferred shares out of shares We therefore accept the appeal set aside the judgment of <ORG> and discharge the answers given by it to the questions referred and substitute the answers indicated above The appellant shall be entitled to his costs of this <ORG> as well as those in <ORG>
