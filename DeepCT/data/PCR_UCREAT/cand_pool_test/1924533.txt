JUDGMENT <NAME> Two questions have been referred by <ORG> for the opinion of <ORG> They are Whether the Court has power to interfere in the plaintiff valuation of relief for the purpose of court fee under Section iv of the Court Fees Act and If so A when would such interference be justified and what should be the criterion for the re determination of the value The reference came to be made in the following circumstances from April up to date and for the recovery of the amount found due on rendition of accounts Value of the suit for accounts for the purposes of court fee has been fixed tentatively the plaintiff will pay court fee on the amount decreed on account of their shares of profits That the defendants be directed to render true and full accounts of <ORG> Kishan Lal Company for the period since As stated in the order of reference the three suits are a sequel to the disputes that arose between the three brothers and broadly Stated the questions that the suits raise are as to the status of certain properties including liquor business the extent of the right and interest of the brothers in the said property and of their title to it the entitlement of the brothers to the prefits of the business to participation in it the validity of certain orders made by the excise authorities in relation to the liquor license and matters connected therewith and arising out of it The defendants in all the three suits pleaded before the learned Judge that the reliefs claimed by the plaintiffs in the suits had not been properly valued for purposes of court fees and jurisdiction in as much as the plaintiffs had valued the reliefs for the purposes of court fees under Section iv and of the <ORG> fees Act at a nominal figure notwithstanding the fact that the plaintiffs in all the suits ex fade made out that the value of the subject matter of the suits runs into lakhs of rupees They contended that even though the plaintiffs were entitled to place their valuation on the reliefs under Section iv and such a right was not unfettered and the <ORG> had a power and indeed an obligation under Order Vii Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure to consider if having regard to the allegations made in the plaint the plaintiffs had valued the reliefs in such a manner that it had no reasonable relationship to the reliefs which the plaintiffs in fact sought or may eventually be held entitled and to require the plaintiffs to value the reliefs according to law and pay the deficit court fee On the other hand the plaintiffs contended that they had an unfettered right to regulate the matter of valuation by appropriate rules under Section of the Suits Valuation Act and that the valuation placed by the plaintiffs was beyond judicial review and the <ORG> had no power to interfere in such a valuation It was stated in the order of reference that there was some controversy before the learned Judge on the question as to the applicability to the Union Territory of Delhi of the rules made by <ORG> at Lahore under Section of the Suits Valuation Act with regard to the manner of determination of the value of certain types of suits but that the learned Judge considered it unnecesary to pursue that matter at that stage because the said rules though prima facie applicable to Delhi by virtue of the provisions in Section of the Delhi High Court Act were not determinative of the questions that have arisen because the said rules did not lay down the manner of determination or the criterion in respect of all types of suits that are envisaged by Section iv of the Court fees Act and for the purpose of determining the propriety of the valuation of the reliefs in the present suits and the questions in relation thereto resort would have to be had to the provision in Section iv and it would be necessary to consider its true manner and scope In that view the learned Judge referred the two questions which have already been set out earlier in this judgment for the opinion of <ORG> The first question for consideration is whether the Court has power to interfere with the plaintiff valuation of the relief sought for i IV In suits A for movable property where the subject matter has no marketalue as for instance in the case of documents relating to title to enforce the right to share in any property on the ground that it is joint family property to obtain a declaratory decree or order where consequential relief is prayed to obtain an injunction for a right to some benefit not herein otherwise provided for to arise out of land and for accounts according to the amount at which the relief is valued in the plaint or memorandum of appeal It is however contended that though under Section iv of the Courts fees Act it is for the plaintiff to value the relief he seeks he has not the right to place any valuation that he likes that by virtue of the provision in Order Vii Rule ll of the Code of Civil Procedure or at any rate in its inherent power referred to in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure the Court has the power to consider if having regard to the allegations made in the plaint the plaintiff has valued the relief he seeks in such a manner that it has a relationship to the relief sought or which may eventually be granted and to require the plaintiff to value the relief according to law and pay the deficit court fee Order Vii Rule ll reads as follows The plaint shall be rejected in the following cases A where the relief claimed is undervalued and the plaintiff on being required by the <ORG> to correct the valuation within a time to be fixed by the <ORG> fails to do so Clause of Rule assumes and refers to the general power of the <ORG> to require the correction of the valuation where the relief claimed is undervalued But where the plaintiff sues for mesne profits or for an amount which will be found due to him on taking unsettled accounts between him and the defendant the plaint shall state approximately the amount sued for They have thus no bearing on the question of valuation of the relief and the court fee payable thereon Similarly the second part of Rule which is the relevant portion in the present context requires that in suits for mesne profits or for amount found due on taking unsettled accounts the plaint should state approximately the amount sued for Paragraph iv of Section of the <ORG> fees Act with which we are now concerned refer to the relief sought in the various suits mentioned in its clauses a to and not to the subject matter of those suits In other words the said provision itself recognises that the amount which will be found due on taking unsettled accounts cannot be stated precisely by the plaintiff at the stage of filing the plaint and therefore requires the amount to be stated only approximately They have no bearing on the question of valuation for the purposes of court fee tha is under consideration The only question for consideration is wheather the plaintiff has the right to place any valuation that he likes The provision in paragraph iv of Section of the <ORG> fees Act which gives a free hand to the plaintiff to place any valuation that he likes and does not place any restriction or condition has in our opinion so far as the suits mentioned in that paragraph are concerned the effect of taking away the general power of the <ORG> under Order Vii Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure and the inherent power to correct an under valuation In other words in our opinion paragraph iv of Section of the <ORG> fees Act gives a right to the plaintiff to place any valuation that he likes on the relief he seeks and the <ORG> has no power to interfere with the plaintiff valuation That was why the legislature obviously thought it fit to leave to the plaintiff to place any valuation the likes on the relief he seeks in such suits To say in such a case that the valuation placed by the plaintiff is arbitrary or fanciful and seek to interfere with the same would amount to a re writing of the statutory provision in paragraph iv of Section of the <ORG> fees Act which a <ORG> cannot do So far as suits for mesne profits and suits for accounts are concerned Section of the <ORG> fees Act provides that if the profits or the amount decreed are or is in excess of the profits claimed or the amount at which the plaintiff values the relief sought the decree shall not be executed until the difference between the fee actually paid and the fee which would have been payable had the suit comprised the whole of the profits or the amount so decreed shall have been paid to the proper officer <NAME> learned counsel for the defendants urged that the use of the words valued and values in paragraph iv of Section of the <ORG> fees Act itself shows that the valuation by the plaintiff should be a proper valuation in the sense that it has a reasonable relationship to the relief sought by the plaintiff or may eventually be granted to the plaintiff and that the <ORG> can therefore consider whether the valuation by the plaintiff was proper The learned counsel submitted that the words ordinarily to be accepted by the <ORG> indicate that according to this decision though the valuation by the plaintiff is to be ordinarily accepted the <ORG> is not bound to accept the same if it finds the valuation to be arbitrary or fanciful and in such a case it can direct the plaintiff to value the relief properly The last words in the observation set out above clearly show that the Supreme <ORG> expressly stated that it was not necessary for it to decide the question As stated by us earlier once it is accepted that the valuation is left to the option of the plaintiff and the difficulty in valuing the relief with any precision or definiteness is also accepted there is no standard by which the valuation by the plaintiff can be evaluated and characterised as improper or abritrary or fanciful Section of the said Act gives power to <ORG> to make rules for determining the value of land for jurisdictional purposes in respect of certain suits mentioned in the section Section provides inter alia that the value for purposes of jurisdiction of suits coming under paragraph iv of Section of the Court fees Act shall not exceed the limits indicated by the Rules made by <ORG> under Section where the suits relate to land or to interest in land in regard to which <ORG> has made any such rules Under Section of the Suits Valuation Act the High Court is given power to make rules concerning the valuation of the suits mentioned in the section and the subject matter of which is not capable of being satisfactorily valued for purposes of the Court fees Act and the Suits Valuation Act In exercise of the power conferred by Section <ORG> now Punjab and Haryana made the following rules regarding suits for accounts Suits in which the plaintiff in the plaint asks for accounts only not being I suits to recover the amount which may be found due to the plaintiff on taking unsettled accounts between him and the defendant II suits of either of the kinds described in Order Xx Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure VALUE a for the purposes of the Court fees Act i Suits in which the plaintiff in the plaint seeks to recover the amount which may be found due to the plaintiff on taking unsettled accounts between him and the defendant II Suits of either of the accounts described in Order Xx Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure Value for the purpose of Court fee A As determined by the Court fees Act Sathappa Chettiar supra the effect of the provision in Section of the Suits Valuation Act is to make the value for the purpose of jurisdiction dependent upon the value as determinabte for computation of court fees and the computation of court fees in suits falling under Section iv of the <ORG> fees Act depends upon the valuation that the plaintiff makes in respect of his claim Also once the plaintiff exercises his option and values his claim for the purpose of court fees that determines the value for jurisdiction and not vice versa However if there are rules made by <ORG> under Section of the Suits Valuation Act and the same are applicable the valuation for the purpose of court fees under Section iv of the <ORG> fees Act will have to be made according to such rules So far as the rules made by <ORG> are concerned it has to be noted that Rules and set out above contemplate separate valuation for the purpose of court fees and for the purpose of jurisdiction Coming now to the decisions of the various <ORG> we find that the <ORG> of Lahore Bombay Madras Mysore Rangoon Hyderabad and <ORG> have taken the same view as the one we have taken above viz that the legislature purposely allowed the plaintiff to fix his own valuation for the purpose of court fees in the suits falling under paragraph iv of Section of the Court fees subject however to any rules made under Section of the Suits Valuation Act in as much as the said suits are such that the relief claimed therein cannot be valued definitely and that the Court has no power to interfere with the plaintiff valuation under order Vii Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure as the said provision applies only to cases in which there is a definite standard by which it can be seen if the relief has been under valued or not LAHORE In this case the effect of Rule made by <ORG> under Section of the Suits Valuation Act was also considered ALLAHABAD In this decision <ORG> clearly stated at page that the question as to whether or not the plaintiff can put an arbitrary or fictitious valuation on the relief which he seeks did not arise in that case at all It was merely stated at page Col There was no discussion and no answer was given to the question as to how in view of the nature of the suits mentioned in paragraph iv of Section of the Court fees Act it can be said that the value given in the plaint by the plaintiff in such suits is arbitrary or fanciful in the absence of a standard for the determination of the real or proper value of the relief claimed In this decision however it was held that under Section iv and of the Court fees Act the plaintiff is entitled to put his own valuation and it was pointed out that the remedy lies in the rule making power of <ORG> under Section of the Suits Valuation Act In this <NAME> who delivered the main judgment clearly stated at page Col that he adhered to the view expressed in the case of <NAME> supra It appears that in Bengal Section has since been added expressly giving power to the <ORG> to revise and determine the correct valuation if in its opinion the subject matter of the suit has been wrongly valued <NAME> who delivered the main judgment clearly pointed out at page Col With due respect we have to point out that there was no consideration in the judgment as to how in suits of the types mentioned in Section iv of the Court fees Act the valuation put by the plaintiff on the relief sought by him can be characterised as arbitrary or fictitious when there is no standard for the correct and precise valuation of the relief The said <ORG> decision has been followed in In this decision it was held that in a suit to obtain a declaratory decree with consequential relief falling within Section iv the court is empowered under the law to revise the valuation put by the plaintiff and if on such revision it is of opinion that the valuation is insufficient or arbitrary it has jurisdiction to fix a right value In none of them was any answer given to the question as to how the value given by the plaintiff to the relief sought by him in a suit under one of the clauses of Section iv of the Court fees Act can be characterised as arbitrary when it is not capable of any precise or definite valuation We have already referred to the decision of <ORG> But where he is allowed to state the amount at which he values the relief sought and no qualifying words or words of limitation are used in the section he has to be held to be free to state such amount as he likes SIND In this decision it was held that a suit for a declaration and an injunction is a suit for consequential relief within the meaning of Section iv of the <ORG> fees Act and that in such a suit it is not open to the plaintiff to put any arbitrary value upon the injunction sought and pay court fee on such value and the question as to what is a proper valuation depends on the circumstances of each suit and the judicial discretion of the <ORG> and that the <ORG> has jurisdiction to revise a valuation OUDH In this case the learned Judge observed that there was no direct authority for the <ORG> to interfere with the valuation set up by a plaintiff who seeks a relief under Section iv or of the <ORG> fees Act unless the <ORG> can take advantage of Section of the Code of Civil procedure and that there could be no doubt that that section may be brought into use if a plaintiff makes an absurd and outrageous misrepresentation as to the value of his suit in order to have it tried by some particular <ORG> Mr <NAME> referred to two decisions of <ORG> The above observations were made in the context of Rule in Chapter of Vol In the later case it was only held in the context of the facts of that case that the <ORG> in deciding the question of court fee should look into the allegations in the plaint to see what is the substantive relief that is asked for For the foregoing reasons our answer to the first question that has been referred is in the negative i that Paragraph iv of Section of the <ORG> fees Act gives a right to the plaintiff in any of the suits mentioned in the clauses of that paragraph to place any valuation that he likes on the relief he seeks subject however to any rules made under Section of the Suits Valuation Act and the <ORG> has no power to interfere with the plaintiff valuation We answer the reference accordingly
