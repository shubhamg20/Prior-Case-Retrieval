At the instance of the assessee in Nos to of under section of the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act he following question of law in respect of the assessment years to has been referred for the opinion of this court Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case <ORG> was right in holding that the share income of the trust should be assessed in the hands of the assessee The same question for the same assessment years has been referred under section of the Act at the instance of the assessee in Nos to of The first trust was created for the benefit of the prospective wife of the minor son of <NAME> viz Likewise the second trust was created for the benefit of the would be wife of <NAME> another minor son of <NAME> On appeal by the assessees the Appellate Assistant Commissioner purporting to follow the decision of the <ORG> in I A Nos On further appeals before the <ORG> at the instance of the <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the <ORG> on the strength of another decision of the <ORG> in I A Nos and Mads dated November that the share income from the two trusts should be assessed in the hands of the assessee Referring to the clauses in the trust deeds the <ORG> took the view that in both the trust deeds there is no provision as to what should happen in the event of <NAME> and <NAME> not being in existence at a time when they may become entitled to take the corpus and the accretions and that the trusts would therefore fail and under section of the Indian Trusts Act there would be a resulting trust in favour of the author of the trust and his wife in which case there could not be a transfer of the amounts set apart under the two trust deeds and the share income from the trust funds necessarily had to be assessed in the hands of the assessees Learned counsel also submitted that <NAME> and <NAME> got married and there was thus no possibility of any resulting trust at all attracting the application of section of the Indian Trusts Act On the other hand learned counsel for the <ORG> contended that the trusts in question would fail in the event of <NAME> and <NAME> not being in existence at that point of time contemplated under the relevant clauses of the trust deeds and that it would have the effect of creating a resulting trust in favour of the assessee and his wife as to justify the assessment of the share income of the assessees in the trust funds in their hands We may now refer to the relevant clauses viz There is no dispute that in the trust deed executed by Smt <NAME> on October creating <NAME> Trust there is a similar provision We may point out that the decision of the <ORG> in I A Nos to Mds was the subject matter of a reference in Nos and of and this court had occasion to consider the validity of the trust in those references In that case also two trusts were created by the assessee and his wife for the benefit of the prospective wives of their two minor sons and cash gifts were made to the two trusts on various dates by the assessee and his wife In this case also under clause of the deed of trust referred to earlier provision is made to the effect that if <NAME> did not get married before attaining the age of or died without marrying then he trustees were directed to convey the capital amount as well as the accretions to the other son Sri <NAME> Similarly in the other trust deed relating to <NAME> Trust executed by the wife of the assessee in Nos to of a similar provision has been made to the effect that if <NAME> did not get married before attaining the age of or died without marrying the amounts set apart together with the accretions should be conveyed to the other son <NAME> It is seen that in clause of the respective trust deeds the beneficiary has been indicated with certainty though the identity could get fixed only on the marriage of <NAME> and <NAME> taking place in which case their respective wives would be entitled to the trust funds with the accretions There is therefore no scope whatever for clause of the respective trust deeds coming into force Section runs as follow Where a trust is incapable of being executed or where the trust is completely executed with out exhausting the trust property the trustee in the absence of a direction to the contrary must hold the trust property or so much thereof a is unexhausted for the benefit of the author of he trust or his legal representative However during the years of account relevant to the assessment years in question both <NAME> and <NAME> had been very much in existence and there was thus no possibility of a resulting trust in favour of the assessee in Nos to of and his wife in the relevant years <NAME> and <NAME> had been in existence during the period in question and had also married as we were informed at the bar there is no scope for applying section of the Indian Trusts Act at all on the facts and the circumstances of the case We now refer to the decision in <ORG> Under clause of the deed of trust the trustees held a sum of Pounds which was paid to them and they held the rupee equivalent of Pounds which was the annual payment which the assessee company undertook to make upon a trust and spend the same and the income if any in taking out a deferred annuity policy with an insurance society in the name of the trustees on the life of the managing director The policy was to cover the annuity of Pounds per annum payable to the managing director for life from the date when he would attain he age of years Nothing was made available to either the managing director or his wife if both died before the date on which the managing director would reach the age of Likewise here was also no provision made in the deed that if the wife of the managing director should die before he reached the age of in which event no annuity would be payable It was held that if the managing director and his wife both died before September when the managing director was due to attain the age of the trust would become incapable of being executed and the trust funds remained unexhausted and as there was no direction in the trust deed that in such a situation monies paid to the trustees would follow any course other than that indicated in section of the Indian Trusts Act the trustees would hold the monies for the benefit of the assessee and therefore it could not be said that by creating a trust in such terms and putting the trustees in possession of the funds in accordance with its provisions the assessee had wholly parted with its interest in the amounts concerned While examining the claim of the company under section xv of the Indian Income tax Act as an expenditure the court took into account the clauses in he trust deed and found that the amount spent would not really be an expenditure having regard to the provisions in the trust deed We are therefore of the view that the <ORG> was wrong in applying section of the Indian Trusts Act to hold that there was a resulting trust in favour of the husband and wife and that the share income from the trust funds has to be assessed in the hands of the assessees We therefore answer the question referred to us in the negative and in favour of the assessees
