produced Effect of <ORG> under duty to examine other relevant evidence on record HEADNOTE The respondent plaintiff filed a suit under of the Madhya Pradesh Accommodation Control Act for eviction of the appellant tenant on the ground of personal necessity In the appeal to this <ORG> on behalf of the tenant it was contended that it was essential for the plaintiff respondent to establish that he was the owner of the premises and that the concurrent finding of fact recorded by first two courts was binding on the <ORG> under of the Code of Civil Procedure and its reversal was illegal Dismissing the appeal HELD The <ORG> power to interfere with the finding of fact reached by the first appellate court cannot be denied if when the lower appellate court decides an issue of fact a substantial question of law arises even PG NO PG NO though the <ORG> while hearing the appeal under of the Code of Civil Procedure has no jurisdiction to re appraise the evidence and reverse the conclusion reached by the first appellate court The court is under a duty to examine the entire relevant evidence on record and if it refuses to consider important evidence having direct bearing on the disputed issue and the error which arises is of a magnitude that it gives birth to a substantial question of law the <ORG> is fully authorised to set aside the finding In the instant case though the partition deed under which the plaintiff claims exclusive title to the property was not produced in court the first appellate court was under a duty to consider all the relevant evidence led by the parties along with the circumstances The Civil Judge who tried the suit as well as the Additional District Judge confirming the decision of the trial court had seriously erred in not considering the entire evidence on record including the reply to the notice sent by the plaintiff respondent wherein the tenant appellant has accepted the plaintiff title and counter foil receipts signed by the appellant in which the plaintiff had been described as the owner of the property The appellant is in possession of a shop in a town in Madhya Pradesh as a tenant under the respondent who filed a suit out of which the present appeal arises for his eviction on the ground of personal necessity Restriction on eviction of tenants Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law or contract no suit shall be filed in any Civil Court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on one or more of the following grounds only namely a that the accommodation let for non residential purposes is required bona fide by the landlord for the purpose of continuing or starting his business or that of any of his major sons or unmarried daughters if he is the owner thereof or for any person for whose benefit the accommodation is held and that the land lord or such person has no other reasonably suitable non residential accommodation of his own in his occupation in the city or town concerned The plaintiff claims that he requires the shop personally for starting a business and it is rightly contended by Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the appellant that it is essential for him to establish that he is the owner of the premises Mr <NAME> strongly urged that the concurrent finding of fact recorded by the first two courts was binding on <ORG> under of the Code of Civil Procedure and its reversal is illegal It is true that the partition deed under which the plaintiff claims exclusive title to the property was not produced in court but the first appellate court was under a duty to consider all the relevant evidence led by the parties along with the circumstances Unfortunately neither the Civil Judge who tried the suit nor the Additional District Judge confirming the decision of the trial court adverted to important items of relevant evidence which were considered and relied upon by <ORG> The plaintiff before filing the suit sent a notice through his counsel to the appellant in which it was stated that the shop in question belongs to him It is true that <ORG> while hearing the appeal under of the Code of Civil Procedure has no jurisdiction to re appraise the evidence and reverse the conclusion reached by the first appellate court but at the same time its power to interfere with the finding cannot be denied if when the lower appellate court decides an issue of fact a substantial question of law arises The court is under a duty to examine the entire relevant evidence on record and if it refuses to consider important evidence having direct bearing on the disputed issue and the error which arises is of a magnitude that it gives birth to a substantial question of law <ORG> is fully authorised to set aside the finding We therefore do not discover any defect in the judgment of <ORG> and the appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs
