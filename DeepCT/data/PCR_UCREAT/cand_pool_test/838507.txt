On telephonic information given to the District Magistrate about the protests at the hospital and the gathering of a large crowd the Superintendent of Police and the Additional District Magistrate PW reached the hospital in the evening There are two oblique contusions of reddish blue colour from to cm cm on the outer upper aspect of Rt The doctor opined that the cause of death was shock as a result of the extensive external injuries and that the death had taken place within hours preceding the post mortem examination <NAME> PW the Enquiry Officer during the course of inquiry examined some witnesses and seized various documents After conclusion of the enquiry he submitted his report Ex on The Enquiry Officer PW found that during the night intervening th and th October deceased <NAME> died in police custody at Rampura police station due to extensive beating given to him and held respondent No <NAME> SI and respondent No <NAME> to be directly responsible for causing those injuries This appeal by special leave has been filed by the State of Madhya Pradesh questioning the acquittal of respondent No for the offences under Sections and IPC and of respondents to for the offences with which they were charged We have heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record That <NAME> deceased was brought from his village Dhabala Deval to Rampura police station by Head Constable <NAME> and Constable <NAME> on in the evening for interrogation as a suspect in a murder case has not been disputed either in the courts below or before us While the prosecution case was that <NAME> died while in police custody on account of torture and excessive beating given to him at the police station the defence set up by the respondents and particularly respondent no <NAME> at the trial was that <NAME> had been released from police custody at about after interrogation on itself vide entry Ex was recorded at the police station Rampura at the instance of Ramesh respondent No to the effect that he had found one unknown person near a tree by the side of the tank riggling with pain in his chest and that as soon as respondent No reached near him the said person died The further case set up by <NAME> respondent No was that after making a Roznamacha entry at a about his departure from the police station he respondent No <NAME> and Constable <NAME> respondent proceeded to the spot where the dead body was stated to be lying for conducting investigation under Section We agree with <ORG> that <NAME> died in police custody as a result of extensive beating given to him and that the respondents had created false clues and fabricated false evidence to conceal the truth that <NAME> had died in police custody of the dead body an intrinsically false document with a view to screen the offence which shows that there were multiple injuries on different parts of the body of the deceased are false documents and were prepared by SI <NAME> with a view to screen the offence and no opportunity had been given to them to tender and explanation in that behalf Even the facts as to at what time the deceased was given beating in the police station and who were the police persons on duty at the police station at the time when beating was given to the deceased <NAME> have not been proved by the prosecution As regards the charge aforesaid four accused respondents there is no definite evidence to show that the deceased <NAME> was detained in the Police Station Rampura during the night intervening th and th October by these respondents or at their instance and no opportunity was afforded to them to explain those circumstances they had been seriously prejudiced and no conviction could therefore be recorded against them for the offence under Section Their acquittal in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case therefore does not call for any interference by us and upholding their acquittal we dismiss the appeal against them Having recorded a clear and conclusive Finding and on a proper appreciation of the evidence that the deceased <NAME> had remained in custody at the police station right from the time he was brought there in the evening on by constables <NAME> Respondent No and <NAME> Respondent No till the time his dead body was removed from the police station on the next day and that the respondent No and others had with a view to conceal the truth created false evidence and fabricated false clues <ORG> could not have acquitted SI <NAME> respondent whose presence at the police station was amply established by the prosecution evidence of the offence of causing multiple external injuries to the deceased which ultimately resulted in the death of <NAME> Similarly the materials on the record established not only the presence of respondents and at the police station during the period <NAME> had remained in custody but also their participation in the removal of the dead body to the hospital with a view to screen the offence These witnesses further deposed that they saw a dead body wrapped in a blanket being brought out from the police station and being placed in a jeep belonging to the fisheries department at about on <NAME> <NAME> who was the Secretary of <ORG> at the relevant time clearly deposed that while the dead body was being put inside the jeep the face of the deceased had got uncovered and had become visible and that since he had heard about the death of <NAME> he saw the face of the deceased whom he identified as <NAME> <NAME> Advocate <NAME> <NAME> corroborated the testimony of <NAME> and <ORG> and deposed that he had himself seen <NAME> and <ORG> respondents alongwith one other constable bringing the dead body wrapped in a blanket from police station and putting it in the jeep while <NAME> SI <NAME> deposed that he told Dr <NAME> that since the deceased had died as a result of beating given to him at the police station in police custody the post mortem of the dead body be not undertaken and that the doctor should await for the higher officials Indeed there is no evidence to show that after <NAME> respondent No who along with <NAME> respondent No had brought the deceased to the police station for interrogation had at any time left the police station on the fateful night In the face of the unimpeachable evidence of PW and PW we fail to understand how the learned Judges of <ORG> could opine that there was no definite evidence to show the complicity of <NAME> respondent No <NAME> and <NAME> respondents and respectively in the crime alongwith SI <NAME> respondent No i that the deceased had been brought alive to the police station and was last seen alive there on ii that the dead body of the deceased was taken out of the police station on at about for being removed to the hospital iii that the deceased had died as a result of the receipt of extensive injuries while he was at the police station iv that SI <NAME> respondent no <NAME> Respondent No <NAME> respondent No and <NAME> respondent No were present at the police station and had all joined hands to dispose of the dead body of <NAME> that SI <NAME> respondent No created false evidence and fabricate false clues in the shape of documentary evidence with a view to screen the offence and for that matter the offender vi SI <NAME> respondent in connivance with some of his subordinates respondents herein had taken steps to cremate the dead body in hot haste describing the deceased as a lavaris vii <NAME> and <NAME> respondents had brought the deceased to the police station form his village and viii that police record did not show that either <NAME> or <NAME> had left the police station till the dead body was removed to the hospital in the jeep unerringly point towards the guilt of the deceased and the established circumstances coupled with the direct evidence of PW and The trial court and <ORG> if we may say so with respect exhibited a total lack of sensitively and a could not careless attitude in appreciating the evidence on the record and thereby condoning the barbarous third degree methods which are still being used at some police stations despite being illegal In the ultimate analysis the society suffers and a criminal gets encouraged Tortures in police custody which of late are on the increase receive encouragement by this type of an unrealistic approach of the <ORG> because it reinforces the belief in the mind of the police that no harm would come to them if an odd prisoner dies in the lock up because there would hardly be any evidence available to the prosecution to directly implicate them with the torture The <ORG> must not loose sight of the fact that death in police custody is perhaps one of the worst kind of crime in a civilised society governed by the rule of law and poses a serious threat to an orderly civilised society Disturbed by this situation <ORG> in its th Report recommended amendments to the Indian Evidence Act so as to provide that in the prosecution of a police officer for an alleged offence of having caused bodily injuries to a person while in police custody if there is evidence that the injury was caused during the period when the person was in the police custody the Court may presume that the injury was caused by the police officer having the custody of that person during that period unless the police officer proves to the contrary From the evidence available on the record both documentary and oral we are satisfied that Respondents and to had participated in causing injuries to <NAME> while in police custody directly or indirectly and even if it is not possible to say that they intended to cause the death of <NAME> and they can certainly be clothed with the knowledge that the injuries which a were being caused to the deceased at the police station were likely to cause his death though probably without any intention to cause his death or even to cause such bodily injuries to him as were likely to cause death Since the occurrence took place years ago the respondents have gone through the ordeal of a protracted trial and the appeals in <ORG> and in this Court We have given our anxious consideration to the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties on the question of sentence We are conscious that a precious human life has been lost at the hands of those who are expected to protect the life and liberty of the citizens of this country Keeping in view the consideration of the human factor involved and particularly the interests of the heirs of <NAME> deceased to whom mere imprisonment of the respondents at this belated stage may not offer much solace We have to strike a balance between these disparate considerations and keeping in view the fact that the respondent No has already undergone a sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment consequent upon his conviction for the various offences by <ORG> as noticed earlier we pass the following order Respondent No <NAME> is convicted under section Part II IPC and sentenced to suffer rigorous imprisonment for two years and to pay a fine of Rs We further direct that the entire amount of fine on realisation from respondents to shall be paid to the heirs of the deceased <NAME> by way of compensation
