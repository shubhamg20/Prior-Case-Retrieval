There was an application for transfer of the execution proceedings which resulted in their being transferred to the <NAME> at Tangail <ORG> Certain orders were passed by that <NAME> and on the th of November he made an order of release and it is this order that is named in the Rule Though the Rule only mentions the order of the th of November I notice that the application on which the Rule was granted referred to the orders generally and I think we can fairly treat this application as though the order of the th of January was called in question so that what we have to decide is whether or not the <NAME> had jurisdiction to entertain these execution proceedings Now his jurisdiction did not extend to suits in excess of a thousand rupees so that if the matter had to be determined by the terms of the Code then under the present Code as under the Code of the <NAME> bad not jurisdiction for the purposes of these execution proceedings Therefore I think the <NAME> rightly held that he had no jurisdiction and that being so not only will the order of the th of November be of no avail but the other orders must share the same fate the order of the th of January being correct No rule has been granted which would invite our making any such order so that in any case I should have felt slow to accede to this application
