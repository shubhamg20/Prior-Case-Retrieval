The Single Judge who heard the matter in the first instance as also the court of appeal found in favour of the respondents though on somewhat different grounds and the <ORG> of Bombay preferred the appeal The principal question canvassed in this Court related to the validity It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the impugned Act was a law relating to betting and gambling and as such was covered by Entries and of List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution whereas the contention of the respondents was that the Act was with respect to trade and commerce and came under Entries and of that List Held that in testing the validity of an Act it was necessary in the first place to decide whether it was with respect to a topic assigned to the legislature and secondly where it was so and the legislature was <ORG> and the Act purported to operate beyond the <ORG> whether there was sufficient territorial nexus to validate such operation and lastly whether the powers of the legislature were in any other way fettered by the Constitution A prize competition that did not to a substantial degree depend upon the exercise of skill for its solution would be of a gambling nature and a scrutiny of the prize competitions offered by the respondents clearly showed that there was an element of chance to start with and consequently they must be of a gambling nature and fell within the mischief of the Act The petitioners therefore had no fundamental right under Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal by the State of Bombay from the judgment and order passed on January by <ORG> of In the said petition there were two petitioners who are now the two respondents to this appeal The first petitioner is an individual who claims to be a citizen of India and the founder and Managing Director of the second petitioner which is a company incorporated in the State of Mysore and having its registered head office at Residency Road Bangalore in that State That licence was granted to the first petitioner under the provisions of the Bombay Prize Competitions Tax Act Bom The Government of Bombay having declined to renew the first petitioner licence for a further period the first petitioner filed a petition under of the Specific Relief Act in <ORG> which was eventually after various proceedings dismissed by the court of appeal on or about March LIV of hereinafter referred to as the Act which came into force on December A new section was substituted for the old and another new section was inserted after and numbered as a A By this new A provision was made for the levy in respect of every prize competition contained in a newspaper or a publication printed outside the State of Bombay for which a licence was obtained under the Act of a tax at such rates as might be specified not exceeding the rates specified in or in a lump sum having regard to the circulation or distribution of the newspaper or publication in the State of Bombay Reference is also made to the rules framed by the State of Bombay called the Bombay Lotteries and Prize Competition Control and Tax Rules herein after called the said Rules which came into force on and from December The said Rules require the petitioner to apply for and obtain a licence in Form which imposes certain onerous conditions Upon the presentation of the petition a Rule was issued calling upon the State of Bombay to appear and show cause if any it had why the writ or orders prayed for should not be issued or made It submitted that as the second petitioner was a corporation and the first petitioner who was a Managing Director thereof had no rights independent of the second petitioner neither of them could lay any claim to any fundamental right under Art An affidavit in reply was filed by the first petitioner traversing the allegations submissions and contentions set forth in the affidavit in opposition filed on behalf of the State of Bombay The impugned Act itself contained distinct provisions in respect of prize competitions and lotteries thereby recognising that prize competitions were not lotteries of the Constitution inasmuch as it imposed restrictions on trade commerce and intercourse between the States and was not saved by Art The restrictions imposed by the impugned Act on the trade or business of the petitioners were not reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public and therefore contravened the fundamental right of the petitioners who were citizens of India to carry on their trade or business under Art In the result the rule nisi was made absolute and it was further ordered that the State of Bombay its servants and agents do forbear from enforcing or taking any steps in enforcement implementation furtherance or pursuance of any of the provisions of the impugned Act and the Rules made thereunder and particularly from enforcing any of the penal provisions against the petitioners their Directors officers servants or agents and that the State of Bombay its servants and agents do allow the petitioners to carry on their trade and business of running the Prize Competition mentioned in the petition and do forbear from demanding collecting or recovering from the petitioners any tax as provided in the impugned Act or the said Rules in respect of the said Prize Competition and that the State of Bombay do pay to the petitioners their costs of the said applications It differed from the learned trial Judge on the view that he had taken that there was no legislative competence in the <ORG> to enact the legislation It held that the topic of legislation was I gambling and the <ORG> was competent to enact it under Entry of the State List It held that there was legislative competence in the <ORG> to impose that tax but that the tax was invalid because it did not comply with the restriction contained in Art It also took the view that the tax even assuming it was a tax on betting or gambling could not be justified because it did not fall under Art It took the view that although the activity of the petitioners was a lottery it was not an activity which was against public interest and therefore the provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution applied to the respondents business The principal question canvassed before us relates to the validity or otherwise of the impugned Act <ORG> has rightly pointed out that when the validity of an Act is called in question the first thing for the court to do is to examine whether the Act is a law with respect to a topic assigned to the particular <ORG> which enacted it If it Is then the court is next to consider whether in the case of an Act passed by the <ORG> of a Province now a State its operation extends beyond the boundaries of the Province or the State for under the provisions conferring legislative powers on it such <ORG> can only make a law for its territories or any part thereof and its laws cannot in the absence of a territorial nexus have any extra territorial operation If the impugned law satisfies both these tests then finally the court has to ascertain if there is anything in any other part of the Constitution which places any fetter on the legislative powers of such <ORG> The impugned law has to pass all these three tests Under ss and of that Act <ORG> had power to make laws for the Province of Bombay or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List in the Seventh Schedule to that Act It will also be remembered that the Act was amended by Bombay Act XXX of after the Constitution of India had come into operation and subject to the provisions of the Constitution <ORG> has power to make laws for the whole or any part of the State of Bombay with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution The State of Bombay which is the appellant before us claims that the impugned Act including A is a law made with respect to topics covered by Entries and of List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which reproduce Entries and of List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act In order to correctly appreciate the rival contentions and to come to a decision as to the particular Entry or Entries under which the impugned Act including A thereof has been enacted it is necessary to examine and to ascertain the purpose and scope of the impugned legislation In of the impugned Act will be found the definition of prize competition to which reference will be made hereafter in greater detail Section creates certain offences in connection with lotteries and competitions punishable as therein mentioned There are two provisos to the section which are not material for our present purpose Section regulates the granting of licences on such fees and conditions and in such form as may be prescribed that is to say prescribed by rules Section authorises the levy of a tax on lotteries and prize competitions at the rate of of the total sum received Or due in respect of such lottery or prize competition Sub section of empowers the State <ORG> by a Notification in the official <ORG> to enhance the rate of tax up to of the total sum received or due in respect of such prize competition as may be specified in the Notification Notwithstanding anything contained in section there shall be levied in respect of every lottery or prize competition contained in a newspaper or publication printed and published outside the State for which a licence has been obtained under section or a tax at such rates as may be specified by the State Government in a notification in the Official Gazette not exceeding the rates specified in section on the sums specified in the declaration made under section by the promoter of the lottery or prize competition as having been received or due in respect of such lottery or prize competition or in a lump sum having regard to the circulation or distribution of the newspaper or publication in the State Section requires every person promoting a lottery or prize competition of any kind to keep and maintain accounts relating to such lottery or prize competition and to submit to the Collector statements in such form and at such period as may be prescribed It is not necessary for the purpose of this appeal to refer to the remaining sections which are designed to facilitate the main purpose of the Act and deal with procedural matters except to which confers power on <ORG> to make rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act In exercise of powers so conferred on it <ORG> has by Notification in the Official Gazette made certain rules called the Bombay Lotteries and Prize Competitions Control and Tax Rules to which reference will be made hereafter They urge that the impugned Act deals alike with prize competitions which may partake of the nature of gambling and also prize competitions which call for knowledge and skill for winning success and in support of this contention reliance is placed on the definition of prize competition in of the impugned Act Section of the Act defined prize competition in the terms following Prize Competition includes a crossword prize competition missing words competition picture prize competition number prize competition or any other competition for which the solution is prepared beforehand by the promoters of the competition or for which the solution is determined by lot any competition in which prizes are offered for forecasts of the results either of a future event or of a past event the result of which is not yet ascertained or not yet generally known and any other competition success in which does not depend to a substantial degree upon the exercise of skill but does not include a prize competition contained in a newspaper or periodical printed and published outside the Province of Bombay It will be noticed that there is a comma after each of the five items including the fifth item There is grammatically no difficulty in reading the qualifying clause as lending colour to each of those items Accepting that the qualifying clause applies to each of the five kinds of prize competitions included in the first category it is urged that the qualifying clause as amended indicates that the <ORG> intended to include innocent prize competitions within the definition so as to bring all prize competitions legitimate or otherwise within the operation of the regulatory provisions of the Act including the taxing sections We find no cogent reason and none has been suggested why the <ORG> which treated lotteries and prize competitions on the same footing should suddenly enlarge the first category so as to include innocent prize competitions innocent prize competitions in the first category one would have expected the <ORG> to have made separate provisions for the legitimate prize competitions imposing less rigorous regulations than what had been imposed on illegitimate prize competitions Tax on legitimate competitions may well be a tax under Entry on the trader who carries on the trade of innocent and legitimate competition Such is what we conceive to be the clear intention of the <ORG> as expressed in the impugned Act read as a whole and to give effect to this obvious intention as we are bound to do we have perforce to read the word or appearing in the qualifying clause after the word promoter and before the word for as and The penal provisions of the English Act and the decision of <ORG> throw no light on the construction of our definition clause As for the foregoing reasons we have already arrived at the conclusion just stated it is unnecessary for us to refer to the language used in the third category and to invoke the rule of construction which goes by the name of <ORG> relied on by learned counsel for the appellant According to the general understanding of men as stated by Lord <NAME> of <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> there are marked distinctions between a tax on gross collection and a tax on income which for taxation purposes means gains and profits There is yet another cogent reason for holding that the tax imposed by A is a tax on betting and gambling In enacting the statute the <ORG> was undoubtedly making a law with respect to betting and gambling under Entry as here in before mentioned the court must in order to uphold the section follow the well established principle of construction laid down by <ORG> and hold that the <ORG> must have been contemplating to make a law with respect to betting and gambling under Entry for there is no constitutional limit to the quantum of tax which can be imposed by a law made under that Entry and the <ORG> of a <ORG> can only make a law for the <ORG> or any part thereof and consequently the <ORG> overstepped the limits of its legislative field when by the impugned Act it purported to affect men residing and carrying on business outside the <ORG> It is submitted that there is no sufficient territorial nexus between the <ORG> and the activities of the petitioners who are not in the <ORG> The doctrine of territorial nexus is well established and there is no dispute as to the principles As enunciated by learned counsel for the petitioners if there is a territorial nexus between the person sought to be charged and the <ORG> seeking to tax him the taxing statute may be upheld Keeping these principles in mind we have to ascertain if in the case before us there was sufficient territorial nexus to entitle the Bombay The question whether in a given case there is sufficient territorial nexus is essentially one of fact We find ourselves in agreement with <ORG> All these we think constitute sufficient territorial nexus which entitles the <ORG> of Bombay to impose a tax on the gambling that takes place within its boundaries and the law cannot be struck down on the ground of extra territoriality Assuming that the impugned Act is well within the legislative competence of <ORG> and that it is not invalid on the ground of extra territorial operation we have next to examine and see if there is anything else in the Constitution which renders it invalid The State of Bombay repudiates these contentions and submits that as prize competitions are opposed to public policy there can be no trade or business in promoting a prize competition and the question of infraction of the petitioner fundamental right to carry on trade or business guaranteed by Art It is conceded that the bill which became Act XXX of and amended the Act in the manner here in before stated was introduced in <ORG> State without the previous sanction of the President and consequently the condition precedent to the validity of the resulting Act as laid down in the proviso had not been complied with but it is submitted we think correctly that the defect was cured under Art What weighed with <ORG> was the fact that the legislature had not prohibited gambling outright but only made provisions for regulating the same and further that the <ORG> was making a profit out of these prize competitions by levying taxes thereon in very general terms guarantees to all citizens the right to carry on any occupation trade or business and el protects legislation which may in the interest of the general public impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by Art Article empowers <ORG> by law to impose restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse not only between one <ORG> and another but also within the <ORG> provided in either case such restrictions are required in the public interest looks at the matter from the point of view of the individual citizens and protects their individual right to carry on their trade or business Art The question which calls for our decision is as to the true meaning import and scope of the freedom so guaranteed and declared by our Constitution We have been referred to a large number of decisions bearing on the Australian and American Constitutions in aid of the construction of the relevant articles of our Constitution there is from which our Art It has been equally authoritatively held that the words whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation occurring in the section do not restrict its operation to such things and persons as are carried by land or sea but that the section extends to all activities carried on by means of interState transactions <ORG> <ORG> One cannot but be struck by the sweeping generality of language used in the section Cases arose under statutes which were sought to be supported on the ground of health Learned counsel for the <ORG> has strongly relied on two decisions of the Australian <ORG> in both of which the validity of a New South Wales Statute called the Lotteries and Art Unions Act was called in question He challenged the validity of the law on the ground that it interfered with the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse among the <ORG>s and consequently violated the provisions of After referring to the observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> The <ORG> that the freedom declared by meant freedom at the frontier the learned Judge observed that the question A A He took the view at that the main purpose of the Act was to prevent or suppress lotteries and particularly in ss and foreign lotteries and that it was aimed at preventing what he graphically described as illegitimate methods of trading if sales of lottery tickets were regarded as trading Adverting to the argument which in substance asked the <ORG> to declare that had created an overriding constitutional right to traffic or invest in lotteries so long as the trafficker or investor could succeed in placing some boundary or other between himself and the conductor of the lottery <NAME> said at pp The only difference in fact was that there was no actual sale by delivery of a lottery ticket in New South Wales but money was received by the agent of the Tasmania promoter in New South Wales and transmitted to Tasmania from where the lottery ticket was to be sent <NAME> as he then was gave a new reason for his opinion that notwithstanding the inter State character of the transaction of the impugned Act was valid There is no prohibition or restraint placed upon any act in connection with a lottery because either the act or the lottery is or involves commerce or trade or intercourse or movement into or out of New South Wales or communication between that State and another State To say that inter State trade commerce and intercourse shall be free means I think that no restraint or burden shall be placed upon an act falling under that description because it is trade or commerce or Sub section authorised that the Treasurer might by notice published in the gazette and given in writing to a private bank require that private bank to cease upon a date specified in the notice carrying on business in Australia Sub section provided that upon and after the date specified in a notice under sub the private bank to which that notice was given should not carry on banking business in Australia It also provided a penalty of pound for each day on which the contra vention occurred His Lordship deduced two general propositions from the decided cases namely that regulation of trade commerce and intercourse among the <ORG>s was compatible with absolute freedom and that was violated only when a legislative or executive act operated to restrict trade commerce and intercourse directly and immediately as distinct from creating some indirect or consequential impediment which might fairly be regarded as remote Referring to the doctrine of pith and substance his Lordship observed that it no doubt raised in convenient form an appropriate question in cases where the real issue was one of subject matter as when the point was whether a particular piece of legislation was a law in respect of some subject within the permitted field but it might also serve a useful purpose in the process of deciding whether an enactment which worked some interference with trade commerce and intercourse among the States was nevertheless untouched by as being essentially regulatory in character He took the view that ss and of the New South Wales Act were on their face concerned and concerned only with intra State transactions and that their provisions did not directly hinder burden or delay any inter State trade commerce or intercourse His Lordship observed that there was nothing in the reasoning in the judgment in the <ORG> case or in subsequent decisions to indicate that the <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> were not rightly decided <NAME> also took the view that the previous decisions of <ORG> in <NAME> case and <NAME> case were rightly decided for the reasons given by <NAME> <NAME> dissented from the majority view The sale of stolen goods when the transaction is juristically analysed is no different from the sale of any other goods but can it be doubted that the <ORG> of any State may prohibit the sale of stolen goods without infringing of the Constitution The only feature which distinguishes such a transaction from trade and commerce as generally understood is to be found in the subject of the transaction there is no difference in the means adopted for carrying it out Article sub of the Constitution of the United <ORG>s compendiously called the commerce clause gives power to the <ORG> to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several <ORG>s and with the Indian tribes In <ORG> United <ORG>s the Pure Food Act which prohibited the importation of adulterated food was upheld as an exercise of the power of the <ORG> to regulate commerce In the last mentioned case it was roundly stated at that there is no constitutional right to gamble There is nothing in the American Constitution corresponding to our Art The scheme of the Australian Constitution also is different from that of ours for in the Australian Constitution there is no such provision as we have in Art a fundamental right to carry on trade or business or at declaring by Art As one of us said in <NAME> at The State of Madras the framers of our Constitution being aware of the problems with which the Australian Government had been confronted by reason of sought to solve them by enacting limitations in Part XIII itself on the freedom guaranteed in Art which protects a law which imposes in the interest of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the fundamental right guaranteed by Art One important point to note is that the language used in Art There is nothing in those two Arts He contends that there is no justification for excluding from the meaning of those words activities which may be looked upon with disfavour by the <ORG> or the <ORG> as injurious to public morality or public interest The argument is that if the trade or business is of the last mentioned character then the appropriate <ORG> may impose restrictions which will be justiciable by the courts and this restriction may in appropriate cases even extend to total prohibition Thus there will be a guaranteed right to carry on a business of hiring out goondas to commit assault or even murder of housebreaking of selling obscene pictures of trafficking in women and so on until the law curbs or stops such activities We have no doubt that there are certainactivities which can under no circumstance be regarded as trade or business or commerce although the usual forms and instruments are employed therein Learned counsel has to concede that there can be no trade or business in crime but submits that this principle should not be extended and that in any event there is no reason to hold that gambling does not fall within the words trade or business or commerce as used in the Articles under consideration It is to be the endeavour of the <ORG> to secure a living wage conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities to protect the weaker sections of the people from social injustice and all forms of exploitation to raise the standard of living of its people and the improvement of public health He says It is an abomination to play at chess dice or any other game for if anything is staked it is gambling which is expressly prohibited in the Koran or if on the other band nothing be hazarded it is useless and vain tracts of the type which formed the subject matter of the case of <NAME> <NAME> and was upheld by <ORG> as not repugnant to the English Common Law were subsequently prohibited by Act XXI of which was enacted on the suggestion of Lord <NAME> made in that case and introduced in India provisions similar to those of the English Gaming Act Vict Before the <ORG> intervened gambling and wagering were not prohibited by the English Common Law although the English courts looked upon it with disfavour and discouraged it on grounds of public policy by denying procedural facilities which were granted to other litigants We find it difficult to accept the contention that those activities which encourage a spirit of reckless propensity for making easy gain by lot or chance which lead to the loss of the hard earned money of the undiscerning and improvident common man and thereby lower his standard of living and drive him into a chronic state of indebtedness and eventually disrupt the peace and happiness of his humble home could possibly have been intended by our Constitution makers to be raised to the status of trade commerce or intercourse and to be made the subject matter of a fundamental right guaranteed by Art But as pointed out in United <ORG>s <NAME> the fact of issuing a licence or imposing a tax means nothing except that the licensee shall be subject to no penalties under the law if he pays it Inspector of Taxes A The fact that regulatory provisions have been enacted to control gambling by issuing licences and by imposing taxes does not in any way alter the nature of gambling which is inherently vicious and pernicious As Lord <NAME> pointed out The phrase raised in a convenient form an appropriate question in cases where the real issue is one of subject matter and it may also serve a useful purpose in the process of deciding whether a particular enactment is a law with respect to trade commerce or intercourse as such or whether it is a law with respect to some other subject which incidentally trenches upon trade commerce and intercourse In our opinion therefore the impugned Act deals with gambling which is not trade commerce or business and therefore the validity of the Act has not to be decided by the yardstick of reasonableness and public interest laid down in Arts We have examined the scheme and the rules and the official solutions and the explanations in support thereof and we have come to the conclusion that the competition at present run by the petitioners under the name of <ORG> are of a gambling nature It is said that they are like nine compulsory questions in a school examination but then in a school examination the students are told which are the nine compulsory questions and they can take particular care with regard to those but in this scheme there is no knowing which nine will be selected and those competitors whose answers do not accord with the official solution are debarred from being considered for the first prize On the whole we have come to the conclusion that <ORG> was right in its conclusion that in point of fact the prize competitions run by the petitioners partake of a gambling nature and therefore fall within the definition and are to be governed by the regulatory and taxing provisions of the Act For the reasons stated above we have come to the conclusion that the impugned law is a law with respect to betting and gambling under Entry and the impugned taxing section is a law with respect to tax on betting and gambling under Entry and that it was within the legislative competence of <ORG> to have enacted it There is sufficient territorial nexus to entitle <ORG> to collect the tax from the petitioners who carry on the prize competitions through the medium of a newspaper printed and published outside the State of Bombay The result therefore is that this appeal must be allowed and the order of the lower court set aside and the petition dismissed and we do so with costs throughout
