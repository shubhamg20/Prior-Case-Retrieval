These two appeals have been filed by <ORG> hereinafter called the <ORG> a public sector undertaking of the State of Punjab against the judgment dated of <ORG> in CWP No of and against the order in the review application dated in RA of Though the main judgment in the writ petition has been rendered by <ORG> on the events which have taken place during the pendency of these appeals have changed the complexion of the case and according to the respondent Union of India the writ petition has practically become infructuous and no relief can be granted We shall narrate the facts which have given rise to the writ petition and shall also refer to the subsequent events <ORG> hereinafter called the <ORG> examined the offers and wherever there were deviations in the offers that were made the <ORG> sought clarifications on from the bidders to be given by It is the appellant case that on account of some pressure brought on respondents Member Telecom Commission <ORG> and Respondent Advisor Telecom Commission <ORG> the matter was referred by the th respondent to a High Level Committee with a view to obtain an opinion disqualifying the appellant so that the <ORG> could go in for an outmoded analog system rather than the current digital system to be provided by some multinational company which was wanting to dump its outmoded analog system in the India It is the appellant case that this was done with a view to enable the issue of a fresh notification calling for fresh tenders pertaining to analog system It appears that on the abovesaid High Level Committee submitted its report stating that there were two deviations in the tenders submitted by the appellant as noticed by <ORG> in respect of the required specifications It is said that the appellant had answered all these questions put by the respondents by means of the appellant documents already on record but these were not accepted The appellant stated that the said officer disowned signing such minutes dated The appellant made a representation on to the nd respondent and on the impugned order was passed cancelling the tenders The appellant then filed writ petition on in <ORG> Thereafter the appellant moved this Court in June We shall now refer to the subsequent events that have taken place after the filing of the SLP in this Court It was also stated that the <ORG> in its letter dated had informed <ORG> that it had decided that it was not practical to keep the loan offer open and that in fact formal steps had been taken to cancel the loan offer on The <ORG> also stated that the <ORG> had approved the withdrawal of the loan on This Court was informed on that in the meantime <ORG> was thinking of calling for fresh tenders for installation of telephones under a new scheme for rural areas spread over different States and this Court directed a further affidavit to be filed in this behalf A fresh affidavit dated was filed on behalf of <ORG> to the effect that the <ORG> loan had a validity period of one year which had automatically lapsed on that there was a time constraint in regard to the <ORG> loan and that remainders were received from <ORG> to avail the loan latest by that the <ORG> had informed <ORG> that it was not availing the loan and that it had decided to fund <ORG> through its own resources It was stated that this decision was taken to avoid heavy commitment charges of <ORG> loan if the evaluation decision on the previous tender went beyond Thereafter the previous tenders were cancelled on stating that no bidder qualified the technical commercial evaluation It was also stated that <ORG> had by their letter dated already confirmed that the <ORG> had approved withdrawal of the loan on as already informed to this Court It was also stated that presently there were indigenously developed DOT exchanges which were working in rural area having total capacity of lakh lines landlines digital MARR etc It was stated for the respondents across the <ORG> that the appellant had also responded to the new advertisement These are the subsequent events that have taken place during the pendency of these matters in this Court It is stated for the respondents that the appellant is also participating in these new tenders We have therefore to decide this appeal in the light of the above subsequent developments Learned Senior counsel <NAME> and <NAME> for the appellant and Senior counsel <NAME> for the petitioner in the Transfer Petition have submitted that in spite of these developments the question whether the various officers conspired and played fraud in seeing to it that the <ORG> loan lapsed or stood withdrawn has still to be gone into They contend that when the writ petition was filed on the position was that with a view to allow multi national companies to dump outmoded analog technology into India the officers were wanting to float fresh tenders in which such analog technology could be made the basis of the tenders either wholly or partly that the said attempt was successfully thwarted by the appellant filing the writ petition in <ORG> and Haryana and that with a view to spite the appellant the officers had all conspired and played fraud in having the <ORG> loan withdrawn and the <ORG> tender cancelled The excuse put forward by the officers of <ORG> that <ORG> loan would be expensive was absurd inasmuch as there was a year moratorium on interest and the interest rate was something like and there were other very favourable terms It was argued that there was no point in having such a beneficial loan withdrawn and spending funds of <ORG> Alternatively it was contended by the learned senior counsel for the appellant that the appellant had a legitimate expectation of a substantive nature that even if the Government wanted to put its own funds the original tender notification would be processed for the benefit of Eastern UP On the other hand it was contended vehemently for <ORG> by <NAME> the learned Additional Solicitor General of India that there was absolutely no truth in the contention of the appellant that there was a conspiracy or fraud to shelve the <ORG> loan or to bring in outmoded technology into India through certain favoured multinationals According to him there were two main defects in the tender submitted by the appellant one was a technical one and the other was the absence of proof of proveness <ORG> proceedings in fact showed that it wanted to accept the appellant tender and it gave an opportunity to the appellant to make good the defects but the attitude of the appellant was not helpful and it was the inaction of the appellant that was the cause for the delay that led to a situation where the time limit set by the <ORG> came very close and was expiring As there was no chance of the appellant curing the defects within the few days that were left the <ORG> loan had to be withdrawn This was because there were other rural areas in other States which were more backward then Eastern UP A Tabular statement relating to the national figures regarding telephones is placed before the <ORG> to show that there are even more backward rural areas in some States where the percentage of telephone was less than in Eastern UP There is no question of dumping outdated technology into India There is no proof of fraud either in private law or public law established It is also argued that there is no need to transfer the writ petition filed by Mr <NAME> from the Allahabad High <ORG> to this <ORG> On these submissions the following questions arise for consideration Whether after the <ORG> loan for the contract for providing telephones for <ORG> was withdrawn it is necessary to give any finding on the question of alleged fraud or to grant any directions regarding the bids offered for the <ORG> contract Whether if initially the Government decided to fund the proposed contract for Eastern UP from its own resources it was permissible for the Government to change its policy into one for providing telephones for rural areas in the entire country and whether the legitimate expectation of the appellant in regard to the earlier notification required this Court to direct that the notification for Eastern UP should be continued Point The disputes between the parties before the <ORG> loan was withdrawn were i whether there was a conspiracy or fraud or other manouvre on the part of the <ORG> officials to shelve the <ORG> loan to spite the appellant and bring in outmoded analog technology through favoured multinationals and ii whether the appellant a complied with the technical specifications and produced adequate proof of the proveness of the system offered by the appellant i as to its successful implementation in China If the <ORG> loan itself has now stood withdrawn there is now no possibility of the <ORG> loan project for Eastern UP being started or completed We have heard these submissions very patiently but the point is whether this Court is to give findings on issues which have become non issues now after the withdrawal of the <ORG> loan We have given our anxious consideration to the various contentions raised on behalf of the appellant and the petitioner in the Transfer Petition and we are of the view that a detailed decision on the said questions is not called for Duty to act in good faith is inherent in the process It was contended that the project for Eastern UP should still go ahead and it was not open to <ORG> to deprive the appellant company of its reasonable and legitimate expectation regarding the acceptance of the bid offered for the Eastern UP project It was not open to the <ORG> to deprive the expectation of villagers in villages in Eastern UP and to change over to a new policy of providing telephones to rural areas in all the <ORG>s We do not propose to deal with question of promissory estoppel because the parties were still at the stage of the tenders at the relevant time <NAME> said that the constitutional rights have roots in the common law lm The rule of law lastly may be used as a formula for expressing the fact that with us the law of constitution the rules which in foreign countries naturally form part of a constitutional code are not the source but the consequence of the rights of individuals as defined and enforced by the <ORG> that in short the principles of private law have with us been by the action of the <ORG> and <ORG> so extended as to determine the position of the <ORG> and its servants thus the constitution is the result of the ordinary law of the land This says Lord Steyn is the pivot of <NAME> discussion of rights to personal freedom and to freedom of association and of public meeting and that it is See also The Rule of Law as the Rule of Reason Consent and Constitutionalism in at that Fairness is both procedural and substantive Due Process and Fair Procedure by <NAME> and at quoting <NAME> at clear that <NAME> regards the rule of law as having both procedural and substantive effects It was observed in that case that for a legitimate expectation to arise the decisions of the administrative authority must affect the person by depriving him of some benefit or advantage which either i he had in the past been permitted by the decision maker to enjoy and which he can legitimately expect to be permitted to continue to do until there has been communicated to him some rational grounds for withdrawing it on which he has been given an opportunity to comment or ii he has received assurance from the decision maker that they will not be withdrawn without giving him first an opportunity of advancing reasons for contending that they should not be withdrawn Lord <NAME> went a little further when he said that they had a legitimate expectation that they would continue to enjoy the benefits of the trade union membership Even so it has been held under English law that the decision maker freedom to change the policy in public interest cannot be fettered by the application of the principle of substantive legitimate expectation <ORG> But today the rigidity of the above decisions appears to have been somewhat relaxed to the extent of application of Wednesbury rule whenever there is a change in policy and we shall be referring to these aspects presently Before we do so we shall refer to some of the important decisions of this Court to find out the extent to which the principle of substantive legitimate expectation is accepted in our country This Court held that the Societies were entitled to a legitimate expectation that the past consistent practice in the matter of allotment will be followed even if there was no right in private law for such allotment According to the principle of legitimate expectation if the authority proposed to defeat a person legitimate expectation it should afford him an opportunity to make a representation in the matter Within the contours of fair dealing the reasonable opportunity to make representation against change of policy came in The respondent filed a writ petition claiming that it had a legitimate expectation of acceptance of its bid which was the highest It was held that though the respondent bid was the highest still it had no right to have it accepted This Court referred to <NAME> vs Secretary of State for Home Affairs Ch which required an opportunity to be given to an alien if the leave given to him to stay in UK was being revoked before expiry of the time and to Attorney General of Hong Kong vs <NAME> AC which required the Government of Hong Kong to honour its undertaking to treat each deportation case on its merits this Court also referred to <ORG> vs Minister for the Civil Service AC which related to alteration of conditions relating to membership of trade unions and the need to consult the unions in case of change of policy as was the practice in the past and to <ORG> case SCC and <ORG> <ORG> case SCC as follows The legitimacy of an expectation can be inferred only if it is founded on the sanction of law or custom or an established procedure followed in regular and natural sequence <NAME> <NAME> observed very clearly that the notion of legitimate expectation falling short of a legal right was too nebulous to form a basis for invalidating the exercise of power The <ORG> could interfere only if the decision taken by the authority was arbitrary unreasonable or not taken in public interest If it is established that a legitimate expectation has been improperly denied on the application of the above principles the question of giving opportunity can arise if failure of justice is shown SCC considered the question again In that case it was held that the <ORG> policy to extend renewal of an agreement to selected industries which came to be located in Madhya Pradesh on invitation of <ORG> as against other local industries was not arbitrary and the said selected industries had a legitimate expectation of renewal under renewal claims which should be given effect to according to past practice unless there was any special reason not to adhere to the practice Reference was made to <ORG> case SCC <ORG> <ORG> case SCC and to <ORG> case SCC Administrative Law para where he says that in important cases a legitimate expectation has been founded in the absence of detrimental reliance and that there are good reasons for doing so This aspect has come up for consideration recently in the English Courts The result is that change in policy can defeat a substantive legitimate expectation if it can be justified on Wednesbury reasonableness We have noticed that in <ORG> case SCC also it was laid down that the decision maker has the choice in the balancing of the pros and cons relevant to the change in policy It is therefore clear that the choice of the policy is for the decision maker and not for the <ORG> The legitimate substantive expectation merely permits the <ORG> to find out if the change in policy which is the cause for defeating the legitimate expectation is irrational or perverse or one which no reasonable person could have made It was contended that there was a substantive legitimate expectation that the revenue would continue to follow the previous practice in regard to claims for loss relief It was held that the <ORG> was still confined to <ORG> principles but that on facts it a case of exceptional circumstances and it would be unfairness amounting to abuse of power to refuse to follow past practice Of course legal certainty is a highly desirable objective in public administration as elsewhere the central Wednesbury principle is that an administrative decision is unlawful if so outrageous in its defiance of logic of or accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it We shall refer to two recent cases In view of the above legal position can it be said on the facts of this case that the substantive legitimate expectations of the appellant have been contravened It will be noticed that at one stage when the <ORG> loan lapsed the Government took a decision to go ahead with the project on its own funds
