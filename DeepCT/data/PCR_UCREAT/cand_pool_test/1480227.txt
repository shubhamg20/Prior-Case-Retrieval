A short question which arises for determination in this batch of civil appeals is whether the A and CIT A were right in disallowing the claim of the assessee for adjustment of of export incentive against indirect cost of trading goods while allowing deduction under section HHC of the Income tax Act as it stood at the relevant time In the above example assessee had incurred direct cost of Rs and indirect cost of Rs According to the assessee the <ORG> was right in reducing Rs from FOB value of exports amounting to Rs however according to the assessee the <ORG> had erred in reducing further the FOB value of exports by Rs instead of Rs because according to the assessee although it had incurred indirect cost of Rs from that figure of Rs it was entitled to deduction of of expenses attributable to export incentives miscellaneous income and interest income amounting to Rs of Rs is Rs as mentioned in the above example Therefore according to the assessee it was entitled to total deduction of only Rs and not Rs from FOB value of exports amounting to Rs According to the learned counsel clause baa of the Explanation to section HHC specifically excludes of incentive receipts from the business profits leaving of such receipts assumed to have been incurred by the <ORG> for earning such receipts and therefore there is no reason why a similar assumption cannot be validly made while interpreting clause of sub section to section HHC read with clause of the Explanation to section HHC In this connection it is submitted that the <ORG> has given recognition to the fact that of certain receipts had to be incurred for earning them and therefore it excluded only of such receipts from the purview of business profits According to the learned counsel one has to read Explanation which defines indirect costs as applicable to apply to the entire section HHC and even if that argument is not accepted still there is no reason why the assumption made by the <ORG> of treating of certain receipts as expenditure under clause baa of the Explanation to section HHC is not applicable to cases falling under section HHC read with clause to the Explanation to sub section of section HHC Mr <NAME> Additional Solicitor General learned counsel appearing on behalf of the <ORG> submitted that the modality under section HHC a for computing business profits was different from the modality for computing export turnover in respect of trading goods under section HHC According to the learned counsel the word costs being attributable to exports would attract the allocation ratio only in such cases where the tax payer is engaged in earning income in foreign exchange from exports and simultaneously earning income from domestic sales and that such ratio is not applicable in cases falling under section HHC because that sub section categorically states that the profits derived from exports shall be the export turnover minus direct and indirect costs Therefore according to the learned counsel the ratio of allocation of costs in the definition of the words indirect costs in the Explanation to sub section would apply only to cases falling under section HHC a and section HHC i Learned counsel further submitted that as a matter of policy that the Government thought it fit to exclude only of the receipts from the business profits as per Explanation baa instead of and from this it cannot be inferred that the <ORG> has assumed that of such receipts has to be treated as costs or expenses to earn receipts by way of incentives commission interest etc Therefore there is no justification for excluding indirect costs if any incurred for earning export incentives commission etc Before coming to the controversy in hand we quote hereinbelow section HHC as it stood at the relevant time Deduction in respect of profits retained for export business HHC For the purposes of sub section a where the export out of India is of goods or merchandise manufactured or processed by the assessee the profits derived from such export shall be the amount which bears to the profits of the business the same proportion as the export turnover in respect of such goods bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee where the export out of India is of trading goods the profits derived from such export shall be the export turnover in respect of such trading goods as reduced by the direct costs and indirect costs attributable to such export where the export out of India is of goods or merchandise manufactured or processed by the assessee and of trading goods the profits derived from such export shall i in respect of the goods or merchandise manufactured or processed by the assessee be the amount which bears to the adjusted profits of the business the same proportion as the adjusted export turnover in respect of such goods bears to the adjusted total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee and ii in respect of trading goods be the export turnover in respect of such trading goods as reduced by the direct and indirect costs attributable to export of such trading goods Provided that the profits computed under clause a or clause or clause of this sub section shall be further increased by the amount which bears to ninety per cent of any sum referred to in clause iiia not being profits on sale of a licence acquired from any other person and clause iiib and iiic of section the same proportion as the export turnover bears to the total turnover of the business carried on by the assessee For the purposes of this sub section a adjusted export turnover means the export turnover as reduced by the export turnover in respect of trading goods adjusted profits of the business means the profits of the business as reduced by the profits derived from the business of export out of India of trading goods as computed in the manner provided in clause of sub section adjusted total turnover means the total turnover of the business as reduced by the export turnover in respect of trading goods direct costs means costs directly attributable to the trading goods exported out of India including the purchase price of such goods indirect costs means costs not being direct costs allocated in the ratio of the export turnover in respect of trading goods to the total turnover trading goods means goods which are not manufactured or processed by the assessee For the purposes of this section a convertible foreign exchange means foreign exchange which is for the time being treated by <ORG> as convertible foreign exchange for the purposes of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and any rules made thereunder aa export out of India shall not include any transaction by way of sale or otherwise in a shop emporium or any other establishment situate in India not involving clearance at any customs station as defined in the Customs Act export turnover means the sale proceeds received in or brought into India by the assessee in convertible foreign exchange in accordance with clause a of sub section of any goods or merchandise to which this section applies and which are exported out of India but does not include freight or insurance attributable to the transport of the goods or merchandise beyond the customs station as defined in the Customs Act ba total turnover shall not include freight or insurance attributable to the transport of the goods or merchandise beyond the customs station as defined in the Customs Act Provided that in relation to any assessment year commencing on or after the st day of April the expression total turnover shall have effect as if it also excluded any sum referred to in clauses iiia iiib and iiic of section baa profits of the business means the profits of the business as computed under the head Profits and gains of business or profession as reduced by ninety per cent of any sum referred to in clauses iiia iiib and iiic of section or of any receipts by way of brokerage commission interest rent charges or any other receipt of a similar nature included in such profits and the profits of any branch office warehouse or any other establishment of the assessee situate outside India Export House Certificate or Trading House Certificate means a valid Export House Certificate or Trading House Certificate as the case may be issued by the Chief Controller of Imports and Exports Government of India supporting manufacturer means a person being an Indian company or a person other than a company resident in India manufacturing including processing goods or merchandise and selling such goods or merchandise to <ORG> or <ORG> for the purposes of export We have considered the rival submissions However in the above stand of the <ORG> there is a fallacy Similar provision is made in clause which defines the words direct costs to mean costs attributable to exports of trading goods Moreover clause of the Explanation defines indirect costs as costs which is not direct costs as defined in clause According to the <ORG> the question of allocation does not arise in cases falling under section HHC We do not find merit in this contention For example in the case where the assessee exports all bought out items but brings back only a part of the export proceedings into India in such cases the ratio will apply and therefore if one is to read clause it retains the words indirect costs to be allocated in the ratio of export turnover to total turnover This is opposed by the <ORG> saying that since apportionment does not apply to section HHC there is no question of applying the yardstick of For the above reasons we set aside the impugned judgments of <ORG> dated and restore the orders of <ORG> dated and
