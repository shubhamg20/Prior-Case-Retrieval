Nature of power of rectification If discretionary HEADNOTE The appellant with his five sons constituted a Hindu undivided family and up to the assessment year the income received by the appellant was assessed to tax as the income of the <ORG> The previous year of <ORG> for each assessment year was from October I to September of the following year A petition filed by the appellant in <ORG> under Article challenging the order of the <ORG> was dismissed by a Single Judge holding inter alia that the appellant had not applied in revision to the Commissioner under section A On appeal to this Court HELD The income from November onwards being assessed to tax as the income of a Hindu undivided family consisting of the appellant his wife and a new born minor son Even if the words used in the statute are prima facie enabling the Courtswill readily infer a duty to exercise power which is invested in aid of enforcement of a right public or private of a citizen Because a revision application could have been moved for an order correcting the order of the Income Tax Officer under but was not moved <ORG> was not justified in dismissing as not maintainable the writ petition which was entertained and was heard on the merits The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals arise out of orders passed in peti tions praying for a writ of mandamus to rectify orders of assessment relating to income assessed to tax for the years and Till the assessment year the income received by <NAME> was assessed to tax as the income of a Hindu undividedfamily He submitted that the assessment of <NAME> has been made in the status of undivided family comprising of himself and his minor son <NAME> The Income tax Officer accepted the plea that to income assessed to tax in the hands of <NAME> in the status of a Hindu undivided family a ii of the Income tax Act did not apply but he declined to give relief holding that for the period November to September <NAME> should have been assessed as an individual Income for the period November to September being assessed to tax as the income of a Hindu undivided family and not of an individual a ii plainly did not apply and the income of the minor children of <NAME> could not be included in the income of <NAME> assessed as a Hindu undivided family We are therefore unable to agree that the income accruing between November and September could be assessed in the hands of <NAME> as an individual There is no clear evidence on the record about the status in which <NAME> submitted the return of income which belonged to the erstwhile Hindu undivided family be excluded from the assessment which accordingly stood reduced from Rs to Rs There was in fact an existing Hindu undivided family of which for a part of the period <NAME> and his wife were members and for the rest besides the two their infant son was a member In rejecting the application under the Income tax Officer apparently assumed that in an applica tion made by an assessee he could exercise his power suo motu and modify the status of the assessee even without giving an opportunity to the assessee to establish that the order assessing him in the status of a Hindu undivided family was in law correct There was no defence to the claim for rectification on the merits of that application It is true that a petition to revise the order could be moved before the Commissioner of Income tax If <ORG> had not entertained his petition <NAME> could have moved the Commissioner in revision because at the date on which the petition was moved the period prescribed by A of the Act had not expired We are unable to hold that because a revision application could have been moved for an order correcting the order of the Income tax Officer under but was not moved <ORG> would be justified in dismissing as not maintainable the petition which was entertained and was heard on the merits <ORG> observed that under of the Indian Income tax Act the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer is discretionary Even if the words used in the statute are prima facie enabling the <ORG> will readily infer a duty to exercise power which is invested in aid of enforcement of a right public or private of a citizen But there may be some thing in the nature of the thing empowered to be done some thing in the object for which it is to be done something in the conditions under which it is to be done something in the title of the persons for whose benefit the power is to be exercised which may couple the power with a duty and make it the duty of the person in whom the power is reposed to exercise that power when called upon to do so Lord <NAME> observed in the same case at pp that the enabling words give a power which prima facie might be exercised or not but if the object for which the power is conferred is for the purpose of effectuating a right there may be a duty cast upon the donee of the power to exercise it for the benefit of those who have that right when required on their behalf Lord <NAME> and Lord <NAME> made similar observations at pp The appeals must therefore be allowed and the order passed by <ORG> set aside The appellant will be entitled to his costs in this <ORG> and in <ORG>
