It was further prayed that directions be issued to give back the lands in question to the erstwhile land owners or to sell the land by public auction only for the public purpose Pending adjudication of the main petition an injunction was prayed for restraining the respondents from using or utilising any part or portion of land in question for any slaughter house abattoir and restraining the respondent No from allowing respondent No to establish or operate any slaughter house abattoir on the land in question Vide order dated the learned Single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the writ petition and the appeal filed against the order of the learned Single Judge was dismissed by <ORG> of <ORG> vide the judgment impugned in this appeal The facts leading to the filing of the present appeal are that by notification dated nd August issued under the Land Acquisition Act <ORG> acquired land measuring acres for a public purpose namely construction of Mourigram Dankuni Link Project of South Eastern <ORG> After completion of the project the <ORG> surrendered the surplus land measuring acres to <ORG> on <ORG> was authorised to set up <ORG> on this land It was contended that the respondents were encroaching upon the Constitutional Rights of the appellants by establishing a slaughter house abattoir on the land acquired for a specified public purpose The delay in filing Writ Petition was sought to be explained on the ground that respondents had allegedly kept the deal a guarded secret The lease deed was executed between the parties on th June on terms and conditions which were incorporated in Part II of the Schedule attached to the said lease deed It is contended that the respondent <ORG> without issuing any advertisement or resorting to the procedure of auction and tender has secretly leased out the land which has resulted in huge monetary loss worth crores of rupees to the <ORG> exchequer It is submitted that in the light of the pleadings and the record produced before it <ORG> was justified in dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellants It is argued that there is no defect or error of law in the decision making process of <ORG> by which the land has been leased out to respondent No It is conceded that though the documents executed between the parties is styled as a lease deed yet in fact it is a sale as the whole of the then prevalent market value of the land has been paid by the respondent No Referring to the decisions of this Court reported in AIR SC and AIR SC and analysing the facts of the case the learned Single Judge held There are enough materials placed before me which unmistakably substantiate that Mr <NAME> client has brought a promise and or hope that at least employed youths would be provided in this industry In appeal while upholding the judgment of the learned Single Judge <ORG> dealt with the submissions of the appellants to the effect that the land should have been sold by public auction if after acquisition it was not used for any other public purpose by the <ORG> Agreeing with the learned Single Judge it was held by <ORG> in appeal that We are however of the opinion that this court is not at all required to be satisfied whether a surplus land has been utilised for a public purpose After acquisition of the land in accordance with the procedure established by law a surplus land has vested in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances Article empowers the <ORG> to carry on any trade or business and make contracts for any purpose Whether any advertisement was issued or not or whether public auction or floating of tenders should have been dispensed with or not are such matters which require pleadings in order to enable <ORG> to explain or justify their action in the circumstances of the case Learned counsel appearing for the respondents have brought to our notice that in fact the value charged from respondents No was the market value of the land and not lease money as urged In this regard in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent No in this <ORG> it is stated In order that the proper and correct lease premium and lease rent were arrived at a valuation of the land in question was caused to be made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer The public purpose which the <ORG> had in mind has been spelt out in its affidavit as under In finalising the lease terms and conditions and the proposal of the respondent no the fact that setting up of the said industry in the low lying land at Mourigram would not only provide employment to more than persons which estimate was provided even by <ORG> Australia in its feasibility study report carried out in the year as aforesaid and indirect employment to large number of persons in West Bengal were taken into consideration We have found in this case that the appellants have miserably failed to place on record or to point out to any alleged constitutional vice or illegality SCC it was held that as regards the question of propriety of private negotiation with an individual or corporation it should be borne in mind that <ORG> owned or public owned property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the executive One of the methods of securing the public interest when it is considered necessary to dispose of the property is to sell the property by public auction or by inviting tenders There may be situations where there are compelling reasons necessitating departure from the rule It is a matter of historical experience that there is a tendency in every government to assume more and more powers and since it is not an uncommon phenomenon in some countries that the legislative check is getting diluted it is left to the <ORG> as the only other reviewing authority under the Constitution to be increasingly vigilant to ensure observance with the rule of law and in this task the court must not flinch or falter It was further held that principle of reasonableness and non arbitrariness in governmental action is the core of our entire Constitutional scheme and structure The lease was given to respondent No upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances with the object of setting up an industry in the <ORG> of West Bengal which was likely to generate employment to more than persons and earn foreign exchange worth more than Rs crores Under the circumstances we do not find any ground to interfere with the impugned judgments or the action of the JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ respondent State in granting the lease to respondent No JJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJJ The appeal is accordingly dismissed but without any order as to costs
