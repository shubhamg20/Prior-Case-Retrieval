This is an appeal from a judgment of <ORG> dismissing an appeal from the full bench of <ORG> at Lahore whose decision had been in favour of the respondents The action was commenced by the appellants as mortgagees claiming a declaration that they were mortgagees in possession of certain lands therein specified and that the defendants were not entitled to redeem without payment of the mortgage debt due under the mortgage deeds and also an injunction to restrain the defendants as mortgagors from prosecuting their petition for redemption of the lands in <ORG> under the Punjab Act IV of hereinafter called the impugned Act and for restitution of the lands under the provisions of the Act If the Collector finds that the mortgage is one to which this Act applies he shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment for the time being in force in cases where he finds that the value of the benefits enjoyed by the mortagagee while in possession equal or exceed twice the amount of the principal sum originally advanced under the mortgage order in writing a that the mortgage be extinguished and where the mortgagee is still in possession that the mortgagor be put into possession of the mortgaged land as against the mortgagee and that the title deeds if any be restored to the mortgagor If in cases to which this Act applies the Collector finds that the value of the benefits enjoyed by the mortgagee while in possession is less than twice the amount of the principal sum originally advanced and some payment is still due to the mortgagee according to the terms of the mortgage the Collector shall by order in writing and notwithstanding anything contained in any other enactment for the time being in force direct that the land be restored to the mortgagor and he be put into possession subject however to the payment of compensation by the mortgagor to the mortgagee at rates not exceeding the following scales i thirty times the land revenue assessed on the land at the time when it was mortgaged if the mortgagee has been in possession for a period exceeding thirty years but not exceeding forty years ii fifteen times the land revenue assessed on the land at the time when it was mortgaged if the mortgagee has been in possession for a period exceeding forty years but not exceeding fifty years iii five times the land revenue assessed on the land at the time when it was mortgaged if the mortgagee has been in possession for a period exceeding fifty years No civil court shall have jurisdiction to entertain any claim to enforce any right under a mortgage declared extinguished under this Act or to question the validity of any proceedings under this Act Notwithstanding anything in the two next succeeding sub sections <ORG> has and <ORG> has not power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to this Act hereinafter called the Federal Legislative List Notwithstanding anything in the next succeeding sub section <ORG> and subject to the preceding sub section <ORG> also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the said Schedule hereinafter called the Concurrent Legislative List Subject to the two preceding sub sections <ORG> has and <ORG> has not power to make laws for a Province or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the said Schedule hereinafter called the Provincial Legislative List <ORG> has power to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in the Provincial Legislative List except for a Province or any part thereof The item in the Provincial List which is directly relevant is No which is in these terms Land that is to say rights in or over land land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant and the collection of rents transfer alienation and devolution of agricultural land land improvement and agricultural loans colonisation Courts of Wards encumbered and attached estates treasure trove The precedence of the Concurrent List is defined by Section of the Constitution Act which provides that If any provision of a Provincial law is repugnant to any provision of an existing Indian law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent Legislative List then subject to the provisions of this section the existing Indian law shall prevail and the Provincial law shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void Existing Indian Law is defined by Section of the Constitution Act as meaning any law passed by any legislature in British India before the commencement of Part III of the Act which came into force on April Owing to the death of one of the appellants a change of parties had taken place in the appellants but that is not material Thus both parties rightly construed Section as having no application in a case where the <ORG> could show that it was acting wholly within its powers under the Provincial List and was not relying on any power conferred on it by the Concurrent List In such a case it is also clear that there is no room for the exercise by the Governor General of his reserved power under Section The land in each province may have its special characteristics in view of which it is necessary to legislate and there are local customs and traditions in regard to land holding and particular problems of provincial or local concern which require provincial consideration Rights in land must include general rights like full ownership or leasehold or all such rights But before that is done it may be observed that there is no express provision in the Constitution referring by name to mortgages though mortgages are of particular importance in India as subject of ordinary business life and of litigation and of legislation The impugned Act as already explained has the main purpose of giving relief to mortgagors by enabling them to obtain restitution of the mortgaged lands on terms less onerous than the mortgage deeds require It may have been mentioned ex abundanti cautela but in any case it is sufficiently allied to agriculture generally to be treated as a species of agricultural land or at least as land occupied or let for purposes subservient to agriculture and as such within the general scope of an Act dealing with agricultural land It follows that in their Lordships judgment there is not sufficient ground for holding that the impugned Act or any part of it was invalid As a whole it fell within the powers given to the Province by items and of List II without any necessity to invoke any powers from the Concurrent List List III Their Lordships will accordingly for the reasons given humbly advise His Majesty that the appeal should be dismissed
