He brought a suit praying for a mortgage decree in the usual form on February i within twelve years from July The Subordinate Judge of Lucknow in whose Court the suit was instituted held that it was out of time and this decision was affirmed on appeal first by the District Judge and then by <ORG> The appellant comes before the <ORG> upon special leave Then followed the clause upon which the defence was founded In case of default the said creditor shall at all times within and after the expiry of the stipulated period of six years aforesaid have the power to realise the entire mortgage money and the remaining interest and compound interest due to him in a lump sum through <ORG> by attachment and sale of the said mortgaged share as well as from my person and all other kind of my property both movable and immovable together with costs of <ORG> and I my heirs relations and representatives shall have no occasion for objection and refusal that the aforesaid rate of interest fixed by me shall stand within and after the stipulated period and after the decree till payment of the entire demand hereunder and that I shall at no time demand reduction in interest The mortgagor defaulted in the payment of interest for the first year and it was contended for the defendants that immediately upon this default the principal moneys became due within the meaning of the Article of the Indian Limitation Act set out above and consequently that the statutory period of twelve years had expired before the institution of the suit <ORG> following a majority decision of the Allahabad full bench in had more than once held that in such cases time ran against the mortgagee from the date of the first default and the judgments in the present case add little to the elucidation of this problem The Subordinate Judge thought it clear that the clause gave the mortgagee an option either to sue at once or to wait till the expiry of the mortgage term but he held himself concluded by authority on the question of limitation The District Judge thought there was no option and that the mortgagee was bound to sue In his opinion the right of the mortgagee to enforce payment on default made the principal money immediately payable within the meaning of a of the Transfer of Property Act and therefore entitled the mortgagor to redeem regardless of the six years term He thought the clause in question was clearly inserted for the benefit of the creditor and that it was at his option to treat the money as being immediately due or not He referred to previous Allahabad decisions which seem to support his argument and in particular to a dictum of this <ORG> in a case decided under the Indian Limitation Act XIV of which will be noted presently Their Lordships think that if under a clause of this nature the principal money becomes due within the meaning of Article immediately upon default by the mortgagor in payment of interest or of any instalment it must equally become due upon the breach of any other condition to which a similar provision is attached a case falling under Act XIV of a similar argument was put forward for the appellant to that which has prevailed in <ORG> and Allahabad though it was based upon the application of a six years pariod of limitation The decision was against the appellant on the ground that the period was twelve years and not six But Sir <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the Board after expressing himself to this effect continued Their Lordships must not be supposed in coming to this decision to give any countenance to the argument of Mr <NAME> for the appellant that this suit would have been barred if the limitation of six years under clause had been applicable to it They think upon the construction of this bond there would be good reason for holding that the cause of action arose within six years before the commencement of the suit In this case <ORG> had following the decision in <NAME> case dismissed a mortgagees suit as out of time It not having been brought within twelve years of the mortgagor default in payment of an instalment which gave the mortgagees the right as in the present case without waiting for the expiry of the stipulated period to enforce their security The decision also apparently proceeds upon the view that the words of the English Limitation Act and the English decisions thereon apply without question to the words of Article of schedule to the Indian Act a conclusion which as it seems to their Lordships may involve and on the critical point when applied to such a proviso as the present a large assumption Their Lord ships would be reluctant however to pronounoe on either question in the absence of full argument and it is accordingly a satisfaction to thorn to find that the present case in which they have had no assistance from the respondents can as they think regardless of the general question be decided on its own special circumstances which apparently <ORG> was not concerned to note It is no doubt true that the question now before the <ORG> was advisedly left open for future discussion but the considerations referred to by Lord <NAME> are of great weight and it is difficult to find an answer to them Under these circumstances it is a matter of great regret to their Lordships that they should now have to pronounce upon these important and difficult questions without the assistance of counsel for the respondents But the case has been placed before them very fully and with conspicuous fairness by Mr <NAME> who appeared for the appellant and they have given their most anxious consideration to all the judgments which have been referred to There can be no doubt that as pointed out by Lord <NAME> a proviso of this nature is inserted in a mortgage deed exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagees and that it purports to give them an option either to enforce their security at once or if the security is ample to stand by their investment for the full term of the mortgage If on the default of the mortgagor in other words by the breach of his contract the mortgage money becomes immediately due it is clear that the intention of the parties is defeated and that what was agreed to by them as an option in the mortgagees is in effect converted into an option in the mortgagor For if the latter after the deed has been duly executed and registered finds that he can make a better bargain elsewhere he has only to break his contract by refusing to pay the interest and instanti as Lord <NAME> says he is entitled to redeem If the principal money is due and the stipulated term has gone out of the contract it follows in their Lordships opinion that the mortgagor can claim to repay it as was recognised by <NAME> in his judgment in <ORG> They are not prepared to hold that the mortgagor could in this way take advantage of his own default they do not think that upon such default he would have the right to redeem and in their opinion the mortgage money does not become due within the meaning of Article of the Indian Limitation Act until both the mortgagor right to redeem and the mortgagee right to enforce his security have accrued This would of course also be the position if the mortgagee exercised the option reserved to him Their Lordships are not greatly oppressed by the authority of <NAME> <NAME> supra It is they think always dangerous to apply English decisions to the construction of an Indian Act The clause there under consideration differed widely from that now before their Lordships and indeed from the clauses with which <ORG> had to deal the question for decision would have fallen in India not under Article but under Article which is in very special terms and a of the statute of James with which the <ORG> was concerned made the time to run not from the date when the money became due but from the date when the cause of action arose If in the Indian cases the question were When did the mortgagee cause of action arise i when did he first become entitled to sue for the relief claimed by his suit their Lordships think that there might be much to be said in support of the Allahabad decisions Judged by the Indian criterion when the money sued for became due upon the best consideration their Lordships have been able to give to this difficult question they think that the decision of the Chief <ORG> of Oudh was wrong and that they should have held that the appellant suit was within time For these reasons their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that this appeal should be allowed that the decrees of all the <ORG> should be set aside and that the suit should be remitted to <ORG> for trial of the other issues which have not been decided The respondents Nos must pay the costs of the appellant in both <ORG> and <ORG> and before this <ORG>
