The Superintendent of <ORG> issued show cause notice to the appellants for recovery of short levy of duty relating to the period from th March to st March stating that there was less determination of the assessable value of pumps due to non inclusion of <ORG> duty paid on electric motors used in the manufacture of pumps and that there was deduction of irregular trade discount on wholesale cash price while determining the assessable value of the articles in question The Assistant Collector directed the appellant to pay the duties short levied holding that the excise duty paid by the appellant on electric motors fitted to the pumps could not be deducted while computing the assessable value of the pump sets for purposes of assessment and that the wholesale cash price minus the trade discount which is uniformly given to all wholesale dealers would represent the assessable value for assessment purposes Against the orders of the Assistant Collector the appellant preferred an appeal before the Appellate Collector who allowed the appeal and quashed the demand notice holding i that the assessable value of the pumps had to be arrived at after deduction from the wholesale cash price of the excise duty payable not only on the pumps which are manufactured but also the excise duty paid on the electric motors which were used as a component of the pumps and ii that in determining the assessable value of the PD pumps a discount of per cent declared by the appellant and allowed to wholesale dealers was liable to be deducted from the wholesale cash price of the pumps under the provisions of the section of the <ORG>s and Salt Act In exercise of the powers conferred on it under section of the Act <ORG> suo moto issued a show cause notice dated st June to the appellant proposing to set aside the order of the Appellate Collector and restore the orders of the Assistant Collector stating that the Appellate Collector has erred in his decision The appellant filed its reply to the notice and also made its submissions during the course of personal hearing The appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging <ORG> order contending that <ORG> erred in setting aside the order of the Appellate Collector and in restoring the orders of the Assistant Collector In appeal to this <ORG> it was contended on behalf on the appellant that while computing the assessable value the duty paid on electric motors for purposes of manufacturing monoblock pumps was also liable to be excluded that <ORG> ignored the Notification No CE dated as amended by Notification No dated and that besides the depots of the appellant there are other five independent wholesalers and <ORG> should not have ignored the trade discount allowed to them The Judgment of the Court was delivered by YOGESHWAR DAYAL This Civil Appeal arises from the order dated th November passed by <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh High Court in proceedings under Article of Constitution of India The proceedings under Article of the Constitution were directed against an order dated th January passed by <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred upon them under Section of the Central Excises and Salt Act hereinafter called the Act The appellate Collector by the aforesaid order had accepted various appeals filed by <ORG> appellant before us against various order passed by the Assistant Collector <ORG> Indore With regard to the question of trade discount the Assistant Collector held that in terms of explanation to Section of the Act deduction in respect of trade discount on wholesale cash price of the articles to be removed from the factory has to be allowed the trade discount allowed has to be at uniform rate as held by <ORG> once the wholesale price is fixed and the quantum of trade discount is decided it must be given uniformly to all wholesalers irrespective of their relations with the manufacturers The Assistant Collector held that the wholesale cash price minus the trade discount which is uniformly given to all wholesale dealers would represent the assessable value for assessment purposes Aggrieved by the orders of the Assistant Collector the appellant preferred an appeal before the Appellate Collector who held that the assessable value of the pumps had to be arrived at after deduction from the wholesale cash price of the excise duty payable not only on the pumps which are manufactured but also the excise duty paid on the electric motors which were used as a component of the pumps While allowing the appeals the Appellate Collector dealing with the deduction of trade discount observed as follows With regard to the second issue i admissibility of trade discount of declared by the appellants and approved by the jurisdictional <ORG> officer it was contended by the appellants that according to the pattern of their sale they had appointed area dealers for sales of their products over a particular area It was also noticed that some sales were also made in small lots by the appellants to the dealers falling outside the jurisdiction of the area dealers It was explained that in view of the fact that such dealers did not have the facility and the technical know how for providing after sale service the discount allowed to them was lesser than that allowed to the dealers wholesale dealers who were required to afford the services after sales emphasis supplied When this order came to the notice of <ORG> <ORG> suo moto issued show cause notice to the appellant proposing to set aside the order of the Appellate Collector which appeared to it to be not correct in law and restore the order passed by the Assistant Collector of Central Excise Indore It appears to <ORG> that the deduction contemplated therein is in respect of the duty leviable on the article which is being cleared from the factory and not the duty paid or leviable on the raw materials or component which went into the manufacture of that excisable article Further the Appellate Collector also failed to take note of the fact that the so called area dealers in a large number of cases were no other than the party own selling depots and the price charged to them could not prima facie be accepted as genuine unless there was compelling evidence to establish that the transaction was at arm length It accordingly appears to <ORG> that the wholesale cash price charged to the independent dealers and discount given to them is along a genuine wholesale cash price and that the genuine whole sale cash price is ascertainable the quantum of sale however meagre is irrelevant The appellant filed a reply dated th August and inter alia contended We deal with these two points separately as below i ASSESSABLE VALUE OF MONOBLOCK PUMPS At the outright we wish to state that the grounds of appeal advanced against the various orders in appeal issued by the Assistant Collector <ORG> Indore before Appellate Collector <ORG> and Customs New Delhi will form part of our reply and we would rely on them We presume that the records of the case are already with you and there is no need of reproduce here our arguments That is why we have to recover the total amount including the cost and Central Excise duty paid on the Raw Material so that the Central Excise duty paid on them will automatically be recovered If the duty is ascertainable there is no reason as to why it should be go into the cost necessarily There is no law to warrant such a procedure This would tantamount depriving us of our right to recover the full amount of Central Excise duty paid by us We presume that the records of the case are already with you and there is no need to reproduce there our arguments However without prejudice to whatever stated in above referred appeal memos we would like to state as follows ii A It is contended in the Show Cause Notice that the wholesale cash price charged to the independent dealers and the discount given to them is alone a genuine wholesale cash price and that once the wholesale cash price is ascertainable the quantum of the sale however meagre is irrelevant Unless there was compelling evidence to establish that the transaction was at arms length The facts that there are independent dealers alongwith depots goes to prove that no special treatment is accorded to the depots The sales to independent dealers may not be treated as retail sales but there is no reason as to why the price charged to these few so called independent dealers should be preferred to the price charged to independent area dealers ii The section also makes it clear that the excise is levied only on the amount representing the manufacturing cost plus the manufacturing profit and the excludes post manufacturing costs and the profit arising from the post manufacturing operation Under these circumstance there are no reason to reopen the matter and given an adverse decision It is noticed in the order of <ORG> that During the course of personal hearing on various contentions were reiterated and it was emphasised that the manufacturers had two patterns of sales namely i through area distributors who are given exclusive rights of sale within their respective areas and who were further authorised to appoint sub distributors and ii some sales were to other dealers to whom a less percentage of discount was given It was pointed out to them during the course of personal hearing that majority of the so called area distributors were depots of <ORG> only <ORG> after considering the points raised by the appellant in its written reply to the show cause notice as well as points urged during the course of personal hearing took the view that under Section of the Act the abatement of duty is admissible only in respect of the article in question and not the duty paid on the raw material or the component which had gone into its manufacture and accordingly held that the view of the Appellate Collector is incorrect In this view of the matter <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred in it under sub section of Section of the Act set aside the impugned order passed by the Appellate Collector and restored all the orders passed by the Assistant Collector of Central Excise It was contended on behalf of appellant before <ORG> that <ORG> erred in holding that the duty paid on the electric motors was not deductible in computing the wholesale cash price under the provisions of Section of the Act It was urged before <ORG> that the excise duty paid on the component parts could not be treated as manufacturing cost and that it was not competent for the Government to levy excise duty on excise duty paid In view of our conclusion on the first point itself no useful purpose would be served in examining the second question as the appellant himself had given the reasons before <ORG> as to why they gave higher trade discount to their depots and other area distributors We may take point Nos and together <NAME> as His Lordship then was speaking for the Court observed The activity carried out by the appellant of assembling the three components of the weighbridge brings into being complete weighbridge which has a distinctive name character or use But if the end product is a separate product which comes into being as a result of the endeavour and activity of the appellant then the appellant must be held to have manufactured the said item Section a of the Act read with its explanation reads as under Determination of value for the purposes of duty Where under this Act any article is chargeable with duty at a rate dependent on the value of the article such value shall be deemed to be a the wholesale cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from the factory or any other premises of manufacture of production or if a wholesale market does not exist for such article at such place at the nearest place where such market exists or The relevant part of the Notification No CE dated as amended by Notification No dated reads as follows In exercise of the powers conferred by rule of the Central Excise Rules <ORG> hereby exempts power driven pumps falling under tariff item no a of the first schedule to the Central Excise and Salt Act and specified in column of the table annexed hereto from so much of duty of the excise leviable thereon as in excess of the duty specified in the corresponding entry in column of the said table There is thus no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed with costs
