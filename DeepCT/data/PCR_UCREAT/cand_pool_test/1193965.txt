HEADNOTE Under the powers conferred by of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act <ORG> issued a notification on August placing a ban on the importation of gold except with the permission of <ORG> Section A of the Act which was introduced by an amendment in provided that shall be deemed to have been imposed under of the Sea <ORG> Act and all the provisions of the Act shall have effect accordingly Section of the Sea <ORG> Act enabled <ORG> by notification to prohibit or restrict the bringing goods of any specified description into India and by reason of other provisions of that Act goods imported in contravention of the notification issued under were liable to confiscation In the Sea <ORG> Act was amended by the introduction of A in that Act which provided inter alia that where goods were seized under that Act in the reasonable belief that they were smuggled goods the burden of proving that they were not smuggled goods shall be on the person from whose possession the goods were seized Thereafter the Collector of <ORG> being prima facie of the view that the gold seized had been smuggled issued notice to the respondent to show cause why the said gold should not be confiscated that the object of A was the prevention and eradication of smuggling inter alia of gold which was widely prevalent and in view of the fact that without a Law in that form and with that amplitude smuggling might not be possible of being effectively checked the restrictions imposed by that section being in the interests of the general public could not be held to be violative of the rights guaranteed by Art that the wording of A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act showed that the reference in it to of the Sea <ORG> Act was merely for rendering notifications under the named provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act to operate as notifications under the Sea <ORG> Act and that it could not have the effect of incorporating the relevant provisions of the latter Act in the Act of and that consequently when a notification issued under of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act was deemed for ail purposes to be a notification issued under of the Sea <ORG> Act the contravention of the notification attracted to it each and every provision of the Sea <ORG> Act which was in force at the date of the notification Every notification issued under Sub section shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be after it is issued It is the constitutional validity of this section that is the common point which arises in these several cases which have been heard together We have heard on the merits only Civil Appeals to of and the other cases were posted before us in order that Counsel appearing for the parties in them We shall therefore refer only to the fact of Civil Appeals to of in dealing with these petitions The facts giving rise to these appeals are briefly as follows On the morning of June one <NAME> an employee of the respondent alighted at the Central station in Madras from <ORG> Enquiries were made to verify the story narrated by <NAME> as to the source from which he obtained the gold and thereafter the Collector of <ORG> being prima facie of the view that the gold seized had been smuggled issued notice to the respondent to show cause why the said gold should not be confiscated The respondent thereupon filed a petition Writ Petition of under Art of the Constitution before <ORG> for the issue of a writ of certiorari or other appropriate writ for quashing the order of the Collector of <ORG> on various grounds to which we shall advert later including the constitutional validity of a A While this writ petition was pending the respondent filed another petition Writ Petition of for a writ of mandamus directing the Collector to return the gold seized and confiscated by him Besides the learned Judges were also of the view that A of the Sea <ORG> Act could not be invoked in adjudicating a contravention of a notification under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act which imposed restrictions on the import of gold Though on these conclusions the order of the Collector confiscating the gold was set aside the learned Judges held that the respondent was not entitled to an order for the return of the gold but only to a direction to the Collector to hear and determine the question about the gold seized being smuggled gold without reference to the rule as to onus of proof enacted by A The appellant the Collector of <ORG> Madras obtained leave from <ORG> under Arts and of the Constitution to appeal to this <ORG> against the orders in writ petition No of and No of Civil Appeals and and a similar order was passed in an application for a certificate by the respondent who felt aggrieved by the refusal of the <ORG> in Writ petition No of to direct an immediate return of the gold seized Civil Appeal We shall first take up for consideration Civil Appeals and of filed by the Collector of <ORG> because unless those appeals fail there would be no need to decide the relief to which the respondent would be entitled in Civil Appeal of In order to appreciate the contentions raised it would be necessary to set out the statutory provisions which form the background of the impugned provision A of the Sea <ORG> Act The Central Government may by notification in the official Gazette order that subject to such exemptions if any as may be contained in the notification no person shall except with the general or special permission of <ORG> and on payment of the fee if any prescribed bring or send into India any gold or silver or any currency notes or bank notes or coin whether Indian or foreign Explanation These provisions have to be read in conjunction with the provisions of the Sea Customs Act which form as it were integrated provisions in relation to the import and export of among other commodities gold and A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act which was introduced by an amendment of effects this co ordination Without prejudice to the provisions of section or to any other provision contained in this Act the restrictions imposed by sub sections and of section subsection of section and clause a of sub sec tion of section shall be deemed to have been imposed under section of the Sea Customs Act and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect The offenses mentioned in the first column of the following schedule shall be punishable to the extent mentioned in the third column of the same with reference to such offenses respectively Section of this Act to Offenses which off Penalties ence has re ference The other provisions which have a bearing upon the points arising for discussion with reference to the validity of the impugned A of the Sea Customs Act are This notification was superseded and replaced by a fresh one dated August also issued under the powers conferred by sub of of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and this is the notification which continues in force up to this date and which is relevant to the proceedings against the respondent In exercise of the powers conferred by sub of of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act Act of and in supersession of the notification of <ORG> in the late <ORG> No FI dated the th March <ORG> is pleased to direct that except with the general or special permission of <ORG> no person shall bring or send into India from any place outside India a any gold coin gold bullion gold sheets or gold ingot whether refined or not or any silver bullion It would be noticed that on the law as it stood upto before A was inserted in the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act the importation of gold in contravention of the notification of August issued under of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act would have been an importation contrary to of the Sea <ORG> Act with the result that any person concerned in the act of importation would have been liable to the penalties specified in the third column of and the imported gold would have been liable to confiscation under the opening words of that column It is only necessary to add that gold was not the only commodity which gave rise to this problem As the question of the constitutionality of A has been the subject of elaborate consideration in a few decided cases to which reference was made during the arguments The validity of the confiscation was challenged before this Court on the ground that It has been urged by the learned Solicitor General for the appellant that the points regarding the constitutional validity of A raised in the present appeal are concluded in his favour by this judgment We shall therefore have to examine the exact scone of this decision in detail which we shall do later but for the present it is sufficient to state that the case dealt mainly with an objection based on a violation of Art We shall now proceed to deal with the points Urged by learned Counsel for the respondent in support of his plea that the impugned provision violates the fundamental right to hold property under Art and the right to carry on trade or business under Art the learned Judges also upheld two further contentions urged on behalf of the respondent in support of their petition that A was not attracted to the determination of a question raised in relation to the confiscation of an article imported in contravention of a notification under of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act that A required as a pre condition of its applicability that the goods which were the subject of adjudication must have been seized in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods and that in the instant case the <ORG> Officer effecting the seizure did not or could not entertain such a belief We consider it Would be convenient if we deal with these two points after examining the constitutional validity of A Nevertheless there are some passages in this judgment which would be immediately referred to on which reliance was placed by the learned Solicitor General in support of his contention that this judgment is an authority for the position not merely that A does not violate Art if not expressly decides that the restriction imposed by it on the right to hold property or to engage in the business of dealing in gold was a reasonable restriction within Art We will quote these passages in order to examine whether this contention is made out expressing the opinion that the petition did not show in what manner there had been a violation of that Article and the judgment continues But Mr <NAME> argues that the burden of proof enunciated therein is opposed to fundamental principles of natural justice as it gives an unrestricted arbitrary and naked power to the customs authorities without lay ing down any standard or norm to be followed for exercising powers under the section It is a heavy burden to be laid upon the shoulders of an innocent purchaser who might have come into possession after the article has changed many hands and this it is alleged invokes discrimination between him and other litigants and deprives him of the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Art only to those goods of the specified kind which have been seized under the Act and in the reasonable belief that they are smuggled goods It is only those goods which answer the threefold description that come under the operation of the section The differentia on the basis of which the goods have been classified and the presumption raised by the section obviously have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act The impugned section cannot be struck down on the infirmity either of discrimination or illegal classification <NAME> We cannot accept the further submission either that even if this <ORG> did not in terms consider the validity of A with reference to Art still the reasoning by which it rejected the contention that it violated Art No doubt there are situations when the points regarding a violation of Art and an objection that a restriction is not reasonable so as to conform to the requirements of Art Such for instance are cases when the denial of equality before the law is based on the ground that the power vested say in an administrative authority to affect rights guaranteed to a citizen is arbitrary being unguided or uncanalised The vesting of such a power would also amount to the imposition of an unreasonable restriction on the exercise of the guaranteed right to trade or carry on a business etc We have already set out what one might term the historical background and the surrounding circumstances which necessitated the enactment of this provision In this connection reference may be made to the observations by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> the learned <NAME> said The onus is put on the defendant when there is a dispute in the proceedings whether duty has been paid or whether the goods were lawfully imported If for instance it is found that he has dealt in prohibited goods if he can show that he acquired them in the ordinary course of business obviously he would not be guilty of dealing in them with intent to avoid the prohibition Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the respondent explained to us the special features attaching to gold as a commodity and as a store of value and of the difficulties if not impossibility of identifying one piece of gold from another in the absence of a requirement of marking and basing himself on this factual position submitted six grounds in support of his contention that the restriction imposed by A was unreasonable and we shall deal with these points in the same order Section A no doubt on its face purports to be a rule of evidence but in reality is not so basic facts which would indicate the smuggled character of the Gold seized but from the mere belief of the seizing officer that the gold seized was smuggled It was said on the other side that the requirement in A that the officer seizing the gold must entertain a reasonable belief that the gold was smuggled provided an adequate safeguard to the person affected which would render the restriction imposed reasonable within cls Even if on the other hand the test is objective in the sense that at the stage of the adjudication under the grounds upon which the belief was entertained could be the subject matter of enquiry it furnishes no safeguard either because the reasonableness of the belief regarding the smuggled character of the gold would have to be judged by the adjudicating officer with reference to the information which the seizing officer had at the moment of seizure and that information must necessarily have been obtained behind the back of the person from whom the gold had been seized and before the officer commenced any enquiry to ascertain the truth or otherwise of the information conveyed to him There is no reasonable or rational connection between the fact to be proved viz There is therefore no adequate basis on which the provision could be sustained as a rule of evidence The operation of A is not restricted in point of time or to persons actually suspected to be connected with the import but extends also to persons who are able to establish bona fide acquisition of gold but who are unable to prove how the person from whom they acquired obtained the gold they sold The section therefore practically prohibits all holding of gold or trade in gold and subjects the holding of and the trade in gold to the penalty of confiscation indigenous gold has been produced in mines in India both before and after and there is nothing to differentiate this from imported gold it is a commodity which frequently changes hands because of regular trade and widespread use as ornaments etc We shall deal with each of these points and examine them in the light of the submissions made by the learned Solicitor General in answer The point raised is that there is no rational connection between the fact from which the statute raises the presumption and the fact which has to be proved in order that the goods might be the subject of confiscation The argument is that the fact from which the presumption is drawn is the reasonable belief of the officer effecting the seizure that the article seized is smuggled while the fact which by the terms of the statute it is held to prove is that the gold seized is smuggled with the result that the practical effect of the provision is that there is a statutory direction to the adjudicating officer to treat the gold as smuggled so as to entitle him to confiscate the same It is only if learned Counsel for the respondent is right that the effect of the section is as above that the several decisions of <ORG> to which he invited our attention could have any application Learned Counsel relied particularly on the decisions in <NAME> State of Alabama and <NAME> State of Georgia State legislation that proof of one fact or group of facts shall constitute prima facie evidence of the main or ultimate fact in issue does not constitute a denial of due process of law if there is a rational connection between what is proof and what is to be inferred and the presumption is not un reasonable and is not made conclusive of the rights of the person against whom it is raised In regard to the American decisions of which only a few were cited including those just now get out the principle underlying them is to be found summarized in <NAME> Constitutional Law at where the learned author says The power of a legislature to prescribe the rules of evidence is universally recognised but it is equally well established that due process limits it in this matter It may establish rebuttable presumptions only if there is a rational connection between what is proved and what is permitted to be inferred therefrom might in great part coincide with that for judging of due process it must not be assumed that these are identical for it has to be borne in mind that the Constitution framers deliberately avoided in this context the use of the expression due process with its comprehensiveness flexibility and attendant vagueness in favour of a somewhat more definite word reasonable and caution has therefore to be exercised before the literal application of American decisions Pausing here we might mention that two matters might be urged as flowing from or as the necessary result of the impugned provision that even a bona fide possessor of the goods might be deprived of his property notwithstanding that there was no basis even for a suspicion that he was a party to the smuggling or had any knowledge that the goods in his possession were smuggled goods and that the burden cast on the possessor to prove the negative namely that the gold was not smuggled cast an impossible burden upon the person from whom the goods are seized as it virtually amounts to a confiscation by the law without any reasonable proof before a quasi judicial authority that the gold was smuggled To this last the sixth point we shall advert in its proper place but what we are concerned to point out at this stage is that apart from the point about the impossibility of discharging the onus of proof cast by the section there is little basis for the argument that there is lack of any rational connection between the facts giving rise to the presumption and the fact presumed and to this we shall now proceed This question about the lack of rational connection may be considered from two points of view If in a prosecution for dealing in smuggled goods the onus could with constitutional propriety be cast upon the accused to prove that the goods were not smuggled it is difficult to see any reasonable basis for the contention that where the offence charged against a person is not dealing in but possession of smuggled goods there is a constitutional bar on the burden being so laid As we shall have occasion to point out All It appears to us therefore that the argument regarding the lack of rational connection has no substance The second of the grounds urged by learned Counsel was that the requirement of A that the belief of the officer seizing the goods should rest of reasonable grounds provided no safeguard to the citizen as the seizing officer who acts administratively entertains the belief on unproved information gathered from sources which most often are not and in practice will not be possible to be disclosed to the party affected It has also to be added that at the stage of appeal or revision from the orders of the officer adjudging confiscation under of the Act each successive appellate or Revisional authority has also to address itself to this requirement It would be seen that this is really the argument upon which the sixth of the points urged by learned Counsel rests and therefore it will be convenient to examine the soundness of the contention and the answers which have been made on the other side after dealing with point No It is only in those cases where reasonable suspicion exists that the gold in the possession of a person has come into the country by illicit means that there is power in an officer to affect the seizure and in most of the cases the innocent possessor would be in a position to discharge the onus It is therefore in cases where a person is unable to prove how he got into possession of the gold found with him or where his explanations are found to be false or unacceptable that in the large majority of cases the section would normally be invoked Besides these it would be applied also in cases where a person is able to prove that his acquisition was bona fide but that the persons from whom he acquired or one higher up in the series of prior owners is unable to explain satisfactorily his possession and it is only in these marginal or extreme cases that the onus created by the section might be contended to be harsh and unreasonable Commenting on a passage in the judgement of <ORG> which stated If such powers are capable of being exercised reasonably it is impossible to say that they may not also be exercised unreasonably and treating this as a ground for holding the statute invalid Viscount <NAME> observed in <ORG> <ORG> It appears to me that the short answer to this contention and I hope its shortness will not be regarded as disrespect is that the validity of a measure is not to be determined by its application to particular cases If it is not so exercised i if the powers are abused it is open to challenge and there is no need for express provision for its challenge in the statute If so judged it passes the test of reasonableness possibility of the powers conferred being improperly used is no ground for pronouncing the law itself invalid and similarly if the law properly interpreted and tested in the light of the requirements set out in Part III of the Constitution does not pass the test it cannot be pronounced valid merely because it is administered in a manner which might not conflict with the constitutional requirements Is such a law a reasonable restriction on the right to hold property or on the right to carry on business within cls This analysis would show that the provisions of the section are constitutionally valid in the sense of being reasonable restrictions on the right to hold property or to carry on trade or business in the large percentage of cases to which the section would apply and The learned Chief Justice said at of the Report It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness wherever prescribed should be applied to each individual statute impugned and no abstract standard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases a balancing of the need for individual liberty in the matter inter alia of the right to hold property or of the right to trade with the need for social control in order that the freedoms guaranteed to the individual subserve the larger needs moral social economic and political of the community and thus ensure orderly prog ress towards the goal indicated by the preamble In this connection he drew our attention to the Report of the Taxation Enquiry Commission which pointed out the factual position regarding the existence of widespread smuggling in certain commodities including inter alia gold The extent of the leakage of revenue that takes place through this process cannot be estimated even roughly but we understand it is not unlikely that it is substantial But is the social good to be achieved by the legislation so disproportionately small that on balance it could be said that it has proceeded beyond the limits of reasonableness We would answer this in the negative We would only add that there is authority for the position that acts innocent in themselves may be prohibited and the restrictions in that regard would be reasonable if the same were necessary to secure the efficient enforcement of valid provisions enactment stood in with the result that any subsequent amendments to the Sea Customs Act did not and could not affect modify or enlarge the scope of the incorporated Sea Customs Act which had become part of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act Where any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of this Act repeals any enactment by which the text of any Central Act or Regulation was amended by the express omission insertion or substitution of any matter then unless a different intention appears the repeal shall not affect the continuance of any such amendment made by the enactment so repealed and in operation at the time of such repeal of the Sea Customs Act and A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act there is no scope for any argument that there The Central Government may by notification in the Official Gazette order that subject to such exemptions if any as may be contained in the notification no person shall except with the general or special permission of <ORG> and on payment of the fee if any prescribed bring or send into India any gold or silver or any currency notes or bank notes or coin whether Indian or foreign In this situation A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act enacts the restrictions imposed by sub section of section shall be deemed to have been imposed under section of the Sea Customs Act and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly The effect therefore of A is to treat the text of the notification by <ORG> under as if it had been issued under of the Sea Customs Act with the title and the recital of the source of power appropriate to it by the creation of a legal fiction A comparison of the formulae with the text of A shows that the reference in it to of the Sea Customs Act is merely for rendering notifications under the named provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulations Act to operate as notifications under the Sea Customs Act and that it cannot have the effect of incorporating the relevant provisions of the earlier Act into the Act of so as to attract the rule formulated by <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> already quoted dealing with the acquisition of Land for the purposes designated by it made provision for the acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act and the provisions of the Land Act Acquisition were subjected to numerous modifications which were set out in the Schedule so that in effect the Local Act was held to be the enactment of a Special Law for the acquisition of land for the special purpose It was in the context of these and several other provisions which pointed to the absorption of certain of the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act into the Local Act with vital modifications that their Lordships stated But their Lordships think that there are other and perhaps more cogent objections to this contention of the Secretary of <ORG> and their Lordships are not prepared to hold that the sub section in question which was not enacted till can be regarded as incorpo rated in the Local Act of Nor again does Act XIX of contain any provision that the amendments enacted by it are to be treated as in any way retrospective or are to be regarded as affecting any other enactment than the Land Acquisition Act itself We consider that there is no analogy between the provisions held to be incorporated in the Calcutta Improvement Trust Act dealt with by <ORG> and A of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act now under discussion It has also to be noticed that <NAME> had in his possession admittedly no receipt of any kind for the purchase of the gold further he had on him the letter addressed by the first respondent to <ORG> Bullion merchants Bombay intimating that cash to the extent of rupees one lakh was being sent through the representative which obviously could not possibly remain in the possession of <NAME> if has story about his taking cash to that addressee and the purchase of the gold from him were true There are two views possible of the exact import of this note by the <ORG> Inspector that it was a detention preliminary to a seizure which would be effected after the further investigation and that which found favour with the learned Judge of <ORG> that it was itself the seizure In support of the first of the above constructions attention may be drawn to the fact that the events narrated earlier took place before clock in the morning and that immediately thereafter <NAME> was taken to the <ORG> House and was examined there at about and in the course of his examination he made several statements which were obviously incorrect and whose error was capable of being detected then and there for he said I cannot account for the presence of this letter on me which should have been given to the firm in Bombay There was ample material at that stage on the basis of which it could be said that a reasonable belief could be entertained that the gold seized was smuggled In the present case the quantity of gold in the possession of <NAME> of the value of over one lakh of rupees was certainly a very relevant factor to be taken into account and which could be considered in judging the matter <NAME> and Co which admittedly had a bearing upon the purchase of gold in the possession of <NAME> necessarily drew an amount of suspicion on the theory of a bona fide purchase We accordingly allow appeals and with costs throughout one set of hearing fees the writ petitions filed by the respondent being directed to be dismissed In view of our decision in appeals and the points raised by the respondent in appeal of do not require to be decided
