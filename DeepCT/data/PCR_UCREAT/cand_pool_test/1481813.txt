A few facts are necessary for the purpose of disposing of this appeal It is also the case of the prosecution that although <NAME> cried the noise of her cries were suppressed by someone In <NAME> family by putting on loudly a radio or television set and that the neighbours and outsiders whose attention was attracted by the cries of <NAME> were prevented from entering the residence as the doors were shut It was also alleged by the prosecution that there was deliberate delay in taking <NAME> to the Geeta Nursing home where she died and that she was deliberately taken to Geeta Nursing Home where adequate facilities for treatment of burn injuries were not avail able instead of the Badshah Khan Hospital which is also known as the Civil Hospital where better treatment for burn injuries was available as known to the Appellants It was submitted by Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the Appellants that there is no evidence to establish that the deceased <NAME> committed suicide It was further submitted by learned Counsel that as far as the demands for dowry articles are concerned the evidence of witnesses is full of inconsistencies regarding the precise nature of the demands and the articles demanded and it was not possible to come to a conclusion of harassment to <NAME> on the basis of this evidence with the degree of certainly required in the criminal trial We propose to discuss first the validity of conviction under Section of the Indian Penal Code because that is the more serious offence alleged against <NAME> and <NAME> A plain reading of this provision shows that before a person can be convicted of abetting the suicide of any other person it must be established that such other person committed suicide We may mention here that commission of dowry death is now punishable under Section of the Indian Penal Code and certain presumptions are prescribed under Sub section of that section but it is pointed out to us that that section was not enacted at the time when the incident in question took place and hence can have no application to the case before us In this regard it is pointed out by Mr <NAME> that in the present case there is no such clear piece of evidence like a suicide note or statement had been made by <NAME> after the incident to the effect that she had taken her own life or set herself on fire Further there is no evidence that her clothes gave out a smell of kerosene which would indicate of suicide As far as the question of improbability of sustaining burns accidentally from the stove lighted for preparing tea is concerned evidence was led by the prosecution to show that the stove was placed on the raised slab which would make it unlikely that burns were caused to <NAME> by accident The evidence of the Investigating Officer <NAME> undoubtedly is to the effect that when he went to the residence of <NAME> for the first time for investigation the stove was lying on the slab The next circumstance sought to be relied upon by the prosecution to establish the case of suicide was that there was deliberate delay in taking <NAME> to a Hospital or <ORG> It was urged by the prosecution that although the accident occurred at about a it was only one and a half hours later that <NAME> was taken to the <ORG> and this would show that <NAME> committed suicide as a result of the harassment and instigation of <NAME> and <NAME> and his relatives and that delay was made in taking her to hospital so that she might become unconscious and unable to make any statement and further so that the chances of her recovery might be diminished or rendered nugatory In this regard again there is no satisfactory evidence Dr <NAME> a Private Practitioner has deposed that on June <NAME> came to his house in Old Faridabad in the morning at about a or a and told him that his daughter in law has received some burns on account of catching fire from the stove and desired that Dr <NAME> should accompany him to his residence for treatment In view of this evidence it is not possible to come to a conclusion with the degree of certainty required in a criminal trial that there was any deliberate delay in taking <NAME> to the hospital The result therefore is that there is no satisfactory evidence on the basis of which a conclusion could be reached with any reasonable certainty that <NAME> committed suicide and the conviction of <NAME> and <NAME> under Section of the Indian Penal Code must be set aside Coming next to conviction under Section A of the Indian Penal Code a reading of the said section shows that whoever being the husband or relative of the husband of a woman subjects such woman to cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine In the present case as pointed out by the learned Additional Sessions Judge as well as the learned Judge of <ORG> there is an ample evidence that repeated demands were made inter alia by <NAME> and <NAME> on <NAME> her parents and her brother <NAME> for articles of dowry and money There is also evidence that <NAME> made statements after her marriage and right up to the time when she died that she and her parents were being harassed by <NAME> <NAME> and his family members for various dowry articles and also for money As pointed out by Mr <NAME> that there are some inconsistencies regarding the precise nature of the articles demanded but we are of the view that these inconsistencies are of little importance considering the volume of evidence showing that repeated demands were made for various articles of dowry and money on <NAME> and her parents There is also substantial evidence to show that an amount of Rs We therefore agree with the conclusion reached by the Additional Sessions Judge and confirmed by <ORG> in this connection and confirm the conviction and sentence imposed on <NAME> and <NAME> under Section A of the Indian Penal Code
