There is no doubt that while at <NAME> he was very ill and ultimately his recovery was considered hopeless He said that many other persons were present when he signed the will but he did not know whether any other witness or the testator had signed when he did The Subordinate Judge declined to believe this witness because there was some doubt as to an apparent alteration in the date of his attestation of the will and the explanation he gave was not clear But there is not one word in the evidence affecting the respectability and competency of the four attesting witnesses all of whom were dead before the trial A little further on he says that at the request of <NAME> he came to see him at Rampura four or five days before his death that sometimes he was helped to sit up and sometimes used to get and sit up himself unaided that on the morning of the next day he told him a will had been executed and showed him the will but did not request him to be a Witness that for two or three days before his death he could at times get up and sit up unaided but from one day before his death he lost the power of getting and sitting up unaided The testator says that considering the realness of his property he does not wish to adopt a son and vests his property in his brother <NAME> that he may perform all ceremonies and maintain his wife during her life and his four unmarried daughters and also give those daughters in marriage and if there was any difficulty about living together the appellant was to have from <NAME> an allowance of Rs The Subordinate Judge said that the will was wisely and prudently kept dark and that the fact that the appellant was paid twice as much as she was entitled to under the will showed that there was something rotten in the core of the will and therefore precaution was taken that the appellant should have no occasion to dispute it Excluding the evidence of the appellant which <ORG> declined to accept as reliable there is no evidence that the appellant ever claimed any share in the income of the estate
