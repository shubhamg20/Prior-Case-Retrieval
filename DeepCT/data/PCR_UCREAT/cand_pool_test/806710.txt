Explanation I to the sub section provided that the building shall be deemed to have been completed on the date on which completion thereof is reported or otherwise recorded by the local authorities having jurisdiction and in case of a building subject to assessment the date on which the first assessment thereof comes into effect and where the said dates are different the earliest of the said date and in the absence of any such report record or assessment the date on which it is actually occupied for the first time The respondent landlord filed a suit for the eviction of the tenant on the ground that the Act did not apply to the shop and the tenant was liable to eviction In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that by virtue of sub section of section the Act would be applicable to the shop in question and that the exemption created by the sub section did not embrace buildings constructed prior to the commencement of the Act and that the building should be deemed to have been constructed on the date of occupation on th June and not on the date of the first assessment The Act had no application and the appellant could not be given the benefit of section In the absence of any ambiguity there is no question of taking any external aid for the interpretation of the sub section i Explanation I makes it abundantly clear that the date of occupation would be taken to be the date of completion of the construction only when there is no report or record of the completion of the construction or no assessment thereof If there is an assessment as in the instant case it will be the date of the first assessment which will be deemed to be the date of completion of the construction The building had not therefore become more than ten years old on the date when the revision came to be decided by <ORG> and consequently there was no question of giving the benefit of section of the Act to the appellant ii In order to attract section the suit must be pending on the date of the commencement of the Act which was th of July Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the rd March of <ORG> in Civil Revision No for The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> The first two appeals by special leave and the third by certificate and the special leave petition raise a common question of law and therefore we propose to dispose of them by a common judgment The respondent landlord filed a suit for the eviction of the tenant on the ground that the Urban Buildings Regulation of Letting Rent and Eviction Act Act of and hereinafter referred to as the Act did not apply to the shop and the tenant was liable to eviction The Judge <ORG> Mainpuri decreed the suit on the finding inter alia that the construction of the shop in suit was completed in the year and that ten years having not elapsed since then the provisions of the Act did not apply to the case The defendant thereupon filed a revision under section of the Civil Procedure Code in <ORG> which came up for hearing before a learned Single Judge who remitted the following issue to the trial court On what date was the construction of the building in dispute completed within the meaning of section of the Urban Buildings Regulation of Letting Rent and Eviction Act and deemed to have been completed as contemplated by Explanation I a thereto There is thus no error in the judgment of the court below He therefore referred the case to <ORG> There is no dispute that the first assessment of the shop took place on st of April It would be appropriate at this stage to extract sub section of section of the Act insofar as it is material for the purposes of the case Except as provided in sub section of section sub section A of section sub section of section sections A or sub section of section nothing in this Act shall apply to a building during a period of ten years from the date on which its construction is completed Explanation I For the purposes of this sub section a the construction of a building shall be deemed to have been completed on the date on which the completion thereof is reported to or otherwise recorded by the local authority having jurisdiction and in the case of a building subject to assessment the date on which the first assessment thereof comes into effect and where the said dates are different the earliest of the said dates and in the absence of any such report record or assessment the date on which it is actually occupied not including occupation merely for the purposes of supervising the construction or guarding the building under construction for the first time The same contention was raised by him in that case also and a Division Bench of this Court accepted the contention and held that Act of was prospective and applied only to buildings brought into being de novo after the Act came into force In that case there is no discussion except this bald observation There is no ambiguity in the language of sub section of section and in the absence of any ambiguity there is no question of taking any external aid for the interpretation of the sub section As a second limb to the first argument it is contended that the building will be deemed to have been constructed on the date of occupation on th of June and not on the date of the first assessment and that if this be so the appellant would be entitled to the benefit of section of the Act on the date when the revision came to be decided by <ORG> on rd of March Explanation I provides that the building shall be deemed to have been completed on the date on which completion thereof is reported to or otherwise recorded by the local authorities having jurisdiction and in case of a building subject to assessment the date on which the first assessment thereof comes into effect and where the said dates are different the earliest of the said dates and in the absence of any such report record or assessment the date on which it is actually occupied for the first time A perusal of Explanation I makes it abundantly clear that the date of occupation would be taken to be the date of completion of the construction only when there is no report or record of the completion of the construction or no assessment thereof If there is an assessment as in the present case it is it will be the date of the first assessment which will be deemed to be the date of completion of the construction and in that view of the matter the building had not become more than ten years old on the date when the revision came to be decided by <ORG> and therefore there was no question of giving the benefit of section of the Act to the appellant Further in order to attract section the suit must be pending on the date of commencement of the Act which is th of July but the suit giving rise to the present appeal was filed on rd of March long after the commencement of the Act There is yet another reason why section will have no application to the present case Considered from any angle the Act has no application to the present case and the appellant could not be given the benefit of section We find no force in either of the contentions raised by Mr <NAME> that he will pay to the respondent arrears of rent if any within a month from today that he will pay to the respondent future compensation for use and occupation of the suit premises for each calendar month by the th of the succeeding month and
