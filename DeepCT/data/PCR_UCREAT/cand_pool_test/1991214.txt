findings i The deceased was killed by the rash and negligent driving of the driver of ii The deceased was not a workman and the Workmen Compensation Act has no application to this case iii The claim was not barred by limitation iv The monthly income of the deceased was Rs Section speaks of the award of <ORG> On receipt of an application for compensation made under Section A <ORG> shall after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard hold an inquiry into the claim and may make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom compensation shall be paid and in making the award <ORG> shall specify the amount which shall be paid by the insurer or owner or driver of the vehicle involved in the accident or by all or any of them as the case may be Section deals with the procedurs and powers of Claims Tribunals Section provides for appeals Any person aggrieved by the award may prefer an appeal to <ORG> within days from the date of the award Section bars the jurisdiction of <ORG> It says that where <ORG> has been constituted for any area <ORG> shall have jurisdiction to entertain any question relating to any claim for compensation which may be adjudicated upon by <ORG> for that area and no injunction in respect of any action taken or to be taken by or before <ORG> in respect of the claim for compensation shall be granted by <ORG> The object of this group of Sections to of the Act is to supply a cheap and expeditious mode of enforcing liability arising out of claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles or damages to any property of a third party so arising or both as referred to in Section For determination of liability one has still to look to the substantive law in the law of torts and the Fatal Accidents Act hereinafter to be referred to as the Act or at any rate to the principles thereof Section merely says that the <ORG> may make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just It is for them to plead and prove that there was an accident involving death arising out of the use of motor vehicles and the loss accruing to them in terms of money value Suit for compensation to the family of a person for loss occasioned to it by his death by actionable wrong Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act neglect or default and the act neglect or default is such as would if death had not ensued have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof the party who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action or suit for damages notwithstanding the death of the person injured and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as amount in law to felony or other crime Every such action or suit shall be for the benefit of the wife husband parent and child if any of the person whose death shall have been so caused and shall be brought by and in name of the executor administrator or representative of the person deceased and in every such action the <ORG> may give such damages as it may think proportioned to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom end for whose benefit such action shall be brought and the amount so recovered after deducting all costs and expenses including the costs not recovered from the defendant shall be divided amongst the before mentioned parties or any of them in such shares as the <ORG> by its judgment or decree shall direct At page his Lordship observed thus it is necessary first to estimate what was the deceased man expectation of life if he had not been killed when ho was let this be years and next what sums during these years he would probably have applied to the support of his wife And there is a further possibility to be allowed for though in most cases it is incapable of evaluation namely the possibility that in the events which have actually happened the widow might re marry in circumstances which would improve her financial position In this case the factors to be taken into consideration for determining the quantum of compensation are few There is no evidence that the deceased had estate which his heirs would inherit Subject to the proviso to Sub section a policy of insurance shall cover any liability incurred in respect of any one accident up to the following limits namely a where the vehicle is a goods vehicle a limit of twenty thousand rupees in all including the liabilities if any arising under the Workmen Compensation Act in respect of the death of or bodily injury to employees other than the driver not exceeding six in number being carried in the vehicle Prior to that there was no statutory provision for awarding interest No decision under the Act has been brought to our notice wherein this question was discussed and a conclusion was reached one way or the other The principle applicable in respect of such a matter is that on entering possession the purchaser becomes entitled to the rents but if he has not paid the price interest in equity is deemed payable by him on the purchase price which belongs to the seller Applying the principles of natural justice there is therefore no reason why they should be deprived of interest To sum up i The claimants are entitled to a compensation of Rs In the result the appeal is allowed in part as indicated above
