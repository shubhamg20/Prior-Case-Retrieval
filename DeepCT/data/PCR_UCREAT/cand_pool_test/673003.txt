<ORG> for enforcement of their claim to appointment in preference to the candidates included in the list prepared in the year The <ORG> rejected the claim of the respondents and held that the list of eligible candidates prepared in the year had validity and operative force only for a period of one year and as such the respondents had no right to claim appointment in the year A learned Single Judge of <ORG> has allowed the Writ Petition in the view that by a Circular dated <ORG> has relaxed the time limit of one year for lists of selected candidates and hence the respondents were entitled to seek appointment in terms of the list prepared in The learned Counsel stated that in the first place the preparation of a list containing names in the year was itself contrary to the instructions issued by the <ORG> in their Circular dated In the said Circular the <ORG> has directed all the Heads of Departments to ensure that waiting list of candidates be prepared only in accordance with the number of posts which are vacant or arc likely to fall vacant during a year besides providing for per cent more candidates so that the list may not become unwieldy The counsel stated that the preparation of a list containing names as against only vacancies which had occurred during the year was in clear violation of the instructions of <ORG> The reason underlying the limitation of the period of a list for one year is obviously to ensure that other qualified persons are not deprived their chances of applying for the posts in the succeeding years and being selected for appointment This situation is very unsatisfactory because the sole object of getting selection made by selection committees is that the selection lists are made only in proportion to the vacancies not that they should be so big which may give rise to avoidable criticism and there may be discontent amongst the selected candidates Alongwith the above it is also made clear that from now and in future in every event in the list of clerks selected in accordance with Rule and Rule of the Class IV Service Rules the number of vacancies shall be limited to Please continue to ensure compliance of the aforesaid arrangement and if an instance of violation of this arrangement comes to light in future then in such an event strict action be taken and the Government be also apprised according to need of such a matter As the learned Judge has allowed the Writ Petition only on the ground that the <ORG> Circular dated May overrides the earlier circulars we need examine only the scope and effect of this circular a waiting list would be effective only for a period of one year and the list should not contain more than per cent surplus candidates against vacancies existing and anticipated Therefore the words list which is pending can only mean a list which had current force but which contained more names than per cent surplus number of candidates against vacancies which existed or were likely to occur It could never have been the intention of the <ORG> that lists prepared in the earlier years irrespective of the interval of time would be treated as pending lists and all the candidates included in those lists should be given employment before fresh lists of eligible candidates are prepared Another significant feature to be noticed in this case is that after the list of the year was prepared a fresh list of candidates had been prepared in the year and the selected candidates have been given appointments In the face of this later list there is no scope for treating the list as a pending list
