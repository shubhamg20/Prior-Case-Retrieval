clearly shows that it applies to all the courts including a <ORG> and as such a <ORG> will have the power to add any person not being the accused before it but against whom there appears during trial sufficient evidence indicating his involvement in the offence as an accused and direct him to be tried along with the other accused The summoning of additional persons who appear to be involved in the A crime from the evidence led during the trial and directing them to stand their trial alongwith those who had already been committed must be regarded as incidental to such cognizance and a part of the normal process that follows it otherwise the conferal of the power under upon the <ORG> would be rendered nugatory Section which enacts a deeming provision provides that where the <ORG> proceeds against any person under sub section the case may proceed as if such person had been an accused person when the <ORG> took cognizance of the offence upon which the inquiry or trial was commenced in other words such person must be deemed to be an accused at the time of commitment because it is at that point of time the <ORG> in law takes cognizance of the offence Under read with of the Code when a case is committed to <ORG> in respect of an offence <ORG> takes cognizance of the offence and not of the accused and once the Session <ORG> is properly seized of the case as a result of the committal order against some accused the power under can come into play and such <ORG> can add any person not an accused before it as an accused and direct him to be tried alongwith the other accused for the offence which such added accused appears to have committed from the evidence recorded at the trial The Judgment of the Court was delivered by TULZAPURKAR This appeal by special leave is directed against the order of <ORG> in Criminal Revision No of whereby <ORG> confirmed the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge Ludhiana on October directing that the attendance of the two appellants <NAME> and <NAME> be procured and they be ordered to stand trial together with three accused who had been committed to his Court to stand their trial for offences under ss and each read with I The facts giving rise to the appeal may be stated thus At the instance of one <NAME> a criminal case was registered at Police Station Dakha against <NAME> <NAME> the two appellants <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> on the allegation that each one armed with a Toki had entered his house on April at a and had caused a number of injuries to <NAME> and <NAME> who were present in the house with the respective weapons During the investigation the police found <NAME> and <NAME> the appellants to be innocent and therefore a charge sheet was submitted by the police only against the remaining three accused <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The learned Magistrate who held a preliminary inquiry committed the three accused <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> to <ORG> and the learned Additional Sessions Judge Ludhiana framed charges against the three accused for offence under ss read with I but at the trial evidence of <NAME> and <NAME> was recorded during the course of which both of them implicated <NAME> and <NAME> in the incident The application was opposed by the counsel for the accused principally on the ground that the Sessions Judge had no jurisdiction or power to summon the two appellants and direct them to be made accused to stand their trial along with three accused because they had neither been charge sheeted nor committed and <ORG> had no jurisdiction or power directly to take cognizance against them in respect of any offences said to have been committed by them The appellants have come up in appeal to this <ORG> by special leave Counsel for the appellant raised two contentions in support of the appeal In the first place relying upon sections and of the Code of Criminal Procedure counsel contended that there was a bar to <ORG> taking congnizance of any offence as a <ORG> of original jurisdiction unless the appellants were committed to it by a Magistrate under the Code and it was pointed out that admittedly in the instant case though the I had involved the two appellants in the alleged incident on investigation the police had found no material against them with the result the police had submitted a charge sheet only against the three accused and not the appellants and even the Committal Order passed by the Magistrate was only in respect of the three accused and therefore it was not open to the learned Additional Sessions Judge Ludhiana to take the impugned action against the appellants Reliance was placed by the counsel upon a decision of the Andhra Another On the other hand counsel for the respondents contended that there has been a change in the phraseology in ss and of the Code of Criminal Procedure as compared to the equivalent provisions contained in the old Code with the result it was not the accused but the case which got committed to <ORG> and once <ORG> had upon such commitment seisin of the case it was open to it to exercise the power under It was further urged that there was no warrant to read subject or subordinate to and that it covered case of suspects like the two appellants and therefore the High <ORG> was right in upholding the order of the learned Additional Sessions Judge Ludhiana The real question centres around the scope and ambit of of the Code of Criminal Procedure under which a power has been conferred upon a criminal <ORG> to add a person not being the accused before it and against whom during the trial evidence comes forth showing his involvement in the offence as an accused and try him along with those that are being tried and the question is whether a Sessions <ORG> can add such a person as an accused in the absence of any committal order having been passed against him Sub ss Power to proceed against other persons appearing to be guilty of offence where in the course of any inquiry into or trial of an offence it appears from the evidence that any person not being the accused has committed any offence for which such person could be tried together with the accused the Court may proceed against such person for the offence which he appears to have committed Where the Court proceeds against any person under sub section I then a the proceedings in respect of such person shall be commenced afresh and the witnesses re heard subject to the provisions of clause a the case may proceed as if such person had been an accused person when the <ORG> took cognizance of the offence upon which the inquiry or trial was commenced Under the Code the equivalent provision was to be found I under which it was provided that any person attending a criminal <ORG> although not under arrest or upon a summons may be detailed by such <ORG> for the purpose of inquiry into or trial of any offence of which such <ORG> can take cognizance and which from the evidence may appear to have been committed and may be proceeded against as though he had been arrested or summoned sub provided that in such a situation the evidence shall be re heard in the presence of the newly added accused With regard to this old provision <ORG> in its st Report vide para observed that the power conferred upon a criminal <ORG> thereunder could be exercised only if such person happened to be attending the <ORG> and he could then be detained and proceeded against but there was no express provision in section for summoning such a person if he was not present in <ORG> and therefore a fairly comprehensive pro vision was recommended which now forms the subject matter of the present section <ORG> further observed in its said Report vide para that the old section assumed that the Magistrate proceeding under it had the power of taking cognizance of the new case but did not say in what manner cognizance was taken by the Magistrate and the question was whether against the newly added accused cognizance will be supposed to have been taken on the Magistrate own information under section or only in the manner in which cognizance was first taken of the offence against the other accused and the question was important because the methods of inquiry and trial in the two cases differed <ORG> felt that the main purpose of this particular provision was that the whole case against all known suspects should be proceeded with expeditiously and convenience required that cognizance against the newly added accused should be taken in the same manner as against the other accused and <ORG> therefore proposed that a new provision should be incorporated providing that there will be no difference in the mode of taking cognizance if a new person was added as an accused during the proceedings and that is how clause of sub of came to be enacted as set out above which incorporates a deeming provision A plain reading of section which occurs in Chapter XXIV dealing with general provisions as to inquiries and trials clearly shows that it applies to all the Courts including <ORG> and as such <ORG> will have the power to add any person not being the accused before it but against whom there appears during trial sufficient evidence indicating his involvement in the offence as an accused and direct him to be tried along with the other accused but the question is whether it has power to do so without there being a committal order against such person In this context the provisions of ss and of the present Code vis a vis the equivalent provisions under the old Code will have to be considered When in a case instituted on a police report or otherwise the accused appears or is brought before the Magistrate and it appears to the Magistrate that the offence is triable exclusively by <ORG> he shall a commit the case to <ORG> subject to the provisions of this Cod relating to hail remand the accused to custody during and until the conclusion of It is true that there cannot be a committal of the case without there being an accused per son before the <ORG> but this only means that before a case in respect of an offence is committed there must be some accused suspected to be involved in the crime before the <ORG> but once the case in respect of the offence qua those accused who are before the <ORG> is committed then the cognizance of the offence can be said to have been taken properly by the Sessions <ORG> and the bar of would be out of the way and summoning of additional persons who appear to be involved in the crime from the evidence led during the trial and directing them to stand their trial along with those who had already been committed must be regarded as incidental to such cognizance and a part of the normal process that follows it otherwise the conferal of the power under upon the Sessions <ORG> would be rendered nugatory Under that provision it is provided that where the <ORG> proceeds against any person under sub then the case may proceed as if such person had been an accused person when the <ORG> took cognizance of the offence upon which the inquiry or trial was commenced in other words such person must be deemed to be an accused at the time of commitment because it is at that point of time the Sessions <ORG> in law takes cognizance of the offence The appellant was one of the persons mentioned as the assailants in the First Information Report The Sub Divisional Magistrate recorded that the appellant was discharged and transferred the case for inquiry to another Magistrate who after examining two witnesses ordered the issue of a non bailable warrant against the appellant for proceeding against him along with the other accused under A of the old Code The order was confirmed by <ORG> and <ORG> and in further appeal to this Court it was held first that there could be no discharge of the appellant as he was not included in the charge sheet submitted before the Magistrate by the police and second that the appellant could be proceeded against along with other accused under A Cr One of the contentions urged before this Court was that the Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence so far as the other accused were concerned but not as regards the appellant and with regard to this contention <NAME> as he then was observed as follows In our opinion once cognizance has been taken by the Magistrate he takes cognizance of an offence and not the offenders once he takes cognizance of an offence it is his duty to find out who the offenders really are and once he comes to the conclusion that apart from the persons sent up by the police some other persons are involved it is his duty to proceed against those persons The summoning of the additional accused is part of the proceeding initiated by his taking cognizance of an offence If a Magistrate takes cognizance under a on the basis of a complaint of facts he would take cognizance and a proceeding would be instituted even though persons who had committed the offence were not known at that time The same position prevails in our view under It will thus appear clear that under section read with of the Code when a case is committed to <ORG> in respect of an offence <ORG> takes cognizance of the offence and
