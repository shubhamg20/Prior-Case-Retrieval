The mortgage bond is dated the th of July and the time fixed for repayment is ten years The defendants however rely on the following provision of the bond and urge that the amount of the mortgage became due when default was made in the payment of the first instalment and as more than twelve years have elapsed since the date of default the claim is time barred yearly and we shall pay the interest on the said amount monthly at the rate of annas per month If we fail to pay the interest aforesaid in any month or the principal by the end of the stipulated period as specified above or no payment is made in a year the mortgagee shall under all these circumstances be at liberty to realize the entire amount with the interest aforesaid in a lump sum through court by means of a suit from the mortgaged and other moveable and immoveable property and the persons of us the executants Had this clause stood alone it might perhaps be said on the authority of the English and other cases cited on behalf of the respondents that the plaintiffs were bound to sue when default was first made in the payment of the instalment fixed in the bond It says nothing about the security and it in my opinion clearly intends that the mortgagee might if he so chose wait for the full term of ten years and if he did so interest Would run till date of actual payment This provision in the bond gives full power to the mortgagee not to enforce his right to claim the entire amount of the mortgage on the happening of a default but to wait till the expiry of the stipulated period often years It is true that under Article time begins to run from the date when the money becomes due but that date depends upon the terms of each document and a true construction of those terms The first clause as to payment of the whole amount on the occurrence of a default was clearly inserted in the document for the benefit of the creditor and as he was expressly authorized not to take advantage of the clause I am unable to hold that he was bound to sue when default was made The decree in that case provided that the amount of it should be paid by eight instalments and that in case of default and non payment of any instalment the plaintiff had power to realize in one lump sum the entire decretal money payable up to that time by executing the decree It was held upon a construction of the decree that the decree holder on the happening of any default might if he wished execute the decree for all the decretal money then unpaid but that it was not the intention that on the happening of a default the decree holder should be bound to execute the decree once and for all their Lordships of <ORG> expressed a similar opinion That was a suit to recover the amount of a hypothecation bond in which the borrower engaged to repay the amount with interest on a day named with a condition that in the event of the hypothecated lands being sold in execution of a decree before the day fixed for repayment the lender should be at liberty at once to sue for the recovery of the debt It was contended that the plaintiff cause of action arose on the th May when the lands pledged were sold in execution and that the suit having been brought after six years from that date was time barred With reference to this contention their Lordships observed Their Lordships must not be supposed in coming to this decision to give any countenance to the argument of Mr <NAME> that this suit would have been barred if the limitation of six years under Clause had been applicable to it They think upon the construction of this bond there would be good reason for holding that the cause of action arose within six years of the commencement of the suit Their Lordships thus held that limitation would begin to run from the date fixed for payment and that the cause of action arose that is to say the money became due on that date and not on the date on which the hypothecated property was sold in execution There was this further clause If we fail to pay the interest aforesaid in any month or the principal by the stipulated period as specified above or no payment is made in a year the mortgagee shall under all these circumstances be at liberty to realize the entire amount with the interest aforesaid in a lump sum through court by means of a suit from the mortgaged and other moveable and immoveable property and the person of us the executants The court below has dismissed the plaintiff suit holding that the claim is barred by limitation The period of limitation prescribed is twelve years and time begins to run from the date when the money sued for becomes due The provision however in the deed admittedly entitled the mortgagee to bring a suit to recover principal and interest after the first default and if it can be said that the money then became due the suit is barred by limitation It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the mortgagees were entitled to sue or not to sue and that accordingly on a true construction of the mortgage deed the money did not become due until the expiration of ten years from the date of the mortgage It seems to me that money is due when it can be legally demanded and it is admitted in the present case that the money secured by this mortgage could have been legally demanded and recovered after the first default and had a suit been brought for its recovery by sale of the mortgaged property the defendants could not have pleaded that such a suit was premature For this there is the high authority of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> The defendant agreed to pay interest quarterly and the plaintiff agreed not to call in the money for five years if the defendant should regularly pay interest It provides for a loan for five years subject to a provision that if default is made in punctual payment of interest the principal shall be recoverable at once The right to bring an action may arise on various events but it has always been held that the statute runs from the earliest time at which an action could be brought <NAME> said We have not to determine whether the defence here set up is handsome or conscientious but whether it is good at law and I am of opinion that it is Now when first had the plaintiff a cause of action When default was made for twenty one days in payment of an instalment of interest <NAME> <NAME> is in point It is said that this case is not good law and that it has not been referred to for many years I think that it has not been refer red to because it has been acquiesced in and it does not appear that it has ever been questioned It seems to me that this case is the clearest authority if authority were needed that money becomes duo as soon as it is legally recoverable quite irrespective of when the suit was instituted It is unnecessary lo express any opinion as to whether or not the learned Judges were correct in their construction of the deed in question because there are no similar words in the deed in the present suit All these cases dealt with the construction of Article of the Limitation Act which contains no reference to the money becoming due and in my opinion these cases have no bearing on the question which we have to consider in the present appeal see also <NAME> <NAME> I All Their Lordships have moreover in the recent case to which I have referred decided that Article is the article which applies to a suit on a simple mortgage to enforce payment of money charged on immoveable property I am clearly of opinion that in the present case the money became due within the meaning of that expression in the article of limitation when the first default was made and that accordingly the suit is barred by limitation I would dismiss the appeal I concur with the learned Chief Justice that the present suit is barred by limitation Article clearly applies and under that article time began to run from the date on which the money became due annually and we shall pay the interest on the said amount monthly at the rate of eight annas per month If we fail to pay the interest aforesaid in any month or the principal in the stipulated period as specified above or no payment is made in a year the mortgagee shall under all these circumstances be at liberty to realize the entire amount with the interest aforesaid in a lump sum through court by means of a suit from the mortgaged and other moveable and immoveable property and the persons of us the executants In other words the money became due from the mortgagor to the mortgagee on the occurrence of the first default It seems to me that this clause was simply put into the document in order to make it quite clear that the interest should continue to run in spite of no suit being brought not only up to the expiry of the ten years but also up to the date of realization There is no question of waiver for no waiver has been alleged much less proved I would therefore dismiss the appeal The order of the <ORG> is that the appeal be dismissed with costs
