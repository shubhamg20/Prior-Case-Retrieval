PETITIONER <NAME> AND <NAME> Vs RESPONDENT THE STATE OF DELHI And connected Appeals DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH JAGANNADHADAS BENCH JAGANNADHADAS MUKHERJEA BOSE VIVIAN CITATION AIR SCR ACT Prevention of Corruption Act II of and proviso to Prevention of Corruption Second Amendment Act LIX of A Whether mandatory or directory Cognizance taken on a police report vitiated by a breach of mandatory provisions Legal effect thereof HEADNOTE Held that and proviso to of the Prevention of Corruption Act II of and the corresponding A of the Prevention of Corruption Second Amendment Act LIX of are mandatory and not directory and that an investigation conducted in violation thereof is illegal If cognizance is in fact taken on a police report in breach of a mandatory provision relating to investigation the results which follow cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice It is well settled that an illegality committed in the course of an investigation does not affect the competence and the jurisdiction of the court for trial and where cognizance of the case has in fact been taken and the case has proceeded to termination the invalidity of the preceding investigation does not vitiate the result unless miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby When any breach of the mandatory provisions relating to investigation is brought to the notice of the <ORG> at an early stage of the trial the <ORG> will have to consider the nature and extent of the violation and pass appropriate orders for such reinvestigation as may be called for wholly or partly and by such officer as it considers appropriate with reference to the requirements of A of the Prevention of Corruption Second Amendment Act Appeal by Special Leave from the Judgment and Order dated the th August of <ORG> Circuit Bench Delhi in Criminal Revision Nos and of arising out of the Judgment and Order dated the th May of <ORG> Delhi in Corruption Case No of from the Judgment and Order dated the th August of <ORG> Circuit Bench Delhi in Criminal Miscellaneous No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> are appeals by special leave against the orders of <ORG> made in exercise of revisional jurisdiction reversing the orders of the Special Judge Delhi quashing certain criminal proceedings pending before himself against these appellants for alleged offences under the Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act These appeals raise a common question of law and are dealt with together In respect of such of these accused as are public servants there are also charges under section of the Prevention of Corruption Act Under section of the Prevention of Corruption Act a police officer below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police shall not investigate any offence punishable under sub section of section without the order of a Magistrate of the First Class It appears from the evidence taken in this behalf that such investigation was con ducted not by any Deputy Superintendent of Police but by officers of lower rank and that after the permission was accorded little or no further investigation was made Section enacts a special rule of evidence against persons accused of offences under section or of the Indian Penal Code throwing the burden of proof on the accused In the normal course therefore an investi <NAME> gation into the offence of criminal misconduct under section of the Act and an investigation into the offence under sections and of the Indian Penal Code which have been made cognizable by section of the Act would have to be made by an officer incharge of a police station and no order of any Magistrate in this behalf would be required But the proviso to section as well as sub section of section of the Act specifically provide that a police officer below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police shall not investigate any such offence without the order of a Magistrate of the First Class or make any arrest there for without a warrant The above mentioned proviso to section as well as sub section of section have been thereby omitted and substituted by section A the relevant portion of which may be taken to be as follows Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure no police officer below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police elsewhere than in the presidency towns of Calcutta Madras and Bombay shall investigate any offence punishable under sections or A of the Indian Penal Code or under section of this Act without the order of a Magistrate of the First Class In any case the investigation in these cases having taken place prior to the amendment what is relevant is section as it stood before the amendment On the arguments urged before us two points arise for consideration Is the provision of the Prevention of Corruption Act enacting that the investigation into the offences specified therein shall not be conducted by any police officer of a rank lower than a Deputy Superintendent of Police without the specific order of a Magistrate directory or mandatory As has been pointed out by Lord <NAME> in <ORG> Turner there is no universal rule to aid in determining whether mandatory enactments shall be considered directory only or obligatory with an implied nullification for disobedience When information of the commission of a cognizable offence is received or such commission is suspected the appropriate police officer has the authority to enter on the investigation of the same unless it appears to him that there is no sufficient ground Thus it may be seen that according to the scheme of the Code investigation is a normal preliminary to an accused being put up for trial for a cognizable offence except when the Magistrate takes cognizance other Ch wise than on a police report in which case he has the power under section of the Code to order investigation if he thinks fit Investigation usually starts on information relating to the commission of an offence given to an officer in charge of a police station and recorded under section of the Code For the above purposes the investigating officer is given the power to require before himself the attendance of any person appearing to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case He has also the authority to examine such person orally either by himself or by a duly authorised deputy The officer examining any person in the course of investigation may reduce his statement into writing and such writing is available in the trial that may follow for use in the manner provided in this behalf in section Under section the officer in charge of a police station has the power of making a search in any place for the seizure of anything believed to be necessary for the purpose of the investigation A subordinate officer may be deputed by him for the purpose only for reasons to be recorded in writing if he is unable to conduct the search in person and there is no other competent officer available The investigating officer has also the power to arrest the person or persons suspected of the commission of the offence under section of the Code A police officer making an investigation is enjoined to enter his proceedings in a diary from day to day If upon the completion of the investigation it appears to the officer in charge of the police station that there is no sufficient evidence or reasonable ground he may decide to release the suspected accused if in custody on his executing a bond If however it appears to him that there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground to place the accused on trial he is to take the necessary steps therefore under section of the Code In either case on the completion of the in vestigation he has to submit a report to the Magistrate under section of the Code in the prescribed form furnishing various details Thus under the Code investigation consists generally of the following steps Proceeding to the spot Ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of the case Discovery and arrest of the suspected offender Collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence which may consist of a the examination of various persons including the accused and the reduction of their statements into writing if the officer thinks fit the search of places of seizure of things considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced at the trial and Formation of the opi nion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the accused before a Magistrate for trial and if so taking the necessary steps for the same by the filing of a charge sheet under section The scheme of the Code also shows that while it is permissible for an officer in charge of a police station to depute some subordinate officer to conduct some of these steps in the investigation the responsibility for every one of these steps is that of the person in the situation of the officer in charge of the police station it having been clearly provided in section that when a subordinate officer makes an investigation he should report the result to the officer in charge of the police station the formation of the opinion as to whether or not there is a case to place the accused on trial is to be that of the officer in charge of the police station There is no provision permitting delegation thereof but only a provision entitling superior officers to supervise or participate under section When such a statutory provision enjoins that the investigation shall be made by a police officer of not less than a certain rank unless specifically empowered by a Magistrate in that behalf notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Code of Criminal Procedure it is clearly implicit therein that the investigation in the absence of such permission should be conducted by the officer of the appropriate rank This is not to say that every one of the steps in the investigation has to be done by him in person or that he cannot take the assistance of deputies to the extent permitted by the Code to an officer in charge of a police station conducting an investigation or that he is bound to go through each of these steps in every case A cursory perusal of Schedule II of the Code of Criminal Procedure discloses that almost all the offences which may be alleged to have been committed by a public servant fall within two chapters Chapter IX Offences by or relating to public servants and Chapter XI Offences against public justice and that each one of them is non cognizable The underlying policy in making these offences by public servants non cognizable appears to be that public servants who have to discharge their functions often enough in difficult circumstancesshould not be exposed to the harassment of investigation against them on information levelled possibly by persons affected by their official acts unless a Magistrate is satisfied that an investigation is called for and on such satisfaction authorises the same This is meant to ensure the diligent discharge of their official functions by public servants without fear or favour When therefore the <ORG> thought fit to remove the protection from the public servants in so far as it relates to the investigation of the offences of corruption comprised in the Act by making them cognizance it may be presumed that it was considered necessary to provide a substituted safeguard from undue harassment by requiring that the investigation is to be conducted normally by a police officer of a designated high rank It has been suggested by the learned SolicitorGeneral in his arguments that the consideration as to the policy would indicate if at all only the necessity for the charge sheets in such a case having to be filed by the authorised officer after coming to his own conclusion as to whether or not there is a case to place the accused on trial before the <ORG> on a perusal of the material previously collected and that at best this might extend also to the requirement of arrest of the concerned public servant by an officer of the appropriate rank There is however no reason to think that the policy comprehends within its scope only some and not all the steps involved in the process of investigation which according to the scheme of the Act have to be conducted by the appropriate investigating officer either directly or when permissible through deputies but on his responsibility It is sufficient to notice one argument based on section of the Code on which reliance has been placed in some of these decisions in support of the view that section of the Act is directory and not mandatory Any officer in charge of a police station may without the order of a Magistrate investigate any cognizable case which a <ORG> having jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XV relating to the place of inquiry or trial No proceeding of a police officer in any such case shall at any stage be called in question on the ground that the case was one which such officer was not empowered under this section to investigate What that sub section cures is investigation by an officer not empowered under that section i with reference to sub sections and thereof It is difficult to see how this analogy helps unless the said sub section is also to be assumed as directory and not mandatory which certainly is not obvious on the wording thereof We are therefore clear in our opinion that section and proviso to section of the Act and the corresponding section A of Act LIX of are mandatory and not directory and that the investigation conducted in violation thereof bears the stamp of illegality Now trial follows cognizance and cognizance is preceded by investigation A defect or illegality in investigation however serious has no direct bearing on the competence or the procedure relating to cognizance or trial But it cannot be maintained that a valid and legal police report is the foundation of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to take cognizance These latter sections regulate the competence of the <ORG> and bar its jurisdiction in certain cases excepting in compliance therewith If therefore cognizance is in fact taken on a police report vitiated by the breach of a mandatory provision relating to investigation there can be no doubt that the result of the trial which follows it cannot be set aside unless the illegality in the investigation can be shown to have brought about a miscarriage of justice We are therefore clearly also of the opinion that where the cognizance of the case has in fact been taken and the case has proceeded to termi A I the invalidity of the precedent investigation does not vitiate the result unless miscarriage of justice has been caused thereby Such a course is not altogether outside the contemplation of the scheme of the Code as appears from section under which a Magistrate taking cognizance on a complaint can order investigation by the police It is relevant in this context to observe that even if the trial had proceeded to conclusion and the accused had to make out that there was in fact a failure of justice as the result of such an error explanation to section of the Code of Criminal Procedure indicates that the fact of the objection having been raised at an early stage of the proceeding is a pertinent factor It is true that the peremptory pro vision itself allows an officer of a lower rank to make the investigation if permitted by the Magistrate When a Magistrate is approached for granting such permission he is expected to satisfy himself that there are good and sufficient reasons for authorising an officer of a lower rank to conduct the investigation In our opinion therefore when such a breach is brought to the notice of the <ORG> at an early stage of the trial the <ORG> have to consider the nature and extent of the violation and pass appropriate orders for such reinvestigation as may be called for wholly or partly and by such officer as it considers appropriate with reference to the requirements of section A of the Act The charge sheets in these two cases were filed on by a Sub Inspector of Police <NAME> and it appears that he applied to the Magistrate for permission to investigate into these cases on In the case out of which Criminal Appeal No of arises the evidence of <NAME> shows that he took up the investigation after he obtained permission and partly investigated it thereafter but that the major part of the investigation was done by a number of other officers who were all below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police without having obtained from the Magistrate the requisite sanction therefor Since then it was only <NAME> that made all the investigation and it appears from his evidence that he examined as many as witnesses in the case It raises the same questions which have been disposed of by our judgment in Criminal Appeals Nos to of
