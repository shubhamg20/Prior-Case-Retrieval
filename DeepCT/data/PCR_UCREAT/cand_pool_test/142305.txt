It has been argued with much learning and light and also some little warmth on both sides and I took time to consider my judgment not only having regard to the importance of the question to the parties but also to the general principle on which alone it seemed to me that a satisfactory solution can be arrived at If it had been an ordinary case I should probably have had very little difficulty in presuading the parties to agree to the tarddition of the party on conditions which may be regarded as equitable in the circum stances It was with this view that almost at the very commencement of the discussion I asked the learned Advocate General who appeared for the applicant whether he had any instructions to agree as to any conditions as to coats The first observation that falls to be made with regard to the present application is that it is one for joinder of a third party as party defendant and made by the third party himself and not by the plaintiff or the defendant in the action I have felt it necessary to state this because it seems to me that different considerations should apply to applications for joinder of additional parties when the party sought to be added is party plaintiff or party defendant and also when the application for such joinder is made by the party sought to be added or by either of the parties already on the record and if so which of them In such a ease as the present one however it is obvious that if a third party application to be added as party defendant were opposed by both parties I should have had very little hesitation in rejecting the application unless I were satisfied that the party sought to be added was not only a proper party but a necessary party Having regard however in this ease to the learned and strenuous argument in support of the application by Mr <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> I have felt bound to regard it virtually as an application by both The question thus resolves itself into this Should the plaintiff in this case be compelled to litigate against not only the defendant of his choice against whom he has prayed for the reliefs consequent on the declaration but also against the Secretary of <ORG> If it is to be only a question of a permissible party then on principle it follows that such cannot generally be ordered when it is opposed by the person to fight whom he is so brought on the record The question thus further resolves itself into this whether in such an action the Secretary of <ORG> is a proper party having regard to the rules relating to the joinder of defendants It is Clause of Rule that applies to the present case It provides that the <ORG> may at any stage of the proceedings either upon or without the application of either party and on such terms as may appear to the <ORG> to be just order that the name of any person who ought to have been joined as defendant or whose presence before the <ORG> may be necessary in order to enable the <ORG> effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit be added The contention was that the presence before the <ORG> of the Secretary of <ORG> in this case would be necessary in order to enable the <ORG> effectually and completely to ad indicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit The necessity referred to in the clause is for the purpose of enabling the <ORG> effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in a suit It is obvious that this clause cannot be read as requiring that all persons who have or claim to have or are likely to have any sort of right title or interest in respect of any portion of the subject matter of a suit should all be made parties If it be borne in mind that the suit is by a plaintiff for certain reliefs against certain persons as defendants and that the judgments of civil <ORG>s are not judgments in rem then it follows that the questions involved in the suit are only questions with regard to the right set up and the relief claimed on the one side and denied or withheld on the other The expression therefore all the questions involved in the suit can only be questions as between the parties to the litigation In these cases there is no question of the <ORG> not being able effectually and adjudicate and settle any question So far as I was able to see the entire argument in support of the application was based on the position that in the absence of the Secretary of <ORG> the <ORG> could not completely adjudicate upon and settle all the Questions involved in the suit In other words the contention was that the Secretary of <ORG> was a proper party to every suit in which any question was raised with regard in the legality of any statute and that in the absence of the Secretary of <ORG> as a party in any such suit there can be no completeness of adjudication within the meaning of the rule There is no decision in the case as to whether he was either a necessary or proper party and their Lordships of <ORG> do not even refer to it At page Lord <NAME> who delivered the judgment of their Lordships of <ORG> observes as follows The learned Judges of <ORG> from whose judgment their Lordships feel complled to differ upon this point do not refer to the rights of the <ORG> which may be affected but base their opinion solely on the ground that the <ORG> is not affected by the result and that consequently a mere declaratory order against the <ORG> would be of no value It is therefore not a case falling under the rule that the officer representing the <ORG> is a necessary party to every action as the result of which the rights of the <ORG> may be affected The question would therefore have to be determined merely on a consideration of whether in the absence of the Secretary of <ORG> as a party to the action it is impossible to have a complete adjudication upon and settlement of all the questions involved in the suit The conclusion I have thus arrived at is this If the expression all questions involved in the suit should be regarded as absolute and not merely relative to the parties before the <ORG> then the Secretary of <ORG> may in this case be regarded as a proper party and not otherwise But it seems to me that there is neither principle for authority that can be discovered of regarding such an expression as all the questions involved in a suit appearing in a rule relatiag to joinder not parties as absolute and not relative IS a plaintiff should claim certain property and it should be regarded that the question involved in the suit is generally whether he is the owner of the property and not whether as against any other particular person he is entitled to certain rights over property very serious consequences are sure to ensue and procedure in our Courts of law is certain to become exceedingly complicated and much more disastrously prolonged than it is at present The <ORG> of appeal consisting of Lord Justice <NAME> and Lord Justice <NAME> reversing the decision of the <ORG> below held that <ORG> not being directly interested in the issues between the plaintiff and the defendant but only indirectly and commercially affected the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to add him as a defendant Lord Justice <NAME> at pages and observes as follows But reliance is placed on the following words of the rule which provide for adding the names of parties whose presence before the <ORG> may be necessary in order to enable the <ORG> effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all questions involved in the cause or matter And again later on that eminent Judge says Can it be said that the rule prevents the plaintiff from proceeding against a defendant Without having to litigate with everybody who may be in any way affected however indirectly by the action It appears to me that it does not It seems to me that if ever a case can be conceived which would fall directly within the words of the rule already referred to this was such a case There was a defendant who when sued by the plaintiff for infringement of a patent right sought to justify his action on the patent right of a third party and if the terms of Clause of Rule should be taken absolutely as contended for it would have seemed to be a clear case in which for the purpose of effectually and completely adjudicating upon and settling all questions involved with regard to the patent right of the plaintiff it was not only proper but necessary that this other patentee should have been added as a party defendant But <ORG> said No and decided that he was not a proper party on the ground I take it that the words of the rule should be construed not absolutely but relatively At page that learned Judge observes Now this although it is not a case of making a parson a plaintiff in respect of a defendant as to whom he does not desire to be plaintiff without and against his will is certainly the case of making a person a plaintiff consent Again that learned Judge at page lays down that the defendant to be added must be a defendant against whom the plaintiff has some cause of complaint which ought to be determined in the action and that it was never intended to apply where the person to be added as defendant is a person against whom the plaintiff has no claim and does not desire to prosecute any He proceeds thus It seems to me that this application is answered and that it was not intended that persons in the position of this company should be added as defendants merely for the convenience of another defendant It seems to me that it is the more important to construe this rule strictly because it is obvious the in many cases if the defendant contention is right its provisions might be made use of in a manner exceedingly harassing to plaintiffs by forcing them to include in their actions persons against whom they do not seek to proceed and to mix up their rights as against one person with questions on a highly complicated nature arising between themselves and the others There is no principle for even suggesting that any declaration as against him will be effectual and binding as against all other possible persons such as committees and other bodies and officers that may be constituted or created under the Act now in question There is no cause of action alleged against the applicant and no relief whatever claimed against him They therefore ask for an injunction on the ground that the Act which is held up as a shield by the defence is really not available to them because it is illegal and ultra vires On principle and authority I have therefore come to the conclusion that the Secretary of <ORG> is neither a necessary nor a proper party and that as the plaintiffs oppose his being joined as additional defendant I would not be justified in adding him as a party defendant even as a person brought in merely to look on and see fair play to use the words of Lord <NAME> in the case of Duke of Bedford <NAME> A
