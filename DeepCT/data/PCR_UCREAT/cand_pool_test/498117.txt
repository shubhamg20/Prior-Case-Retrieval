HEADNOTE The respondent who held the substantive post of Inspector of Police and had been officiating as the Deputy Superintendent of Police was reverted to his original rank of Inspector without being given any opportunity of being heard in respect of the reversion Later a Departmental enquiry was held behind his back in respect of certain allegations of misconduct made against him in a confidential communication from the District Superintendent of police to the Deputy Inspector General of Police but these allegations were not proved at the enquiry As the order of reversion was maintained by the Government inspite of the representations made by the respondent he filed a suit challenging the order Held that a person officiating in a post has no right to hold it for all times A person who is given an officiating post to test his suitability to be made permanent later holds it on the implied term that he would have to be reverted if he was found unsuitable The observation in <NAME> State of Madhya Pradesh that when a person officiating in a post is reverted for unsatisfactory work that reversion amounts to reduction in rank disapproved The departmental enquiry held later in this case does not prove that the respondent was reverted by way of punishment The Government had the right to consider the suitability of the respondent to the post to which he had been appointed to officiate of the Constitution inasmuch as he was not given an opportunity to show cause against the order proposed to be made On May a confidential memorandum was sent by the District Superintendent of Police Parbhani to the Deputy Inspector General of Police Aurangabad in which he stated that he had conducted an inquiry into certain allegations of corruption made against the respondent while he was acting in the service of <ORG> at Parbhani and he thought that those allegations were of substance There is a letter addressed by the Inspector General of Police to the Chief Secretary to <ORG> dated August written after the departmental inquiry wherein it is stated that the respondents previous record was not satisfactory and that he had been promoted to officiate as Deputy Superintendent of Police as the Government was in need of officers and that he had been given a chance in the expectation that he would turn a new leaf but the complaint made in the confidential memorandum was a clear proof that the officer was habitually dishonest and did not deserve promotion The respondent made representations to the Government to revise the order reverting him to the lower rank but the Government expressed its inability to do so In the judgment under appeal <ORG> followed its earlier decision in <NAME> State of Madhya Pradesh in which it had been held that if a person officiating in a higher post is reverted to his original post in the normal course that is on account of the cessation of the vacancy or his failure to acquire the required qualification the reversion does not amount to a reduction in rank but if he is reverted for unsatisfactory work then the reversion amounts to reduction in rank <ORG> held that the Government plea that the respondent had been promoted as there was dearth of officers was an afterthought and that the fact that the respondent had been given a chance to officiate in the higher post prima facie showed that he was fit to hold that post It therefore came to the conclusion on the authority of <NAME> case that the respondent must be held to have reduced in rank and this reduction in rank was illegal as the respondent had not been given an opportunity to show cause against it We are unable to agree with the observation in <NAME> case that when a person officiating in a post is reverted for unsatisfactory work that reversion amounts to a reduction in rank A person officiating in a post has no right to hold it for all times In short in the case of an appointment to a permanent post in a <ORG> service on probation or on an officiating basis the servant so appointed does not acquire any substantive right to the post and consequently cannot complain any more than a private servant employed on probation or on an officiating basis can do if his service is terminated at any time The respondent had of course no right to the post of Deputy Superintendent of Police to which he had been given an officiating appointment and he does not contend to the contrary This is what happened in this case even if it be taken that the respondent had been reverted to his original rank because he was found unsuitable for the higher rank to which he had been given an officiating appointment It was therefore observed in <NAME> case at Thus if the order entails or provides for the forfeiture of his pay or allowances or the loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion then that circumstances may indicate that although in form the <ORG> had purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules in truth and reality the <ORG> has terminated the employment as and by way of penalty He of course lost the benefit of the appointment to the higher rank but that by itself cannot indicate that the reversion was by way of punishment because he had no right to continue in the higher post or to the benefits arising from it It may give rise to a suspicion about the motive which led the Government to take the action but it is now firmly established that if the action is justifiable under the terms of the employment then the motive inducing the action is irrelevant in deciding the question whether the action had been taken by way of punishment see <NAME> case at The Government had the right to consider the suitability of the respondent to hold the position to which he had been appointed to officiate At one stage Mr <NAME> was inclined to argue that the enquiry was really a part of the original order of reversion and that it had been deliberately postponed to as to avoid the applicability of of the Government of India Act No such case is made in the plaint We think therefore that the appeal must be allowed with costs throughout and we order accordingly
