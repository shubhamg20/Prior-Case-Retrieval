HEADNOTE The validity of the Punjab Security of Land Tenures Act Act of and of the Mysore Land Reforms Act Act of as amended by Act of was challenged by the petitioners under Art Article makes the right to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by the said Parts a fundamental right The Constitution has given a place of permanence to the fundamental freedoms The incapacity of <ORG> therefore in exercise of its amending power to modify restrict or imposefundamental freedoms in Part III arises from the scheme of theConstitution and the nature of the freedoms or from the nature of the articles sought to be amended the doctrine of necessary implication cannot be invoked if there is an express provision There is no necessity to imply any such power as <ORG> has the plenary power to make any law including the law to amend the Constitution subject to the limitations laid down therein iii The power of <ORG> to amend the Constitution is derived from Arts is in respect of the power to make a law and not of the content of the law made within the scope of its power iv <ORG> it so minded could certainly have conferred an express legislative power on <ORG> to amend the Constitution by ordinary legislative process There is therefore no inherent inconsistency between legislative process and the amending one One need not cavil at the description of amending power as a sovereign power for it is sovereign only viithin the scope of the power conferred by a particular Constitution which may expressly limit the power of amendment both substantive and procedural vi If power to abridge the fundamental rights is denied to <ORG> revolution is not a necessary result It is really a pragmatic solution reconciling the two conflicting doctrines namely that a court finds the law and that it does make law It finds law but restricts its operation to the future If so there is no acceptable reason why the <ORG> in declaring the law in supersession of the law declared by it earlier could not restrict the operation of the law as declared to the future and save the transactions whether statutory or otherwise that were affected on the basis of the earlier law <ORG> as it has the constitutional jurisdiction to declare law binding on all the <ORG>s as it has India the scope of the retrospective operation of the law declared by the supreme <ORG> superseding its earlier decisions is left to its discretion to be moulded in accordance with the justice of the cause or matter before it Applying the doctrine of prospective overruling in the circumstances of the present case the <ORG> declared that this decision would not affect the validity of the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act or other amendments to the Constitution taking away or abridge the fundamental rights It further declared that in future <ORG> will have no power to amend Part III of Abe Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights When there is conflict between that Article and Art A FF iii In Britain there is no distinction between constitutional law and ordinary law as to the procedure of their enactment This may give a distinct character to the law of the Constitutionbut it does not serve to distinguish it from the other laws of the land for the purpose of Art There is nothing to prevent the <ORG> from placing certain matters outside the amending procedure Democracy may be lost if there is no liberty based on law and law based on equality There is a difference between the <ORG> and its agencies such as <ORG> <ORG> the Legislature of the <ORG>s and the local and other authorities vii Our Constitution has given a guaranteed right to the persons whose fundamental rights are affected to move the <ORG> As there is apprehension that the erosion of the right to property may be practised against other fundamental rights it is necessary to call a halt This Court has the power and the jurisdiction to do so The opposite view expressed in <NAME> case was wrong If there was any doubt in the matter it is resolved by the words namely the Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the terms of the bill A ii While there is a whole part devoted to the amendment of the Constitution there is no specific mention of the amendment of the Constitution in Art The mere fact that during the passage of the Constitution by <ORG> residuary power was finally vested in the <ORG> would not therefore mean that it includes the power to amend the Constitution If it has been followed there is no question of testing the amendment of the Constitution On the avail of fundamental rights or in any other way as in the case of ordinary legislation But short of that the power to amend includes the power to add any provision to the Constitution to alter any provision and substitute any other provision in its place or to delete any provision vi There is no express limitation on power of amendment in Art If the Constitution makers intended certain basic provisions in the Constitution and Part III in particular to be not amendable there is no reason why it was not so stated in Art There is no reason why if the word law in Art Article when it talks of the <ORG> making any law refers to the law made under the provisions contained in Ch of Part XI of the Constitution beginning with Art It can have no reference to the Constituent power of amendment under Art power should have been given to amend any provision of the Constitution without any limitations but indirectly that power should be limited by using words of doubtful import in Art must be read as meaning law passed under the ordinary legislative power and not a constitutional amendment Merely because there was some indirect effect on Art and there was no necessity for any ratification under the proviso for amendment of Part HI is not entrenched in the proviso The doctrine accepted here is that courts declare law and that a declaration made by a court is the law of the land and takes effect from the date the law came into force then there is no necessity of applying the principle of prospective overruling for in that case the amendment under Art It is because the power to amend is given by the article that by following its procedure the Constitution stands amended There is no other provision in the Constitution under which these articles can be amended Articles Fifth Schedule Part and Sixth Schedule Para empower the <ORG> to make amendments to certain parts of the Constitution by law and by express provision such law is deemed not to be amendment for the purpose of Art No other article confers the power of amending the Constitution Under the residual power the <ORG> has no competence to make any law with respect to any matter enumerated in Lists II and III of the th Schedule but under Art Moreover a law passed by residual power is passed by virtue of Art iii Article gives the power of amending this Constitution There is no conflict between Arts The two articles operate in different fields the former in the field of law the latter in that of constitutional amendment vii The words fundamental used in regard to rights in Part III and the word guaranteed in Art If it is held that the rights conferred by Part III cannot be abridged or taken away by constitutional amendments all these amendments would be invalid The Constitution makers could not have intended that the rights conferred by Part III could not be altered for giving effect to the policy of Part In exercise of the amending power the <ORG> has ample authority to abridge or take away the fundamental rights under Part III Merely because of possibility of abuse the power cannot be denied The best exposition of the Constitution is that which it has received from contemporaneous judicial decisions and enactments xi There is no provision in the Constitution for calling a convention for its revision or far submission of any proposal for amendment to the referendum If they infringe Art The significant fact that a separate part has been devoted in the Constitution for amendment of the constitution and there is only one Article in that Part shows that both the power and the procedure to amend are enacted in Art There is no room for an implication in the construction ofArt Today at a time when absolutes are discredited it must not be too readily assumed that there are basic features of the Constitution which shackle the amending power and which take precedence over the general welfare of nation and the need for agrarian and social reform xi Even on the assumption that the impugned Act is unconstitutional the principle of stare decisis must be applied to the present case and the plea made by the petitioners for reconsideration of <NAME> case and <NAME> case must be rejected not be used to abridge or take away the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution iii a law amending the Constitution is Law within the meaning of Art On the application of the doctrine of prospective over ruling as enunciated in the judgment the decision will have only prospective operation and <ORG> will have no power to abridge or take away Fundamental Rights from the date of the judgment and read with EntrY of List ii there are no restrictions on the power if the procedure in Art and is an inroad into fundamental rights is beyond the reach of the courts because it falls within the word law in Arts A the learned counsel appearing for the parties the Advocates General appearing for the States and the learned counsel for the interveners have placed their respective viewpoints exhaustively before us for the expression amend has a limited meaning The said summary though not exhaustive broadly gives the various nuances of the contentions raised by the learned counsel who question the validity of the th Amendment We have not noticed the other arguments of Mr <NAME> which are peculiar to the Writ Petition No of as those questions do not arise for decision in the view we are taking on the common questions axe clear and unequivocal and there is no scope for invoking implied limitations on that power further the doctrine of impliedpower has been rejected by the American courts and jurists There are no basic and non basic features of the Constitution everything in the Constitution is basic and it can be amended in order to help the future growth and progress of the country of the Constitution and even if they can be there is nothing in the debates to prove positively that fundamental rights were excluded from amendment Most of the amendments are made out of political necessity they involve questions such is such as to admit qualifications or limitations and therefore the <ORG> must construe them in such a manner as that Article could not control Art The aforesaid contentions only represent a brief summary of elaborate arguments advanced by learned counsel We shall deal in appropriate context with the other points mooted before US Article The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall toy the extent of the contravention be void Article A Notwithstanding anything contained in article no law providing for a the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article article or article Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article A none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part and not withstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent <ORG> to repeal or amend it continue in force The result of the said amendments is that both the said Acts dealing with estates within their wide definition introduced by the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act having been included in the Ninth Schedule are placed beyond any attack on the ground that their provisions are inconsistent with or take away or abridge any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution The <ORG> came to that conclusion on two grounds namely the word law in Art was one made in exercise of legislative power and not constitutional law made in exercise of constituent power and ii there were two articles Arts Two questions arose in that case Whether the amendment Act insofar it purported to take away or abridge the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution fell within the prohibition of Art The learned counsel appearing for both the parties accepted the correctness of the decision in <NAME> case in that Yet <NAME> speaking for the majority agreed with the reasons given in <NAME> case on the first question and <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> away the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III In short the majority speaking through <NAME> agreed that no case had been made out for reviewing the earlier decision and practically accepted the reasons given in the earlier decision After giving his reasons for doubting the correctness of the reasoning given in <NAME> case the learned Judge concluded thus I would require stronger reasons than those given in <NAME> case to make me accept the view that Fundamental Rights were not really fundamental but were intended to be within the powers of amendment in common with the other parts of the Constitution and without the concurrence of the States He also brought out other defects in the line of reasoning adopted in <NAME> case in its preamble which reads We the people of India having solemnly resolved to constitute India into a Sovereign Democratic Republic and to secure to all its citizens justice It demarcates their jurisdiction minutely and expects them to exercise their respective powers without overstepping their limits It empowers the <ORG>s to make laws in respect of matters enumerated in the Lists annexed to Schedule VII It directs it to work for an egalitarian society where there is no concentration of wealth where there is plenty where there is equal opportunity for all to education to work to livelihood The Constitution also enjoins the <ORG> not to make any law which takes away or abridges the said rights and declares such laws to the extent of such inconsistency to be void empowers <ORG> to modify the rights conferred by Part III in their application to the members of the armed forces Art enables it to impose restrictions on the rights conferred by the said parts while martial law is in force in an area Art Article makes the right to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by the said Parts a guaranteed right enables the President by order to declare the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in that order to be suspended that is to say even during emergency only Art namely Any provision of this Constitution may be amended whether by way of variation addition or repeal in the manner provided in this article said thus Now what is it we do We divide the articles of the Constitution under three categories The Constitution has given by its scheme a place of permanence to the fundamental freedoms The incapacity of the <ORG> therefore in exercise of its amending power to modify restrict or impair fundamental freedoms in Part III arises from the scheme of the Constitution and the nature of the freedoms Briefly stated the Constitution declares certain rights as fundamental laws infringing the said rights of social control infringing the said power on <ORG> and the them in specified circumstances if the decisions in <NAME> case and <NAME> case laid down the correct law it enables the same <ORG> to abrogate them with one stroke provided the party in power singly or in combination with other parties commands the neces With this background let us proceed to consider the provisions of Art or from the nature of the articles sought to be amended cannot be accepted for the simple reason that the doctrine of necessary implication cannot be invoked if there is an express sion or unless but for such implication the article will no necessity to imply any plenary power to make any Constitution subject to the Uninfluenced by any foreign doctrines let us look at the provisions of our Constitution subject to the provisions of the Constitution <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India In the field reserved for <ORG> there is Entry which empowers it to make laws in respect of any other matter not enumerated in Lists II and III including any tax not mentioned in either of those lists Article expressly states that <ORG> has exclusive power to make any law with respect to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or State List Subject to the argument based upon the alleged nature of the amending power as understood by jurists in other countries which we shal consider at a later stage it cannot be contended and indeed it was not contended that <ORG> if it were so minded could not have conferred an express legislative power on <ORG> to amend the Constitution by ordinary legislative process Articles and and para of the th Schedule and para of the th Schedule have expressly conferred such power There is therefore no inherent Inconsistency between legislative process and the amending one The residuary power of <ORG> unles there is anything contrary in the Constitution certainly takes in the power to amend the Constitution Can it be said reasonably that a law amending an article is inconsistent with the article amended If an article of the Constitution expressly says that it cannot be amended a law cannot be made amending it as the power of <ORG> to make a law is subject to the said Article is in respect of the power to make a law and not of the content of the law made Within the scope of its power That provision confers power on the President to remove difficulties in the circumstances mentioned in that provision he can by order direct that the Constitution shall during such period as may be specified in that order have effect subject to such adaptations whether by way of modification addition or omission as he may deem to be necessary or expedient There is no force in either of the two criticisms Further there is internal evidence in the Constitution itself which indicates that amendment to the Constitution is a law within the meaning of Art It prima facie takes in constitutional law the introduction of a bill it shall be passed by the two <ORG>s it shall receive the assent of the President This <ORG> said There are gaps in the procedure as to how and after what notice a bill is to be introduced how it is to be passed by each <ORG> and how the President assent is to be obtained The fact that there are other conditions such as a larger majority and in the case of articles mentioned in the proviso a ratification by Legislatures is provided does not make the amendment anytheless a law such a law can contain provisions for amendment of Schedules I and IV indicating thereby that amendments are only made by Legislative process Article which empowers <ORG> by law to abolish or create <ORG> in States para of the th Schedule and para of the th Schedule which enable <ORG> by law to amend the said Schedules also bring out the two ideas that the amendment is law made by legislative process and that but for the fiction introduced it would attract Article The Order in <ORG> had set up a legislature for the territory consisting of the Queen <ORG> and a <ORG> and the law making power was vested in Her Majesty acting with the advice and consent of the <ORG> and <ORG> Under that Act power was given to the said legislature to make laws for peace welfare and good Government of the Colony in all cases whatsoever The <ORG> there fore had except in the case covered by of the Act an unrestricted power to make laws Lord <NAME> upheld the law as the Constitution Act conferred an absolute power upon the legislature to pass any law by majority even though it in substance amended the terms of the Constitution Act In <ORG> <NAME> the facts are these By section of the Ceylon Constitution Order in <ORG> <ORG> shall have power to make laws for the peace Lord <NAME> after considering <NAME> case made the following observations at a legislature has no power to ignore the conditions of law making that are imposed by the instrument which itself regulates its power to make law There is no article in any of the constitutions referred to us similar to article of our Constitution India adopted a different system altogether it empowered the <ORG> to amend the Constitution by the legislative process subject to fundamental rights The Indian Constitution has made the amending process comparatively flexible but it is made subject to fundamental rights Now let us consider the argument that the power to amend is a sovereign power that the said power is supreme to the legislative power that it does not permit any implied limitations and that amendments made in exercise of that power involve political questions and that therefore they are outside judicial review This wide proposition is sought to be supported on the basis of opinions of jurists and judicial decisions It is exercising a peculiar power bestowed upon it by Article Five Posing the question Is other a law about the amending power of the Constitution he answers there is none He would even go to the extent of saying that the sovereignty if it can be said to exist at all is located in the amending body But there are equally eminent authors who express a different view In the same book it is further said that the power to amend the constitution by legislative action does not confer the power to break it any more than it confers the power to legislate on any other subject contrary to the prohibitions Thus for example the American Constitution the oldest of the existing <ORG> asserts that by no process of amendment shall any State without its own consent be deprived of its equal suffrage in the <ORG> while among the <ORG> more recently promulgated those of the Republics of France and Italy each containing a clause stating that the republican form of government cannot be the subject of an amending proposals it is not necessary to multiply citations from text books at length for after going through them carefully we find that there are no considered judgments of the American Courts which would have a persuasive effect in that regard Inasmuch as the governor had forwarded the certified copy of the resolution to the Secretary of <ORG> before being served with a copy of the restraining order issued by the <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> found that there was no longer a controversy susceptible of judicial determination This passage in our view correctly summarises the American law on the subject But none of the authors goes to the extent of saying which is the problem before us that when there are conflicting articles couched in widest terms the court has no jurisdiction to construe and harmonize them It may be that <ORG> seeks to amend the Constitution for political reasons but the <ORG> in denying that power will not be deciding on political questions but will only be holding that <ORG> has no power to amend particular articles of the Constitution for any purpose whatsoever be it political or otherwise We therefore hold that there is nothing in the nature of the amending power which enables <ORG> to override all the express or implied limi tations imposed on that power There is considerable force in this argument This question may arise for consideration only if <ORG> seeks to destroy the structure of the Constitution embodied in the provisions other than in Part III of the Constitution We do not therefore propose to express our opinion in that regard The Constitution came into force on January The occasion for the amendment was that <ORG> in <NAME> State of Bihar held that the Bihar Land Reforms Act passed by the State of Bihar was unconstitutional while <ORG> of Allahabad and Nagpur upheld the validity of corresponding legislations in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh respectively It may be said that the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act was made by <ORG> as this Court recognized the power of <ORG> to amend Part III of the Constitution but it can also be said with some plausi bility that as <ORG> had exercised the power even before the Between and the Legislatures of various <ORG>s made laws bringing about an agrarian revolution in our country zamindaries inams and other intermediary estates were abolished vested rights were created in tenants consolidation of holdings of villages was made ceilings were fixed and the surplus lands transferred to tenants Should we now give retrospectivity to our decision it would introduce chaos and unsettle the conditions in our country Learned counsel for the petitioners as well as those for the respondents placed us on the horns of this dilemma for they have taken extreme positions leamed counsel for the petitioners want us to reach the logical position by holding that all the said laws are void and the learned counsel for the respondents persuade us to hold that <ORG> has unlimited power and if it chooses it can do away with fundamental rights There is an essential distinction between Constitution and statutes There are two doctrines familiar to American Jurisprudence one is described as Blackstonian theory and the other as prospective over ruling which may have some relevance to the present enquiry In the words of <NAME> the said expression means a court should recognize a duty to an nounce a new and better rule for future transactions whenever the court has reached the conviction that an old rule as established by the precedents is unsound even though feeling compelled by stare decisis to apply the old and condemned rule to the instant case and to transactions which had already taken place We apply it to this case because the repeal might work hardship to those who have trusted to its existence Finally there are interests in the administration of justice and the integrity of the judicial process to consider To thus legitimate such an extraordinary procedural weapon that has no bearing on guilt would seriously disrupt the administration of justice Lord <NAME> speaking for <ORG> made the following observations Their Lordships nevertheless recognise that too rigid adherence to precedent may lead to injustice in a particular case and also unduly restrict the proper development of the law They propose therefore to modify their present practice and while treating former decisions of this <ORG> as normally binding to depart from a previous decision when it appears right to do so It will be seen from this passage that <ORG> hereafter in appropriate cases may depart from its previous decision when it appears right to do so and in so departing will bear in mind the danger of giving effect to the said decision retroactivity We consider that what <ORG> means by this statement is that in differing from the precedents it will do so only without interefering with the transactions that had taken place on the basis of earlier decisions Even if the party filing an appeal may not be benefited by it in similar appeals which he may file after the change in the law he will have the benefit It is really a pragmatic solution reconciling the two conflicting doctrines namely that a court finds law and that it does make law It is left to the discretion of the court to prescribe the limits of the retroactivity and thereby it enables it to would the relief to meet the ends of justice In India there is no statutory prohibition against the court refusing to give retroactivity to the law declared by it for the enforcement of the fundamental rights the Supreme <ORG> has the power to issue suitable directions or orders or writs If so we do not see any acceptable reason why it in declaring the law in superses <NAME> sion of the law declared by it earlier could not restrict the operation of the law as declared to future and save the transactions whether statutory or otherwise that were effected on the basis of the earlier law We would lay down the following propositions I The doctrine of prospective over ruling can be invoked only in matters arising under our Constitution it an be applied only by the highest court of the country i the Supreme <ORG> as it has the constitutional jurisdiction to declare an binding on all the courts in India the scope of the retroactive operation of the law declared by the Supreme <ORG> superseding its earlier decisions We have arrived at two conclusions namely <ORG> has no power to amend Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights and this is a fit case to invoke and apply the doctrine or prospective overruling We therefore declare that our decision will not affect the validity of the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act or other amendments made to the Constitution taking away or abridging the fundamental rights We further declare that in future <ORG> will have no power to amend Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights In this case we do not propose to express our opinion on the question of the scope of the amendability of the provisions of the Constitution other than the fundamental rights as it does not arise for consideration before us Nor are we called upon to express out opinion on the question regarding the scope of the amends ability of Part Ill of the constitution otherwise than by taking away or abridging the fundamental rights thereof which only deals with procedure of the Constitution and therefore if it takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III thereof it is void On the application of the doctrine of prospective over ruling as explained by us earlier our decision will have only prospective operation and therefore the said amendments will continue to be valid We declare that the <ORG> will have no power from the date of this decision to amend any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights enshrined therein On the other hand such a restrictive power gives stability to the country and prevents it from passing under a totalitarian or dictatorial regime There is nothing to choose between destruction by amendment or by revolution the former is brought about by totalitarian rule which cannot brook constitutional checks and the other by the discontentment brought about by mis rule Nor are we impressed by the argument that if the power of amendment is not all comprehensive there will be no way to change the structure of our Constitution or abridge the fundamental rights even if the whole country demands for such a change We do not express our final opinion on this important question A final appeal is made to us that we shall not take a different view as the decision in <NAME> case held the field for many years This argument is answered by the remarks made by this Court in the recent judgment in <ORG> <ORG> There a Bench of Judges unanimously held that there was nothing in the Constitution that prevented <ORG> from departing from a previous decision of its own if it was satisfied of its error and of its baneful effect on the general interest of the public In this case as we are satisfied that the said rule of construction is inconsistent with our republican polity and if accepted bristles with anomalies we have no hesitation to reconsider our earlier decision attack under any provisions contained in Part III of the Constitution has been attacked on the ground that the Seventeenth Amendment is in itself unconstitutional The Constitution came into force on January By clause it provided that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law Clause made a special provision to the effect that if any Bill pending at the commencement of the Constitution in the <ORG> of a <ORG> had after it had been passed by such Legis lature been reserved for the consideration of the President and had received his assent then such law would not be called in question though it contravened the provisions of cl relating to compensation Clause provided that any law of the <ORG> enacted not more than eighteen months before the Constitution might be submitted to the President for his certification and if so certified it could not be called in question on the ground that it contravened the provision of cl of Art That Act received the assent of the President as required under cl of Art Then there was an appeal before this Court but while that appeal was pending the First Amendment to the Constitution was made and and in addition provided for insertion of two Articles numbered A and Bin Part III Article A provided that no law providing for the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it was inconsistent with or took away or abridged any of the rights conferred by any provision in part Ill or took away or abridged any of the rights conferred by any provision of Part III A and were invalid on the ground that they related to matters covered by the State List namely item of List and could not therefore be passed by <ORG> law would ordinarily include constitutional law there was a clear demarcation between ordinary law made in the exercise of legislative power and constitutional law made in the exercise of constituent power and in the context of Art Further the nature of these amendments was to add to or alter or delete various other provisions of the Constitution contained in Part III thereof On December came the decision of this Court by which the Kerala Agrarain Reforms Act No It was also urged that the Seventeenth Amendment was legislation with respect to land and <ORG> bad no right to legislate in that behalf and further that as the Seventeenth Amendment provided that the Acts put in the Ninth Schedule would be valid in spite of the decision of the Courts it was unconstitutional The minority however doubted the correctness of the view taken in <NAME> case to the effect that the word law in Art It was because of this doubt thrown on the correctness of the view taken in <NAME> case that the present reference has been made to this Special Bench means that the provisions in the Constitution can be changed so as to important upon them And that this power is of a limited character and does not authorise <ORG> to make any addition to alteration of or deletion of any provision of the Constitution including the provision contained in Part III authorises only those amendments which have the effect of improving the Constitution Thus in effect the argument is that there is a very limited power of amendment under the Constitution It is further urged that apart from these implied limitations there is an express limitation under Art which would actually take away or abridge the rights guaranteed under that Part In effect it is said that even if there are no implied limitations to amend the Constitution under Art the rights guaranteed under Part III cannot be taken away or abridged under Art It is further urged that it was not competent for <ORG> to amend the Constitution by putting a large number of Acts in the Ninth Schedule as the power to legislate with respect to land is solely within the in such a way that <ORG> may not be able to do all these things hold that there are some implied limitations on the amending power and these implied limitations should be that there is no power any where in the Constitution to change the basic features of the Constitution to which reference has already been made It is then urged that there is no express provision in Art under the legislative provisions contained in Chapter I of Part XI read with Chapters II and III of Part of the As to Articles and and the necessity of taking action under the proviso to Art it is urged that there is no change in Arts and which would require following the procedure as to ratification or at any rate such change in other Articles which would have the effect of directly compelling change in Arts and and that in the present case no such direct compulsion arises Lastly as to the argument of fear it is urged that there is always a provision with respect to amendment in written federal Constitutions provides for a comparatively flexible provision for amendment and there is no reason to make it rigid by implying any limitations on that power Further there Is no reason to suppose that all those things will be done by <ORG> which are being urged to deny the power under Art Besides the above reliance is also placed on behalf of the Union of India and the States on the doctrine Therefore even though <NAME> case has stood only for fifteen years there has been a vast agrarian revolution effected on the faith of that decision and this <ORG> should not now go back on what was decided in that case Further there is a proviso for ratification with respect to certain Articles and other provisions of the Constitution including Art The argument is that there is no express provision in terms in Art conferring power on <ORG> to amend the Constitution and in this connection our attention has been invited to an analogous provision in the Constitution of Ireland in Art The very fact that a separate Part has been devoted in the Constitution for amendment thereof and there is only one Article in that Part shows that both the power to amend and the procedure for amendment are to be found in Art If there was any doubt about the matter that doubt in our opinion is resolved by the words to which we have already referred namely the Constitution shall stand amended in the terms of the Bill But we fail to see why when there is a whole Part devoted to the amendment of the Cons titution the power to amend should not be found in that Part if it can be reasonably found there and why Art the marginal note cannot control the meaning of the words in the Article itself and we have no doubt that the words the Constitution shall stand amended in accord the power of amendment of the Irish Constitution which prescribes the procedure for amendment we find no words therein comparable to these words in Art while therefore there is a whole Part devoted to the amendment of the Constitution we do not find any specific mention of the amendment of the Constitution in Art The mere fact that during the passage of the Constitution by <ORG> residuary power was finally vested in the <ORG> would not therefore mean that it includes the power to amend the Cons titution read with item of List therefore there is no doubt in our mind that both the procedure and power to amend the Constitution are to be found in Art read with item of List I which provides for residuary legislative power of <ORG> There is in our opinion another reason why the power to amend the Constitution cannot found in Art The Constitution is the fundamental law and no law passed under mere legislative power conferred by the Constitution can affect any change in the Constitution unless there is an express power to that effect given in the Constitution itself There are a number of Articles in the Constitution which expressly provide for amendment by law as which gives power to make law for the whole or any part of the territory of India by <ORG> is subject to the provisions of this Consti tution and any law made by <ORG> whether under Art which provides a special procedure for amendment of the Constitution should be read along with Arts and therefore the two together give power to <ORG> to pass a law under Art which will amend even those provisions of the Constitution which are not expressly made amendable by law passed under the legislative power of <ORG> the Constitution cannot be I changed by any law passed under the legislative powers contained therein for legislation so passed must conform to the fundamental law we fail to see how a law passed under the residuary power which is nothing more than legislative power conferred on parliament under the Constitution can change the Constitution namely the fundamental law Itself We may in this connection refer to the following passage in The Law Whatever the nature of the written constitution it is clear that there is a fundamental distinction between constitutional law and the rest of the law It will mean that ordinary legislation passed under fundamental law would amend that law and this cannot be done unless there is express provision as in Art to that effect In the absence of such express provisions any law passed under the legislative powers granted under the fundamental law cannot amend it and considering the scheme of the legislative powers conferred by Articles and read with item of List I this to our mind is clear firstly that the power to amend the Constitution is to be found in Art read with item of List for that would make any amendment of the Constitution impossible except with respect to the express provisions contained in certain Articles thereof for amendment by law of the Constitution is not ordinary legislative power and no one can possibly call it ordinary legislative power because the procedure provided for the amendment of the Constitution in Art we find that it is the exercise of constituent power for the purpose of amending the Constitution itself land is very different from the exercise of ordinary legislative power for passing laws which must be in conformity with the Constitution and cannot go against any provision thereof unless there is express provision to that effect to which we have already referred is gone through is not ordinary legislation but an amendment of the Constitution which becoming a part of the fundamental law itself by virtue of the words contained in Art It is urged in this connection on behalf of the Union of India that even though the assent of the President is required under Aft We are of opinion that the President can refuse to give his assent when a Bill for amendment of the Constitution is presented to him the result being that the Bill altogether falls for there is no specific provision for anything further to be done about the Bill in Art as there is in Art If we look at that we must bold that what emerges is not ordinary law passed under the Constitution but something which has the effect of amending the fundamental law itself which could not be done by ordinary legislative process under the Constitution unless there is express provision to that effect We have already referred to such express provisions in various Articles but Art It is also remarkable to note in this connection that the word law which has been used in so many Articles of the Consti tution has been avoided apparently with great care in Art I I I to be a law for such law is open to challenge in courts on various grounds namely on the ground that it violates any fundamental rights or on the ground that <ORG> was not competent to pass it or on the ground that it is in breach of any provision of the Constitution But if the procedure has been followed the Constitution stands amended and there is no question of testing the amendment of the Constitution thereafter on the anvil of fundamental rights or in any other way as in the case of ordinary legislation In view of an this we have no doubt that even though sovereignty in the body which has the power to amend the Constitution and vice versa clearly confer the power to amend the Constitution and also provide the procedure for doing so and that in our opinion is enough for the purpose of deciding whether the Seventeenth Amendment is valid or not Further as we have already stated the power conferred under Art is constituent power to change the fundamental law i the Constitution and is distinct and different from the ordinary legislative power conferred on <ORG> by various other provisions in the Constitution So long as this distinction is kept in mind <ORG> would have the power under Art What is the extent of the power conferred on <ORG> and whether there are any limitations on it express or implied will be considered by us presently But we have no doubt without entering into the question of sovereignty and of whether Art This brings us to the scope and extent of the power conferred for amendment under Art It shows that in law though amendment MAY professedly be intended to make improvements and to alter only in detail in reality it may make a radical change in the provision which is amended In this connection reference has been made to contrast certain other provisions of the Constitution where for example the word amend has been followed by such words as by way of addition variance or repeal see Sixth Schedule paragraph and more or less similar expressions in other Articles of the Constitution it is very difficult to say fact that no such words appear in Art But short of that we are of opinion that the power to amend includes the power to add any provision to the Constitution So far as express limitations are concerned there are none such in Art When it speaks of the amendment of this Constitution it obviously and clearly refers to amendment of any provision thereof including the provisions contained in Part III relating to fundamental rights is concerned there are no limitation whatsoever in the matter of substance on the amending power and any provision of the Constitution be it in Part III and any other Part can be amended under Art and this Wags us to the argument that there are certain basic features of the Constitution which cannot be amended at all and there is an implied limitation on the power of amendment contained in Art We may in this connection refer to the view prevailing amongst jurists in the United States of America as to whether there are any plied limitations on the power of amendment contained in Art There are two lines of thought in this matter in the United States Some jurists take the view that there are certain implied limitations on the power to amend contained in Art On the other hand it is that the more prevalent view amongst jurists in the United States is that there are no implied limitations on the scope of the amending power in Art <NAME> on the Constitutional Law of the United States of America Edition says that probably the correct position is that the amending power embraces everything in other words there are no legal limitations whatever on the power of amendment except what is expressly provided in Art Besides as a matter of fact there is no decision of <ORG> of the United States holding that there are implied limitations on the power of amendment contained in Art We have given careful consideration to the argument that certain basic features of our Constitution cannot be amended under Art reason for coming to this conclusion is that if we were to accept that certain basic features of the Constitution cannot be amended under Art it would only be the courts which would have the power to decide what are basic features of the Constitution and then to declare whether a particular amendment is valid or not on the ground that it amends a particular basic feature or not We fail to see why if there was any intention to make any part of the Constitution unamendable <ORG> failed to indicate it expressly in Art If for example the Constitution makers intended certain provisions in the Constitution and Part III in particular to be not amendable we can see no reason why it was not so stated in Art Copious references were made during the course of arguments to debates in <ORG> and it is urged that it is open to this Court to look into the debates in order to interpret Art We are of opinion that we cannot and should not look into the debates that took place in <ORG> to determine the interpretation of Art But we have no doubt that what was spoken in the debates in <ORG> cannot and should not be looked into in order to interpret Art Craies on Statute Law Sixth Edition at says that it is not permissible in discussing the meaning of an obscure enactment to refer to parliamentary history of a statute in the sense of the debates which took place in <ORG> when the statute was under consideration and supports his view with reference to a large number of English cases In <NAME> Commissioner of Taxation it was said that reference to historical facts can be made in order to interpret a statute There was however no reference to the debates in order to arrive at the meaning of a particular provision of the Constitution there in dispute which used the words the procedure established by law or to define its extent and scope and to determine what it takes in and what it does not which must be interpreted on the words thereof as they finally found place in the Constitution and on those words we have no doubt that there are no implied limitations of any kind on the power to amend given therein It was observed in that case unanimously by a Bench of nine judges that although it may be correct to describe the preamble as a key to the mind of the Constitution makers it form no part of the Constitution and cannot be regarded as the source of any substantive power which the body of the Constitution alone can confer on the Government expressly or by implication This brings us to the question whether the word law in Art includes an amendment of the Constitution and therefore there is an express provision in Art which at least limits the power of amendment under Art to this extent that by such amendment fundamental rights guaranteed by Part cannot be taken away or abridged We have already pointed out that in <NAME> case as well as <NAME> case it has already been held in one case unanimously and in the other by majority that the word law in Art which says that <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void Now we see no reason why if the word law in Art means is that a law made under the constitutional provisions would be tested on the anvil of Part III and if it takes away or abridges rights conferred by Part III it would be void to the extent of the contraventions There are many Articles in the Con stitution which directly for making law in addition to Articles etc We see no difficulty in the circumstances in holding that Art when it talks of the <ORG> making any law refers to the law made under the provisions contained in Ch I of Part XI of the Constitution beginning with Art Article provides that <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the legislature of a <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the <ORG> Article gives exclusive power to <ORG> to make laws with respect to subjects enumerated in List Article gives exclusive power to <ORG> legislatures to make laws with respect to List II Article gives exclusive power to <ORG> to make laws with respect to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or the <ORG> List We are referring to these provisions merely to show that the various provisions in Chapter I of Part XI provide for making laws and these laws are all laws which are made under the legislative power conferred on <ORG> or on <ORG> legislatures under the Constitution it is said that the <ORG> shall not make any law <ORG> there including <ORG> and legislature of each <ORG> its meaning could only take in laws made by <ORG> and <ORG> legislatures under the powers conferred under Chapter I of Part XI read item of List I Therefore an amendment of the Constitution is not an ordinary law made under the powers conferred under Chapter I of Part XI of the Constitution and cannot be subject to Art We have already referred to a large number of Articles where <ORG> is given the power to make law with respect to those Articles prohibits the <ORG> from making any law which takes away or abridges rights conferred by Part III it is only referring to ordinary legislative power conferred on <ORG> and legislatures of <ORG>s and cannot halve any reference to the constituent power for amendment of the Constitution contained in Art we see no reason why an express provision to that effect was not made in Art We are unable to accept this contention for we have no doubt that Art there is no express provision that amendment of the Constitution under Art no express provision is made to this effect and in both places the matter is left in a state of uncertainty the word law which we find so often used in so many Articles of the Constitution is conspicuously avoided and it is specifically provided that after the procedure has been gone through the Constitution shall stand amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill If We keep in mind this difference between constitutional amendment or constitutional law and an ordinary amending Act or law it should not be difficult to hold that when Art speaks of the St ate making a law it is referring to ordinary law made under the powers conferred by Art speaks of making law it can only refer to making ordinary law particularly when we compare the words of Art and which all speak of <ORG> making law <ORG> legislatures making law and so on There is nothing to suggest this even in the inclusive definition of the words law and laws in force in Art Besides it is conceded on behalf of the petitioners that Art must say that it would require a very clear provision in the Constitution to read the power to amend the Constitution relating to Part III in this manner We cannot find that clear provision in Art We repeat that when <ORG> was taking the trouble of providing a whole Part for amendment of the Constitution and when the words in Art as meaning law passed under ordinary legislative power and thus not including an amendment of the Constitution therein We have therefore no hesitation in agreeing with the view taken in <NAME> case which was upheld by the majority in <NAME> case It is said that by including various Acts in the Ninth Schedule and making them immune from challenge under the provisions contained in Part III the power of <ORG> under Art is affected inasmuch as <ORG> cannot strike down any of the Acts included in the Ninth Schedule on the ground that they take away or abridge the rights conferred by Part III A similar argument was raised in <NAME> case and was turned down unanimously The same argument was again raised in <NAME> case and was also turned down We are of opinion that when the proviso lays down that there must be ratification when there is any change in the entrenched provisions including Art If there is no actual change directly in the entrenched provision no ratification is required even if any amendment of any other provision of the Constitution may have some effect indirectly on the entrenched provisions mentioned in the proviso But what was meant in <NAME> case was that if there is such an amendment of an unentrenched Article that it will directly affect an entrenched Article and necessitate a change therein then recourse must be had to ratification under the proviso We may illustrate this by two examples Article lays down inter alia that <ORG> shall have power to issue writs for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any other purpose If that takes place it will necessitate an amendment of Art also and deletion therefrom of the words for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III We have no doubt that if such a contingency ever happens and Part III is completely deleted <ORG> will amend Art and which deal with the election of the President and the manner thereof and if it is so the entire amendment must be submitted for ratification But short of that we are of opinion that merely because there is some effect indirectly on an entrenched Article by amendment of an unentrenched Article it is not necessary that there should be ratification in such circumstances also Besides let us consider what would happen if the argument on behalf of the petitioners is accepted that ratification is necessary whenever there is even indirect effect on an entrenched Article by amending an unentrenched Article It gives power to <ORG> not only to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights but to issue them for any other purpose Writs have thus been issued by <ORG> for enforcing other rights conferred by ordinary laws as well as under other provisions of the Constitution like Arts Further take an ordinary law which confers certain rights and it is amended and those rights are taken away Therefore on this argument even if there is amendment of ordinary law there would be an effect on Art It is however said that when ordinary law is amended rights disappear and therefore there is no question of enforcement thereof if that is correct with respect to ordinary law it is in our opinion equally correct with respect to the amendment of an unentrenched provision of the Constitution The answer given in <NAME> case to this argument was that Art We respectfully agree with these observations and are of opinion that merely because there is some indirect effect on Art and our answer is the same namely that there is no direct effect on Art deals with State legislation and in any case <ORG> cannot make any law with respect to Acts which were put in the Ninth Schedule and therefore <ORG> could not amend the Constitution in the manner in which it was done by making additions in the Ninth Schedule both for want of ratification and for want of legislative competence That laws thus saved relate to matters covered by List II does not in any way affect the position It was said that <ORG> could not validate a law which it had no power to enact the validity of the impugned provision turns on whether the subject matter falls within or without the jurisdiction of the legislature which passed it But to make a law which contravenes the Constitution constitutionally valid is a matter of constitutional amendment and as such it falls within the exclusive power of <ORG> We respectfully agree with these observations and there was no question of the application of the proviso in such a case for <ORG> was amending Part III only with respect to these laws and there was no necessity for any ratification under the proviso for amendment of Part III is not entrenched in the proviso Nor is there any force in the argument that <ORG> could not validate those laws by curing the constitutional infirmity because they dealt with land which is in List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution over which <ORG> Legislatures have exclusive legislative power The laws had already been passed by <ORG> legislatures under their exclusive powers what has been done by the Seventeenth Amendment is to cure the constitutional infirmity if any in these laws in relation to Part III We must therefore reject the argument that the Seventeenth Amendment required ratification because laws put in the Ninth Schedule were <ORG> law We must equally reject the argument that as these laws dealt with land which is in the exclusive legislative power of <ORG> legislature <ORG> could not cure the constitutional infirmity if any in these laws by putting them in the Ninth Schedule It is therefore argued that we should give a limited interpretation to the power of amendment contained in Art as otherwise we shall be giving power to <ORG> to destroy the Constitution itself But as the argument was urged with a good deal of force on behalf of the petitioners and was met with equal force on behalf of the Union and the States we propose to deal with it briefly If the Constitution gives a certain power and its terms are clear there is no reason why that power should be withheld simply because of possibility of abuse If we may say so possibility of abuse of any power granted to any authority is always there and if possibility of abuse is a reason for withholding the power no power whatever can ever be conferred on any authority be it executive legislative or even judicial Therefore the so called fear of frightful consequences which has been urged on behalf of the Petitioners if we hold as we do that the power to amend the Constitution is unfettered by any implied limitations is no ground for withholding the power for we have no reason to suppose that <ORG> on whom such power is conferred will abuse it The argument for giving a limited meaning to Art It is said that the Constitution is an organic document for the governance of the country and it is expected to endure and give stability to the institution which it provides various Constitutions of the world shows that there are usually provisions for amendment of the Constitution in the Constitution itself It is admitted by even those writers on the United States Constitution who are of the view that there are certain basic features which cannot be amended and who would thus make the Constitution even more rigid than it is that howsoever rigid the Constitution may be its rigidity will not stop the people from breaking it if they have outgrown it and this breaking is generally speaking by violent revolution Besides it also provides for ratification by more than half the States in case of entrenched Provisions in the proviso If on those terms it is clear we think it is that power to amend is subject to no limitations except those to be expressly found in the Constitution courts must give effect to that It is because of this circumstance that we have had so many amendments in the course of the last sixteen years that the interpretation that we have given to Art is in consonance with the terms thereof and the intention of those who made it We therefore reject the argument of fear altogether This brings us to the argument of stare decisis raised on behalf of the Union of India and the States We are of opinion that there is force in this argument <NAME> case was not correctly decided and thus disturb all that has been done during the last fifteen years and create chaos into the lives of millions We would in the circumstances accept the argument on behalf of <ORG> and the States that this is the fittest possible case in which the principle of stare decisis should be applied We have so far been following in this country the well known doctrine that courts declare law and that a declaration made by a court is the law of the land and takes effect from the date the law came into force it would be impossible to apply the doctrine of prospective over ruling in our country particularly where a law infringes fundamental rights laws taking away or abridging fundamental rights would be void to the extent of contravention went to the root of the State power of legislation and any law made in contravention of that provision was void ab initio does not include an amendment of the Constitution then there is no necessity of applying the principle of prospective over ruling for in that case unless some limitations on the power of amendment of the Constitution are implied the amendment under Art Lastly we would refer to the following observations in <NAME> case at pp with respect to over ruling earlier judgments of this Court and specially those which are unanimious like <NAME> case It is true that the Constitution does not place any restriction on our powers to review our earlier decisions or even to depart from them and there can be no doubt that in matters relating to the decision of constitutional points which have a significant impact on the fundamental rights of citizens we would be prepared to If the said decision has been followed in a large number of cases that again is a factor which must be taken into account These principles were applied in <NAME> case and it was observed that if <NAME> case were to be overruled it would lead to the inevitable consequence that the amendments made in the Constitution both in and would be rendered invalid and a large number of decisions dealing with the validity of the Acts included in the Ninth Schedule which have been pronounced by different <ORG> ever since the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case was declared would also be exposed even so in View of the argument raised and the importance of the question it considered the arguments against that decision and came to the conclusion its that that case was rightly decided We may add that besides so many cases in <ORG> there have been a large number of cases in this Court to which it is unnecessary to refer where on the faith of various amendments made in the Constitution particularly the First the Fourth and the Sixteenth amending fundamental rights this Court has upheld the validity of various Acts on the basis of these amendments We say this with great respect and would hold that apart from the principle of stare decisis we should not say that the The <ORG> submits that except as stated in the article there are no limitations on the amending power and denies that there are any implied restrictions I closed my opinion with the following observations I would require stronger reasons than those given in <NAME> case to make me accept the view that Fundamental Rights were not really fundamental but were intended to be within the powers of amendment in common with the other parts of the Constitution and without the concurrence of the States the rights of society are made paramount and they ire placed above those of the individual I say it with respect that I felt then as I do so even more strongly now that in the two earlier cases the result was reached by a mechanical juris prudence in which harmonious construction was taken to mean that unless Art The true principle is that if there are two provisions in the Constitution which seem to be hostile juridical hermeneutics requires the <ORG> to interpret them by combining them and not by destroying one with the aid of the other Article which says that the Constitution may be amended by following this and this which says the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III and that any law made in contravention of the clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void the Madras <ORG> Resolution of a constitution on the basis of declaration of rights the Nehru Report it is obviour that our first care should be to have the

<ORG> and lastly <ORG> are just a few of the steps to be remembered the <ORG> has an acknowledged right to modify the Constitution as therefore the Constitution may undergo perpetual changes it does not in reality exist the <ORG> is at once a legislative and a constituent assembly of course the dictum of <NAME> that the English Constitution elle existe point it does not exist is far from accu Dicey Law of the Constitution th Edn There is a vast body of constitutional laws in England which is written and statutory but it is not all found in one place and arranged as a written Constitution usually is In our Constitution also the laws relating to delimitation of constituencies or allotment of seats to such constituencies made or purporting to be made under Art This may give a distinct character to the law of the Constitution but it does not serve to distinguish it from the other laws of the land for purposes of Art The Ame Constitution and our Constitution itself are outstanding examples There are certain other differences of degree such as that nary legislation may be tentative or temporary more detailed or secondary while the Constitution is intended to be permanent general and primary There are fundamental differences between our Con American Jurispruence Vol But there is nothing to prevent the <ORG> from limiting itself In some of the Constitutions there is an attempt to put a restriction against the <ORG> seeking to whittle down the rights conferred on the individual But there is nothing to prevent the <ORG> from rpo limiting itself In some of the Constitutions there is an attempt to put a restriction Against the <ORG> seeking to whittle down the rights conferred on the individual There is nothing however to prevent the State from placing certain matters outside the amending procedure There is no third alternative In the Constitution of Brazil the Constitution cannot be amended when there is a state of seige our emergency I am mindful of the observations of Justice <NAME> that We need education in the obvious to learn to transcend our own convictions and to leave room for much that we hold dear to be done away with short of revolution by the orderly change of law In such a case the apprehension is that democracy may be lost if there is no liberty based on law and law based on equality Article which I quoted earlier may again be read here The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of contravention be void There are others who hold to liberty and freedom of the Compare the attitude of <NAME> who would have Communism provided there was universal freedom of speech of association of elections and of <ORG> To such the liberty and dignity of the Individual are inviolable Having established that there is no difference between the ordinary legislative and the amending processes in so far as cl of Aft In Britain the question whether a constitutional amendment is valid or not at arise because the courts are powerless <ORG>ary Sovereignty under the English Constitution means that <ORG> enjoys the right to make or unmake any law whatever and no person or body has any right to question the legislation After recalling the texts of the Article under which Amendments may be made and of the th Amendment proposed by the <ORG> in and proclaimed as ratified by the States in the <ORG> announced Although there is no clear pronouncement a great contro versy exists whether questions of substance can ever come before the <ORG> and whether there are any implied limitations upon the amendatory Power In the two cases inwhich the express limitation of Equal suffrage Clause was involved the <ORG> did not enter the question Bryce Weaver Mathews <NAME> <NAME> Willis <NAME> <NAME> to name only a few are of the opinion that there are no implied limitations although as <NAME> points out it is sometimes expressly declared what indeed is implied without the declaration that everything in the declaration of rights contained is excepted out of the general powers of Government and all laws contrary thereto shall be void views of the several writers and so I shall confine myself to the observation of <NAME> to whom again and again counsel for the <ORG> turned either for support or inspiration ing to him there are no implied limitations unless the <ORG>s adopt In our country amendments so far have bean made only with the object of negativing <ORG> decisions but more of it later The process of amendment in the United <ORG>s is clearly not a legislative process and there is no provision like Art Our liberal Constitution has given to the Individual all that he should have freedom of speech of association of assembly of religion of motion and locomotion of property and trade and profession It has given a guaranteed right to the person affected to move the Court <NAME> agreed that there was a lot of truth in it ll ya du vrai dans cette boutade I agree with <NAME> in these observations taken from his book In the most inalienable of such rights a distinction must be made between possession of a right and its exercise No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The deprivation when it takes place is not of the right which was immutable but of the continued exercise of the right There is a legal method A new clause was added which reads Nothing in this article or in clause of article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes It is argued by counsel for the <ORG> that by lifting the ban to make special provision for backward classes of citizens there is discrimination against the higher classes had provided that the <ORG> shall promote with special care their educational and economic interests The changes may be seen by comparing the unamended and the amended clauses side by side All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression Before Amendment After Amendment Nothing in sub clause a of clause Nothing in sub clause a of clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to or prevent the <ORG> from making any law relating to libel slander defamation contempt of <ORG> or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security or tends to overthrow the <ORG> in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause in the interest of the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence The amendment was necessary because in <NAME> <ORG> of Madras it was held that disturbances of public tranquallity did not come within the expression undermines the secu The Amending Act passed by <ORG> also included a sub section which read No law in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of the Constitution which is consistent with the provisions of article of the Constitution as amended by sub section of this section shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground only that being a law which takes away or abridges the right conferred by sub clause a of clause I of the said article its operation was not saved by clause of that article as originally enacted Tuming now to clause we may read the original and the amended clause side by side All citizens shall have the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business Before Amendment Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause and in particular nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it prescribes or empowers any authority to prescribe or prevent the <ORG> from making any law prescribing or empowering any authority to prescribe the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business After Amendment Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause and in particular nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to or prevent the <ORG> from making any law relating to i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business or ii the carrying on by the <ORG> or a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise The first change is in the verbiage and is not one of substance Sub clause to the generality of which the original clause created some exceptions allowed the <ORG> to make laws imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the sub clause If it was considered that this right in the state was required in the interests of the general public then the exercise of the right to practise profession or to carry on an occupation trade or business could be suitably curtailed Before Amendment Nothing in this article shall prevent <ORG> from making any law prescribing in regard to a class or classes of employment or appointment to an office under any <ORG> specified in the First Schedule or any local or other authority within its territory any requirement as to residence within the <ORG> prior to such employment or appointment After Amendment Nothing in this article shall prevent <ORG> from making any law prescribing in regard to a class or classes of employment or appointment to an office under the Government of or any local authority within a State or Union territory any requirement as to residence within that State or Union territory prior to such employment or appointment This brings me to the main question in this case It is whether the amendments of the part Right to Property in Part III of the Constitution were legally made or not Today there are three articles A and and the Ninth Schedule No property movable or immovable including any interest in or in any company owning any commercial or industrial undertaking shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principle on which and the manner No such law as is referred to in clause If any Bill pending at the commencement of this Constitution in the <ORG> State has after it has been passed by such <ORG> been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent then notwithstanding anything in this constitution the law so assented to shall not be Called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause Nothing in clause shall affect a the provisions of any existing law other than a law to which the provisions of clause apply or the provisions of any law which the State may hereafter make i for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty or ii for the promotion of public health or the prevention of danger to life or property or iii in pursuance of any agreement entered into between the Government of the Dominion of India or <ORG> and the Government of Any law of the State enacted not more than eighteen months before the commencement of this Constitution may within three months from such commencement be submitted to the President for his certification and thereupon if the President by public notification so certifies it shall not be called in question in any court on the ground that it contravenes the provisions of clause of this article or has contravened the provisions of sub section of section of the Government of India Act which reads All citizens shall have the right to acquire hold and dispose of property The question may now be asked why was it necessary to make such a Fundamental Right at all There is no natural right in property and as <NAME> said in his Reflections Government is not made in virtue of natural rights which may and do exist in total independence of it There was personal liberty and private law but there was no sharp division between the different kinds of laws Time was when there was a lot of free property which was open for appropriation It has been very aptly said that all private property is a system of monopolies and the right to monopolise lies at the foundation of the institution of property An extremely valuable definition of ownership is to be found in the Restatement of the Law of Property where it is said It is the totality of rights as to any specific objects which are accorded by law at any time and place after deducting social reservations Later we find it in many The Institution of Property Even in the most democratic of Constitutions namely the West German Constitution of there was a provision that lands minerals and means of production might be socialised or subjected to control but it seems that <ORG> was quite content that under it the <ORG> would have no say in the matter of compensation He conceded that land would be required for public purposes but hopefully added not only land but so many other things may have to be acquired However the decisions of the High Courts and <ORG> interpreting and expounding this philosophy took a different view of compensation A and which are respectively headed saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates etc Saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates etc Notwithstanding anything in foregoing provisions of this Part no law providing for the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or for Grotius De jure Belli ac Pacis the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is consistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part Provided that where such law is a law made by <ORG> the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article A none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provision of this Part and notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent <ORG> to repeat or amend it continue in force A law of the <ORG> could do these with the President assent although it took away or abridged any of the rights conferred by any provisions of Part Ill A because a it was not considered at the hearing of this case and it has stood for a long time as part of the Constitution under the decision of this <ORG> and has been acquiesced in by the people If I was free I should say that the amendment was not legal and certainly not justified by the reasons given in the earlier cases of this <ORG> was substituted by No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and other fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate the concept of just compensation the amendment added a new clause A as follows A Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or control led by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property A was substituted and was deemed to be always substituted by a new clause which provided Notwithstanding anything contained in article no law providing for a the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights or the taking over of the management of any property by the <ORG> for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property or amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of any of the corporation or the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing agents secretaries and treasurers managing directors directors or managers of corporations or of any voting rights of shareholders thereof or the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease or licence for the purpose of searching for or winning any mineral or mineral oil or the premature termination or cancellation of any such agreement lease or licence shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Art I entertain considerable doubt A Constituent Assembly makes a new Constitution for itself It may however be stated here that if I was free to consider it I would have found great difficulty in accepting that the constitutional guarantee could be abridged in this way I may say here that the method I have followed in not recon sidering an amendment which has stood for a long time was also invoked by <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> There is no reference in this to any judiciary coming into the picture That it has there is no doubt just as there is no doubt that each time the individual rights have suffered land tenures in force in that area and shall also include i any jagir inam or muafi or other similar grant and in the States of Madras and Kerala any janmam right ii any land held under ryotwari settlement iii any land held or let for purposes of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto including waste land forest land land for pasture or sites of buildings and other structures occupied by cultivators of land agricultural labourers and village artisans The only saving of compensation is now to be found in the second proviso added to clause of the article which reads Provided further that where any law makes any provision for the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land building or structure provides for payment of compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof There is also the provision for compensation introduced indirectly in an Explanation at the end of the Ninth Schedule in respect of the Rajasthan Tenancy Act The same is also true of the taking over of the management of any property by the <ORG> for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property or the amalgamation of two or more companies or the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing agents secretaries treasurers managing directors directors or managers of corporations or of any voting right of shareholders thereof any rights by virtue of an agreement lease or licence for the purpose of searching for or winning any mineral or mineral oil or of the premature termination It will be noticed further that deprivation of property of any person is not to be regarded as acquisition or requisition unless the benefit of the transfer of the ownership or right to possession goes to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> It took fifty eight years for the words of <NAME> lone dissent to to become the law of the united states at least in respect of segregation in the public schools See <NAME> Board of Education If a halt is to be called we must declare the right of <ORG> to abridge or take away Fundamental Rights This Court has the power and jurisdiction to make the declaration I dissent from the opposite view expressed in <NAME> case and I overrule that decision There is no kind of agricultural estate or land which cannot be acquired by the <ORG> even though it pays an illusory compensation Since no law providing for the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Art This brings me to the third section of the Act The article gives power to no particular person or persons the Constitution itself makes distinctions Our Constitution has done the same My conclusions are i that the Fundamental Rights are outside the amendatory process if the amendment seeks to abridge or take away any of the rights ii that <NAME> case and <NAME> case which followed it conceded the power of amendment over Part III of the Constitution on an erroneous view of Arts The contention that article prescribes only the procedure of amendment cannot be accepted The article not only prescribes the procedure but also gives the power of amendment It is because the power to amend is given by the article that the Constitution stands amended There is no other provision in the Constitution under which these articles can be amended Articles Fifth Schedule Part and Sixth Schedule Para empower the <ORG> to No other article confers the power of amending the Constitution Some articles are expressed to continue until provision is made by law see articles and Some articles continue unless provision is made otherwise by law see articles and some continue save as otherwise provided by law see articles Some articles are subject to the provisions of any law to be made see articles and some are expressed not to derogate from the power of making laws see articles to All these articles are transitory in nature and cease to operate when provision is made by law on the subject Most of articles continue until provision is made by law made by the <ORG> Many of the above mentioned articles and also other articles see articles to A to delegate powers of making laws to the legislature Like other powers of legislation the residual power of the <ORG> to make laws is by virtue of art Under the residual power of legislation the <ORG> has no power to make any law with respect to any matter enumerated in Lists II and III of the th Schedule but under art Nobody has doubted that the section gives the power of amending the Constitution Article gives the power of amending this Constitution From time to time major amendments have been made in the articles mentioned in the proviso see articles to A A IA and Seventh Schedule and other articles see articles is in these terms The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the tights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void Between these alternatives there is no middle ground The bill must be passed in each <ORG> by not less than two thirds of the members present and voting the requisite quorum in each <ORG> being a majority of its total membership and in cases coming under the proviso the amendment must be ratified by the legislature of not less than one half of the States the body which created the right can surely take it away by the same process The two articles operate in different fields It does not particularly refer to the articles in Part III and many other articles but on its true construction it gives the power of amending each and every provision of the Constitu tion and necessarily takes in Part III The next contention is that there are implied limitations on the amending power there are expressions in Part III which indicate that the amending power cannot touch Part III The right to move <ORG> for enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed by art While the Constitution is static it is the fundamental law of the country the rights conferred by Part III are fundamental the right under art Soon after the Constitution came into force it became apparent that laws for agrarian and other reforms for implementing the directives of Part IV were liable to be struck down as they infringed the provisions of Part III It is to be noticed however that before the First amendment no attempt was made to overrule these cases and but for the amendments these judicial interpretations of the Constitution would have continued to be the law of the land The validity of the First Amendment was upheld in <NAME> case The validity of the Seventeenth amendment was upheld in <NAME> case If the rights conferred by Part III cannot be abridged or taken away by constitutional amendments all these amendments would be invalid There are other indications in the Constitution that the fundamental rights are not intended to be inviolable I find nothing in the passage contrary to the view unequivocally expressed by the same learned Judge in <NAME> case that the fundamental rights are amendable In the exercise of the amending power the <ORG> has ample authority to abridge or take away the fundamental rights under Part III The decision totally negatived the contention that an amendment must be confined in its scope to an alteration or improvement of that which is already contained in the Constitution and cannot change its basic structure include new grants of power to <ORG> nor relinquish in the <ORG> those which already have been granted to it see Cooley on Constitutional Law Chapter III Art XVI title Constitutional Law thus The term amendment a used in the constitutional article giving <ORG> a power of proposal includes additions to as well as corrections of matters already treated and there is nothing there which suggests that it is used in a restricted sense The Seventeenth Amendment has not derogated from the sovereignty the republican form of government and the federal structure and the question whether they can be touched by amendment does not arise for decision In a special article written on August Sir <NAME> remarked It seems rather illogical that a constitution should be settled by a simple majority by an assembly elected indirectly on a very limited franchise and that it should not be capable of being amended in the same way by a <ORG> elected and perhaps for the most Part elected directly by adult suffrage see <NAME> India Constitution in the making nd Edition The best exposition of the Constitution is that which it has received from contemporaneous judicial decisions and enactments There is no provision in the Constitution for calling a convention for its revision or for submission of any proposal for amendment to the referendum gives power to <ORG> throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction to issue to any person or authority within those territories directions orders and Writs for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III and for any purpose The Seventeenth Amendment made no direct change in art It made changes in Part In and abridged or took away some of the rights conferred by that Part As a result of the changes some of those rights no longer exist and as <ORG> cannot issue writs for the enforcement of those rights its power under art This power to make laws is subject to the limitations imposed by Part The abridgement of the rights conferred by Part III by the Seventeenth Amendment necessarily enlarged the scope of the legislate power and thus affected art is a law with respect to land and other matters within the competence of <ORG> and the <ORG> has no power to enact such a law The Act as they stood on the date of the Constitution Amendments are validated Revolutionary social and economic changes have taken place on the strength of the First Fourth and Seventeenth Amendments Having heard lengthy arguments on the question I have come to the conclusion that the validity of the constitutional amendments was rightly upheld in <NAME> and <NAME> cases and I find no reason for over ruling them The argument for the petitioners suffers from a double fallacy the first that the <ORG> has no power to amend Part III so as to abridge or take away the entrenched property rights and the second that the Judges have the power to make such an amend ment If they infringed art Moreover the Seventeenth amendment has been acted upon and its validity has been upheld by this Court in <NAME> case Before concluding this judgment I must refer to some of the speeches made by the members of <ORG> in the course of debates on the draft Constitution To know how simple are the provisions of the Draft Constitution in respect of amending the Constitution one has only to study the provisions for amendment contained in the American and Australian Constitutions He said The condemnation of the Constitution largely comes from two quarters <ORG> and <ORG> The second thing that the Socialists want is that the Fundamental Rights mentioned in the Constitution must be absolute and without any limitations so that if their <ORG> comes into power they would have the unfettered freedom not merely to criticize but also to overthrow the <ORG> <NAME> the great American statesman who played so great a part in the making of the American Constitution has expressed some very weighty views which makers of Constitution can never afford to ignore that we in the like manner can make laws and impose burdens on future generations which they will have no right to alter in fine that the earth belongs to the dead and not the living One has only to examine the provision relating to the amendment of the Constitution shall be governed or who shall govern it and therefore all such clauses acts or declarations by which the makers of them attempt to do what they have neither the right nor the power to do nor take power to execute are in themselves null and void The parlia ment of the people of or of any other period had no more right to dispose of the people of the present day or to bind or to controul them in any shape whatever than the parliament or the people of the present day have to dispose of bind or controul those who are to live a hundred or a thousand years hence When man ceases to be his power and his wants cease with him and having no longer any participation in the concerns of this World he has no longer any authority in directing who shall be its governors or how its government shall be organized or how administered <NAME> <NAME> I have perused the judgment of my learned Brother <NAME> <NAME> and I agree with his conclusion that the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act is legally valid but in view of the importance of the constitutional issues raised in this case I would prefer to state my own reasons in a separate judgment of the Constitution a common question arises for determination viz The impugned Act consists of three sections This proviso reads thus Provided further that where any law makes any provision for the acquisition by the State of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation it shall not be lawful for the State to acquire any portion of such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land building or structure provides for payment of compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof A a the expression estate shall in relation to any local area have the same meaning as that expression or its local equivalent has in the existing law relating force in that area and all to land tenures in also include i any jagir inam or muafi or other similar grant and in the States of Madras and Kerala any ianmam right ii any land held under ryotwari settlement iii any land held or let for purposes of agriculture or for purposes ancillary there to including wast land forest land land for posture or ones of buildings and other structures occupied by cultivators of land agricultural labourers and village artisans Section amends the th Schedule by adding entries to it Certain zamindars feeling themselves aggrieved attacked the validity of those Acts in courts of law on the ground that they contravened the fundamental rights conferred on them by Part III of the Constitution The parties aggrieved by these respective decisions had filed appeals by special leave before this <ORG> The object of this amendment was to widen the scope of agrarian reform and to confer on the legislative measures adopted in that behalf immunity from a possible attack that they contravened the fundamental rights of citizens In other words the amendment Protected the legislative measures in respect of certain other items of agrarian and social welfare legislation which affected the proprietary rights of certain citizens expressly provided that none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the th Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground that they were inconsistent with or took away or abridged any of the rights conferred by Part III and it added that notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any <ORG> or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent legislature to repeal or amend continue in force It appears that notwithstanding these amendments certain other legislative measures adopted by different States for the purpose of giving effect to the agrarian policy of the party in power were effectively challenged The first question presented for determination in this case is whether the impugned Act in so far as it purports to take away or abridge any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III which provides that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the Contravention be void In other words the argument of the petitioners was that the law to which Art applies would include a law passed by <ORG> by virtue of its constituent power to amend the Constitution and so its validity will have It was said that it was the deliberate intention of the framers of the Constitution who realised the sanctity of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III to make them immune from interference not only by ordinary laws passed by the legislatures in the country but also from constitutional amendments In my opinion there is no substance in this argument Although law must ordinarily include constitutional law there is a juristic distinction between ordinary law made in exercise of legislative power and constitutional law which is Made in exercise of constituent power In a written federal form of Constitution there is a clear and well known distinction between the law of the Constitution and ordinary law made by the legislature on the basis of separation of powers and pursuant to the power of law making conferred by the Consti tution See <NAME> on Law of the Constitution Tenth Edn I ad it been intended by the Constitution makers that the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III should be completely outside the scope of Art it is reasonable to assume that they would have made an express provision to that effect guarantee the right to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of rights conferred by Part But the expression fundamental in the phrase Fundamental Rights means that such rights are fundamental vis a vis the laws of the legislatures and the acts of the executive authorities mentioned in Art and means that the right to move <ORG> for enforcement of fundamental rights without exhausting the normal channels through <ORG> or the lower courts is guaranteed I proceed to consider the next question arising in this case the scope of the amending power under Art It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that Art I am unable to accept this argument as correct Part XX of the Constitution which contains only Art which prescribes the procedure for amendment of the Constitution begins by saying that an amendment of this Constitution may be initiated in the manner therein indicated The significant fact that a separate Part has been devoted in the Constitution for amendment of the Constitution and there is only one Article in that Part shows that both the power to amend and the procedure to amend are enacted in Art Besides the words used in the proviso unambiguously indicate that the substantive part of the article applied to all the provisions of the Constitution Article stats that <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule and Art It is apparent that the power of constitutional amendment cannot fall within these Articles because it is illogical and a contradiction in terms to say that the amending power can be exercised and at the same time it is subject to the provisions of the Constitution It was then submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the amending power under Art If the Constitution makers considered that there were certain basic features of the Constitution which were permanent it In MY opinion there is no room for an It was pointed out in that case that there was no constitutional guarantee against the alteration of boundaries of the <ORG>s the <ORG> is by law authorised to form a new <ORG> by redistribution of the territory of a <ORG> or by uniting two or more <ORG>s or parts of <ORG>s or by uniting any territory to a part of any <ORG> to increase the area of any <ORG> to diminish the area of any <ORG> to alter the boundaries of any <ORG> and to alter the name of any <ORG> is clear and unambiguous in support of the view that there is no implied limitation on the amending power In modern democratic thought I there are two main trends the liberal idea of individual rights If such a Bill has been passed and assented to by the President the <ORG> shall have no jurisdiction to question the validity of such law on the of contravention of cl ie If the President certifies such an Act within months from the commencement of the Constitution the <ORG> shall have no jurisdiction to invalidate that Act on the ground of contravention of cl of that Article Similarly the scheme of Art indicates that the fundamental rights guaranted by sub cls The Constitution makers must have anticipated that in dealing with socioeconomic problems which the egislatures may have to face from time to time the concepts of public interest and other important considerations which are the basis of cls Today at a time when absolutes are discredited it must riot be too readily assumed that there are basic features of the Constitution which shackle the amending power and which take precedence over the general welfare of the nation and the need for agrarian and social reform As <NAME> has said In all those cases in which owing to the distribution of governing power there is doubt as to the political body in which the Sovereignty rests the test to be applied is the determination of which authority has in the last instance the legal power to determine its own competence as well as that of others The legal position is summarised by <NAME> at page of his treaties The Law of the American Constitution as follows The result of the National Prohibition Cases seems to be that there is no limit to the power to amend the Constitution except that a State may not without its consent be deprived of its equal suffrage in the <ORG> can make a law to give effect to and implement the Agreement in question or to pass a law amending Art <NAME> There is also another aspect of the matter to be taken into account It was held in that case that the injunction was properly issued against the calling of a referendum election on the act of the legislature of a State ratifying an amendment to the Federal Constitution it follows that there is no way to incorporate it and others of like character into the national organic law except through revolution It was then contended for the petitioners that there would be anomalies if Art In my opinion the argument proceeds on a misconception Both Mr <NAME> <NAME> and Mr <NAME> resorted to the method of reduction ad absurdem MI pointing out the abuses that might occur if there were no limitations on the power to amend and of the Constitution clearly showS that <ORG> has no right to make a law in respect of land and since the impugned Act is a legislative measure in relation to land it is in Valid Whet the impugned Act purports to do is not to make any land legislation but to protect and validate the legislative measures in respect of agrarian reforms passed by the different <ORG> in the country by granting them immunity from attack based on the plea that they contravene fundamental rights It was argued for the petitioners that <ORG> cannot validate a law Which it has no Power to enact The proposition holds good where the validity on impugned Act turns on whether the subject matter falls within or without the jurisdiction of the legislature which passed it But to make a law which contravenes the Constitution constitutionally valid is a matter of constitutional amendment and as such it falls within the exclusive power of <ORG> and within the amending power conferred by Art I should like to add that in <NAME> Garnett in National Prohibition Cases and in United <ORG>s Sprague a similar argument Was advanced to the effect that a constitutional amendment was not valid if it was in the form of legislation But the argument was rejected by <ORG> in all the three cases It remains to deal with the objection of the petitioners that the newly inserted articles A and require ratification of the <ORG> legislatures under the proviso to Art of the Constitution because these articles deprive <ORG> of the power to issue appropriate writs under Art I do not think there is any substance in this argument and it cannot be said even to have that effect directly or in any substantial measure Article A aims at saving laws providing for the compulsory acquisition by the <ORG> of a certain kind of property from the operation of article read with other relevant articles in Part III while article purports to validate certain specified Acts Regulations already passed which but for such a provision would be liable to be impugned under Art It is therefore not correct to say that the powers of High Courts to issue writs is in any way affected contravened the fundamental rights guaranteed to the petitioner under Art At page of the report <NAME> stated as follows As the preventive detention order results in the detention of the applicant in a cell it was contended on his behalf that the rights specified in Article a and have been infringed It was argued that because of his detention he cannot have a free right to speech as and where he desired and the same argument was urged in respect of the rest of the rights mentioned in sub clauses and Although this argument is advanced in a case which deals with preventive detention if correct it should be applicable in the case of punitive detention also to any one sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code In spite of the saving clauses to permitting abridgement of the rights connected with each of them punitive detention under several sections of the Penal Code i for theft cheating forgery and even ordinary assault will be illegaL Unless such conclusion necessarily follows from the article it is obvious that such construction should be avoided The article has to be read without any pre conceived notions So read it clearly means that the legislation to be examined must be directly in respect of one of the rights mentioned in the sub clauses If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen freedom of speech or ex pression or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms etc the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of article will arise On that short ground in my opinion this argument about the infringement of the rights mentioned in article generally must fail the said observations were cited with approval by <ORG> because the object of the impugned Act is to amend the relevant Articles in Part III which confer fundamental rights on citizens and not to change the power of <ORG>s under Art In this connection I should like to refer to another aspect of the matter In that case the validity of the said Amendment Act was challenged firstly on the ground that the newly inserted Arts All these arguments were rejected by this Court and it was held in that case that the Constitution First Amendment Act was legally valid It was further contended in that case that the decision of this court in <NAME> Prasads case should be reconsidered by this <ORG> that there Was no justification for re considering <NAME> Prasad case If the arguments urged by the petitioners are to prevail it would leadto the inevitable consequence that the amendments made to the Constitution both in and in would be rendered invalid and It was also pointed out that <ORG> the <ORG> and the people have acted on the faith of the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> Prasad case and titles to property have been transferred obligations have been incurred and rights have been acquird in the implementation of the legislation included in the th Schedule There were some initial delays but a considerable progress hag been made in this direction in recent years and it is hoped that the issue of compensatory bonds will be completed in another two years In the former Punjab area however the State <ORG> has the power to settle tenants on land in excess of the permissible limit although it has not set a ceiling on ownership It is true that the principle of stare decisis may not strictly apply to a decision on a constitutional point There is no restriction in the Constitution itself which prevents this <ORG> from reviewing its earlier decisions or even to depart from them in the interest of public good It is true that the problem of construing constitutional provisions cannot be adequately solved by merely adopting the literal construction of the words used in the various articles The Constitution is an organic document and it is intended to serve as a guide to the solution of changing problems which the <ORG> may have to face from time to time I have already dealt with the merits of the contention of the petitioners with regard to the validity of the impugned Act and I have given reasons for holding that the impugned Act is constitutionally valid and the contentions of the petitioners are unsound It is also not necessary for me to express an opinion on the doctrine of prospective overruling of legislation
