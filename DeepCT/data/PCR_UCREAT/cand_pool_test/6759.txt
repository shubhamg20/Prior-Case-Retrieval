<ORG> quashed the notices on the ground that the <ORG> had not been given an opportunity of being heard lakhs as Additional Duty and this amount had been provisionally debited in the <ORG> Account on the basis of the price list supplied by the <ORG> and the <ORG> was informed that if it desired a personal hearing it can appear before the authorities to make the final assessment in accordance with law The <ORG> challenged the validity of this notice dated on the ground that the notice was barred by limitation and was issued without jurisdiction so that no proceedings could be taken the person chargeable with the duty so short levied shall pay the deficiency or pay the amount paid to him in excess on written demand by the proper officer within three months from the date on which the duty or charge is paid or adjusted in the owner account if any or from the date of making the refund in character would be inapplicable if a case fell within a specified category of cases mentioned in Rule It was pointed out in <NAME> case that the reason for the addition of the new rule A was a decision of the Nagpur <NAME> case A I Nagpur so that a fresh demand may be made on a basis altered by law Therefore it is wrong to hold that the case falls under Rule and not under Rule A The <ORG> was required to furnish quarterly consolidated price lists which used to be accepted for purposes of enabling the <ORG> to clear its goods but according to the Collector these used to be verified afterwards by obtaining evidence of actual sales in the market before issuing final certificates that the duty had been fully paid up This current account known as personal ledger account was maintained under the third proviso to Rule which lays down Provided also that the Collector may if he thinks fit instead of requiring payment of duty in respect of each separate consignment of goods removed from the place or premises specified in this behalf or from a store room or warehouse duly approved appointed or licensed by him keep with any person dealing in such goods an account current of the duties payable thereon and such account shall be settled at intervals not exceeding one month and the account holder shall periodically make deposit therein sufficient in the opinion of the Collector to cover the duty due on the goods intended to be removed from the place of production curing manufacture or storage They held the view that such a charge could be made having regard to the provisions of Section of the Act A learned single Judge of that Court quashed the notices by his order of on the ground that the <ORG> had not been given any opportunity of being heard so as to be able to meet the material collected behind its back which formed the basis of the demands under the aforesaid three notices He indicated the various factors required by Section of the Act which had to be taken into account and held The determination as to whether a wholesale market exists at the site of the factory or the premises of manufacture or production etc As no appeal was filed by either side against this decision it became final and binding between parties before us so that the question whether <ORG> has correctly interpreted Section of the Act in determining the basis on which the excise duty leviable could be assessed is not under consideration here We now propose to complete the assessments for the said periods from the evidence in our possession from which it appears i that there is no wholesale market for the goods covered by your price lists in or near the factory or the Place of manufacture and that the nearest wholesale market for the sale is the Calcutta market The learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench of <ORG> said that there was not enough material on record to conclude that there was any provisional assessment under Rule deleted on and substituted by Rule which laid down When the owner of any goods in respect of which the duty has been assessed provisionally under sub rule has paid such duty the proper Officer may make an order allowing the goods to be cleared for home consumption or for exportation as case may be and such order shall be sufficient authority for the removal of the goods by the owner Provided that before making any such order the proper officer shall require the owner to furnish a bond in the proper form binding the Owner to pay the differen tial duty When the final assessment is made No order directing provisional assessment contemplated by Rule applicable at the relevant time has been placed before us Even if the making of debit entries could on the facts of the case be held to be merely provisional think that what took place could not be held to be a provisional assessment within the provisions of Rule which contemplated the making of an order directing such an assessment after applying the mind to the need for it Before proceeding further we will deal with the question whether the <ORG> Bench correctly refused to permit an argument that the impugned notice of fell under Rule A Firstly the <ORG> having come to Court for a Writ of Pro hibition on the ground that the impugned notice was issued with out jurisdiction had necessarily to establish the case which it sets up in paragraph of its Writ Petition that the notice was not authorised by the rules including Rule A As the notice of was followed on by a correction by another notice of certain statements both the notices were assailed in paragraph ii in the following words The respondent has mala fide and without jurisdiction issued the said impugned notices pretending to falsely state that the aggregate sum therein mentioned has been provisionally debited in your petitioner account and pretending to intimate to your petitioner that the respondent proposed to complete the assessment And thereby he is seeking under the guise of completing an alleged assessment which had already been completed and duty in respect whereof had already been paid to do indirectly what he could not do directly inasmuch as Rule A of the said Rules has no application to the facts of the case and inasmuch as recovery of any duty which might have been short levied under Rule of the Rules is barred by limitation Secondly We find from the Judgment of the learned Single Judge that as the burden lay upon the petitioning <ORG> to demonstrate for obtaining a Writ of Prohibition that the impugned notice was not authorised by any rule its counsel had contended inter alia that the notice did not fall under Rule A Thirdly the question whether the Collector did or did not have the power to issue the impugned notice under or with the aid of Rule A was a question of law and of jurisdiction Therefore we will consider this question also Recovery of duties or charges short levied or erroneously refunded When duties or charges have been short levied through inadvertence error collusion or mis construction on the part of an officer or through misstatement as to the quantity description or value of such goods on the part of the owner or when any such duty or charge after having been levied has been owing to any such cause erroneously refunded the person chargeable with the duty or charge so short levied or to whom such refund has been erroneously made shall pay the deficiency or pay the amount paid to him in excess as the case may be on written demand by the proper officer being made within three months from the date on which the duty or charge was paid or adjusted in the owners account current if any or from the date of making the refund Rule provides for the time and manner of payment of duty This rule indicates that ordinarily the duty leviable must be paid before excisable goods are removed from the place where they are manufactured or stocked and only after obtaining the permission of the officer concerned Clearance on payment of duty When the manufacturer desires to remove goods on payment of duty either from the place or a premise specified under rule or from a store room or other place of storage approved by the Collector under rule he shall make application in triplicate unless otherwise by rule or order required to the proper officer in the proper Form and shall deliver it to the Officer at least twelve hours or such other period as may be elsewhere prescribed or as the Collector may in any particular case require or allow before it is intended to remove the goods The officer shall thereupon assess the amount of duty due on the goods and on production of evidence that this sum has been paid into the <ORG> or paid to the account of the Collector in <ORG> or <ORG> or has been despatched to the <ORG> by money order shall allow the goods to be cleared Goods to be delivered on a Gate pass No excisable goods shall be delivered in a factory except under a gatepass in the proper form or in such other form as the Collector may in any particular case or class of cases prescribe signed by the owner of the factory and countersigned by the proper officer Section of the Act lays down that the Central Government may make rules to carry into effect the purposes of this Act One of the arguments on behalf of the Collector was that no assessment for the purpose of determining the value of excisable goods having taken place in the case before us there could be no levy in the eye of law It was urged that even if there was no provisional assessment as contemplated by Rule whatever took place could at the most be characterised as an incomplete assessment which the Collector could proceed to complete even after the removal of the goals Hence it was submitted there was no question of a proceeding barred by the limitation prescribed for making a The demand for a short levy in certain specified circumstances It may be observed that this finding that the procedure of a provisional acceptance of the Company estimates was adopted seems inconsistent with another finding that what took place was a final adjustment of accounts within the purview of the rd proviso to Rule set out above constituting a levy accord to law It may include both imposition of a tax as well as assessment The term imposition is gene rally used for the levy of a tax or duty by legislative provision indicating the subject matter of the tax and the rates at which it has to be taxed The term assessment on the other hand is generally used in this country for the actual procedure adopted in fixing the liability to pay a tax on account of particular goods or property or whatever may be the object of the tax in a particular case and determining its amount It said there with reference to Rule We are not inclined to accept the contention of of Dr <NAME> that the expression levy in Rule means actual collection of some amount It is to be noted that subsection i uses both the expressions levied and collected and that clearly shows that the expression levy has not been used in the Act or the Rules as meaning actual collection But we could not equate such an adjustment with an assessment a quasi judicial process which involves due application of mind to the facts as well as to the requirements of law unless we were bound by law to give an unusual interpretation to the term assessment They have to be harmonised In <NAME> case <NAME> this <ORG> harmonised them by indicating that Rule A which was residuary in character would be inapplicable if a case fell within a specified category of cases mentioned in Rule It was pointed out in <NAME> case <NAME> No doubt <ORG> gave a reason for the way in which the claims became time barred in the following words It is quite possible that the Excise authorities in an attempt tohelp the appellants by facilitating the movements of goods inadvertently allowed the claims to be barred by limitation Moreover we find that there was no case taken up by the <ORG> in its petition before <ORG> that any short levy resulted from an inadvertence If therefore as we find from the conclusions recorded by <ORG> itself what took place was not an asseessment at all in the eye of law which could not be reopened outside the provisions of Rule we think that the case will fall beyond Rule as it stood at the relevant time But as was pointed out by this Court in <NAME> case Supra the failure to specify the provision under which a notice is sent would not invalidate it if the power to issue such a notice was there We are unable to hold either upon the findings given by <ORG> or upon facts transpiring from the affidavits filed by the parties that the notice was a mere cloak for some omission or error or inadvertence of the Collector in making a levy or an assessment At that time it was certainly not clear whether a case would fall under Rule even before the short levy or its cause was established If however it is read in conjunction with Section of the Act we think that a quasi judicial proceeding in the circumstances of such a case could take place under an implied power It is well established rule of construction that a power to do something essential for the proper and effectual performance of the work which the statute has in contemplation may be implied See Craies on Statute Law Fifth Edition The question whether there was or was not an implied power to hold an enquiry in the circumstances of the case before us in view of the Provisions of Section of the Act read with Rule A of the Central Excise Rule was not examined by <ORG> because it erroneously shut out consideration of the meaning and applicability of Rule A Consequently we allow this appeal and set aside the orders of <ORG> In the circumstances of the case the parties will bear their own costs throughout
