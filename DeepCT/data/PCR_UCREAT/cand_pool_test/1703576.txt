In this case the petitioner <NAME> has moved <ORG> for the issue of a writ in the nature of certiorari to quash an order of <ORG> dated discharging the petitioner from <ORG> service as Probationary Sub Deputy Collector On <ORG> issued a notice to the petitioner asking him to show cause why his services should not be terminated The Government did not permit the petitioner to inspect the confidential reports sent by the Collector and the Commissioner and the Government also declined the request of the petitioner that he should be permitted to lead evidence or to cross examine the Collector and the Commissioner upon whose report the Government had taken action On <ORG> passed an order terminating the services of the petitioner as a Probationary Sub Deputy Collector It was alleged on behalf of the petitioner that the <ORG> of Bihar had no justification for withholding the confidential reports from being shown to the petitioner during the proceedings It is further alleged that the procedure contemplated by Article of the Constitution was not followed by the <ORG> and the petitioner was entitled to a second notice in terms of the language employed in that article It was stated on petitioner behalf that Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules applied to his case and the full procedure contemplated by that article should have been followed In support of his argument Mr <NAME> referred to Rule which states Without prejudice to the provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act no order of dismissal removal or reduction shall be passed on a member of a Service other than an order based on facts which have led to his conviction in a criminal Court unless he has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and has been afforded an adequate opportunity of defending himself The ground on which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges which shall be communicated to the person charged together with a statement of the allegations on which each charge is based and of any other circumstances which it is proposed to take into consideration in passing orders on the case At that inquiry oral evidence shall be heard as to such of the allegations as are not admitted and the person charged shall be entitled to cross examine the witnesses to give evidence in person and to have such witnesses called as he may wish provided that the officer conducting the inquiry may for special and sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing refuse to call a witness In my opinion the argument addressed on behalf of the petitioner is not well founded Rule was also amended by the same notification Before the amendment Rule did not apply to the case of a probationer for the explanation of Rule stated that the discharge of a person appointed on probation would not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of that rule But Rule was amended on by the notification already referred to and an explanation was added to Rule to the following effect The discharge of a probationer whether during or at the end of the period of probation for some specific fault or on account of his unsuitability for the service amounts to removal or dismissal within the meaning of this rule At the same time the following sub paragraph was added to Rule The full procedure prescribed in this rule need not be followed in the case of a probationer discharged in the circumstances described in explanation II to Rule In such cases it will be sufficient if the probationer is given an opportunity to show cause in writing against the discharge after being apprised of the grounds on which it is proposed to discharge him and his reply duly considered before orders are passed The next submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner is that in any event the confidential reports upon which the notice of discharge was made should have been given to the petitioner It was argued that there was a violation of natural justice in this case and the order of discharge must therefore be quashed by a writ of certiorari In my opinion the argument addressed by the counsel is correct It appears from Annexure A of the application that the notice of discharge was based upon certain reports received by the Government while the petitioner was employed as Sub Deputy Collector at Jamshedpur It was argued by the Government Pleader on behalf of the respondent that the annual confidential reports for the years to were communicated to the petitioner and in support of his contention the Government Pleader referred to annexure The complaint of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that these special confidential reports were not made available to the petitioner before he was asked to show cause against the notice of discharge These two special reports contain matters which are highly relevant and prejudicial to the petitioner and in my opinion these reports should have been shown to the petitioner or their contents communicated to him before he was asked to show cause against the notice of discharge It is a matter of general principle that a person should not be condemned on ex parte statements and no order of removal or discharge should be passed against a Government servant unless he has been given a real and effective opportunity of refuting the statements upon which his notice of discharge is based It is true that the final order of discharge of a probationer is an administrative act but the proceedings leading to that final order are quasi judicial in character and the principle embodied in the maxim audi alteram partem therefore applies to such proceedings In such cases <ORG> will have to ascertain the law and also to ascertain the facts I need not add that in doing either they must act in good faith and fairly listen to both sides for that it is a duty lying upon every one who decides anything But I do not think they are bound to treat such a question as though it were a trial They have no power to administer an oath and need not examine witnesses They can obtain information in any way they think best always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view The Act required that a public inquiry should be held and the Minister should consider the objections made by the owners and the report of the person who held the inquiry before he passed the order of confirmation It was held by <ORG> that in deciding whether or not he shall confirm the clearance order the Minister occupied a quasi judicial function and must not take into consideration any matters other than those mentioned in paragraph of the first schedule of the Act If the Minister holds a private inquiry to which the owners are not invited or takes into consideration ex parte statements with which the owners have had no opportunity of dealing he was not acting in accordance with correct principles of justice and his confirmation of the clearance order would be ultra vires and the owners would be entitled to get the confirmation order quashed by a writ of certiorari It was observed by <NAME> in that case that the <ORG> had violated the fundamental rule of justice firstly by not disclosing to the assessee what information had been supplied to it by the Departmental representative and secondly by not giving an opportunity to the assessee to rebut the material furnished to it by the <ORG> It was argued on behalf of the petitioner that even though the amended Rule contemplated only a summary inquiry in the case of a probationer officer the provision of Article of the Constitution required that a second notice should be given before the final order of discharge was made It was however pointed out on behalf of the respondents that a probationer was always liable to be discharged in case his conduct was not satisfactory and there was no necessity of giving a second notice as contemplated by Article of the Constitution The point is not free from difficulty but upon the whole I am satisfied that the petitioner is entitled to a second notice after summary inquiry had been made into the allegations of bribery and corruption made in the first notice Section of the Government of India Act was in the following terms Except as expressly provided by this Act every person who is a member of <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him It was held by <ORG> in <NAME> case that no action was proposed within the meaning of Section until the authority had come to a definite conclusion upon the charges brought against a civil servant and the actual punishment to follow was provisionally determined upon It was on that stage being reached that the Act gave the civil servant the opportunity for which Sub section made provision Rule is concerned that the civil servant shall be informed of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and to afford him an adequate opportunity of defending himself against charges which have to be reduced to writing this is in marked contrast to the statutory provisions of a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him It is on that stage being reached that the statute gives the civil servant the opportunity for which Sub section makes provision It was pointed out by the Government Pleader in this case that a probationer was not entitled to a full inquiry contemplated by the first paragraph of Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules Article of the Constitution therefore applies to this case and a probationer is entitled under that article to a second notice requiring him to show cause against the action to be taken viz The question whether two notices have to be given to a probationer before he can be discharged is one of considerable difficulty A view that can reasonably be taken is that two notices need not be given to such an officer Before this amendment the explanation to Rule provided that the discharge of a person during the period of probation did not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of the rule The third sub paragraph which has been added to Rule by the amendment lays down that the full procedure prescribed in the first sub paragraph of that Rule need not be followed in the case of a probationer and that in the case of a probationer who is to be discharged in the circumstances described in explanation II to Rule it will be sufficient if the probationer is given an opportunity to show cause in writing against the discharge after being apprised of the grounds on which it is proposed to discharge him Such a notice was given to <NAME> There is no doubt that even under Article of the Constitution a notice has to be given to an officer when it is provisionally decided that he should be dismissed or removed This appears to follow from the fact that sub paragraph of Rule requires a notice to be given to show cause in writing against the discharge The words after being apprised of the grounds on which it is proposed to discharge him as used in that sub paragraph strongly tend to show that discharge of the probationer must be provisionally decided upon before notice is given I consider it unnecessary however to discuss this point any further and to give my final conclusion because I entirely agree with my learned brother that there has been a violation of the principles of natural justice as the petitioner was not allowed to see the special reports of the Commissioner of Chotanagpur Division and the Deputy Inspector General <ORG> two of the important materials upon which <ORG> decided to discharge him
