Whether on the termination of the suit tenancy a fresh tenancy arrangement came into existence with effect from st January as regards the ground floor portion of the premises is one of the questipns that arises for decision in this case and the answer depends mainly on the documents that have been filed on both sides The other important question is whether even if it be held that there was no such fresh tenancy the defendants could be treated as tenants holding over and thus entitled to the benefits of the House Rent Control Order and this is a question of law There was no question of taking over possession from <ORG> and handing possession to the new tenants except in a technical sense for <ORG> and <ORG> were already tenants occupying the floors they wanted to take The old lease had come to an end by efflux of time There were fresh tenancies in respect of the first floor and the top floor Ordinarily and if there were no other complications the plaintiff would certainly be entitled to a decree for possession and for mesne profits as regards door No the portion remaining under the occupation of the defendants the defendants informed the plaintiff that they were exercising the option under Section A of the Madras House Rent Control Order and intended to occupy the premises in their possession for a period of months from st March paying a monthly rental of Rs in respect of the same and they denied the plaintiff right to recover possession before st March It is quite clear and this has been the subject matter of decisions both here and under the analogous English order that a tenant holding over is entitled to the benefits of the Rent Control Order The contention for the plaintiff raised by Mr <NAME> his learned advocate is that the Rent Control Order as it stood before its amendment in June and July did not apply to premises let for business purposes and that on the date he filed this suit the tenant could not avail himself of the benefits of the Order though now after the amendments it may be that the remedy to secure eviction can be sought only from the Controller under the Act There is no proof at all in this case that the suit premises were let for business purposes only and not for occupation as residence Sub clause A as it now stands after the July amendment provides that the landlord wishing to evict a tenant in possession shall apply to the Controller for a direction in that behalf and it is for the Controller to make up his mind after satisfying himself on certain matters whether the landlord shall be put in possession or not This amendment though it came into force after the suit was filed must be held to govern us because what we have to see is the true position on the date when the order of eviction is sought and not on the date when the suit was filed as was held by <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> Mr <NAME> ingeniously contended that there could be no objection to a decree being passed in this suit though after the decree it might be that he might have to go before the Controller to get possession This argument fails to take note of two answers One is that when a special tribunal is indicated for obtaining a particular relief it is that tribunal that has got exclusive jurisdiction to grant that relief and to that extent the jurisdiction of civil Courts is ousted Secondly even if it is held that the Court has jurisdiction to grant a decree for eviction it cannot be called upon to indulge in a mere pastime and pass orders which would be brutum fulmen and which cannot be carried into effect without resort being had to other persons or tribunals in whom a discretion is vested to decide if eviction is to be ordered or not
