which will show the circumstances under which <ORG> decided to take action under Rule It is mentioned that the Government have received several petitions containing serious allegations of official misconduct against the petitioner who is a member of <ORG> and the First Member of <ORG> and was also formerly Commissioner Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Administration After adverting to the observations of <ORG> that the affairs regarding the disposal of valuable forest lands belonging to a religious institution known as <ORG> reveal a very disquieting state of affairs and that due notice will have to be taken by the competent authority in the interest of public administration and in the preservation of the forest wealth no less than in the interest of the institution itself Ex <NAME> proceeds to state that the judgment in the said original petition and the preliminary report of <ORG> have disclosed the following grave charges of serious irregularity and official misconduct on the part oi the accused officer The action of the officer was contrary to the provision in Rules of the AH India Services Conduct Rules which enjoin every member to maintain absolute integrity in official matters He had also interested himself in the actual allocation of the lands between the several nominees and demarcated on a sketch prepared for the purpose the particular portions to be given to each In connection with item No it may also be stated that the State Government again refer to an observation of <ORG> in the said writ petition regarding the conduct of the Commissioner the accused officer herein in the matter of sanctioning leases and the further observation to the effect that it was quite improper for the Commissioner to have initiated the proposals for lease and then acted in judgment over his own proposals further proceeds to state that detailed enquiry into the charges by the Branch is in progress and as the evidence in the case has to be collected from a large number of officers who are subordinate to the accused officer in his capacity as First Member of <ORG> in the interests of proper conduct of the enquiry it is necessary that the officer should not be allowed to continue in that post There is no doubt a further consequential direction given to the nd Member <ORG> to assume charge from the accused officer and to attend to the duties of the First Member <ORG> until further orders In the affidavit filed in support of this application no doubt various matters are stated but it is not necessary to go into all those aspects in view of the order passed by me on in No of The State Government have accordingly filed a counter affidavit limited to the matter referred to above Then he refers to various matters in relation to the lease of the properties belonging to that institution and several other matters It is in the course of the judgment pronounced in the said writ petition that certain observations appear to have been made which according to the petitioner are obiter dicta in relation to the disposal of the forest land belonging to the institution There are several additional affidavits filed by the petitioner which again more or less reiterate the legal aspect referred to above in different ways It is specifically stated that in view of the representation of the petitioner counsel and recorded by this Court on th March in No of the various averments on facts made in the affidavit or additional affidavits filed by the petitioner have not been traversed and therefore those allegations cannot and should not be deemed to have been admitted The <ORG> Government takes up the stand that there is no violation of any of the petitioner constitutional protection as a senior I A Officer nor has there been any violation of the All India Services Act or the Rules framed thereunder It is further stated that apart from the observations contained in the judgment of <ORG> in No of regarding the conduct of the petitioner as commissioner long before those observations were made enquiry was proceeding in regard to those very matters which had been alleged as against the petitioner Government decided that it was necessary to pursue the disciplinary proceedings against the petitioner and for that purpose further investigations have been ordered and it was felt very necessary to keep the petitioner under suspension According to the State having due regard to the conduct of the petitioner at the earlier stage of the enquiry in preventing access to the records either directly or indirectly and having regard also to the fact that at the enquiry to be pursued evidence will have to be taken from very many of the subordinates of the petitioner it was felt necessary in the interests of justice that an order has to be made suspending the petitioner pending enquiry against him and it was under those circumstances that the order Ex But it is not necessary for me to go into all those aspects in this writ petition because the question that arises for consideration is one of law namely as to whether the contention of Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner that there is no jurisdiction in the <ORG> to place the officer under suspension under Rule before framing charges as against him is to be accepted or not The All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules hereinafter to be called the Rules have been framed by the Central Government after consultation with the Governments of the States concerned in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub section of Section of the Alt India Services Act Central Act of The All India Services Act is an Act to regulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to <ORG> common to the Union and the States Section defines the expression <ORG> as a service known as <ORG> or the service known as <ORG> Section provides for the Central Government after consultation with the Governments of the States concerned making rules for the regulation of recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to <ORG> The rules have been framed as I have mentioned earlier by virtue of powers conferred upon <ORG> under Sub section of Section of Central Act of There are six Explanations in this rule which are not also necessary to be noted Rule provides that the penalty of dismissal removal or compulsory retirement shall not be imposed on a member of the service except by an order of <ORG> Rule on which considerable reliance has been placed by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner together with the various sub rules is as follows Procedure for imposing penalties without prejudice to the provisions of the Public Servants Inquiry Act no order shall be passed imposing any of the penalties specified in Rule on a member of the <ORG> unless he has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and has been afforded an adequate opportunity of defending himself The grounds on which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges which shall be communicated to the member of the <ORG> charged together with a statement of the allegations on which each charge is based and of any other circumstances which ie is proposed to take into consideration in passing orders on the case The member of the Service concerned may request for an access to official records for the purpose of preparing his written statement provided that the Government may for reasons to be recorded in writing refuse him such access if in its opinion such records are not strictly relevant to the case or it is not desirable in the public interest to allow such access If the Government does not consider it necessary to appoint a Board of Inquiry or an Inquiry Officer the Government shall inquire into the charges in such manner as it deems fit Provided that <ORG> or the Inquiry Officer as the case may be may for reasons to be recorded in writing refuse to call a witness After the inquiry against a member of the <ORG> has been completed and after the punishing authority has arrived at any provisional conclusion in regard to the penalty to be imposed if the penalty proposed is dismissal removal compulsory retirement or reduction in rank the member of the <ORG> charged shall be supplied with a copy of the report of inquiry and be given a further opportunity to show cause why the proposed penalty should not be imposed on him Provided that if the punishing authority disagrees with any part or whole of the findings of <ORG> or the Inquiry Officer the point or points of such disagreement together with a brief statement of the grounds thereof shall also be communicated to the member of the <ORG> Notwithstanding anything contained in this rule a it shall not be necessary to follow the procedure laid down in Sub rules to in cases where it appears to the authority competent to impose the penalty at the initial stage of the proceedings that the penalty of censure would be adequate but if at any later stage it is proposed to impose any other penalty specified in Rule the procedure laid down in the said Sub rules to shall be followed it shall be lawful for the authority competent to impose the penalty to waive for good and sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing any of the provisions of this rule in any exceptional case where such authority is satisfied that there is difficulty in strictly complying with such provisions and that compliance with such provisions can be waived without any injustice to the member of the Service concerned the provisions of this rule shall not apply in relation to the imposition on any member of the service of any of the penalties specified in Rule i where the penalty is imposed on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge ii where the authority empowered to impose a penalty is satisfied that for some reason to be recorded in writing it is not reasonably practicable to follow the provisions of this rule and iii where the authority empowered to impose a penalty is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to follow the provisions of this rule It will be seen that Rule specifically refers to the procedure for imposing penalties Sub rule provides that no order imposing any of the penalties specified in Rule shall be passed unless he has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and has been afforded an adequate opportunity of defending himself Sub rule provides for the grounds on which it is proposed to take action being reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges and to their communication to the member of the Service charged along with a statement of the allegations on which each charge is based and any other circumstances which it ia proposed to take into consideration in passing orders on the accused If no <ORG> or Inquiry officer is appointed the Government are to inquire into the charges in such manner as they deem fit Rule makes provision to the effect that no order imposing on a member of the <ORG> any penalty specified in Rule shall be passed by the <ORG> except after consultation with the <ORG> There is also a proviso to Rule dealing with cases where there is a difference of opinion between the State <ORG> and the <ORG> Rule again on the basis of which the State <ORG> in this case have passed the order under attack is as follows Suspension during disciplinary proceedings i If having regard to the nature of the charges and circumstances in any case the Government which initiates any disciplinary proceedings is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to place under suspension the member of the Service against whom such proceedings are started the Government may a if the member of the Service is serving under it pass an order placing him under suspension or if the member of the service is serving under another Government request that Government to place him under suspension pending the conclusion of the inquiry and the passing of the final order in the case Provided that in cases where there is difference of opinion between two State Governments the matter shall be referred to <ORG> whose decision thereon shall be final According to Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner a perusal of Rule under which action has been taken clearly shows that it is mandatory that <ORG> must have a regard to the nature of the charges and the circumstances in any case before it is satisfied that it is necessary or desirable to place a member of the <ORG> under suspension In this connection the learned counsel placed considerable reliance upon the use of the expression charge occurring in Rule and urged that the said expression must bear the same meaning that it must have when it is used in Rule referred to above The learned counsel urged that Rule and in particular Sub rule therein has clearly laid down that the grounds on which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges and they are to be communicated to the member of the <ORG> and it is the existence of such a definite charge or charges referred to in Sub rule of Rule that is again indicated in the expression charge occurring in Rule That is in short according to the learned counsel unless a definite charge or charges have been framed as is pontemplated under Sub rule of Rule for the purpose of imposing penalty against an officer no action can be taken by way of suspending an officer under Sub rule of Rule The learned counsel also urged that unless the charge or charges have been framed as against a Government servant it is idle to expect a compliance with Sub rule of Rule wherein one of the essential requisites is that <ORG> must have regard to the nature of the charges The learned counsel referred me to Rule of the Central Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules framed by the President in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Article and Clause of Article of the Constitution The learned counsel also referred me to certain decisions to the effect that the same word occurring in the same section of the same set of rules must be given the same meaning unless there is anything to indicate the contrary That is according to the learned counsel the same meaning that is to be given to the expression charge or charges occurring in Sub rule of Rule must be given to the expression charge occurring in Sub rule of Rule I am not referring to the decisions of certain <ORG> relied on by the learned counsel There can be no controversy that if this Court is concerned to find out whether an enquiry has commenced as against an officer having due regard to the provisions contained in Rule certainly the proposition laid down by the learned Judge can very well be applied and it can be held that enquiry proceedings for purposes of imposing a penalty can be considered to commence only from the framing of a definite charge or charges The reliance placed upon this decision again by the learned counsel is for the purpose of establishing that unless charges have been framed no suspension pending enquiry can be ordered No doubt the order placing an officer in the employ of <ORG> under suspension was challenged and that challenge was on the basis of Section A of the Municipalities Act Act of which is as follows A If the President has reasons to believe that the Executive Officer or the Secretary or any of the other officers of the <ORG> appointed under Section is corrupt or has persistently failed in the discharge of his duties or is otherwise guilty of misconduct he may frame charges against him and where he is satisfied that it is so necessary he may for reasons to be recorded suspend him pending the completion of the enquiry The enquiry under Sub section shall be carried on in such manner as may be prescribed by rules After the inquiry is completed the President shall submit the record with his own recommendation to <ORG> or to the <ORG> as he may consider fit Whenever the Board acts under Sub section the condition prescribed in Section shall apply and an appeal shall lie to <ORG> in the manner and to the extent provided in the said section It will be seen that Section A specifically provides that under the circumstances mentioned therein the President has to frame charges against the officer and where he is satisfied that it is necessary he can place the officer under suspension pending the completion of the enquiry It is in considering that section the learned Judge if I may say so with respect Quite rightly came to the conclusion that in view of the grammatical construction to be placed on Section A the inquiry contemplated by that section can be considered to be initiated only by the framing of the charges and that only then can suspension be ordered According to the learned Advocate General the scheme of Section which deals with the procedure to be adopted for imposing penalties is entirely different from the scheme of Rule which gives jurisdiction to <ORG> to place an officer under suspension That is exactly what has happened in this case Apart from the observations contained in the judgment of <ORG> in No of regarding the conduct of the petitioner as Commissioner there is the other circumstance namely that even as early as the Government have been receiving various allegations of misconduct as against the petitioner and those allegations were being inquired into by the Branch Those materials available before the Government clearly show that there are very serious charges of misconduct as against the petitioner which if established will result in imposing any one of the penalties referred to in Rule The learned Advocate General has also urged that the expression charges in Rule has been used in the general sense of an imputation or accusation or allegation as against an officer whereas Rule has specifically laid down the procedure for imposing the penalties Before imposing those penalties the Rule has laid down very clearly the procedure to be adopted and in that connection it is stated that the grounds on which it is proposed to take action are to be reduced to the form of definite charge or charges and have to be communicated to the member of the <ORG> charged Suspension of a <ORG> servant pending an enquiry is a necessary part of the procedure for taking disciplinary action against him These observations if I may say so with great respect emphasise that suspension of a <ORG> servant pending an inquiry is really a necessary part of the procedure for taking disciplinary action as against him Rule lays down the specific procedure for imposing penalties and it is in connection with that that Sub rule clearly says that the grounds on which it is proposed to take action should be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges In my view the matters provided for in Rule have to be strictly limited only for the purposes for which they are intended namely the procedure for imposing penalties In my view the very restricted meaning sought to be given to the expression disciplinary proceedings by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner namely that it takes in only the stage when a charge is framed and an inquiry is held cannot certainly be accepted The absence of such an expression framed after the word charges in Rule in my view is a clear indication that charges referred to in Rule are not identical with charges framed as against an officer for purposes of an inquiry under Rule The learned counsel Mr <NAME> has stated that the observations made in the judgment of <ORG> in No of cannot be taken into account at the present stage because that judgment will be the subject of an appeal I will proceed on that basis for the present the State <ORG> have also stated that the said preliminary report has disclosed three grave charges of serious irregularity and official misconduct referred to therein No doubt the proposition is well settled that where an authority takes action under an Act or the Rules framed thereunder it must conform to the provisions of the statute or the rules which have conferred upon it the power to take such action and if there is any violation of the said provisions the public servant will have a right to challenge the decision of that authority If no action can be taken as against the officer under these circumstances by way of suspension at that stage the position would be that the <ORG> servant concerned will be continuing to hold office notwithstanding such serious allegations of misconduct levelled as against him There are two minor contentions raised on behalf of the State namely that the order plating the petitioner under suspension is a purely administrative act and therefore no interference should be made under Article of the Constitution Parties will bear their own costs
