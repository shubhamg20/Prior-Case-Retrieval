It is admitted that the haired Judicial Commissioner has misconceived the facts and that Section A has no application to this ease There is no question here of the disobedience of the conditions of any license issued by the Surer inter dent of <ORG> The Deputy Magistrate who tried the case framed a charge under Section Indian Penal Code but did not set out the common object of the unlawful assembly of which the accused was alleged to be a member There is nothing in the Act which renders a person liable to punishment for joining an assembly or procession which has already been convex ed or collected if he has no notice that the Convenor or promoter baa matted to take out a license in if after becoming an are that the person wise duty it was to take out a license has failed to do so ho persists in remaining with the assembly or procession then it may I think be said that he shares the Common object of such person to resist the execution of the Superintendent order In the present case the evidence shows that the acoused <NAME> joined the profession after it had been directed to disperse there is no evidence that he was aware that any breath of the notification had been committed bat if it could have been shown that be and four others of the assembly or procession were acting together with the common object that the person who bad convened or collected the assembly or directed or promoted the procession should resist the execution of the Superintendent order then I think he would have come under the operation of Section Indian Penal Code I agree that reentrance connotes soma overt act and that mere words when there is no intention of carrying them into effort will not be sufficient to prove an intention to resist bat in the present case the induct of the mob and their refusal to disperse at the command of the Police clearly constitute overt acts and establish a common object to resist the orders within the meaning of Clause of Section Indian Penal Code The reply is that when a notification is issued by an executive authority in exercise of a power conferred by Statute that notification is as much a part of the law as if it had be in incorporated within the body of the Statute at the time of its enactment In my judgment although the wording of the notification did not follow the exact language of Clause of Section there was on the whole a substantial compliance and the public of Daltonganj were in no error or doubt as to its purport In these circumstances I do not doubt that the accused might have been Convicted under Section Indian Penal Code if sufficient evidence had been given to prove a Common object to resist the execution of the order but there was no evidence on this point and the charge framed against him by <ORG> did not even set out the Common object of the unlawful assembly and it is impossible to say that the accused had notice of the precise case which the prosecution were making against him Here again Some formal evidence should have been given and the accused should have had an opportunity of meeting his case in <ORG> We asked the learned Counsel for the <ORG> whether there was any evidence upon which it Could be held that the Common object of the unlawful assembly was to disobey such a lawful order as is contemplated by Section of the Indian Penal Code but the learued Counsel reply was in the negative I agree with the judgment which has just been delivered by my learned brother The learned Judicial Commissioner before whom the <ORG> was not represented was obviously in difficulty in understanding how the respondent could be convicted under the Code for an offence committed under the <ORG> Act Assuming that to be the position of the <ORG> the learned Judge came to the conclusion that though the procession might be deemed to be an unlawful assembly the persons forming the procession could not be punished under the Code as members of an unlawful assembly I confess that there is much to be said for the view of the learned Judicial Commissioner but in truth the question does not arise Section A of the <ORG> Act only applies where there is a violation of the conditions of a license granted under Section not where the procession was formed without a license But it was insisted by the learned Assistant Government Advocate that the conviction under Section of the Indian Penal Code was nevertheless right and that the respondent was a member of an unlawful assembly of five or more persons whose common object was first to resist the execution of a law and secondly to commit an offence The form of the argument addressed to us by the learned Assistant Government Advocate raises a question of grave public importance for no less a claim than this is put forward on behalf of the Crown that a District Superintended of Police or an Assistant District Superintendent may by purporting to act under Section of the Police Act prohibit an assembly or a procession if the assembly declines to take out a license for such collection or procession and that the members of the procession by refusing to disperse if ordered to disperse by the Police make themselves liable not only under the Police Act for which the maximum sentence is a fine of Rs but also under Section of the Indian Penal Code for which the maximum sentence is rigorous imprisonment for two years with a fine So far as I know the claim has never yet been put forward in any case that a person can be convicted under the Code for an offence under the Police Act and before I accede to the argument which involves the personal liberty of the subject I must be satisfied that the argument is well founded and that it rests on principle or is covered by authorities It was argued in the first place that the common object of the assembly was to resist the execution of the law In order to succeed the prosecution must establish first that there was a law which could be executed secondly that there was execution of that law and thirdly that there was resistance to the execution of that law He may also on being satisfied that it is intended by any persons or class of persons to convene or collect an assembly in any such road street or thoroughfare or to form a procession which would in the judgment of the Magistrate of the District or of the sub division of a District it uncontrolled be likely to cause a breach Of the peace require by general or special notice that the parsons convening or collecting such assembly or directing or promoting shall procession shall apply for a license Bat it is one thing to say that the Act itself constitutes a prohibition it is another thing to say that the Act gives a limited and a conditional discretion to the Superintendent of Police not to prohibit an assembly or a procession without a license for that there is no authority in the Act as I shall presently show but to require the persons convening or collecting such assembly or directing or promoting such procession to apply for a license It was then argued that there is nothing to prevent the <ORG> from reposing confidence in a particular person or a body of persons and any order issued by such a person or body of parsons if authorised by the <ORG> has the character off law and is in fact law Now whether law means the expression of the exercise of the discretion by the <ORG> or whether it includes the expression of the exercise of the discretion by a person or body of parsons under the sanction and the authority of the <ORG> this at any rate is clear that when we speak of law we mean something which is enforceable and which is not capable of being rejected by the <NAME> as uncertain as unreasonable or as repugnant to the law of the land But there are other rules The first usually consists of statutory rules bye laws and regulations made by responsible authorities concerned with <ORG> the second usually consists of bye laws and regulations made by persons societies or corporations who are conducting commercial or other enterprises whether of a public character or not Bat where the Statute does not so provide their validity can be canvassed in the <ORG> of law and the <ORG> can reject them as unenforceable on the ground that they are uncertain or unreasonable The first Section of the Patents Designs and Trade Marks Act of provided that a person should not be entitled to describe himself as a Patent Agent unless registered as such in pursuance of the Act and that <ORG> should from time to time make such rule as were in the opinion of <ORG> required for giving effect to the section Now Section of the previous Act provided that the rules were to belaid before <ORG> and remain before <ORG> for consideration for foray days and during these forty days they might be annulled by a resolution of either <ORG> and that they shall be of the same effect as if they were contained in the Act and shall be judicially noticed Lord <NAME> in the course of his speech drew attention to the terms of Section of the previous Act and then said as follows My Lords I have asked in vain for any explanation of the meaning of those words or any suggestion as to the effect to be given to them if not withstanding that provision the rules are open to review and consideration by the <ORG> Bat there is this difference between a rule and an enactment that whereas apart from some such provision as we are considering you may canvass a rule and determine whether or not it was within the power of those who made it yon cannot canvass in that way the provisions of an Act of Parliament This is a clear authority for the view that though there is no difference between a rule and an enactment where there is a provision in the enactment that the rules shall be of the same effect as if they ware contained in the Act there is a wide difference between the two when there is no such provision and the difference is this that though you may not canvass an Act of Parliament you may canvass a rule If I am right in my view as to the distinction that exists between the law and a bye law framed under a Statute but not made part of the Satiate by the express provision of the Statute it must follow that an order issued by the Superintendent of <ORG> under Section of the Polios Act cannot be claimed as the law That order may be a valid order or an invalid order but as there is no provision in the <ORG> Act giving to the orders mined by the <ORG> under Section of the <ORG> Act the same effect as it they were contained in the Act they cannot be regarded as the law for any purpose whatsoever <NAME> I am quite willing to assume that the order of the Superintendent of <ORG> is law within the meaning of the first Clause of Section of the Indian Penal Code I have still to enquire whether it is enforceable as the law that is to say whether it is sanctioned and authorised by the <ORG> Act or whether it dots not constitute an undue interference with the liberty of the Subject in the garb of an order under the <ORG> Act In order to determine this question it is necessary to examine the provisions of Section and A of the <ORG> Act The first Clause of Section gives to the District Superintendent or the Assistant District Superintendent the power to direct the conduct of all assemblies and processions on the public roads or in the public streets or thoroughfares and prescribe the routes by which and the times at Which such processions may pass The second Clause gives him power to require by general or special notice that the person convening or collecting such assembly or directing or promoting such profession shall apply for a license provided he is satisfied that it is intended by any parson or class of persona to convene or collect an assembly in any such road street or thoroughfare or to form a procession such as in the judgments of the Magistrate if uncontrolled be likely to cause a breach of the peace A power of licensing is a power to regulate not a power to prohibit and it is necessary to point out that there is nothing in Section either in the first or in the second clause which gives the <NAME> an express power to prohibit an assembly or procession if the parsons convening or collecting sash assembly or directing or promoting sash profession decline to apply for a Incense It is sufficient here to point out that there is no express power to prohibit given in Section of the Act Section I of the the Act however gives a power to the <ORG> to order an assembly or procession to disperse but section A applies and applies only where there is a violation of the Condition of a license Section A therefore has no application to this case for it is admitted that the persons directing or promoting the procession did not apply for a license On an interpretation of Sections and Aof the <ORG> Act it would appear that there is no power in the <ORG> to prohibit a profession where the persons directing and promoting such profession decline to apply for a license although there is sash power where such persons take out a license but violate the conditions of such license The argument overlooks the provision of Section of the Act which imposes a penalty upon every person for opposing or not obeying the order issued under Section Section A and Section of the Act It is at least significant that the Act though it expressly vests in the Magistrate or in the <ORG> the power to stop any procession which Violates the conditions of a license and to order it to disperse gives no such Power to the <ORG> at least expressly where the person convening or collecting an assembly or directing or promoting a procession declines to apply for a license It must follow that there is no power by implication to prohibit an assembly or a procession in the event of the persons in charge of the same declining to apply for a license But it may be urged that the power to regulate a public assembly or a procession would be a barren power if the <ORG> have not by implication a porwer to prohibit such assembly or procession and that the true rule is that if the <ORG> enables something to be done it gives power at the same time by necessary implication to do everything which is absolutely indispensable for the purpose of carrying out the purpose in view Where the Act imposes a penalty upon every person for opposing or not obeying the orders issued under the Act it seems to me that the purpose in view is carried out by enforcing the provision of the Act against such persons But when it is argued that because they are given the power to restrict within certain hours the sale of ice creams therefore they have implied power to do all that might be desirable or expedient with reference to the times and circumstances under which ice creams shall be sold it seems tome the argument entirely fails What is sought to be done whether directly by bye laws or indirectly by the language of the license that is issued is something that can only be done by the <ORG> It is a restraint of a common right which all His Majesty subjects have the right to open their shops and to sell what they please subject to legislative restriction and if there is no legislative restriction which is appropriate to the particular thing in dispute it seems to me it would be a very serious inroad upon the liberty of the subject if it could be supposed that a mere single restriction which the <ORG> has imposed could be enlarged and applied to things and circumstances other than that which the <ORG> has contemplated It is said that the words which I have read unless the same be sooner forfeited revoked or suspended give the power My Lords that construction of the Act of Parliament seems to me to be entirely contrary to principle The point established in the other case to which I propose to refer the case of Toronto <ORG> Virgo A is this that a statutory power conferred upon <ORG> to make bye laws for regulating and governing a trade does not in the absence of an express power of prohibition authorize the making it unlawful to carry on a lawful trade in a lawful manner The Statute gave power to the <ORG> to pass bye laws for licensing regulating and governing hawkers or petty chapmen and other persons carrying on petty trades Stopping here for a moment it will be noticed that Section of the <ORG> Act gives power to the <ORG> as the marginal note shows to regulate public assemblies and precessions and license the same There is no prohibition on the face of the <ORG> Act just as there is no prohibition on the face of the Statute which I am now considering The bye laws framed by the <ORG> prohibited the hawkers from prosecuting their calling or trade in certain streets in the city of Toronto The Privy <ORG> held that the bye law complained of was ultra vires In the second plane there is no power to issue an order to have operation for three months This was the view which was taken of Section of the <ORG> Act in this Court in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Criminal sic Referrenre No of unreported The Act requires that the judgment shall be exercised by the Magistrate of the District or of the sob division of a District The order not only does not show that any judgment has been exercised by the Magistrate of the district but it shows that such judgment has been exercised by toe Officiating Superintendent of <ORG> If the order is to be regarded as a bye law then it is well established that <ORG> will not give effect to it unless it is satisfied teat all the conditions precedent to the validity of the bye law have been fulfilled If the <ORG> has given a power to the Superintendent of <ORG> to legislate in the manner it has for the safety of the public imposed as a condition precedent that the Magistrate snail be satisfied that there is necessity for the legislation I will assume that the order was a lawful one and that it could be executed I will assume that there was a violation of that order by the persona who formed the procession In my opinion on an interpretation of Section A and the contention is an sic imposible one Section A which does not aooly to this case does give the <ORG> a right to stop a procession and to order it to disperse Section which does apply to this casa gives no such power to the <ORG> Section provides a penalty for opposing or not obeying the orders that may be issued either under Section or Section A In my opinion the <ORG> had no power either under the Criminal Procedure Code or under the <ORG>s Act to stop the procession or order it to disperse Now in the first place if there was no power in the <ORG> to stop the procession or to order it to disperse there was clearly a right in the accuses persons to withstand or stand against or make opposition to the order of dispersal It consists of an overt act showing an intention to make opposition to the execution of the law In that case the bailiff made a demand for the money and the accused replied that the bailiff was not legally entitled to take the money and that he would not give it to him It was held that there was nothing mare than a refusal to submit and that there was no resistance within the meaning of Section Indian Penal Code It is sufficient to say that there is no evidence that the a sensed persons were likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace The offense is created for the first time by the Police Act which imposes a penalty upon every person opposing or not obeying the orders issued under Section A and of the Police Act It has been held in numerous cases that where a Statute creates a new offense which was not an offense at Common Law and imposes a penalty in respect of such offense a person committing such an offense can only be proceeded against under the Statute which creates the offence and cannot be indicted under the general law It was contended on his behalf that there was no remedy by indictment as the Act which created the offence provided a penalty for each offences The Court gave effect to the argument advanced on behalf of the defendant and quashed the indictment This is the view which has been taken in numerous cases in England The mode of procedure and the amount of penalty are often crega Hel by the <ORG> as of the utmost Importance When they are creating new offeneesi and the law would I believe contrary to their intention be most seriously modified if it were held that the party committing a breach of that which for the first time is made an offence were to subject himself by so doing to proceedings of this description which might result in a committal to prison I have thought it necessary to deal with the case at tome length for the reason that the issue raised by the Crown in this appeal goes far beyond the astual facts of the case and indeed affects the liberty of the subject in relation to what he may lawfully do in a lawful manner Where there are breaches of law and order it is the duty of this <ORG> to relentlessly apply the law and look neither to the position nor the motive of the persons committing or encouraging breaches of law and order I would dismiss this appeal
