This appeal preferred by <ORG> is directed against the judgment of Mr Justice <NAME> in No allowing the petition filed by Respondents to herein petitioners in the writ petition under Article of the Constitution for the issue of a writ in the nature of <NAME> or any other appropriate writ or direction to the appellants to fix the seniority of respondents to as per the original proceedings of <ORG> dated th October and also to further direct the appellants not to give effect to the subsequent proceedings of <ORG> dated nd November and th January The Writ Petitions came to be filed by Respondents to under the following circumstances During the Second Word War with the object to supplying foodgrains at fair prices to the Railway employees a new <ORG> known as <ORG> was created and recruitment of the personnel was made on an emergency basis from three sources the sources being temporary staff who were appointed in the permanent departments initially and subsequently transferred to the <ORG> Subsequently representations were made to <ORG> by the Railway employees and as a result of the representations <ORG> issued proceedings on nd November in partial modification of the earlier proceedings dated th October directing that while inter se seniority of the first and second categories of the <ORG> should be maintained as directed in its proceedings dated th October Certain difficulties arose in giving effect to the modified proceedings and <ORG> issued clarification by the further proceedings dated th January Respondents and the appellants herein resisted the application on the main ground that the <ORG> is competent to revise the seniority as the recruitment of the personal to <ORG> was on a temporary basis and that therefore a policy decision had to be taken after the <ORG> was abolished and the members of the disbanded shop were shown places in the regular <ORG>s having regard to their educational qualifications age and service rendered in other departments and that being a policy decision it is not liable to be questioned nor is there anything to suggest that respondent to have been singled out for any discriminatory treatment It is their case that to equate the writ petitioners respondents herein with regular employees would be doing injustice to the regular employees and as such there is no violation of the guarantees either under Article or of the Constitution Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the appellants contended that the judgment of <NAME> of <ORG> in relied upon by the learned Judge has since been reversed by a Division Bench of <ORG> in A No by its judgment dated th July and that further the respondents cannot invoke Articles and for the simple reason that there were no service Rules governing the employment of temporary personnel in <ORG> and their absorption into permanent Departments was not by virtue of any Rules in existence but by reason of the proceedings issued by <ORG> on th August which was a policy decision taken by the authorities and <ORG> is competent or entitled to change the service conditions including seniority in the absence of any Rules governing their original appointment in the defunct <ORG> Therefore the question that falls for determination in this Writ Appeal is whether the revision of seniority of respondents to by the impugned proceedings is a denial of equal opportunity to them along with those similarly drafted into <ORG> The scope of Articles and has been the subject of numerous decisions of <ORG> and we need only refer to a few of them to appreciate the question involved in this Appeal That is what Article injuncts upon namely that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> The three provisions form part of the same constitutional code of guarantees and supplement each other If that be so it must be held that the matters relating to employment must include all matters in relation to employment both prior and subsequent to the employment which are incidental to the employment and form part of the terms and conditions of such employment That was a case where seniority was to be fixed between direct recruits and promotes in a particular rotational system and in a particular ratio and that principle which was stated in the order of <ORG> came to be challenged before <ORG> This brings us back to the circular of and the main question in that connection is the meaning to be assigned to the words seniority determined accordingly in the explanation to principle relating to relative seniority of direct recruits and promotes A further question arose in that case whether after the formation of a common cadre with direct recruits and promotees promotion to the higher cadre could also be made only a ratio that existed between direct recruits and promotees at the time of recruitment to the original cadre At the time when the petitioner and the direct recruits were appointed to Grade there was one class in Grade formed of direct recruits and the promotees from the grade of artisans The recruits from both the sources to Grade were integrated into one class and no discrimination could thereafter be made in favour of recruits from one source as against the recruits from the other source in the matter of promotion to Grade To put it differently once the direct recruits and promotees are absorbed in one cadre they form one class and they cannot be discriminated for the purpose of further promotion to the higher Grade What has been held by their Lordships in <NAME> case applies with equal force to the case on hand Here also there was already an integrated service namely <ORG> and all the members of this Service were absorbed in different Departments and after absorption there cannot be a further dividing line between direct recruits drawn from open market and those appointed through Selection Boards as that would clearly be a denial of equal opportunity to persons similarly situated in the matter of further promotion on the basis of their seniority among other grounds Since the absorption of direct recruits and others is from the integrated <ORG> no discrimination can be shown on the ground of differences that existed between various sources prior to the recruitment to the <ORG> for the purpose of fixing seniority We are not inclined to agree with the view expressed by <ORG> of <ORG> reversing the judgment rendered by <NAME> The learned Judges of <ORG> were to the view that there was no Service Rule which had been evolved at the time of the recruitment of persons to <ORG> on an ad hoc basis from the open market whereas such a rule had been evolved in the case of recruits by <ORG> or <ORG> That order also must have prescribed the mode of selection and that is how recruitment was made to that <ORG> from various sources Therefore we are not prepared to agree with the learned Judges that there was no integrated cadre simply because the personal were drawn from different sources and possessed different qualifications Therefore when once a <ORG> was created from various sources and members belonging to the common cadre were absorbed later in other departments there cannot be a further dividing line on the basis of differences that existed prior to the formation of a common cadre in <ORG> for the purpose of fixing seniority We have therefore no hesitation in confirming the order of the learned Single Judge and dismissing the Appeal with costs
