The plaintiffs were therefore driven to the necessity of instituting suit No of against them in the court of the Munsif of Muzaffarnagar in which the prayer originally was that the defendants should be restrained by an injunction from making any alterations in the property and from damaging the same so long as the property had continued in their possession as tenants that he may be granted permission under the Control of Rent and Eviction Act No III of to file a suit for ejectment of the tenants or occupants namely <NAME> etc Thereupon the plaintiffs instituted Suit No of in the court of Civil Judge of Muzaffarnagar on the nd of December for the ejectment of the defendants and for recovery of arrears of rent and mesne profits after giving the defendants a notice dated the th of July by which they intended to terminate their tenancy from the Ist of August The defendants resisted the suit on the ground that in view of the provisions of the Rent Control and Eviction Act the permission obtained from the District Magistrate was of no help to the plaintiffs and that they had no cause of action against them The defendants continued in occupation of the property as tenants and their possession as tenants had been recognised by the plaintiffs in Suit No of referred to above by which the plaintiffs sought a relief for injunction restraining the defendants from making any alteration in the property and from damaging the same as long as the property continued in their possession as tenants In the present case there is concurrent finding of fact of the two courts below that the tenants wilfully caused or permitted to be caused substantial damage to the accommodation and they without the permission in writing of the landlord made constructions which materially altered the accommodation <NAME> requested the District Magistrate to grant him the permission to file a civil suit against the occupiers for their eviction Permission will be awarded to the owner to file a civil suit for the ejectment of the tenant Hence under the orders of the District Magistrate you are hereby accorded permission to file a civil suit against your tenant Sri Debi Prasad under Section of the Rent Control and Eviction Act In regard to the permission aforesaid it has been contended on behalf of the appellants that the lower appellate court view that this permission was defective because it was in favour of only one of the landlords namely <NAME> and against only one of the tenants namely <NAME> was not based upon a correct appreciation of matter It was further held that where it is mainfest that all the plaintiffs landlords who were interested in the matter brought the suit after serving a notice on the tenants to vacate the premises in suit it will be deemed that the plaintiff who obtained the permission acted as agent on behalf of the other plaintiffs We have quoted the order of the District Magistrate and in that order the District Magistrate granted permission to the owner to file a civil suit for the ejectment of the tenant on the expiration of a notice to determine the lease duly given by one party to the other Under Clause of Section a breach of condition only makes the lease voidable the forfeiture is not complete unless and until the lessor gives notice that he has exercised his option to determine the lease Keeping in view the principles stated above we now proceed to examine the facts of this case There was no express condition in the terms of the compromise decree dated in Suit No of of the court of Munsif Muzaffarnagar referred to above which provided that on breach thereof the lessor may re enter Even if an express condition like that is to be inferred from the compromise decree emanating from the implied covenants mentioned in Clauses and of Section of the Transfer of Property Act a breach of the condition only makes the lease voidable and the forfeiture woiild not be complete unless and until the lessor gave notice that he had exercised his option to determine the lease under Section Clause of the Act On when Suit No of was taken up for hearing an application which is paper No on the record was made on behalf of the defendants In these circumstances and in view of Section of the Transfer of Property Act the notice given under Section Clause must be deemed to have been waived with the express or implied consent of the persons to whom it was given by an act of the persons giving it showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting Upon this view of the matter although we have disagreed with some of the findings of the lower appellate court the refusal to grant the relief for ejectment must be upheld As a result of the finding reached by us namely that the notice given under Section Clause must be deemed to have been waived and there was no determination of the lease and further that an intention on the part of the lessor to treat the lease as subsisting was manifest by their own action or conduct this second appeal in our opinion has got no force and we accordingly dismiss it with costs
