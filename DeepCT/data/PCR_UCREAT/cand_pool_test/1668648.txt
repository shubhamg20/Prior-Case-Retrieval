This case has been referred to a Full Bench for a decision of the following point of law namely Where a third mortgagee professes to keep in his hand a part of the mortgage money in order to pay off the first and second mortgages and pays of only the first mortgage whether in a suit by the second mortgagee to enforce his mortgage it is open to the third mortgagee to insist on his being treated as a first mortgagee whose mortgage must be paid of before the plaintiff brings the mortgaged property to sale The facts of the case are stated in the referring judgment and briefly are as follows One <NAME> was the owner of a certain property The point raised in this appeal has given rise to conflicting decisions although it must be said that in this Both the cases were decided on the peculiar facts of the case and their Lordships took care to point out the questions of fact which determined their decision The principle of merger which was contained in a codified form in Section Act before its amendment and which is still to be found in the amended section of the same Act does not lay down that there may be a merger where the person paying off the earlier charge was only a charge holder or mortgagee and not a full owner This case has been followed by other cases in this Court but a contrary view has also been taken in this Court see for example <NAME> Basir Uddin All To start with there does not appear to be any difference in principle between a case where a purchaser or a third mortgagee advances some money to the vendor or the mortgagor as the case may be and then pays off the first mortgage and the case where a purchaser or a third mortgagee professes to take the transfer for a larger sum than in the earlier case and keeps with him the money needed for paying off the earliest mortgage and actually does not hand over the money to the vendor or the mortgagor but uses the money to pay off the first mortgage It is conceded that in the first case a subrogation does arise but it is denied that it arises in the second case Section as it now stands after amendment of does not recognize any doctrine of agency It is couched in the simplest widest and clearest language possible and the relevant portion runs as follows Any of the persons referred to in Section other than the mortgagor and any co mortgagor shall on redeeming property subject to the mortgage have so far as regards redemption foreclosure or sale of such property the same rights as the mortgagee whose mortgage ha redeems may have against the mortgagor or any other mortgagee Section applied to the case the appeal must succeed and the appellants must be treated as the first mortgagee This is also clear because the appellants as the third mortgagees are among the persons who are entitled under Section Act to redeem the property they have redeemed the property subject to the first mortgage and they have thereby according to the terms of the rule of law the same rights as the first mortgagee whose mortgage they have redeemed against the mortgagor and any other mortgagee the last expression including the plaintiffs respondents Mr <NAME> however argued that Section had no application because of the provision contained in Section Act of The provisions contained in Sections and Act are dealt with by Sections and and these are not to be found in the first provision of Section Act of In our opinion there is nothing in Clause which affects the present case Indeed Mr <NAME> has not been able to point out to us what has been done in this case before st April which is being undone by the new rule of law and what is the remedy or proceeding which is being affected by the new provisions of Sections and In our opinion therefore Sections and Amendment Act have retrospective effect Supposing however that the said sections have no retrospective effect we have got this position This Court itself was divided as to the rule of subrogation in the circumstances of this case and there are conflicting decisions of other <ORG> In the circumstances the rule laid down by the legislature would be a safe guide to follow as laying down correctly the rule of justice equity and good conscience for cases arising before the passing of Act of The result is that in our opinion the question for our decision must be answered in favour of the appellants and we must hold and do hold that the appellants are subrogated to the position of the first mortgagee
