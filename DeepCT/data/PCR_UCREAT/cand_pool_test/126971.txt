HEADNOTE <ORG> of Mizo District Council refused to further renew the temporary licence issued to the appellant a non trader for trading in Mizo District The appellant filed a writ petition contending that the order was mala fide in the sense that though the reason given for refusal was that the number of non Tribal traders had reached the maximum the <ORG> had in fact granted licences to new traders and that the said order and of the Lushai Hills District Trading by non Tribals Regulation was invalid being violative of Art A provision which leaves an unbridled power to an authority cannot in any sense be characterised as reasonable He applied for a further renewal whereupon <ORG> of <ORG> passed an order dated July refusing any further renewal and directing him to The appellant filed a petition under Art This Regulation was passed in pursuance of the provisions of the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution which gives specific power to the District <ORG> to pass regulations affecting the right of non Tribals to trade within the tribal areas and in order to effect the purpose underlying the provision of the Sixth Schedule this Regulation was enacted This appeal by special leave challenges the correctness of this order by which <ORG> dismissed the petition The appellant contention before us was that the said order was invalid as it was based on an invalid provision of law which infringed his fundamental right to carry on business at Aijal under Art that the refusal to allow him to carry on his business amounted to an unreasonable restriction and that section of the Regulation which empowers the <ORG> to refuse to permit him to carry on business was invalid as it conferred on the <ORG> an arbitrary and uncanalized power enabling it to refuse to grant a licence or its renewal according to its sweet will Paragraph of that Schedule provides for the power of the District <ORG> to make Regulation for the control of money lending and trading by non tribals In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such regulations may a prescribe that no one except the holder of a licence issued in that behalf shall carry on the business of money landing prescribe that no person who is not a member of the Scheduled Tribes resident in the District shall carry on wholesale or retail business in any commodity except under a licence issued in that behalf by <ORG> Section of the Regulation provides that no person other than a Tribal resident in the District shall carry on wholesale or retail business in any commodities except under and in accordance with the terms of a licence issued by <ORG> The first proviso to this section does not concern us as it deals with perma nent licences to be issued to persons who were carrying on business prior to the enactment of the Regulation Section empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Regulation and in particular to provide the form and conditions of the licence the fees therefor the procedure for applying for a licence the forms of accounts to be maintained by the licensee and for any other matter connected with or ancillary to the matters aforesaid The Rule also provides that no temporary licence shall be granted for a period exceeding one year at one time Rules and deal with permanent licences that is licences granted to non tribals carrying on business before the enactment of the said Regulation The appellant being a citizen of India and the Mizo District being part of the Union Territory he has undoubtedly a fundamental right under Art Any restriction infringing such a right can only be sustained if it is a reasonable restriction imposed in the interest of the general public as envisaged by Art <NAME> in that decision observed In considering the reasonableness of laws imposing restrictions on fundamental rights both the substantive and procedural aspects of the impugned law should be examined from the point of view of reasonableness and the test of reasonableness wherever prescribed should be applied to each individual statute impugned and no abstract standard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases The clause was struck down by this Court on the ground that while the authorities may fix the ceiling price at which foodgrains should be sold in the market by the dealers there was no such limitation on the power of the <ORG> to acquire the stocks <NAME> one or more approved films of such length and for such length of time as the <ORG> or <ORG> may direct and which also compelled the licensee to exhibit at the commencement of each performance not less than feet of one or more approved films were struck down as imposing unreasonable restrictions on the right of the licensee to carry on his business At page of the Report the <ORG> observed Neither the length of the film nor the period of time for which it may be shown is specified in the condition and the Government is vested with an unregulated discretion to compel a licensee to exhibit a film of any length at its discretion which may consume the whole or the greater part of the time for which each performance is given As the condition stands there can be no doubt that there is no principle to guide the licensing authority and a condition such as the above may lead to the loss or total extinction of the business itself the repeated failure on the part of the licensee and the necessity for <ORG> to afford reasonable opportunity to him to show cause why his licence should not be cancelled Even according to the majority decision there must be disclosed in the statute apparently or otherwise a policy guiding the exercise of power conferred thereunder by the concerned authority These authorities clearly demonstrate that the fundamental right of a citizen to carry on trade can be restricted only by making a law imposing in the interest of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of such a right that such restrictions should not be arbitrary or excessive or beyond what is required in the interest of the general public and that an uncontrolled and uncanalized power conferred on the authority would be an unreasonable restriction on such right It is also well established that where a provision restricts any one of the fundamental rights it is for the <ORG> to establish the reasonableness of such restriction and for the court to decide in the light of the circumstances in each case the policy and the object of the impugned legislation and the mischief it seeks to prevent As already stated under Paragraph of the Sixth Schedule <ORG> has the power to enact Regulations for regulating and controlling money lending or trading by non Tribals in the District Clause empowers the <ORG> in general terms to make Regulations and Clause empowers it in particular to make Regulations prescribing that a non tribal after the enactment of such a Regulation shall not carry on trade except under a licence It is clear from the Regulation and the Rules made thereunder that there is no right of appeal to any superior authority against a refusal to grant or renew a licence There is also no provision either in the Regulation or in the Rules empowering any civil court to adjudicate against any such order of <ORG> Under the second proviso to section the <ORG> no doubt has to record the grounds for refusal but that is hardly a safeguard against an arbitrary refusal for the Regulation does not constitute any superior authority with power to revise such an order or to examine whether the grounds are legal or proper There being no principles or standards laid down in the Regulation there are obviously no restraints or limits within which the power of <ORG> to refuse to grant or renew a licence is to be exercised Indeed there is nothing in the Regulation empowering the <ORG> much less <ORG> to lay down any such maximum number nor does the Regulation prescribe any principles on which such a maximum number is to be fixed Even the Rules made under section do not lay down any principles or standards Rule is couched in general terms and provides that <ORG> may refuse to renew any licence granted to a non tribal trader after the commencement of the Regulation Indeed the Regulation does not contain any provision laying down what is and what is not a proper cause for refusal The power to grant or not to grant is thus entirely unrestrained and unguided A provision which leaves an unbridled power to an authority cannot in any sense be characterised as reasonable The said order dated July having been made under such a void provision is illegal and void We would therefore set aside the said order as having been made under an illegal provision of law and allow the appeal with costs Paragraph of the Sixth Schedule gives power to <ORG> to make regulations for the control of money lending and trading by non tribals Power of <ORG> to make regulations for the control of money lending and trading by non tribals Prescribe that no person who is not a member of the Scheduled Tribes resident in the district shall carry on wholesale or retail business in any commodity except under a licence issued in that behalf by <ORG> Provided that no regulations may be made under this paragraph unless they are passed by a majority of not less than three fourths of the total membership of <ORG> Provided further that it shall not be competent under any such regulations to refuse the grant of a licence to a money lender or a trader who has been carrying on business within the district since before the time of the making of such regulations No person other than a Tribal resident in the District shall carry on wholesale or retail business in any commodities in this District except under and in accordance with the terms of a license issued in that behalf by <ORG> under the provisions of this Regulation Provided that such a license shall not be refused to a person who has been carrying on such business within the district since before the commencement of this Regulation Provided further that if such a license is refused the grounds of refusal shall be recorded in writing by <ORG> Paragraph of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution of India specifically empowers <ORG> of an autonomous district to make regulations prescribing that a nontribal resident of the District shall not carry on business in any commodity except under a license issued in that behalf by <ORG> One of the guiding principles of <ORG> policy embodied in Art of the Constitution is that the <ORG> shall promote with special care the edu cational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and in particular the Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation The restriction imposed by on the right of a non tribal to carry on business in a tribal area is not arbitrary or unreasonable and is not violative of Arts Another contention of the appellant is that the licensing authority could refuse to issue license only if it found that the appellant did not show good conduct and behaviour while in the Mizo Hills as stated in condition No of the temporary trading license Rules a and of the Lushai Hills District Trading by non Tribals Rules made by <ORG> with the previous approval of the the Governor of Assam in exercise of the powers conferred by of the Regulation are as follows In these rules unless there is anything repugnant or the context otherwise requires a Executive Committee means <ORG> of <ORG> constituted under the Assam Autonomous Districts Constitution of the District Councils Rules ORDER In accordance with the Opinion of the majority the appeal is allowed with costs
