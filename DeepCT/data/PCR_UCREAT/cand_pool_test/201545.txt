This is a plaintiff appeal arising out of a snit for sale brought on the basis of a mortgage deed dated the st of February purporting to hare been executed by two persons <NAME> and his mother <NAME> in favour of the plaintiff appellant <NAME> According to the document Rs Further on in the deed they further stipulated that if there was any default in payment of the Rs They pleaded that no consideration had passed and they lastly pleaded that the suit was barred by limitation It has held that the suit is barred by limitation It was a sum which they had to pay to the decree holder <NAME> Excepting the bare statement of the plaintiff <NAME> there is practically no evidence We next come to the question of limitation First of all it is pleaded that the plaintiffs had a period of years within which to bring their suit on the basis of the bond In the present suit no option whatsoever was given to the mortgagee in the matter the mortgagee had a right to sue That time in the absence of any payments on account of interest came to an end at the end of years and the present suit was brought as we have already pointed out at the end exactly of years from the emotion of the document It is true that the Madras High <ORG> has in a recent case differed from the decision of this <ORG> In doing so it has had to go contrary to one of its own farmer decisions whereas the Calcutta Might <ORG> has consistently followed the opinion of this <ORG> or rather the decision in the <ORG> is based partly on the decisions of the Calcutta High <ORG> and we see no reason whatsoever not to follow the decision of this <ORG> which up to the present moment has not been upset and with which we agree Unless therefore the plaintiffs are able to satisfy us that the alleged payments of interest entered on the back of the document were made their suit is clearly barred by limitation In regard to these payments they are ten in number the earliest payments purport to have been endorsed on the deed in December <NAME> February and January The four sums mentioned in these four entries purport to have been paid by <NAME> and the entries on the deed to have been made by <NAME> There had been a partition apparently in the plaintiffs family and their rights under certain deeds were distributed among them and then there were transfers from one to the other of their shares In this sale deed there is an entry of the deed now in suit showing the value of the bond itself on the st of December We have been taken over the evidence of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and on a consideration of their evidence we have come to the conclusion that all these entries of payments on the back of the deed are highly suspicious and that not even the entry of the th of December has been established to our satisfaction The appellants are people who on the face of the record have done in the past a considerable amount of money lending The next point which is worthy of notice is this The plaintiffs would ask ns to believe that on the th of April <NAME> herself paid the sum of Rs Notice in that case was issued to <ORG> On the nd of November <NAME> filed a reply in that proceeding in which she also stated that she had denied the execution and completion of the deed of the st of February and she claimed the money deposited by the mortgagor <NAME> as belonging to herself We have also the admitted fact that all the mortgagee rights that were hypothecated to the present plaintiffs have been redeemed and the plaintiffs have not deemed it worth their while to make these mortgagors parties to the present suit In any view it is clear that the suit was barred by limitation and was properly dismissed by the <ORG> below The appeal fails and we dismiss it with costs including fees on the higher scale
