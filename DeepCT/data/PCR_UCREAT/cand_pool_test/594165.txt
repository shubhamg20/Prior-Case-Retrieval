She alleged that later on when she tried to enter the house of the appellant no which is at property No Ashok Vihar Phase I Delhi she found the main entrance locked and hence she filed Suit No for a mandatory injunction to enable her to enter the house The case of the appellants was that before any order could be passed by the trial Judge on the suit filed by their daughter in law Smt The learned trial Judge decided both the applications for temporary injunction filed in suit no by the parties by his order on He held that the petitioner was in possession of the second floor of the property and he granted a temporary injunction restraining the appellants from interfering with the possession of Smt Against the aforesaid order the appellants filed an appeal before the Senior Civil Judge Delhi who by his order dated held that Smt <NAME> was not residing in the second floor of the premises in question <NAME> filed a petition under Article of the Constitution which was disposed of by the impugned judgment In the same decision it was observed it may be that with change of situation and complex problems arising it is high time to give the wife or the husband a right of occupation in a truly matrimonial home in case of the marriage breaking up or in case of strained relationship between the husband and the wife In our opinion the above observation is merely an expression of hope and it does not lay down any law It is only the legislature which can create a law and not the <ORG> There is no such law in India like the British Matrimonial Homes Act and in any case the rights which may be available under any law can only be as against the husband and not against the father in law or mother in law Here the house in question belongs to the mother in law of Smt <NAME> and it does not belong to her husband <NAME> <NAME> cannot claim any right to live in the said house <NAME> has stated that she had taken a loan for acquiring the house and it is not a joint family property We see no reason to disbelieve this statement <NAME> cannot claim any injunction restraining the appellants from dispossessing her from the property in question for the simple reason that she was not in possession at all of the said property and hence the question of dispossession does not arise Section states shared household means a household where the person aggrieved lives or at any stage has lived in a domestic relationship either singly or along with the respondent and includes such a household whether owned or tenanted either jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent or owned or tenanted by either of them in respect of which either the aggrieved person or the respondent or both jointly or singly have any right title interest or equity and includes such a household which may belong to the joint family of which the respondent is a member irrespective of whether the respondent or the aggrieved person has any right title or interest in the shared household Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force every woman in a domestic relationship shall have the right to reside in the shared household whether or not she has any right title or beneficial interest in the same The aggrieved person shall not be evicted or excluded from the shared household or any part of it by the respondent save in accordance with the procedure established by law While disposing of an application under sub section of section the Magistrate may on being satisfied that domestic violence has taken place pass a residence order a restraining the respondent from dispossessing or in any other manner disturbing the possession of the aggrieved person from the shared household whether or not the respondent has a legal or equitable interest in the shared household directing the respondent to remove himself from the shared household restraining the respondent or any of his relatives from entering any portion of the shared household in which the aggrieved person resides restraining the respondent from alienating or disposing off the shared household or encumbering the same restraining the respondent from renouncing his rights in the shared household except with the leave of the Magistrate or directing the respondent to secure same level of alternate accommodation for the aggrieved person as enjoyed by her in the shared household or to pay rent for the same if the circumstances so require Provided that no order under clause shall be passed against any person who is a woman Learned counsel for the respondent <NAME> stated that the definition of shared household includes a household where the person aggrieved lives or at any stage had lived in a domestic relationship We cannot agree with this submission If the aforesaid submission is accepted then it will mean that wherever the husband and wife lived together in the past that property becomes a shared household It is quite possible that the husband and wife may have lived together in dozens of places with the husband father husband paternal grand parents his maternal parents uncles aunts brothers sisters nephews nieces etc If the interpretation canvassed by the learned counsel for the respondent is accepted all these houses of the husband relatives will be shared households and the wife can well insist in living in the all these houses of her husband relatives merely because she had stayed with her husband for some time in those houses in the past Such a view would lead to chaos and would be absurd It is well settled that any interpretation which leads to absurdity should not be accepted As regards Section of the Act in our opinion the wife is only entitled to claim a right to residence in a shared household and a shared household would only mean the house belonging to or taken on rent by the husband or the house which belongs to the joint family of which the husband is a member The property in question in the present case neither belongs to <NAME> nor was it taken on rent by him nor is it a joint family property of which the husband <NAME> is a member Hence it cannot be called a shared household No doubt the definition of shared household in Section of the Act is not very happily worded and appears to be the result of clumsy drafting but we have to give it an interpretation which is sensible and which does not lead to chaos in society The impugned judgment of <ORG> is set aside and the order of Senior Civil Judge dismissing the injunction application of Smt
