HEADNOTE The appellant was appointed on probation for one year as Programme assistant on May on condition that his services might be terminated without any notice and cause being assigned during that period be liable to be discharged during that period subject to the rules in force in that connection and as Explanation to had been deleted long before the action was taken he was not entitled to the protection of Art The purpose of a notice under was to ascertain after considering the explanation which a probationer may give whether he should be retained or not and in such a case it would be sufficient compliance with that rule if the grounds on which the probationer is considered unsuitable for retention are communicated to him and any explanation given by him with respect to those grounds was duly considered before an order was passed In the present case therefore the appellant was given the opportunity as envisaged by and the appeal therefore must be dismissed The judgment of the court was delivered by <NAME> an appeal on a certificate granted by <ORG> His period of probation expired on June but it was extended from time to time The appellant showed cause The appellant then filed a petition under Art of the Constitution and as this was not afforded to him the order terminating his services was illegal Besides it was urged on his behalf that he was governed by rr and of the Rules did not apply to the appellant and he was governed by the contract of his service which provided that his services might be terminated without any notice and without any cause being assigned during the period of probation The first question that falls for determination is whether the appellant is entitled to the protection of Art But it is equally well settled that where the services of a temporary government servant are terminated not by way of punishment Art will not apply and the services of such a servant can be terminated under the terms of the contract or by giving him the usual one month notice There is also no doubt that the termination of his service was not by way of punishment and cannot therefore amount to dismissal or removal within the meaning of Art It is however urged on behalf of the appellant that the rules themselves made it obligatory that Art should be complied with before the services of a probationer were terminated In this connection reliance is placed on Explanation to of the Rules as amended of October Now if this Explanation were in force in when action was taken against the appellant his contention that Art applied to him would be correct But we find that was further amended in November and by that amendment Explanation was deleted and a new Explanation which took the place of Explanations and of the rule as it Stood after the amendment of October was substituted This new Explanation which was in force at the relevant time is in these terms The termination of employment a of a person appointed on probation during or at the end of the period of probation in accordance with the terms of the appointment and the rules governing the probationary service or does not amount to removal or dismissal within the meaning of this rule or of rule Therefore when action was taken against the appellant in it was this Explanation which governed the appellant and accordingly if his services were terminated in accordance with the terms of his appointment and the rules governing his probationary service and not as a measure of punishment the appellant cannot claim the protection of Art His contention based on Explanation to as it existed after the amendment of October must therefore fail as that Explanation had been deleted long before action was taken against the appellant In the alternative it has been urged on behalf of the appellant that he was entitled to the protection of and as that rule was not complied with the termination of his service was illegal <ORG> held that would not apply to the appellant because in the letter of appointment issued to him it was said that his services were liable to be terminated without any notice and without any cause being assigned The reason why <ORG> held that that term in the letter of appointment would prevail over is that where there is conflict between the terms of contract and the rules the former must prevail under a Two questions thus arise in this connection the first is whether in view of a the appellant will not be entitled to the protection of and the second is whether he was afforded the protection of before action was taken to terminate his service if that rule applies Rule was inserted in the Rules in November and reads thus Where it is proposed to terminate the employment of a probationer whether during or at the end of the period of probation for any specific fault or on account of his unsuitability for the service the probationer shall be apprised of the grounds of such proposal and given an opportunity to show cause against it before orders are passed by the authority competent to terminate the employment This rule would clearly apply to the appellant who was a probationer as it was in force at the relevant time unless a makes it inapplicable in view of the term mentioned above in the letter of appointment issued to him Rule a lays down These rules shall apply to every person in the whole time civil employment of a <ORG> in India other than a person so employed only occasionally or subject to discharge at less than one month notice except a persons for whose appointment and conditions of employment special provision is made by or under any law for the time being in force Rule a thus excludes the application of the Rules only in case of persons for whose appointment and conditions of employment special provision is made by or under any law for the time being in force It cannot be said therefore that the term already mentioned which appears in the letter of appointment issued to the appellant is a special provision by virtue of any law or was inserted under any law for the time being in force That term is nothing more than the usual term one finds in letters of appointment issued to persons appointed on probation <ORG> was therefore in our opinion not right in holding that will not apply to the appellant because of this term in the letter of appointment issued to him He was therefore given an opportunity to remedy the defects and to make attempts to bring himself up to the standard at least of an average Programme Assistant On July the appellant was given a notice by which he was afforded an opportunity to show cause why his services should not be terminated and was informed that any representation made by him in this regard would be duly considered It has been contended on behalf of the appellant that this was not sufficient compliance with That rule lays down that the probationer shall be apprised of the grounds on which it was proposed to terminate his services and given an opportunity to show cause against it The appellant was apprised of the grounds on which it was proposed to discharge him Therefore in a case covered by all that is required is that the defects noticed in the work which make a probationer un suitable for retention in the service should be pointed out to him and he should be given an opportunity to show cause against the notice enabling him to give an explanation as to the faults pointed out to him and show any reason why the proposal to terminate his services because of his unsuitability should not be given effect to If such an opportunity is given to a probationer and his explanation in reply thereto is given due consideration there is in our opinion sufficient compliance with Generally speaking the purpose of a notice under is to ascertain after considering the explanation which a probationer may give whether he should be retained or not and in such a case it would be sufficient compliance with that rule if the grounds on which the probationer is considered unsuitable for retention are communicated to him and any explanation given by him with respect to those grounds is duly considered before an order is passed This is what was done in the present case and it cannot therefore be said that the appellant was not given the opportunity envisaged by We therefore dismiss the appeal though for slightly different reasons
