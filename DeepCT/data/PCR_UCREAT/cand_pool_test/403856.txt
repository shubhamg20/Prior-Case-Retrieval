HEADNOTE This was an appeal by the defendants in a suit for possession on redemption of certain mortgages instituted in <ORG> exercising jurisdiction under the Sangli State Agriculturists Protection Act of Their case was that the mortgaged properties had been sold at auction and purchased by their father who had sold most of them to other persons more than years before the institution of the suit and as such the suit was barred by limitation The trial court thereafter decreed the suit in part holding that the claim in respect of portions only of the mortgaged properties was barred by limitation Held that the preliminary objection that the Special judge had no jurisdiction under the Sangli State Agriculturists Protection Act to entertain the suit must be overruled The former suit stands dismissed as a result of the judgment of the High <ORG> and no appeal has been brought against that judgment to this <ORG> The suit as originally framed prayed for accounts in respect of two mortgages though there were really three mortgages to be described in detail hereinafter and for possession of the lands comprised in those mortgages The first defendant filed his written statement on January contesting the suit mainly on the ground that the plaintiff had no title to the mortgaged properties in view of the events that had happened that the mortgaged properties had been sold at auction and purchased by the defendant father who thus became the full owner thereof and that he had sold most of the properties to other persons who were holding those properties as full owners The <ORG> decreed the suit in respect of the mortgaged portion of No having an area of acres and gunthas as against defendant No and No against defendant No heirs Each party was directed to bear its own costs throughout In our opinion there is no substance in this contention If the legislature had intended to limit the jurisdiction of <ORG> as contended on behalf of the appellants nothing would have been easier than to say in express terms that the court jurisdiction to grant relief was limited to transactions of that year and after but there are no such words of limitation in any part of the statute It was next contended that the suit was barred by limitation of one year under Art It appears that there was a decree for money of the year in favour of a third party who is not before us On the basis of this auction purchase it has been contended on behalf of the mortgagee that unless the sale were set aside it would bind <NAME> and his successor in interest the plaintiff In the present case there was no such adjudication the plaintiff has to sue to recover possession of immovable property mortgaged and afterwards transferred by the mortgagee for a valuable consideration within years from the date the transfer becomes known to the plaintiff On the other hand it has been contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the usual rule of years limitation under Art There is no clear averment in that paragraph of the plaint about the extent of the interest sold by those sale deeds and other transfers referred to therein If those sale deeds which are said to be registered documents were not available for any reasons certified copies thereof could be adduced as secondary evidence but no foundation has been laid in the pleadings for the reception of other evidence which must always be of a very weak character in place of registered documents evidencing those transactions In order therefore to attract the operation of Art If there is no such proof the shorter period under Art It was argued on behalf of the defendants appellants that as it is a matter within the special knowledge of the plaintiff the plaint should disclose the date on which the plaintiff became aware of the transfer On the other hand it was contended on behalf of the plaintiff respondent that it is for the defendants to plead and prove the facts including the date of the knowledge which would attract the bar of limitation under Art ion the only other Article which will apply to the suit is Art It appears from the order dated March passed by the trial court during the pendency of the suit after remand that the second defendant died on April that is to say while the appeal before <ORG> was pending in that Court before remand That rule requires that all persons having an interest either in the mortgage security or in the right of redemption shall be joined as parties The original mortgagee In the written statement filed on behalf of the third defendant it is stated in para The second defendant had remained ex parte throughout apparently because he had no interest in the property to be redeemed But it does appear that the second defendant had no subsisting interest if he had any at any anterior period in any portion of the mortgaged property It was also contended that the original defendant No died and in his place defendants Nos a to were substituted It was sought at one stage of the arguments to be argued that the suit had abated against defendant No But on the facts stated above there was no room for the application of XXII of the Code The defendant No who happens to be the brother of the original defendant No has only filed a written statement claiming that he and his vendor defendant No had been in possession for more than years and that Bom the suit was on that count barred by limitation <NAME> there was no question of abatement of the suit or the appeal The only question which may or may not be ultimately found to be material on a proper investigation may be whether the decree to be passed in this case would be binding on those who had not been served On these findings it must be held that the preliminary objections raised on behalf of the defendants in bar of the suit must be overruled It would thus appear that all the three mortgages are between the same parties as mortgagor and mortgagee and the two brothers of the mortgagor join in executing the mortgages as sureties the property given in mortgage belonging to all the three brothers It appears that of the three brothers <NAME> died first and then <NAME> some time in survived by his two daughters the plaintiff and defendant No These are formal documents giving details of the lands allotted to each one of the three brothers and to their mother by way of maintenance The plaintiff case further is that the principal mortgagor in all those three transactions aforesaid was <NAME> and his two brothers had joined only as sureties by way of additional security in favour of the mortgagee It has been contended on the other hand on behalf of the defendants appallants that in the first instance the documets of referred to above do not evidence an actual partition by metes and bounds but only represent an arrangement by way of convenience for more efficient and peaceful management of the family property and that alternatively if those documents are claimed to have the efficacy of partition deeds they are inadmissible in evidence for want of registration In this connection reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants upon what was alleged to be the subsequent conduct of the three brothers after as evidenced by the three mortgage bonds themselves and the saledeed exhibit dated June Finally the deed proceeds to make the following very significant declaration as to the status of the members of the so called joint family As I have sold to you my right title and interest in the above said lands neither I nor my heirs and executors of my will have any right whatsoever over the said property I have sold to you whatever interest I had in the said lands If the transaction of the year is admissible in evidence for the purpose for which the document was used in the courts below namely to prove separation in estate there is no room for ambiguity and the position is clear that the three brothers had become separate But it was argued on behalf of the appellants that those documents exhibits series aforesaid are not admissible in evidence even for the limited purpose of showing separation in estate Such a partition may be effected orally but if the parties reduce the transaction to a formal document which is intended to be the evidence of the partition it has the effect of declaring the exclusive title of the coparcener to whom a particular property is allotted by partition and is thus within the mischief of the material portion of which has been quoted above In our opinion there is no answer to this contention because it is clear upon a proper construction of the three mortgage bonds and on the plaintiff own case that the entire ancestral properties and not only <NAME> share had been mortgaged The appeal will therefore be allowed to the extent of the half share rightly belonging to <NAME> and the decree for possession after redemption will be confined to the other half belonging to the plaintiff father In the result the appeal is allowed to the extent indicated above Appeal allowed in part
