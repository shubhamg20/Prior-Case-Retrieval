<ORG> has filed this appeal being aggrieved with the order passed by the Additional Collector <ORG> Ltd who by their acts of commission omission have rendered the goods liable to confiscation under the aforesaid Section have also rendered themselves liable to penalty under Section of the Act ibid I also find that the goods are not covered by exemption Notification No and that the show cause notice was issued to the party in accordance with the <ORG> Law and it is well within the jurisdiction of <ORG> to take appropriate action in the matter including adjudication In view of the forgoing facts circumstances and evidences and my findings I pass the following order dated should be read as a whole that in para iii of the Notification it has been laid down that the imports are allowed if the importer satisfies <NAME> of the Zone that the imported goods will be used for the production of goods for exports out of India or in connection with the production or packaging of goods for export out of India or with the promotion of such exports of goods that they were not aware as to whether the power of <NAME> have been delegated to the Assistant Collector for satisfying as to imports that in the absence of satisfaction of <NAME> the consignment cannot be detained that the difference in wording of Clause iii and vii i of the Notification No Cus clearly says that it is for <NAME> to record satisfaction as to whether the goods so imported will be used for production of goods to be exported out of India that at the point of importation there was no role for the Collector to play that the interpretation of the Letter of Approval was the exclusive task of <NAME> that in terms of Clause vii of the aforesaid Notification the importer was liable to pay duty only on such goods which were not used in connection with the production or packaging of goods within the Zone for export out of India that the role of <ORG> starts only when some goods in relation to which exemption was claimed were not actually used in connection with the production of the export goods that it is well settled in law that even testing and checking is a process of manufacture and therefore even this aspect will amount to manufacture or production that the question of <ORG> being to see whether there has been any manufacture or production at the stage of consignment being exported did not seem to arise that the above contention was supported by the fact that even packaging is one of the functions allowed in free trade zone that even simple entre pot trade is an important means of earning foreign exchange and import into and export from bond after sorting and packaging or even mere re export have been traditionally allowed that the value has been added by high technology inputs of selection of items testing and physical additions that reading Notification No Cus According to the revised proposal dated <ORG> approved addition of necessary capital goods in the second and third year of manufacture that the impugned items are estimated material requirements in the form of discrete components of the assembled computer systems as envisaged in the st year of the phased programme that the approved proposal clearly envisages import of discrete components in an assembled form initially that in the first phase of the manufacturing programme required absorption of the technical know how of such high technical products that computer technology was a relatively new concept that the company had necessary infrastructure facilities in the said field had export orders for exporting computer based facility management systems and that the <ORG> had given them time as theirs was a phased manufacturing programme that the process of analysing of the end user requirements and translating the same into components and parts of the computer system both in the form of hardware and software is a substantial input requiring enormous knowledge that engineers were already on the job that it was neither envisaged nor stated in the approved proposal that the computer systems parts and components would be imported in CKD and or discrete form in the first year that the proposal clearly envisaged putting together parts and components of the computer systems along with the software to make them functional that the assembly of PCBs was not envisaged in the first year as the soldering equipment required for such assembly was to be imported during the second year of programme that as the goods were allowed for processing prima facie it appeared that the <ORG> were satisfied that the goods fell within the ambit of the Notification No Cus There is no reason to exclude the chopping of timber into firewood from the ambit of manufacturing process The nature and extent of processing may vary from case to case The question is not whether there is manual application of energy or there is application of mechnaical force The nature and extent of processing may vary from case to another and indeed there may be several stages of processing and perhaps a different kind of processing at each stage But it is only when the change or a series of changes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but instead is recognised as a new and distinct article that a manufacture can be said to take place <ORG> gives the following meaning of the word process to subject to some special process or treatment to subject especially raw material to a process of manufacture deveopment or where therefore any commodity is subjected to process or treatment with a view to its development or preparation for the market as for example by sorting and repacking fruits and vegetables it would amount to processing of the commodity within the meaning of Section and Rule The question is not whether there is manual application of energy or there is application of mechanical force The nature and extent of processing may vary from case to case in one case the processing may be slight and in another it may be extensive but with each process suffered the commodity would experience a change The learned counsel therefore submitted that having regard to the ratio of the decisions in the above cases it may safely be concluded that processing was a sort of manufacture and that admittedly as processing of the goods was done by the appellant they are legally entitled to the benefit of exemption under Notification No Cus It was further submitted by the learned counsel that the Development Commissioner had allowed the import as he was satisfied that the goods were essential for the export product and had cleared the import that the letter from Olivetti Italy for export of computer systems by us to other countries indicates that the processing done by us is of significant nature and was not just a screw driver technology that the computer systems parts components have been assembled and tested for the end use by the appellants that switch deal is an import control matter and appropriately falls within the jurisdiction of the licensing authorities that this case is covered under OGL it does not fall in the jurisdiction of <ORG> that the Joint Development Commissioner on had verbally agreed that the appellants end product being computer systems the components admissible for import under OGL shall be inter alia computers peripheral accessories spare etc that the validity of the import is to be seen in terms of the provisions of Appendix of ITC Policy that if there was a doubt a reference might have been made to <ORG> for clarification that for unit in NEPZ Letter of Approval read with relevant OGL is treated as import licence that the raw material consists of mini computers personal computers monitors key board floppy disc drive hard disc drive micro computers work stations systems software etc The learned Counsel submitted that in the case of <ORG> reported in <ORG> had held Counsel for the appellant has made a solemn statement before us that the entire imported goods would be utilized for export under the existing contract in case this undertaking really works out then the appellant shall be entitled to exemption from duty under the scheme The learned DR submitted that Clause vii i reads the importer shall pay on demand an amount equal to duty leviable on the goods other than capital goods as are not proved to the satisfaction of the Collector of <ORG> to have been used in connection with the production or packaging of goods within the Zone for export out of India or with the promotion of such export of goods or re exported within a period of one year from the date of importation thereof or within such extended period as the Collector of <ORG> may on being satisfied that there is sufficient cause for not using them or for not re exporting them within the said period allow that this clause very clearly says that the Collector of <ORG> has the authority to demand duty in terms of conditions stipulated in the clause referred to above that the first clause reads The importer shall pay on demand an amount equal to duty leviable on the goods as are not proved to the satisfaction of the Collector of <ORG> to have been used in connection with the production or packaging of goods It is clear that the <ORG> were of the view that the goods in dispute were neither used in the production of export product nor for packaging of the export product On the question whether the goods in question were covered under OGL and whether the Letter of Approval and approved project report is to be read along with the OGL for allowing import and granting exemption from duties under the aforesaid Notification the learned DR submitted that the benefit under the Notification was available to an importer located in the Noida Export Processing Zone and if he was the actual user of the goods imported that the appellants were required to manufacture the goods indicated in their approved project report right from the first year of their production that <ORG> in their letter No NEPZ dated addressed to the appellants clarified that OGL certificate in respect of disputed items cannot be issued that this was a clear indication showing that the goods in dispute imported by the appellants were not covered by the approval granted to them and therefore the learned DR submitted that the lower authorities rightly denied them the benefit under Notification No The learned DR also submitted that there was hardly any role to be played by the appellants in respect of the disputed goods inasmuch as the goods were imported in fully assembled form and were exported as such and therefore there was no production or manufacturing On the question of processing amounting to manufacture <ORG> submitted that it is well settled in law that every process is not manufcture and only that process amounts to manufacture which brings into existence a new product distinct in name character and use <ORG> submitted that in the present case no new goods were produced and hence the case law cited and relied upon by the appellants does not help them The appellants argued at length that <ORG> had no jurisdiction and that jurisdiction vested only in the Development Commissioner We find that the exemption under Notification No was applicable to such imports and under this Notification there was a clear stipulation that on a demand by the <ORG> Authorities The importer shall pay the duty leviable on the goods which are not used in the production etc did not indicate that there was any assembly or use of these goods for the production of some different goods Thus there was no production in respect of these goods It was also argued that the satisfaction of the Development Commissioner was necessary and the <ORG> have no part to play Insofar as the approval of the project was concerned it was the sole function and task of the Development Commissioner but insofar as the applicability of the exemption Notification was concerned it was the sole responsibility of the <ORG> and therefore the appellants were not correct in assuming that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction This contention of the department has not been rebutted and no evidence has been brought on record to show that the disputed goods conformed to the goods shown in the approved proposal We hold that this plea of the appellants was misconceived and hold that the <ORG> had a jurisdiction to go into the question whether the goods were eligible for duty exemption under Notification No Cus It was argued by the appellants that they trained their personnel by sending them to Italy to get acquainted with the high technology involved as also to Russia to find out the requirement of the user and that they developed software for the purpose and exported computers equipped with software When pointedly asked whether in the shipping bills there was any indication that at the time of export the computers were furnished with software the learned counsel could not show that this was so No evidence has been brought on record to prove against the allegation that fully assembled goods were imported whereas the proposal approved by the Development Commissioner envisaged the import of raw materials as indicated in Annexure of letter dated Instead of bringing evidence in support of the proposal approved for the first year the appellants simply submitted that during the first year they imported goods in semi assembled form as no manufacturing activity was required to be undertaken during the first year On the question whether some processing was done on the goods in dispute we find that as against the clear allegation by the <ORG> that the appellants imported fully assembled goods the appellants could not produce any evidence that they had done any processing on the goods before their export Thus in the very item under which the excise duty is claimed in this case we find the word in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power The case law cited and relied upon by the appellants also supports this view that the process must bring into existence a new product which was not the case in the case before use In this case this <ORG> Paras and had held as under In the case of <ORG> cited supra <ORG> had held that The counsel for the appellants has made a solemn statement before us that the entire imported goods would be utilized for export under the existing contract In case this undertaking really works out then the appellant should be entitled to exemption from duty under the scheme Appellants had imported the impugned goods and had re exported them within a short time and this was their first time of import of the goods in the export processing zone we find that the penalty of Rs lakhs is very much on the higher side Having regard to the fact that the goods were re exported we reduce the penalty to Rs
