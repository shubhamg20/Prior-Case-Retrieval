It was contended on behalf of <ORG> that what is included in the expression estate is specified in sub clauses i ii and iii of clause of article A and since the sub clauses are disjunctive it would be enough for the <ORG> to show that the law related to land covered by an estate falling in at least one of the sub clauses that since private forests were held in janman right they would be an estate within the meaning of sub clause i and that if the law envisaged a measure of agrarian reform it was not necessary for the <ORG> to establish additionally that forest lands were similar lands described in sub clause iii that is to say lands held for purposes of agriculture or for purposes ancillary thereto It would not be in such a case necessary to further examine if the lands so vested in the government are agricultural lands failing within sub clause iii <ORG> has not given any substantial reasons for coming to the conclusion that the scheme of agrarian reform is a teasing illusion and a promise in unreality If there is pressure on land and the legislature feels that forest lands in some areas can be conveniently and without much damage to the community as a whole utilized for settling a large proportion of the agricultural population it is perfectly open under the constitutional powers vested in the legislature to make a suitable law and if the law is constitutionally valid this <ORG> can hardly strike it down on the ground that in the long run the legislation instead of turning out to be a boon will turn out to be a curse was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> gave a separate Opinion on behalf of himself and <NAME> <NAME> All the above cases involve a challenged to the Kerala Private Forests Vesting and Assignment Act of hereinafter called the Act on the ground that the Act as a whole was violative of Articles and of the Constitution The Writ Petitions are filed in this Court under Article of the Constitution by several Owners and or lessees of large tracts of forest lands The Civil Appeals are filed by the State of Kerala from the judgment and order of a full bench of <ORG> Reported in A I Kerala in petitions filed in that court challenging the Act It is contended on behalf of the <ORG> of Kerala that in order to get the protection of Article A a of the Constitution that the law must fulfill two conditions that it must relate to an estate as defined in Article A a and that the law must be one of agrarian reform It was submitted that the private forests in Malabar are held in janman right and hence they are an estate within the meaning of sub clause i Section gives some definitions Section provides for the constitution of <ORG> their powers and functions The <ORG> shall after reserving such extent of the private forests vested in the <ORG> under sub section of section or of the lands comprised in such private forests as may be necessary for purposes directed towards the promotion of agriculture or the welfare of the agricultural population or for purposes ancillary thereto assign on registry or lease to a agriculturists agricultural laborers Members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes who are willing to take up agriculture as means of their livelihood unemployed young persons belonging to families of agriculturists and agricultural laborers who have no sufficient means of livelihood and who are willing to take up agriculture as means of their livelihood laborers belonging to families of agriculturists and agricultural laborers whose principal means of livelihood before the appointed day was the income they obtained as wages for work in collection with or relate to private forests and who are willing to take up agriculture as means of their liveliho od The <ORG> may by notification in the <ORG> delegate their power under sub section to any officer of the <ORG> or any class of officers of <ORG> subject to such restrictions and control as may be specified in the notification The extent of private forests or lands comprised in private forests which may be assigned to each of the categories of persons specified in sub section and the order of preference in which assignment may be made shall be such as may be prescribed Section deals with the powers of the <ORG> and the custodian and Section Section provides for the rules making power of the Government Mr <NAME> who addressed us the principal argument in this case on behalf of the owners contended that private forests could not be converted into agricultural lands by a mere legislative flat contained in the Preamble of the Act because forest lands are lands in which forests grow spontaneously and naturally without human effort or skill and are quite distinct from Since the Preamble to the impugned Act forests in the State of Kerala are agricultural lands and there is no definition of what is meant by agricultural lands in the Act itself we shall have to consider in what sense the expression agricultural lands has been used in the Act He submits that this affirmation in the Preamble is not irresponsibly made and that the expression agricultural lands has been used in a special sense having regard to the uses to which these forest lands have been put over generations Reference may also be made in this connection to some of the passages in the affidavit filed by Shri <NAME> Joint Secretary to <ORG> <ORG> in this connection The several authoritative reports to which reference was made in the affidavit were made available to us and the extracts therefrom were read out at the time of the There is force in this contention It is further stated in the Preamble that in order to give effect to the above objects it was necessary that the private forests should vest in the <ORG> The conditions and restrictions under which the assignments are to take place have to be prescribed by rules That scheme as envisaged in this section was upheld by this Court as a scheme for agrarian reform and we do not see any good reason why we should take a different view with regard to the scheme envisaged in section of the impugned Act <ORG> thought that the scheme was not real or genuine but illusory and has given some reasons in para of the judgment why it took that view The reasons given do not stand scrutiny Exception is taken to assignments by way of lease on the ground that the lessee does not get any fixing of tenure The other reason given is that there is no provision with regard to trees in the forest reserve under section and a suspicion is expressed that the <ORG> may appropriate to itself the value of the trees There is therefore no foundation for the suspicion that valuable trees which form part of the reserve private forests are liable to be appropriated for purposes other than those specifically mentioned in that section provides for the constitution of <ORG> and this relates to the price of trees standing in the lands assigned on registry or given on lease But that does not mean that the value of the trees in the reserve area can be utilized for purposes other than those specifically mentioned in section That will be part of the scheme and <ORG> will have to take adequate provision as to how the value of the trees can be utilized for purposes directed towards the promotion of agriculture or welfare of the agricultural population or for purposes ancillary thereto If this could be constitutionally done by the legislature the fact that at an earlier stage the <ORG> was toying with the idea of paying compensation to owners of private forests is of little consequence But we have no material before us for expressing opinion on such a matter SupCI Mr <NAME> who appeared for the respondent in Civil Appeal No put forward a plea of equitable estoppel peculiar to his client company of the Constitution on the score that it violated their fundamental rights under arts Any law providing for the acquisition by the <ORG> of an estate is saved by art Indeed the decisions of this <ORG> cited at the bar adopt this meaningfully latitudinarian approach and we may briefly refer to them here the learned Judge struck the true national note if we may say so with great respect when he observed The scheme of rural development today envisages not only equitable distribution of land so that there is no undue imbalance in society resulting in a landless class on Vol The details of the scheme of agrarian reform to which the acquired forests would be subjected cannot obviously be embodied in the statue and they are left to be provided by rules which are to be made under for the purpose of carrying out the Provisions of the statute But there is no basis or justification for this apprehension because we are of the view that the agrarian project would have to be spelt out concretely by the <ORG> Government within the prescribed period of two years or at any rate within a reasonable time thereafter If the <ORG> Govern ment merely goes on making money by cutting and selling the timber grown on the forests without implementing the definite proposals of agrarian reform contemplated in within a reasonable period of time it would be a subversion of the statute and in such a case it would be competent to the aggrieved parties to take legal action compelling the <ORG> to make good the statutory promise and to act In terms of and if the forests are diverted for uses outside the scope of the court could restrain the <ORG> from such illegitimate adventures <NAME> clarified the law thus It may be made clear at the outset that the dectrine of courable legislation does not involve any question of bona fides or mala fides on the part of the legislature The whole doctrine resolves itself into the question of competency of a particular legislature to enact a particular law As we see it the Forest Act is calculated to bring benefit to landless laborers tribals and other proletarian groups in the over populated state of Kerala If the <ORG> for ulterior ends prevaricates or betrays the scheme by non implementation or mis implementation an aggrieved party may seek relief through a judicial post audit The <ORG> is not altogether powerless in such a case in the light of the observations made by <NAME> in <NAME> case that If the State were to use lands for purposes which have no direct connection with the promotion of agriculture or welfare of agricultural population the State could be restrained from using the lands for those purposes We on our part do not think there is any merit in it For these and other reasons already mentioned in the leading judgment of our learned brother Mr Justice <NAME> we agree that the appeals be allowed and the writ petitions be dismissed with no order as to costs
