Simultaneously they filed another classification list claiming approval of basic excise duty at the rate of ad valorem under Tariff Item of on pre budget stock of <ORG> <ORG> and articles thereof In this order we shall refer only to such of the judgments as were actually gone into or can be said to be directly relevant to the issue before us He submitted that in the Order in Original of the Superintendent reliance had been placed on the above Rule However in the order of the Collector Appeals there was no reference to the Rule and it had been by passed on general considerations resulting in a wrong decision The only difference was that immediately on the introduction of the Bill together with the invocation of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act the excisable goods were specified under a different entry of the Schedule <NAME> submitted that in some of the authorities reference had been made to the point of time when the goods came into existence No doubt Sub section of Section of the Act stated that there shall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India If however this was interpreted to mean that the late of duty was fixed immediately the manufacture was completed then Rule A would have to be taken as either ineffective or inconsistent with the provisions of Section He submitted that we should not adopt an interpretation of either the Section or the Rule which would lead to the above result This being a recent judgment which took into account a number of earlier judgments no doubt carried considerable weight It had been held in para in the judgment that the answer to the question which fell for determination that case was found in Section and not in any other Section or Rule including Rule A A taxing authority will not ordinarily impose such a duty because it is much more convenient administratively to collect the duty as in the case of most of the Indian Excise Acts when the commodity leaves the factory for the first time and also because the duty is intended to be an indirect duty which the manufacturer or producer is to pass on to the ultimate consumer which he could not do if the commodity had for example been destroyed in the factory itself It is the fact of manufacture which attracts the duty even though it may be collected later <NAME> submitted that the observations of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> had to be read in the light of the position set out in the <ORG> judgment above That was a case where there was initially a total exemption from duty on power driven pumps subject to certain conditions The total exemption was modified with effect from and a concessional rate of duty made applicable <NAME> submitted that there was a clear distinction between that case and the present case where the goods were dutiable both before and after the date of introduction of the Finance Bill <NAME> also submitted that there were a number of judicial decisions with reference to the parallel provisions of Section of the Customs Act in which the view had been taken that the rate of duty would depend not on the date of importation corresponding to the date of manufacture in the case of excisable goods but in the manner specified in Section corresponding to Rule A in the case of excisable goods When <NAME> the learned advocate for the respondents started his reply the Bench suggested to him that there were two relevant aspects which he might deal with in the course of his arguments Sub section of this Section delegated only the manner of the levy and collection of duties of excise the power to impose a duty being only with <ORG> However his submission was that on a true interpretation of this sub rule what it governed was only the rate of duty the question of tariff valuation would not arise in this case and not the classification of the goods based on their description If between the date of manufacture and the date of removal there was a change in the rate of duty with reference to the classification which had already been determined the revised rate would be applicable at the time of removal However if there was a change in the classification such a change could not in view of the wording of the Rule be applied at the time of removal of the goods He particularly referred to paras and of that opinion at pages and wherein it was laid down that the taxable event in the case of duties of excise is the manufacture of goods and the duty is not directly on the goods but on the manufacture thereof Even assuming that Section of the Act gave certain powers to <ORG> in this regard If it were held that a different Tariff description would be applicable to the goods because of a change subsequent to the completion of manufacture it would mean that the accounts properly maintained would stand falsified and an innocent manufacturer would be liable to penal action <NAME> thereafter submitted that no provision of an Act could given retrospective effect unless this was specifically provided for In para of that judgment <ORG> had quoted with approval the observations of <NAME> that The general rule is that all statutes other than those which are merely declaratory or which relate only to matters of procedure or of evidence are prima facie prospective and retrospective effect is not to be given to them unless by express words or necessary implication it appears that this was the intention of the legislature Shri <NAME> also referred to the case of <ORG> This elated to dyes derived from coal tar which prior to the Budget were not excisable There was a series of judgments in this case the final one being that of <ORG> reported in CENCUS <ORG> held that it was incumbent on the respondents <ORG> to establish that the goods in question were manufactured after the midnight of and they had failed to do so in the result the matter was decided in favour of the manufacturers and against the <ORG> <NAME> submitted that the amendment only had the effect that whatever was henceforth manufactured and fell within the amended description in Item would be classifiable under that item He submitted that in view of the authorities cited by him particularly the advisory opinion of <ORG> vide para above this assumption was not correct and since the decision in that case was based on this assumption it was also not an authority to be followed He cited the reference at page of The Law of Central Excise Second Edition by <NAME> and <NAME> to the case of <NAME> Assistant Collector of Central Excise wherein reference was made to a decision of <ORG> Since there is no such provision in Section of the Act this argument is not very relevant The tariff description was required only with reference to the provisions of Rule relating to the filing of classification lists and Sub rule of that Rule specifically provided for filing a fresh list or an amendment when there was an amendment to the First Schedule whether it related to a change in the description or in the item or sub item number We have carefully considered the submissions from both sides on the very interesting question which has been raised in this appeal The question is whether their tariff classification for the purpose of levy and collection of duty should be determined by the tariff as it stood at the time of manufacture or as it stood at the time of removal As seen from what has been stated above detailed arguments were addressed by both sides and several authorities relied upon The situations which are covered by the cases cited and are relevant to the present issue appear to be the following i Goods excisable but fully exempt at the time of manufacture and excisable and not exempt at the time of removal ii Goods excisable and not exempt at the time of manufacture and excisable and not exempt at the time oval there being only a variation in the quantum of exemption iii Goods not excisable at the time of manufacture and excisable and not exempt at the time of removal and iv Goods excisable and not exempt at the time of manufacture and excisable under a different tariff entry and not exempt at the time of removal We shall now refer briefly to the cases relating to each of these situations and also to cases relating to the parallel provisions in Section of the Customs Act In the first judgment <ORG> of <ORG> held that the liability for tax namely the excise duty would arise no sooner the manufacture or production is completed and it is immaterial as to what machinery may be devised by <ORG> under the rule making powers for recovery of a tax In that case the goods were excisable throughout but there was a partial exemption at the time of manufacture which was modified so that a higher rate was prevailing on the date of removal There was a change in the statutory rate also but this does not affect the discussion The attention of <ORG> was drawn to the decisions of the same <ORG> and of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> Brothers to which reference has been made above The learned counsel for the petitioner argues that the view taken by this <ORG> in <NAME> Brothers case must be taken to have been approved by <ORG> as the <ORG> was dismissed on merits The order of <ORG> does not give any reasons The third situation has been covered by the judgment of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> of <ORG> referred to in para above However as against this there is the case of <ORG> vide para above It was ultimately held by <ORG> that it was incumbent on the excise authorities to establish that the goods were manufactured after the midnight of that is when the new item had become applicable and that they had failed to do so and accordingly the matter was decided in favour of the manufacturers We have seen the judgment of <ORG> remanding the matter to <ORG> Apparently before <ORG> it was accepted or assumed by both parties that where the process of manufacture was completed before the date of imposition of the duty that duty would not apply to the goods However even though this question was not argued it could be said that there is the authority of <ORG> to the effect that in such a case where duty is newly levied it would not apply to goods already manufactured We find however that there is no such observation or assumption in the judgment that the taxable event is the date of removal and not the date of manufacture of goods There are also some decisions of the <ORG> itself on some of the above situations These decisions were taken after considering the various authorities which were cited We may also refer to another judgment which although not cited before us has come to be well known There are also a number of other judgments to the same effect differentiating the date of importation or the date of entry into the territorial waters from the date of filing of the bill of entry or other date as mentioned in Section and holding that it is the latter date which determines the rate of duty Indeed in the <ORG> case vide para above <ORG> of <ORG> headed by the Hon ble Chief Justice of that <ORG> after taking note of the decision of the same <ORG> in the <NAME> Brothers case and of the fact that the <ORG> in that regard had been dismissed on merits considered that the <NAME> Brothers case was distinguishable on facts and the decision in that case must be confined to its own facts The situation before us is squarely covered by the judgment of the Allahabad <ORG> in the case of <ORG> and no contrary decision relating to such a case has been brought to our notice In the subsequent judgment in the <ORG> case vide para above <ORG> of the Madhya Pradesh had observed that the order of the <ORG> did not give any reasons and that the words dismissed the SLP on merits were too vague for the declaration of any law under Article We would like to stress that the scope for distinction was not newly introduced by <ORG> which decided the <ORG> case but was found by them in the second order of <ORG> in the <NAME> Brothers case There are further observations in <ORG> judgment in the <NAME> Brothers case which are of relevance to the present case For convenience we are reproducing below para of that judgment The learned counsel for the petitioner further invited attention to the provision of Section of the Act as also to Rules A and Rule of the Central Excise Rules We may observe that the said rules relate to time and manner of payment of duty Excise duty being a tax on production or manufacture the liability for tax will arise at the time the production or manufacture is completed and not at the time the goods are removed from the godowns by the producer or the manufacturer of course if that liability under Section be established then the matter relating to rate will be governed by the provisions of Section of the Act and the relevant rules pertaining thereto In view of this position we do not think that the present case is a fit one for a certificate of fitness for leave to appeal to <ORG> as in our opinion no substantial question of law of general importance is involved in this case It will be seen that reference has been made above to applicable rules including Rule A it has been observed that the relevant rate will be the one prevailing on the date of removal of the goods and that if liability under Section is established then the matter relating to rate will be governed by the provisions of Section of the Act and the relevant rules pertaining thereto What emerges clearly from a study of the <ORG> judgments is that in the first decision in this case there was a categorical view that the liability for tax would arise no sooner the manufacture or production is completed and the point of recovery or any restriction on removal would not be the determining factor for grant of exemption in respect of goods manufactured during the duty free period Therefore when <ORG> dismissed the special leave petition on merits without recording reasons it can certainly be taken that it approved the reasoning of <ORG> but it would not be justified to hold that <ORG> approved the reasoning only as expressed in the first judgment and not the explanation or elaboration as contained in the second judgment which as we have mentioned was also delivered by the learned Chief Justice who delivered the first judgment Therefore a close study of the judgment in the <ORG> case would confirm the view that while <ORG> had upheld the finding of <ORG> in the situation covered by that case it had also left open the position in regard to other situations The above discussion would lead to the conclusions that i There are a number of situations which can be distinguished and where the position law would be different ii The order of <ORG> in the Kirloskar Brothers case should be taken as applicable to the situation in that case other cases having to be considered on their own merits iii The order of <ORG> in the <ORG> case was on the basis of the assumed or admitted position in that case and the situation there was different from that in the present case iv The decisions in the <ORG> case and the <ORG> case on the parallel provision in Section of the Customs Act are in line with the decisions in the <ORG> case and the <ORG> case and The situation in the present case is squarely covered by the judgment of <ORG> in the Kesar Sugar Works case We would observe that if it is held that Rule A applies the question of retrospectivity does not arise because that Rule itself fixes the relevant point of time which determines the rate of duty as the time of removal <NAME> did not contend that Rule A was not valid or that it was not applicable though he had his own explanation as to the scope of its application Even in the quotation from <ORG> relied upon by <NAME> it is laid down that retrospective effect could be given to a provision if by express words or necessary implication it appears that this was the intention of the legislature Power to make declaration under this Act Where a Bill to be introduced in <ORG> on behalf of Government provides for the imposition or increase of a duty of customs or excise the Central Government may cause to be inserted in the Bill a declaration that it is expedient in the public interest that any provision of the Bill relating to such imposition or increase shall have immediate effect under this Act Effect of declaration under this Act and duration thereof A declared provision shall have the force of law immediately on the expiry of the day on which the Bill containing it is introduced There was appended to the Bill a declaration under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act which read as under It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the provisions of clauses and of this Bill shall have immediate effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act It appears to us that even if the application of the amended provision to goods manufactured earlier and cleared after could be considered as having an element of retrospectivity it could still be held that by virtue of the provision in the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act and the further specific provisions in the Finance Bill that effect was the specific intention of the legislation Since the same Finance Bill raised the rate of duty on Item from to and this provision also had immediate effect under the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act <NAME> had conceded that the increased rate of duty under Item as in force at the time of removal would be applicable to the goods in question even though they had been manufactured earlier He however contended that the changed description of Item which brought these goods within the scope of that Item would not be applicable
