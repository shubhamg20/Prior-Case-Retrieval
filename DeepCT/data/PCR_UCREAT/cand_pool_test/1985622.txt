The Magistrate held that there were materials to make out a prima facie case under of the Act against the gun licensee and under of the Act against the mechanic and charged them accordingly In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant State that the question whether a person is in possession of a fire arm or had transferred and delivered it to another is largely one of fact that in the instant case the mechanic was not a servant or employee of the respondents but was independently running his own business of repairing fire arms that the fire arms were handed over by the respondents to the mechanic to be repaired at the latter residence cum workshop which was not the respondent licensed place of business that the mechanic had no licence for repairing or keeping fire arms and the respondents were either aware of this fact or did not ascertain it before delivering the fire arms to him that possession within the purview of means immediate possession and consequently delivery of even temporary possession and control to an unauthorised person falls within the mischief of the section that in the circumstances of the instant case there was a clear prima facie case not only under but also under read with of the Act against the Respondents and consequently the Magistrate was not justified in discharging them In the instant case although the respondents held licences in Form IX for repairing and dealing in fire arms at the place of business factory or shop which was specified in Column of their licences they handed over the fire arms to the mechanic who had no such licence to be repaired at the latters own workshop Prima facie the materials before the Magistrate showed that the respondents had delivered the fire arms in question into the possession of the mechanic without previously ascertaining that he was legally authorised to have the same in his possession and as such they appeared to have committed an offence under of the Act The Magistrate was thus clearly in error in discharging these respondents Trial of summons case as a warrant case does not amount to an illegality but is a mere irregularity that does not vitiate the trial unless there is a prejudice Case remitted to trial Magistrate with direction to frame charges in respect of offences under Sections and of the Act against Respondents to and to proceed further with the trial The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA Whether the giving of fire arms by a person holding a licence for repairing and dealing in fire arms for repairs to mechanic who holds no such licence but does the repair job at his workshop at a place different from the factory or place of business of the licence holder amounts to delivery of those arms into the possession of another person within the contemplation of Section of the Arms Act For short called the Act is the principal question that falls to be answered in this appeal by special leave directed against a judgment dated August of <ORG> The trial Magistrate while considering the question of framing charges held that there were materials to make out a prima facie case under Section of the Act against <NAME> and under Section of the Act against <NAME> and charged them accordingly So far as respondents to are concerned the Magistrate took the view that the giving of the arms to the accused <NAME> by respondents to for the limited purpose of repairs did not amount to delivery of possession of those arms within the meaning of Section of the Arms Act Act IV and in the result he discharged the respondents by an order dated November <ORG> of <ORG> who heard the Revision dismissed it with the reasoning that Respondents to could not be said to have delivered the fire arms concerned into the possession of <NAME> within the meaning of Section of the Act because the respondents who possessed valid licences for repairs as well as for sale of fire arms had given only temporary custody of those arms to <NAME> for the limited purpose of carrying the repair job while the effective control over those arms all the time remained with the respondents It is submitted that in the instant case there were three stark facts which more than any other unmistakably showed that the respondents had given possession of these fire arms to <NAME> a <NAME> was not a servant or employee of the respondents but was running his own business of repairing fire arms It is further urged that the delivery of fire arms for repairs to the unlicensed mechanic for repairs to be carried out at a place other than the factory or place of business specified in the licence of the owners will amount to an offence under Section read with Section of the Act also The sum and substance of his arguments is that the mechanic <NAME> was only in temporary custody of these arms for the limited purpose of repairing them as an agent of the owners who being licensees in Form IX entitled to repair and keep these fire arms throughout remained in their lawful possession and control In <NAME> ibid this <ORG> while noting that the concept of possession is not easy to comprehend held that in the context of Section a of the Arms Act the possession of a fire arm must have firstly the element of consciousness or knowledge of that possession in the person charged with such offence and secondly he has either the actual physical possession of the fire arm or where he has not such physical possession he has nonetheless a power or control over that weapon The standard of test proof and judgment which is to be applied finally before finding the accused guilty or otherwise is not exactly to be applied at the stage of Section or of the Code of Criminal Procedure At this stage even a very strong suspicion founded upon materials before the Magistrate which leads him to form a presumptive opinion as the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged may justify the framing of charge against the accused in respect of the commission of the offence There is nothing in these materials to show that at the time of the seizure of these fire arms any of the respondents or any Manager of their concerns was found present and personally supervising the repair work that was being done by the mechanic <NAME> These positive and negative facts in conjunction with other subsidiary facts appearing expressly or by implication from the materials which were before the Magistrate at that initial stage were at least sufficient to show that there were grounds for presuming that the accused respondents had committed offences under Sections and of the Act There is nothing in those materials to show that before handing over those fire arms to <NAME> for repairs the respondents had done anything to ascertain that <NAME> was legally authorised to retain those arms even for the limited purpose of repairing them Thus prima facie the materials before the Magistrate showed that the respondents had delivered the fire arms in question into the possession of <NAME> without previously ascertaining that he was legally authorised to have the same in his pos session and as such the respondents appeared to have committed and offence under Section of the Act Contravention of any condition of the licence amounts to an offence punishable under Section of the Act The Magistrate was thus clearly in error in discharging these accused respondents The rule enunciated in these decisions has been given a limited recognition in the Proviso to Section of the Act of Under this Proviso if a licensed weapon is carried to an authorised repairer by another having no licence he will not be guilty for carrying that fire arm if he has a written authority of the license holder for carrying that weapon to a repairer For all the reasons aforesaid we allow this appeal and set aside the orders of the Courts below whereby respondents to herein were discharged Moreover trial of a summons case as a warrant case does not amount to an illegality but is a mere irregularity that does not vitiate the trial unless there is prejudice We therefore send the case back to the trial Magistrate with the direction that he should frame charges in respect of offences under Sections and Section of the Act against the accused respondents to and proceed further with the trial in accordance with law We decline the submission made on behalf of these respondents that on account of their prolonged harassment and expense which are the necessary concomitants of protracted criminal proceedings extending over eight years they should not be put on trial now for offences which according to the counsel are merely technical Even so we think this is a circumstance to be taken into consideration by the trial court in fixing the nature and quantum of sentence in the event of the accused being found guilty
