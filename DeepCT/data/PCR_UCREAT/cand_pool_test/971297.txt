it has been decided by a Bench of this Court that no appeal lies from the decision of <ORG> under Clause of Section of the Bombay District Municipalities Act Such a decision would in our opinion be seriously anomalous and we do not think that the words of the Statute require us to make such a pronouncement The only decision which seems to us fairly consistent with that already recorded in <NAME> case Ind In <NAME> <NAME> this Court has held that it has no jurisdiction to revise the order of a District Judge acting under Section of the Bombay District Municipalities Act of And although the words occurring in that section are District Judge whereas the words occurring in Section last clause are <ORG> we do not think that the distinction is sufficient to support the argument that an application for revision is competent although admittedly no appeal would lie
