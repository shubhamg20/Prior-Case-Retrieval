There was no force in the contention that the delivery in question was effected under of the Displaced Persons Act It could not be said that as A had rightly or wrongly taken on of the property on June should have agitated the matter in a court of law and the appellants had no right to take the law in their own hands The fact that some formalities were gone through in pursuance of an unauthorised delivery order was no ground for holding that possession of the field had passed to A It is true that no one including the true owner has a right to dispossess the trespasser by force if the trespasser is in settled possession of the land and in such a case unless he is evicted in due course of law he is entitled to defend his possession even against the rightful owner The appellants were therefore entitled to prevent hem by using necessary force from taking possession The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Two questions that arise for decision in this appeal by special leave are whether the appellants have established satisfactorily the right of private defence pleaded by them and if they had that right have they exceeded the same The prosecution case is as follows Field No measuring five bighas and thirteen biswas situated in Kilokri was an evacuee property and as such was under the management of the managing officer But he put off the question of compromise by pleading that he was going out of station and the question of compromise could be considered after his return On the basis of the above facts it was urged on behalf of the appellants that they were not guilty of any offence The courts below have accepted the prosecution version both as regards possession as well as to the manner in which the incident took place The burden of establishing that plea is on the accused and that burden can be discharged by showing prepon derance of probabilities in favour of that plea on the basis of the material on record The first question that arises for decision in this case is as to who was in possession of the field in dispute on the date of the occurrence i on July There is also no evidence to show that <NAME> was aware of the alleged delivery This takes us to the question whether the purported delivery is valid in law Therefore it is clear that <NAME> had become the owner of the land long before June could not have evicted <NAME> from the land in the manner alleged We fail to see how he could have done it He had no interest in the land in question on June Thereafter it went out of the compensation pool and the managing officer had no power to deal with it unless otherwise expressly provided Our attention has not been invited to any provision in the Act authorising the managing officer to deal with a property which had ceased to be an Where any person a has ceased to be entitled to the possession of any evacuee property by reason of any action taken under sub section or is otherwise in unauthorised possession of any evacuee property or any other immovable property forming part of the compensation pool he shall after he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against his eviction from such property surrender pos session of the property on demand being made in this behalf by the managing officer or managing corporation or by any other person duly authorised by such officer or corporation It must be noted that the power conferred under sub is a special power conferred for a special purpose It is seen from the evidence of <ORG> Jamuna which evidence was not even challenged in cross examination that PWs and were aware of the fact that the purported delivery on June was merely a paper delivery But it was urged on behalf of the prosecution that rightly or wrongly <NAME> taken possession of the property on June and therefore if <NAME> had any grievances he should have agitated LISup CI the same in a court of law and that his relations had no right to take law into their own hands The fact that some formalities were gone through in pursuance of an unauthorised order issued by PW is no ground for holding that possession of the field had passed into the hands of PW Steps taken by PW and others who accompanied him on June were unauthorised acts It is true that no one including the true owner has a right to dispossess the trespasser by force if the trespasser is in settled possession of the land and in such a case unless he is evicted in due course of law he is entitled to defend his possession even against the rightful owner It is only thereafter on July they along with their friends went to the field with a tractor and at that time <NAME> was armed with a pistol for which he had no licence The law relating to defence of property is set out in which says that every person has a right subject to the restrictions contained in to defend First his own body and the body of any other person against any offence affecting the human body Secondly Section of the Code lays down that there is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities It was urged on behalf of the prosecution that even assuming that <NAME> was in possession of the field in view of the delivery that had taken place on June he and his relations had enough time to have recourse to the protection of the public authorities and therefore the appellants could not claim the right of private defence The right of private defence serves a social purpose and that right should be liberally construed There is nothing more degrading to the human spirit than to run away in the face of peril In a wellordered civilised society it is generally assumed that the <ORG> would take care of the persons and properties of individual citizens and that normally it is the function of the <ORG> to afford protection to such persons and their properties
