The approval certificate was granted for one year and until December it had been renewed from year to year when <ORG> refused to renew it on the ground that the partners composing the firm had changed The request made by the appellants for copies of the correspondence and for an opportunity to be heard was refused by <ORG> Ultimately <ORG> refused the review application on the ground that there was no valid ground to interfere with the decision of <ORG> The present appeal was filed on special leave granted by this <ORG> On behalf of the appellants it was contended that <ORG> while disposing of an application under in terms of acts as a quasi judicial authority and the order which was passed taking into consideration the report of <ORG> behind the appellants back and without affording a reasonable opportunity for presenting their case was contrary to natural justice and was therefore void an opportunity to meet the case of an applicant for review the same principle would apply even where a petition for review is rejected based on materials which were not made available to the applicant for review of the Constitution and is against an order of <ORG> <ORG> dated July rejecting an application filed by the appellants under rule of the Mineral Concession Rules to review an order passed by <ORG> rejecting their application for the renewal of the Certificate of Approval granted to them The appellants filed a petition to <ORG> Punjab under Art of the Constitution praying for a writ of certiorari to quash the above order of <ORG> This petition was dismissed by <ORG> in limine and Civil Appeal No of is by special leave of this Court against this order of <ORG> Punjab The appellants who constitute a partnership are engaged inter alia in the business of mining and they held a prospecting licence in the State of Madhya Pradesh Under the scheme of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act Act No XLIII of and the Mineral Concession Rules framed thereunder in order that a prospecting licence may be granted to a person he has to hold a certificate of approval from <ORG> concerned and similarly the rules provide that no mining lease shall be granted to any person unless he held a similar certificate of approval The original certificate granted to the appellants for the year was being renewed from year to year and as a result they held a valid certificate of approval up to the period ending on December Being desirous of having the same renewed for the following calendar year they made an application to <ORG> on November <ORG> however by an order dated September rejected the application the reason given being that the partners composing the firm had changed This order was communicated to the appellants on October and thereupon the appellants made an application on November to <ORG> for a review of the order of <ORG> under rule of the Mineral Concession Rules Rule which was invoked by the appellants provides Where a State Government has failed to dispose of an application for grant of renewal of a certificate of approval or prospecting licence or a mining lease within the period prescribed therefor in these Rules such failure shall for the purpose of these rules be deemed to be a refusal to grant or renew such certificate licence or lease as the case may be and any person aggrieved by such failure may within two months of the expiry of the period aforesaid apply to <ORG> for reviewing the case The procedure for review is laid down by rule which reads Review Upon receipt of such application <ORG> may if it thinks fit call for the relevant records and other information from <ORG> and after considering any explanation that may be offered by <ORG> cancel or revise the order of <ORG> or pass such order as <ORG> may deem just and proper The appellants having come to know from a letter addressed to them by <ORG> that <ORG> had been required to send a report of their remarks in connection with their application for review made enquiries as to what had happened and also requested that they might be informed as to the progress of their application and that they might be given an opportunity of a personal hearing at which they would be able to satisfy the Government about the genuineness of their case On July the application of the appellants was rejected by <ORG> the order stating <ORG> have come to the conclusion that there is no valid ground for interfering with the decision of <ORG> rejecting your application for renewal of a certificate of approval for the year Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the appellants submitted that <ORG> when disposing of an application under in terms of rule is acting as a quasi judicial authority and the order which was passed taking into consideration the report of <ORG> and without their knowing the contents of the report and without affording them a reasonable opportunity of presenting their case was contrary to natural justice and was therefore void support him that the <ORG> acting under the rule referred to is functioning as a quasi judicial authority It does follow therefore that they could not act on the basis of material as regards which the appellants had no opportunity to make their representation No doubt the decision in <NAME> <ORG> was concerned with a case where an order had been passed prejudicial to the respondents before the <ORG> without affording them an opportunity to meet the case of an applicant for review but the same principle would in our opinion apply even where a petition for review is rejected based on materials which were not made available to the applicant for review We have therefore no hesitation in holding that the order of <ORG> now under appeal is vitiated as being contrary to the principles of natural justice in that the decision was rendered without affording to the appellants a reasonable opportunity of being heard which is a sine qua non of a fair hearing apparently be cause they proceeded on the view that the exercise of jurisdiction of <ORG> under rules and of the Mineral Concession Rules was really administrative in character so that the reasonable opportunity that is an essential requisite of quasi judicial procedure was not attracted to the The result is that the appeals are allowed and order of <ORG> dated July and of <ORG> dated September are set aside <ORG> will consider the review application afresh and dispose of the same in accordance with law and in the light of the observations contained in this judgment The appellants are entitled to their costs in this <ORG> Hearing fee
