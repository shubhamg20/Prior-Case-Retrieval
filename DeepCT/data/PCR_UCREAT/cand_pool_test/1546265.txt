The question to be determined in this appeal is whether the provisions of the Punjab Urban Immovable Property Tax Act Punj Act No XVII of which will hereinafter be referred to as the Punjab Act are beyond the powers of <ORG> which enacted it At first he denied his liability to pay the amount but subsequently he paid it under protest and thereafter instituted a suit in <ORG> at Amritsar claiming its refund on the ground that the Act which levied the property tax was ultra vires <ORG> This suit was dismissed and thereupon he made an application for revision to <ORG> but the application also was dismissed In order to appreciate the grounds on which the Punjab Act is called in question a brief reference to some of the provisions of the Government of India Act seems necessary Section of the Government of India Act gives the power to <ORG> to make laws for the whole or any part of British India or any federated State and to <ORG> to make laws for the Province or for any part thereof This section is followed by Section which runs as follows Notwithstanding anything in the two next succeeding sub sections <ORG> has and <ORG> has not power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to this Act hereinafter called the Federal Legislative List Notwithstanding anything in the next succeeding sub section <ORG> and subject to the preceding sub section <ORG> also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the said Schedule hereinafter called the Concurrent Legislative List Subject to the two preceding sub sections <ORG> has and <ORG> has not power to make laws for a Province or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the said Schedule hereinafter called the Provincial Legislative List <ORG> has power to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in the Provincial Legislative List except for a Province or any part thereof Lastly Section provides that If any provision of a <ORG> law is repugnant to any provision of a <ORG> law which the <ORG> Legislature is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing Indian law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent Legislative List then subject to the provisions of this section the <ORG> law whether passed before or after the <ORG> law or as the case may be the existing Indian law shall prevail and the <ORG> law shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void When a power is conferred to legislate on a particular topic it is important in determining the scope of the power to have regard to what is ordinarily treated as embraced within that topic in legislative practice and particularly in the legislative practice of the <ORG> which had conferred the power It was contended that in interpreting the words tax on buildings which occur in List II regard should be had to the legislative practice prevailing in England and further that since the taxes on buildings in England or rates as they were called were generally speaking in the nature of an occupation tax payable by the occupier it could not have been contemplated by <ORG> that the expression tax on buildings should be something other than an occupation tax and embraces tax payable by the owner It seems however unnecessary to pursue the matter further because the point can in our opinion be disposed of on a surer ground There are no words in the Act to suggest that the tax is to be paid only by the occupier and not by the owner and it seems to us to be wholly wrong to read in item words which do not occur there and thereby to limit the scope and meaning of the expressions used It is suggested that all the words used in item should be read together and that if they are so read it must follow that the tax on buildings should be of the same nature as the tax on hearths and windows which it is said must be in the nature of a consumption tax payable by the occupier It appears to me that if <ORG> when enacting the Government of India Act intended Provincial Legislatures to tax occupiers only and not owners of lands and buildings they would have said so It would have been the obvious thing to say and the fact that they did not say so makes it clear to my mind that <ORG> intended Provincial Legislatures to have power to impose any taxes on lands and buildings hearths and windows which they could legitimately do When words in a statute are clear and unambiguous effect must be given to the plain grammatical meaning of the words The words are clear and they entitle <ORG> to impose taxes on lands and buildings hearths and windows without reference to who has to pay such taxes If the tax can legitimately be paid by the owner then it appears to me that item would cover such tax as it would cover a tax legitimately payable by the occupier It seems to me therefore that no assistance can be obtained from what had been the policy of <ORG> in construing this particular item The second contention put forward on behalf of the appellant is a more serious one and needs very careful examination The Provincial Government may by similar notification direct that during the continuance of the present state of war and for a period not exceeding twelve months after the termination thereof there shall be charged levied and paid in addition to the tax leviable under Sub section a surcharge not exceeding fifty per centum of the rate notified under that sub section The tax shall be paid by the owner of the buildings and lands in respect of which it has been levied This section must be read with Section of the Act which is to the following effect The annual value of any land or building shall be ascertained by estimating the gross annual rent at which such land or building together with its appurtenances and It was contended on behalf of the appellant that on a perusal of Section and other provisions of the Act it would appear that the basis of the tax is the annual value of the building and since the same basis is used in the Indian Income tax Act for determining income from property and generally speaking the annual value is the fairest standard for measuring income and in many cases is indistinguishable from it the tax levied by the impugned Act is in substance a tax on income This conclusion does not seem to follow from a mere perusal of Section of the Act because all that it provides is that there shall be an annual tax on buildings at such rate not exceeding twenty per cent of the annual value of such buildings as <ORG> may direct in respect of each rating area It is argued on behalf of the appellant that the moment it is seen that the basis of the tax is the annual value of property which is the very basis used by the Indian Income tax Act for assessing income from property it should be held that it is in substance a tax on income which is a subject outside the authorised field of <ORG> If the annual value of house property represented in every case the actual income of the owner from the property the question would not have presented so much difficulty As has been pointed out in treatises on income tax many of the rules framed under the Income tax Act are highly artificial so that income calculated for purposes of income tax does not by any means necessarily correspond with the income actually received in the year which can be spent or saved The question which arose in that case was whether the provisions of Section of the Finance Act Northern Ireland were beyond the powers of <ORG> There was no dispute in that case that the rateable value corresponded to the annual value as understood in the Income tax Act but it was held that the mere fact that the basis of the tax was rateable or annual value was not enough to make it a tax on income Lord <NAME> who delivered the judgment in that case pointed out that it is the essential character of the particular tax charged that is to be regarded and the nature of the machinery often complicated by which the tax is to be assessed is not of assistance except in so far as it may throw light on the general character of the tax It shows that there are other factors to be taken into consideration and that it is the essential nature of the tax charged and not the nature of the machinery which is to be looked at Section of the Income tax Act however is a much more elaborate provision and sets out the deductions allowable in seven clauses which include cost of repairs insurance premia interest on mortgages and charges land revenue collection charges and vacancies Indeed it was contended on behalf of the respondent that the omission from the Act of any allowance for such outgoings as interest on mortgages is difficult to explain except on the footing that the basis of the tax is something not dependent on the income of the assessee It was urged on behalf of the appellant that the difference between the two Acts as to the mode of assessing annual value is accidental and is made conspicuous only by reason of the number of deductions allowed under the present Income tax Act It was also pointed out that in the old Income tax Act and especially in the Income tax Act of deductions were not allowed on such a liberal scale If we find that the basis of the tax though described as annual value is something not necessarily synonymous with income and is something very different from the annual value as estimated in the Income tax Act we have to seriously ask ourselves whether the tax which the Punjab Act purports to impose can legitimately be said to be in substance a tax on income The real distinction between these two Acts seems to be that whereas the Income tax Act purports to get at the true income there is no such pretence in the impugned Act which uses the annual value merely for the purpose of determining the importance or the value of the property to be taxed The point which arose in that case was precisely the same as the one raised before us The learned Judges who heard the case came to the unanimous conclusion that the Act was not ultra vires and delivered three very elaborate and instructive judgments which deal with all the important aspects of the case These judgments were read to us almost in extenso in the course of the arguments and we agree generally with the conclusions arrived at in them and with most of the reasonings by which they are supported The charging section in the present case is Section which in clear terms levies not a tax on income but a tax on buildings and lands There is however nothing in the impugned Act to show that there was any intention on the part of the <ORG> to get at or tax the income of the owner from the building It appears then that the language in which the particular legislative powers which the Court is now considering have been granted to the Central and Provincial Legislatures respectively may be wide enough if taken by itself and without reference to anything else in the Act to cover in each case a tax of the kind which has been imposed whether it be called an excise duty if imposed by <ORG> or a tax on the sale of goods if imposed by a Province Only in the Indian Constitution Act can the particular problem arise which is now under consideration and an endeavour must be made to solve it as <ORG> have said by having recourse to the context and scheme of the Act and a reconciliation attempted between two apparently conflicting jurisdictions by reading the two entries together and by interpreting and where necessary modifying the language of the one by that of the other The principles deducible from these pronouncements are that where there is an apparent conflict between an Act of the Federal Legislature and an Act of the Provincial Legislature we must try to ascertain the pith and substance or the true nature and character of the conflicting provisions and that before an Act is declared ultra vires there should be an attempt to reconcile the two conflicting jurisdictions and only if such a reconciliation should prove impossible the impugned Act should be declared invalid There is also another mode of approaching the subject which was indicated by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> Khulna I A Bom Their Lordships made the following observations In our opinion therefore the appeal must fail and it is dismissed with costs to <ORG> the respondent in the appeal
