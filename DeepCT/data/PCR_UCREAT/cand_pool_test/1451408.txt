These petitions seek to challenge the notice dated st July issued by <ORG> Sector II Budaun in respect of the assessment years to for initiating penalty proceedings under Section A a of the Sales Tax Act hereafter the Act However on st July he issued a notice under Section A a of the Act requiring the petitioners to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed for not depositing the tax on the turnover of cotton seed in view of the notification aforesaid The petitioners challenged this notice inter alia on the grounds that since the turnover in respect of binaula stood exempted under Section of the Act the petitioners were not required to deposit any tax in respect thereof and respondent No had no jurisdiction to initiate penalty proceedings under Section A a of the Act A counter affidavit has been filed on behalf of the respondents in which by reference to the various notifications it has been sought to make out that the turnover in respect of sales of cotton seed was exempt up to th April Section of the Act provided for liability of tax under the Act while Section provided for exemption from tax Section was inserted in the Act by the Amendment Act of and it provided for levy of purchase tax Suffice it to say that the Act as originally enacted provided for levy of tax on the sale of goods in Uttar Pradesh Subsequently by Notification No ST dated th July also issued under Section of the Act the words cattle fodder including green fodder occurring in entry No aforesaid were substituted by the words cattle fodder including green fodder chuni bhusi chhilka chokar cotton seed gowar and oilcake with effect from st April Anyhow exemption granted to cotton seed under the aforesaid notification of was not withdrawn In other words cotton seeds were also brought in the net of purchase tax but as noted above the exemption granted by the earlier notifications was not withdrawn What thus comes out is that under Section of the Act originally exemption was granted from st April to cattle fodder including green fodder Thus till th April exemption granted in respect of cotton seed had not been withdrawn and the question is as to whether from th April it can be said that the exemption granted to cotton seed has been withdrawn There is a distinction between the provision relating to exemption and non liability to tax An exemption can be granted only in respect of goods which are liable to tax The sales and purchases of such goods would have to be included in the gross turnover and because of the exemption deduction would be allowed in order to arrive at the net turnover while in regard to non liability to tax such turnover will not be included in the gross or the net turnover It has been observed on page There is a broad distinction between the provisions contained in the statute in regard to the exemptions of tax or refund or rebate of tax on the one hand and in regard to the non liability to tax or non imposition of tax on the other In the former case but for the provisions as regards the exemptions or refund or rebate of tax the sales or purchases would have to be included in the gross turnover of the dealer because they are Prima facie liable to tax and the only thing which the dealer is entitled to in respect thereof is the deduction from the gross turnover in order to arrive at the net turnover on which the tax can be imposed In the latter case the sales or purchases are exempted from taxation altogether The legislature cannot enact a law imposing or authorising the imposition of a tax thereupon and they are not liable to any such imposition of tax If they are thus not liable to tax no tax can be levied or imposed on them and they do not come within the purview of the Act at all The very fact of their non liability to tax is sufficient to exclude them from the calculation of the gross turnover as well as the net turnover on which sales tax can be levied or imposed It is thus settled that transactions or sales which enjoy exemption have to be included in the gross turnover but they are exempted when the net turnover is calculated and as for non liability to tax the turnover in respect of such transactions or sales is not included in the gross or the net turnover The view taken was that the turnover of these items could not be included in the net taxable turnover because of the exemption granted under notification issued under Section in respect of milk products and ice cream and lassi wers items of milk products It was submitted by <NAME> the learned counsel for the petitioners that once a notification is issued in exercise of powers conferred under Section of the Act then irrespective of changes made in Section that exemption would continue If once an exemption is granted under Section of the Act in respect of any class of goods or class of persons then unless such exemption is withdrawn it shall remain in force This came into effect from st April and by Notification No Anyhow the exemption granted to cotton seed under the notifications of was not withdrawn It is correct that the word included is a word of extension and generally it is used in that sense but as laid down by <ORG> in South Gujarat Roofiing Tiles Manufacturers Association State of Gujarat SCC this is so when it is said to include things that would not properly fall within its ordinary connotation Apart from this there is no inflexible rule that the word include should be read always as a word of extension without reference to the context The learned counsel relying on Section of the General Clauses Act urged that the earlier notification granting exemption shall continue in force because it is not inconsistent with the subsequent notification amending the definition of cattle fodder and since there is no express withdrawal of exemption in respect of cotton seed that exemption shall continue to remain in force made under the repealed Act shall continue in force provided it is not inconsistent with the re enacted provision and unless there is an express provision in the re enacted provision to the effect that it shall not so continue in force This principle however does not apply to the present case The exemption granted to cotton seed therefore stands withdrawn It was next contended that even though proceedings for each assessment year are separate only one notice was given in respect of the assessment years to and hence the notice is bad We do not find any merit in this contention
