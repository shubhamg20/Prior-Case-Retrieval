<NAME> was a duly qualified doctor who attended <NAME> during the latter part of his illness aided by the admissions of the plaintiff witnesses the history of the illness and the circumstances of suspicion which arise in the case lead to the conclusion first that <NAME> is not shown to have had due testamentary capacity secondly that the balance of evidence in this difficult case is on the whole to the effect that he had not testamentary capacity and that there is no adequate proof whatever that be knew or approved of the contents of the will Their Lordships agree so entirely with the conclusions at which the learned Judges have arrived and with their estimate of the evidence that it will not be necessary for them to go through the facts in any detail There were five executors He said to me I do not know whether what you have done will be according to law go and get it revised by the pleader of Meherpur He said There are four executors and my wife will also be an executrix He further told me to ask <NAME> to keep this secret that there may be no row The will which had been copied out by one <NAME> was put into his left hand over which he still had some power There were other reasons he said Then there were provisions for poor relatives of the testator and of his widow He had no interest except as executor I saw <NAME> on the morning of the day before that on which it was proposed to take him to Calcutta I went in the morning of the day before that on which it was proposed to take him to Calcutta As regards <NAME> senses on that day I only say this that he could taste food and he used to weep and again to wipe the tears from his eyes as he looked at people He could take down the first part of each spoonful and the latter part of it had to be withdrawn And in this connection it must be borne in mind that <NAME> does not seem to have had any intention of making a will before his illness Apart however from the oral evidence there are several matters which in their Lordships opinion tell heavily against the appellant What reason was there for keeping in the dark the two doctors who were in daily attendance on the patient If it be true as <NAME> says that Dr <NAME> suggested that a will should be made by <NAME> in the state in which he was when he paid his first visit it would only have been natural that he should have been consulted The making of the will from first to last was <NAME> doing and there is no satisfactory evidence to show that the alleged testator understood the business in which <NAME> engaged him Their Lordships will therefore humbly advise Her Majesty that the appeal should be dismissed
