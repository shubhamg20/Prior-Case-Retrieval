The subject matter of the litigation which has culminated in this appeal is an image of <NAME> established in the town of Naraingunj in the District of Dacca and the properties movable and immovable appertaining to the endowment of that diety From these tables it will appear that <NAME> was the founder of the endowment and that the first <ORG> to whom he entrusted the management of the endowed properties was <NAME> If this question is answered in the affirmative the plaintiffs or any of them as representing the line of the founder would not prima facie be entitled to possession of the endowed properties If the question is answered in the negative the point necessarily arises for examination whether the plaintiffs or any of them are entitled to recover possession of the properties and to hold them as shebaits So far as the second question which relates to the true character of the endowment is concerned the Subordinate Judge has not come to any distinct finding but he has held upon the evidence that the worship of the diety is maintained to a large extent by public subscriptions and charities and that the properties of the endowment have from time to time received substantial benefits and accretions from charitable gifts by members of the public Upon the question of limitation he has held that the suit is not barred by limitation but he has not discussed the position whether in the events which have happened the title of the defendants to hold as <ORG> may not have been barred by adverse possession on the part of the plaintiff Before we deal with the questions in controversy it is necessary to examine for a moment the history of the origin and management of the endowment We may however proceed on the assumption that <ORG> is There are no materials on the record which would enable us to determine with any approach to certainty the terms on which the foundation was created The defendant has in his possession documents which might perhaps have thrown some light upon this question He admits that he has a deed of gift written in Persian but he has not filed it Shortly before the death of <NAME> which took place on the th May <NAME> executed a deed in favour of his wife <NAME> and his nephew <NAME> by which ho authorised them to manage the endowment as shebaits Immediately after there was a compromise between <NAME> on the one hand and <NAME> and <NAME> on the other and on the th November both the parties filed applications before the District Judge in the appeal preferred against the decree of dismissal of the suit of <NAME> The first point which requires consideration is whether the first defendant is the lawfully appointed mohunt of the endowment The Subordinate Judge has come to the conclusion upon the evidence that he is not the shebait or mohunt On the other hand there is evidence to show that he became the chela of <NAME> which would not of course confer on him any legal status Again it appears from the evidence of <NAME> a pleader at Naraingunj that litigations in respect of the endowed property were conducted in the name of <NAME> while <NAME> merely acted as her manager The second point which requires consideration is whether under these circumstances when it is established that the last mohunt <NAME> has not left any chela entitled to the office of mohunt the representatives of the founder can legitimately claim to take possession of the properties as shebaits In the case last mentioned the endowment was for the promotion of the Nanakshahi religion and was undoubtedly of a public character and yet it was ruled that when a Religious Endowment has been founded the right to appoint a manager or superintendent remains in the founder and his descendants unless there is evidence to show that the founder or his descendants have made any inconsistent disposition The representatives of the founder have from exercised control direct or indirect over the management of the endowment and it is difficult to appreciate how it can be seriously contended that they have no right to intervene when it is found that the succession to the office of Trustee has wholly failed and the properties have passed in We must consequently hold that the plaintiffs or that some amongst them who are the representatives of the founder are entitled to the relief claimed in this suit There is however in our opinion another ground upon which the plaintiff would be entitled to succeed The third point which requires consideration is whether the plaintiffs are entitled to any relief in the suit as framed The learned Counsel for the appellant has strenuously contended that the plaintiffs ought not to be allowed to succeed upon a case neither made in the plaint nor developed in the evidence It may be conceded that the language of the plaint is open to criticism but the plaintiffs have never pressed for relief on the ground that they are absolute owners and not shebaits of the disputed property <NAME> <NAME> I A at and <NAME> <NAME> I A at On the other hand it has been frequently laid down that even if the plaintiff should mistake the relief to which he is entitled in his special prayer the <ORG> yet may afford him the relief to which he has a right under the prayer for general relief provided it is such a relief as is conformable to the case made in the plaint The test in each case is whether the relief sought may be granted upon the facts stated in the plaint and established by the evidence and whether the variance if any between the pleading and proof will take the defendant unfairly by surprise The facts are set out with sufficient precision in the plaint and have been made out by the evidence on the side of the plaintiffs Under these circumstances there is no conceivable reason why the plaintiffs should not get relief on the ground that they have shebait right in the image of the diety <NAME> and the properties endowed for his worship It has farther been argued by the learned Counsel for the appellant that if the plaintiffs as representatives of the founder are entitled to any relief it is the first plaintiff alone in whose favour a decree may legitimately be made because it was contended the office of shebait is inalienable and any arrangement made by <NAME> authorising his wife <NAME> and his nephew <NAME> to hold the office jointly is inoperative in law In the second place the plaintiffs respondents have throughout been represented by the same Pleader and any question of conflict of interest cannot properly be discussed unless an opportunity is afforded to each of them to place his case before the <ORG> independently
