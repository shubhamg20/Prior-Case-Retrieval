The learned Sessions Judge <NAME> found all the four accused persons guilty and convicted and sentenced them for the offence punishable under Section read with Section and sentenced each of them to undergo imprisonment for life Prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows There was previous enmity between accused persons and the deceased Though the deceased was taken to the hospital he breathed his last at about a on The accused persons pleaded innocence It also did not accept the contention of A that no overt act was attributed to him and there was no material to bring him within the field of Section In appeal <ORG> held that merely because the accused persons have sustained some injuries that cannot ipso facto be a ground for throwing out the prosecution case Non explanation of injuries on the accused persons in all cases is not a ground for discarding the prosecution version Finally the plea that offence under Section read with Section was not made out did not find acceptance by <ORG> It also did not accept the plea that there was no material for applying Section to A The prosecution version itself indicated that there was quarrel between the deceased and the accused and since the assaults allegedly took place in course of a sudden quarrel that too in exercise of right of private defence the accused persons should not have been found guilty The occurrence according to the prosecution took place late in the night and it was completely dark and necessitated focusing of torch by A As they have analysed the factual position in great detail and have come to the conclusion regarding guilt of the accused there is no scope for any interference According to him the case is squarely covered by Section Conviction can be based on the testimony of single witness if he is wholly reliable If the evidence is unblemished and beyond all possible criticism and the <ORG> is satisfied that the witness was speaking the truth then on his evidence alone conviction can be maintained Undisputedly there were injuries found on the body of the accused persons on medical evidence That per se cannot be a ground to totally discard the prosecution version This is a factor which has to be weighed along with other materials to see whether the prosecution version is reliable cogent and trustworthy When the case of the prosecution is supported by an eyewitness who is found to be truthful as well mere non explanation of the injuries on the accused persons cannot be a foundation for discarding the prosecution version Other plea emphasized related to alleged exercise of right of private defence Merely because there was a quarrel and two accused persons sustained injuries that does not confer a right of private defence extending to the extent of causing death as in this case Though such right cannot be weighed in golden scales it has to be established that the accused persons were under such grave apprehension about the safety of their life and property that retaliation to the extent done was absolutely necessary No evidence much less cogent and credible was adduced in this regard The right of private defence as claimed by the accused persons have been rightly discarded This brings us to the crucial question as to which was the appropriate provision to be applied The following comparative table will be helpful in appreciating the points of distinction between the two offences Section Section A person commits Subject to certain exceptions culpable homicide if the act by culpable homicide is murder if the the death is caused is act by which the death is caused done is done INTENTION a with the intention of causing with the intention of causing death or death or with the intention with the intention of causing of causing such such bodily injury as the bodily injury as is offender knows to be likely to likely to cause death or cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused or With the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death or KNOWLEDGE with the with the knowledge that the knowledge that act is so imminently the act is likely to dangerous that it must in all cause death Only the intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender knowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing the death of the particular victim is sufficient to bring the killing within the ambit of this clause This aspect of clause is borne out by Illustration appended to Section If the assailant had no such knowledge about the disease or special frailty of the victim nor an intention to cause death or bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death the offence will not be murder even if the injury which caused the death was intentionally given Obviously the distinction lies between a bodily injury likely to cause death and a bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death The words bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death mean that death will be the most probable result of the injury having regard to the ordinary course of nature For cases to fall within clause it is not necessary that the offender intended to cause death so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature Thirdly it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular injury that is to say that it was not accidental or unintentional or that some other kind of injury was intended Thirdly it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury that is to say that it was not accidental or unintentional or that some other kind of injury was intended But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it the only possible inference is that he intended to inflict it The question so far as the intention is concerned is not whether he intended to kill or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but whether he intended to inflict the injury in question and once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite conclusion The test laid down by <NAME> case supra for the applicability of clause thirdly is now ingrained in our legal system and has become part of the rule of law Under clause thirdly of Section culpable homicide is murder if both the following conditions are satisfied i a that the act which causes death is done with the intention of causing death or is done with the intention of causing a bodily injury and that the injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death It must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury which in the ordinary course of nature was sufficient to cause death viz Thus according to the rule laid down in <NAME> case supra even if the intention of the accused was limited to the infliction of a bodily injury sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature and did not extend to the intention of causing death the offence would be murder Illustration appended to Section clearly brings out this point The factual scenario goes to show that late at night in a stage of complete darkness the occurrence took place Custodial sentence of years would meet the ends of justice The appeal is partly allowed to the extent indicated
