In this Act unless there is anything repugnant in in the subject or context a Premises means any building or part of a building which is or is intended to be let separately for use as a residence or for commercial use or for any other purpose but does not include a room in a dharamshala hotel or lodging house The document executed by the parties purported to be one as between a licenser and licensee and provided inter alia that the respondent was to pay an annual rent of Rs The respondent made an application for standardisation of rent under of the Delhi and Ajmer Merwara Rent Control Act and the Rent Controller of Delhi fixed the rent at Rs Per <NAME> The words room in a hotel in of the Act must be given their plain meaning and a room in a hotel must therefore mean any room in a building in the whole of which the business of a hotel was carried on Per <NAME> Although the document executed by the parties was apparently in a language appropriate to a licence the agreement between them judged by its substance and real intention as it must be left no manner of doubt that the document was a lease It had all the characteristics that distinguished it from a license namely that it created an interest in the property in favour of the respondent and it gave him exclusive possession thereof which in the absence of any circumstances that negatived it must indicate a clear intention to grant a lease There could be no reasonable nexus in this case between a hair dresser business and that of a hotel as there was nothing in the document in question to prevent the tenant from carrying on any other business or to bind him to give any preferential treatment to the lodgers who could take their chance only as general customers the tenant only liability being to pay the stipulated rent The following Judgments were delivered <NAME> have had the advantage and privilege of reading the judgments prepared by my learned brethren <NAME> and <NAME> I agree with my learned brother <NAME> that the deed of May is a lease and not a licence On the question of the true scope and effect of of the Delhi and Ajmer Merwara Rent Control Act hereinafter called the Rent Control Act I have reached the same conclusion as has been reached by my learned brother <NAME> namely that the rooms or spaces let out by the appellant to the respondent in <ORG> New Delhi were rooms in a hotel within the meaning of of the Rent Control Act therefore that Act did not apply and the respondent was not entitled to ask for the determination of fair rent under its provisions The reasons for which I have reached that conclusion are somewhat different from those of my learned brother <NAME> and it is therefore necessary that I should state the reasons in my own words In this Act unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context a The question before us is what is the meaning of the expression a room in a hotel Does it merely mean a room which in a physical sense is within a building or part of a building used as a hotel or does it mean something more that is the room itself is not only within a hotel in a physical sense but is let out to serve what are known as hotel purposes If a strictly literal construction is adopted then a room in a hotel or dharamshala or lodging house means merely that the room is within and part of the building which is used as a hotel dharamshala or lodging house Suppose there is a big room inside a hotel in a physical sense it is a room in a hotel but let us suppose that it is let out to take an extreme example as a timber godown Will it still be a room in a hotel though in a physical sense it is a room of the building which is used as a hotel I think it would be doing violence to the context if the expression room in a hotel is interpreted in a strictly literal sense therefore agree with my learned brother <NAME> that the appeal should be allowed but in the circumstances of the case there should be no order for costs That word has therefore to be understood in its ordinary sense It also seems to me plain that the spaces are rooms for this again has not been disputed in the Courts below and I have not found any reason to think that they are not rooms Unless there is good reason to do otherwise that meaning cannot be departed from Is there then any reason why the words of the statute should be given a meaning other than their ordinary meaning The Rent Controller and <ORG> found several such reasons and these I will now consider He took this view because he thought that if for example there was a three storeyed building the ground floor of which was used for shops and the two upper floors for an hotel it could not have been intended to exclude the entire building from the operation of the Act and so the rooms on the ground floor would not have been rooms in an hotel Under the definition a part of a building may be a premises and there is nothing to prevent a part only of a building being a hotel and the rest of it not being one We see no reason why a room in an hotel within the Act must be a room normally used for lodging <NAME> who delivered the judgment thought that a room in an hotel would be within the definition if it was let out to a person to whom board or other service was also given Nor do I see any reason why the Act should exempt from its protection a part which is intimately connected as it is said and which confess I do not understand and not a part not so intimately connected Nor do I see any reason why the Act should have left out of its protection a room which is an essential amenity of the hotel and not other rooms in it There is nothing in the definition about the purposes of the letting out The Act no doubt exempts a room in an hotel but it says nothing about the purposes for which the room must be let out to get the exemption Having given the matter my best consideration I have not been able to find any reason why the words used in the definition should not have their plain meaning given to them I therefore come to the conclusion that a room in an hotel within the definition is any room in a building in the whole of which the business of an hotel is run The question so raised depends on the construction of the written agreement under which <NAME> came to occupy the spaces and the circumstances of the case In the result I would allow the appeal and dismiss the application for fixing standard rent <NAME> I have had the advantage of perusing the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> and I regret my inability to agree with him He got into possession of the said rooms agreeing to pay a sum of Rs On September the respondent made an application to <ORG> Delhi alleging that the rent demanded was excessive and therefore a fair rent might be fixed under the Delhi and Ajmer Merwara Rent Control Act of hereinafter called If the Act The appellants appeared before <ORG> and contended that the Act had no application to the premises in question at they were premises in a hotel exempted under of the Act from its operation and also on the ground that under the aforesaid document the respondent was not a tenant but only a licensee On appeal the District Judge Delhi came to a contrary conclusion he was of the view that the rooms in question were rooms in a hotel within the meaning of of the Act and therefore the Act had no application to the present case On the basis of the aforesaid two findings he came to the conclusion that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to fix a fair rent for the premises The respondent preferred a revision against the said order of the District Judge to <ORG> at Simla and <NAME> held that the said premises were not rooms in a hotel within the meaning of of the Act and that the document executed between the parties created a lease and not a licence The present appeal was filed in this <ORG> by special leave granted to the appellants on January But we have before us the considered judgment of <ORG> which has brought out all the salient points in favour of the respondent The first question turns upon the true construction of the document dated May whereunder the respondent was put in possession of the said rooms What is the substance of this document Two rooms at the Hotel Imperial were put in possession of the respondent for the purpose of carrying on his business as hair dresser from May If he did not pay the prescribed amount in the manner agreed to he could be evicted therefrom without notice and he would also be liable to pay compensation with interest Shortly stated under the document the respondent was given possession of the two rooms for carrying on his private business on condition that he should pay the fixed amount to the appellants irrespective of the fact whether he carried on his business in the premises or not There is a marked distinction between a lease and a licence Section of the Transfer of Property Act defines a lease of immoveable property as a transfer of a right to enjoy such property made for a certain time in consideration for a price paid or promised The lessor parts with his right to enjoy the property during the term of the lease and it follows from it that the lessee gets that right to the exclusion of the lessor But there was a change and the recent trend of judicial opinion is reflected in <NAME> <NAME> wherein Lord Denning reviewing the case law on the subject summarizes the result of his discussion thus at The result of all these cases is that although a person who is let into exclusive possession is prima facie to be considered to be tenant nevertheless he will not be held to be so if the circumstances negative any intention to create a tenancy Denning said much to the same effect at The question in all these cases is one of intention Did the circumstances and the conduct of the parties show that all that was intended was that the occupier should have a personal privilege with no interest in the land The following propositions may therefore be taken as well established To ascertain whether a document creates a licence or lease the substance of the document must be preferred to the form the real test is the intention of the parties whether they intended to create a lease or a licence if the document creates an interest in the property it is a lease All The solitary circumstance that the rooms let out in the present case are situated in a building wherein a hotel is run cannot make any difference in the character of the holding I therefore hold that under the document there was transfer of a right to enjoy the two rooms and therefore it created a tenancy in favour of the respondent Section defines the term premises and the material portion of it is as follows Premises means any building or part of a building which is or is intended to be let separately Can it be said that there is any reasonable nexus between the business of the tenant and that of the hotel
