The questions arising out of the arguments on behalf of the appellant which fell for determination were whether an assessment in violation of a statutory provision could claim the status of an assessment made under the Act within the meaning of whether the decision by the appropriate authority as to the nature of the transaction was a decision on a collateral fact the finding on which alone conferred jurisdiction on the authority to levy the tax or was it a decision on a question of fact which had to be determined by the authority itself as one of the issues before it Whether was valid if construed as being a complete bar to a suit such as filed by the appellant HELD i Section protects assessment made under the Act or the rules made thereunder by appropriate authorities ii If the relevant provisions which confer jurisdiction on the appropriate authorities to levy assessment on the dealers in respect of transactions to which the charging section applies are examined it is impossible to escape the conclusion that all questions pertaining to the liability of the dealers to pay assessment in respect of their transactions are expressly left to be decided by the appropriate authorities under the Act as matters falling within their jurisdiction Whether or not a return is correct whether or not transactions which are not mentioned in the return but about which the appropriate authority has knowledge fan within the mischief of the charging section what is the true or real extent of the transactions which are assessable all these and other allied questions have to be determined by the appropriate authorities themselves and so it is impossible to accept the argument on behalf of the appellant that the finding of the appropriate authority that a particular transaction is taxable under the provisions of the Act is a finding on a collateral fact which gives the appropriate authority jurisdiction to take a further step and make the actual order of assessment iii If it appears that a statute creates a special right or liability ind provides for the determination of the right or liability to be dealt with by tribunals specially constituted in that behalf and it further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be deter mined by the Tribunals so constituted it becomes pertinent to enquire whether remedies normally associated with actions in civil courts are Prescribed by the said statute or not If the court was satisfied that the Act provided no remedy to make a claim for the recovery of illegally collected tax and yet prohibited such a claim being made before an ordinary civil court the court might hesitate to construe as creating an absolute bar or if such a construction was not reasonably possible the court might seriously examine the question about the constitutionality of such express exclusion of the civil court jurisdiction having regard to the provisions of Arts Therefore it could not be said that even for the claim which the appellant sought to make in the present suit there was no alternative remedy prescribed by the Act Although the suit filed by the appellant in so far as it related to the recovery of tax illegally collected was barred by it was not barred in so far as it challenged the validity of itself Appeal from the judgment and order dated August of <ORG> in Appeal No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> The principal point of law which arises in this appeal is whether <ORG> was right in holding that the suit filed by the appellant <ORG> against the respondent the State of Bombay was incompetent It carries on business of manufacture and sale of textile cloth On December the appellant instituted the present suit No One of the pleas raised by the respondent was that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit It was urged by the respondent that of the Act created a bar against the institution of the present suit and the suit should therefore be dismissed on that preliminary ground The respondent also contended that the plea raised by the appellant that the said section was ultra vires the Constitution was without any substance Issue No was in regard to the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to entertain the suit He held that of the Act was a bar to the institution of the present suit and on that view he upheld the Plea raised by the respondent <ORG> agreed with the view taken by the learned trial Judge and dismissed the appeal preferred by the appellant The case which was thus presented by Mr <NAME> was that on a fair and reasonable construction it should be held that does not create a bar against the institution of the present suit It appears that though this alternative plea bad been taken by the appellant in its plaint no issue was framed in respect of it and naturally the point has not been considered either by the learned trial Even so <ORG> of this Court which heard the appeal allowed Mr <NAME> to raise his alternative contention and so the appeal was ordered to be placed before <ORG> The appeal then came on for hearing before <ORG> on April Before dealing with the points raised in this appeal it would be necessary to refer to one fact which is not in dispute The Act was passed in and it came into force on March This Act validated sales tax collected by different <ORG> from st April to th September in accordance with the principles laid down by this <ORG> in <ORG> case If we had reached the stage of considering the merits about the validity of the recovery of tax in the present case it would have become necessary for us to consider the effect of this Continuance Order Save as is provided in no assessment made and no order passed under this Act or the rules made thereunder by the Commissioner or any person appointed under to assist him shall be called into question in <ORG> and save as it provided in sections and no appeal or application for revision shall lie against any such assessment or order Indeed it was beyond the competence of <ORG> to levy a tax in respect of an outside sale and so on the ultimate analysis the impugned assessment is without jurisdiction and it cannot therefore be said to be an assessment made under the Act within the meaning of Mr <NAME> did not dispute the fact that the argument thus presented by him would be equally applicable to cases of assessment made erroneously in respect of transactions which are otherwise statutorily exempted from the operation of the Act If a <ORG> statute exempts certain transactions from the purview of its charging section and the appropriate authority makes an order of assessment in respect of such an exempted transaction the assessment would be beyond its jurisdiction and can be impeached by a suit will not protect such an assessment No doubt Mr <NAME> emphasised the fact that the constitutional pro hibition against an assessment in respect of outside sales stood on a much higher pedestal than the prohibition by a statutory provision in a <ORG> Act In dealing with this question it is necessary to remember that the normal rule prescribed by of the Code of Civil Procedure is that the courts shall subject to the provisions herein contained have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred There is no doubt that a claim for the refund of sales tax allegation to have been paid by the appellants through mistake is a claim of a civil nature and normally it should be triable by the ordinary courts of competent jurisdiction as provided by of the Code but this section itself lays down that the jurisdiction of the civil courts to try suits of a civil nature can be excluded either expressly or impliedly and so the point raised for our decision in the present appeal is whether on a fair and reasonable construction of It can be said that the Jurisdiction of the civil court is barred either expressly or impliedly Section protects assessment made under the Act or the rules made thereunder by appropriate authorities It is the activity of the assessing officer acting as such officer which is intended to be protected and as soon as it is shown that exercising his jurisdiction and authority under this Act an assessing officer has made an order of assessment that clearly falls within the scope of A It was also observed that whether or not an assessment has been made under this Act will not depend on the correctness or accuracy of the order passed by the assessing authority There is no difficulty about the assessing authorities territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction in the present case What is the nature of the Jurisdiction conferred on the appropriate authority in respect of the subject matter of sales tax Has the appropriate authority been given power to examine the nature of the transaction and decide whether it is liable to tax or not Or can the appropriate authority proceed to exercise its power of imposing a tax only in cases where the transaction in question is assessable to such tax In other words is the decision about the character of the transaction the decision on a collateral fact the finding on which alone confers jurisdiction on the tribunal to levy the tax or is it the decision on a question of fact which is left to be determined by the appropriate authority itself If the jurisdiction conferred on the appropriate authority falls under the first category then its finding that a particular transaction is taxable under the relevant provi sions of the Act would be a finding on a collateral question of fact and it may be permissible to a party aggrieved by the said finding to contend that the tax levied on the basis of an erroneous decision about the nature of the transaction is without jurisdiction If however the appropriate authority has been given jurisdiction to determine the nature of the transaction and proceed to levy a tax in accordance with its decision on the first issue then the decision on the first issue cannot be said to be a decision on a collateral issue and even if the said issue is erroneously determined by the appropriate authority the tax levied by it in accordance with its decision cannot be said to be without jurisdiction There may be tribunals which by virtue of legislation constituting them have the power to determine finally the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends but subject to that an inferior tribunal cannot by a wrong decision with regard to a collateral fact give itself a jurisdiction which it would not otherwise possess In this connection the relevant scheme of the Act by which necessary powers have been conferred on the appropriate authorities falls to be considered Section provides that for carrying out the purposes of this Act <ORG> may appoint any person to be Commissioner of Sales Tax and such other persons to assist him as <ORG> thinks fit Section then lays down that persons appointed under sub shall exercise such powers as may be conferred and perform such duties as may be imposed on them by or under this Act Section deals with the assessment of tax sub a provides that the amount of tax due from a registered dealer shall in the case of first assessment be assessed in respect of such period not exceeding twelve months as the Commissioner may determine Sub sections and of contain provisions in regard to the procedure which has to be followed by the Commissioner in determining the question about the liability of a dealer to pay assessment Section A deals with turnover which has escaped assessment and it confers authority on the Commissioner to pass an appropriate order of assessment in respect of the said category of cases When the Commissioner makes an order of assessment in exercise of the powers conferred on him a right is given to the assessee to prefer an appeal and a revision under sections and respectively If we examine the relevant provisions which confer jurisdiction on the appropriate authorities to levy assessment on the dealers in respect of transactions to which the charging section applies it is impossible to escape the conclusion that all questions pertaining to the liability of the dealers to pay assessment in respect of their transactions are expressly left to be decided by the appropriate authorities under the Act as matters falling within their jurisdiction Whether or not a return is correct whether or not transactions which are not mentioned in the return but about which the appropriate authority has knowledge fall within the mischief of the charging section what is the true and real extent of the transactions which are assessable all these and other allied questions have to be determined by the appropriate authorities themselves and so we find it impossible to accept Mr <NAME> argument that the finding of the appropriate authority that a particular transaction is taxable under the provisions of the Act is a finding on a collateral fact which gives the appropriate authority jurisdiction to take a further step and make the actual order of assessment In fact what we have said about the jurisdiction of the appropriate authorities exercising their powers under the Act would be equally true about the appropriate authorities functioning either under Sale tax Acts In that case the petitioner <NAME> challenged the validity of the sales tax levied on her on the ground that the notification issued on December had exempted bides like those which the petitioner firm produced from payment of sales tax The petitioner had moved this Court under Art It would thus appear that according to the majority view the question about the tax ability of a particular transaction falls within the jurisdiction of the appropriate authorities exercising their powers under the taxing Act and their decision in and the extent of the fundamental right conferred on the citizen to move this <ORG> by the said Article does not appear to have differed from the majority view on this point Whilst we are referring to the decision of this Court in <NAME> case we would hasten to add that we are not dealing with the scope and effect of our powers under Art At this stage we are only dealing with the question as to whether Mr <NAME> is right Reverting then to it seems to us plain that the words used in this section are so wide that even erroneous orders of assessment made would be entitled to claim its protection against the institution of a civil suit order passed in appeal under the said section shall subject to the power of revision conferred by be final It is also well settled that even if jurisdiction is so excluded the civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure In construing the effect of the words no suit shall be brought in any civil court to set aside or modify any assessment made under this Act <ORG> thought it necessary to enquire whether the Act contained machinery which enabled an assessee effectively to raise in the courts the question whether a particular provision of the Income Tax Act bearing on the assessment made is or is not ultra vires The presence of such machinery observed <ORG> though by no means conclusive marches with a construction of the section which denies an alternative jurisdiction to enquire into the same subject matter It is true that Mr <NAME> has challenged the validity of but the said section has no bearing on the assessment made and LA The said section provides that No objection shall be taken to any valuation assessment levy nor shall the liability of any person to be assessed or taxed be questioned in any other manner or by any other authority than is provided in this Act According to the majority view the bar created by this provision did not amount to the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain a claim for refund of the tax alleged to be illegally recovered because there were no words in the said provision which could be construed as excluding civil court jurisdiction either expressly or impliedly We would also like to make it clear that we do not think it is necessary in the present case to consider whether the majority opinion in the case of <ORG> was justified in casting a doubt on certain observations made by <ORG> in <ORG> case or on the validity or the propriety of the conclusion in respect of the effect of of the Income tax Act In coming to the conclusion that the jurisdiction of the civil court was not excluded <ORG> noticed that there was nothing in or in the Act which excluded the jurisdiction of the court to grant declarations merely provided an alternative method of having the question determined by the Minister Approaching the task of construing from this point of view his Lordship came to the conclusion that there was nothing in which excluded the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain the claim in question There is one more aspect of the matter which must be con sidered before we finally determine the question as to whether excludes the jurisdiction of the civil court in entertaining the present suit Whenever it is urged before a civil court that its jurisdiction is excluded either expressly or by necessary implication to entertain claims of a civil nature the <ORG> naturally feels inclined to consider whether the remedy afforded by an alternative provision prescribed by a special statute is sufficient or adequate If it appears that a statute creates a special right or a liability and provides for the determination of the right and liability to be dealt with by tribunals specially constituted in that behalf and it further lays down that all questions about the said right and liability shall be determined by the tribunal so constituted it becomes pertinent to enquire whether remedies normally associated with actions in civil courts are prescribed by the said statute or not That being so can it be said that the Act provides an appropriate remedy for recovering a tax alleged to have been illegally levied and collected where the party asking for the said relief pleads a mistake of fact and law It would be noticed that this inquiry may have some relevance in construing the terms of and it would be both relevant and material in considering the question of the constitutionality of Basin himself on this decision Mr <NAME> contends that since the Act does not provide for adequate remedy to recover illegally collected tax from the respondent we should either put a narrow construction on so as to permit institution of a suit like the present or in the alternative should strike it down as constitutionally invalid If a citizen is deprived of his property illegally by recovering from him unauthorisedly an amount of tax where no such tax is recoverable from him he ought to have a proper and appropriate remedy to ventilate his grievance against the <ORG> In support of this contention Mr <NAME> has referred to the decision of <ORG> in Commissioner for Motor Transport <ORG> Ltd Let us therefore examine the question as to whether the Act with which we are concerned in the present appeal provides for Then we have which provides for the remedy of an appeal and which provides for a revisional remedy ing for such extension had sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal or making the application within such period Therefore it cannot be said that even for the claim which the appellant seeks to make in the present suit there is no alternative remedy prescribed by the Act It would be recalled that the alternative claim made by the appellant in its plaint was that on which a plea of bar is raised by the respondent is invalid What then is the ultimate position in this case The Act Linder which tax was recovered from the appellant is valid and so is the charging section valid the appropriate authorities dealt with the matter in regard to the taxability of the impugned transactions in accordance with the provisions of the Act and in consequence tax in question was recovered on the basis that the said transactions were taxable under the Act The appellant contends that the transactions were outside sales and they did not and could not fall under the charging sect ion because of Art and it argues that the tax was levied because both the appellant and the appropriate authorities committed a mistake of fact as well as law in dealing with the question
