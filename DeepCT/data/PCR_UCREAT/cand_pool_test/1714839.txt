Practice and procedure Undertaking given by the parties directions given by <ORG> Effect of Against the decision of <ORG> the assessees have filed appeal in this <ORG> whereas the <ORG> of Orissa has filed a cross appeal Against the decision of <ORG> the assessee has filed an appeal in this court In appeal to this court it was contended on behalf of the <ORG> of Orissa that i the levy of cess being referable to Entries and of the <ORG> List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution the impugned legislation was within the legislative competence of the <ORG> legislature ii the limitations imposed in the statute on the modes of utilisation of cess supports a view that the cess is fee on which the <ORG> legislature is competent to legislate under Entry read with Entry of the <ORG> List iii since the impugned Act was concerned with the raising of funds to enable panchayats and Samithis to discharge their responsibilities of local administration and take steps for proper development of the area under their jurisdiction the impugned legislation was referable to Entry of <ORG> List and iv the enactment of the Central Legislation viz On behalf of the assessees it was contended inter alia that i all the <ORG> levies were ultra vires for the reasons given by this <ORG> in the <ORG> case ii the <ORG> cannot seek to sustain the levy under the Bengal Cess Act by relying on Article of the Constitution and iii the levy being unconstitutional the <ORG> should direct the <ORG>s to refund the cess collected from the assessees because a a refund is the automatic and inevitable consequence of the declaration of invalidity of tax and the <ORG>s have given undertakings before this <ORG> that they would refund the amount collected in case the levy is declared invalid by this <ORG> The Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act is a law of <ORG> relating to mineral development and Section of the said Act empowers <ORG> to fix alter enhance or reduce the rates of royalty payable in respect of minerals removed from the land or consumed by the lessee Sub Section of Section in terms <ORG>s that the royalties payable under the Second Schedule to that Act shall not be enhanced more than once during a period of three years There is a difference in principle between a tax on royalties derived from land and a tax on land measured by reference to the income derived therefrom There is a clear distinction between tax on land and tax on income arising from land Even assuming that the levy is a fee the <ORG> legislature can impose a fee only in respect of any of the matters in the <ORG> List Under Entry of List I regulation of mines and mineral development is in the field of parliamentary legislation to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest There is a difference between the object of the Act and its subject In assessing the field covered by the Act of <ORG> in question one should be guided not merely by the actual provisions of the Central Act or the rules made thereunder but should also take into account matters and aspect which can legitimately be brought within the scope of the said statute The different notifications issued by the <ORG> of Bihar under section of the Act determining the rate of cess on the amount of rayalty of all minerals of the <ORG> place the matter beyond all doubt There are no clear indications in the statute that the amounts are collected by way of fee and not tax Although there is no provision for the constitution of a separate fund for this purpose as is found in relation to the cesses levied under Part II or Part III of the Act yet this consideration alone does not preclude the levy from being considered as a fee Also there is no reason why the vital interest of the <ORG> should not be a relevant criterion for deciding that a refund should not be granted Accordingly the <ORG> should refund the amounts of cess collected after the relevant dates to assesses directly or in the Coalfields from whom they were collected with interest at the rate directed by this <ORG> or mentioned in the undertaking from the date of the relevant judgment to the actual date of repayment The undertaking given by the parties or interim directions given by the <ORG> cannot be understood in such a manner as to conflict with the <ORG> final decision The Judgment of the Court was delivered by RANGANATHAN These are connected batches of Civil Appeals and Special Leave Petitions THE LEGISLATIVE ENTRIES It will be convenient at the outset to refer to the various entries of the <ORG> and the State Lists in the Seventh Schedule to the constitution which have a bearing on the issues to be discussed Entry Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest The fund has to be utilised to meet expenditure incurred in connection with such development measures as <ORG> might draw up for the purposes above mentioned as well as for the purposes specified in clauses a to of The validity of this levy of cess was challenged by the petitioner coal company in the <NAME> case as ultra vires the powers of <ORG> because a the cess was not a fee but a duty of excise on coal which was a field covered by Entry of List I in the Seventh Schedule and repugnant to the Local Mines Labour Welfare Fund Act Central Act XXXII of and even if it was treated as a fee relatable to Entries and of List II in the Seventh Schedule it was hit by Entry of List I read with the Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act Central Act LIII of the MMRD Act for short or by Entry of List I read with the Industries Development and Regulation Act the IDR Act for short Central ACt LXV of Repelling the argument it was held that the extent of levy of a fee would always depend upon the nature of the services intended to be rendered and the financial obligations incurred thereby and cannot by itself alter the character of the levy from a fee into the of a duty of excise except where the correlation between the levy and services is not genuine or real or where the levy is disproportionately higher than the requirements of the services intended to be rendered The court therefore came to the conclusion that the cess levied by the impugned act was neither a tax nor a duty of excise but a fee The second argument turned on the impact of the MMRD Act on the State power to levy a fee under Entry read with Entry of List II as a consequence of the declaration contained in of the Central Act In other words if a Central Act has been passed which contains a declaration by <ORG> as required by Entry and if the said declaration covers the field occupied by the impugned Act the impugned Act would be ultra vires not because of any repugnance between the two statutes but because <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass the law It proceeded to review the provisions of Central ACt LIII of and concluded that if this Act were held to contain the declaration referred to in Entry there would be no difficulty in holding that the declaration covered the field of conservation and development of minerals and that the said field was indistinguishable from the field covered by the impugned Act In coming to this conclusion the <ORG> pointed out that the rule making powers conferred on <ORG> under Section of the Act included the levy and collection of royalties fees and taxes in respect of minerals mines quarried excavated or collected Therefore if a Central Act has been passed for the purpose of providing for the conservation and development of minerals and if it contains the requisite declaration then it would not be competent to <ORG> to pass an Act in respect of the subject matter covered by the said declaration In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or enforced all that this required is a declaration by <ORG> that it is expedient in the public interest to take the regulation and development of mines under the control of the <ORG> The same issue regarding the competence of <ORG> to levy the very same cess came up for consideration again in the Tulloch case of the Act like the predecessor Act contained the following declaration in terms of Entry of List I It read It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided but unlike the earlier one this was a declaration contained in an Act of Parliament which had the effect of impairing the legislative competence of the <ORG> under Entry read with Entry of the <ORG> List The test of two legislations containing contradictory for if a competent legislature with a superior efficacy expressly or impliedly evinces by its legislation an intention to cover the whole field the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after would be overborne on the ground of repugnance In the present case having regard to the terms of it appears clear to us that the intention of <ORG> was to cover the entire field and thus to leave no scope for the argument that until rules were framed there was no inconsistency and no supersession of the State Act Meeting the argument that the power to levy a fee was an independent head of legislative power under each of the three legislative lists and that the levy of tax undue the State Act could be traced to this entry the <ORG> pointed out the fallacy underlying the argument in the following words The materials words of the Entries are Fees in respect of any of the matters in this List The result was that <NAME> declared the levy of the cess to be invalid and it was held that as and from the date on which the Act came into force the Orissa Act should be deemed to be non existent for every purpose The appellant was therefore called upon to pay a cess based on the royalty paid by him to the State <ORG> of Andhra Pradesh which had succeeded to the State of Madras in respect of the territories in question and it was the validity of this levy which was upheld by <ORG> that came up for the consideration of this Court It was contended on behalf of the appellant relying on Hingir Rampur and <NAME> that the provision imposing land cess quoad royalty must be held to be repealed by MMRD Act of or in any event by the MMRD Act Central Act LXVII of and that after the date when these enactments came into force the land cess that could be levied must be exclusive of royalty under a mining lease Sections and have nothing to do and are not concerned with the development of mines and minerals or their regulation It will thus be seen that there is no connection between the regulation and development of mines and collection of land cess for which provision is made by ss and of the Act There is therefore no scope at all for the argument that there is anything in common between the Act and the Central Act of and so as to require any detailed examination of these enactments for discovering whether there is any over lapping A second contention raised before the <ORG> was that as the impugned land cess was payable only in the event of the lessee winning the mineral and not when no minerals were extracted it was in effect a tax on the minerals won and therefore on mineral rights It is unnecessary for the purpose of this case to examine the question as to what exactly is a tax on mineral rights seeing that such a tax is not leviable by <ORG> but only by the <ORG> and the sole limitation on the <ORG> power to levy the tax is that it must not interfere with a law made by <ORG> as regards mineral development The judgment of <ORG> in the <NAME> case supra held the field from to We have already referred to the cess levied in Orissa which came to be considered by this Court as early as and in the Hingir Rampur and Tulloch cases Further cases came up for consideration on the same lines in Bihar <ORG> v<ORG> of Bihar decided on the subject matter of A before us in Orissa <NAME> <ORG> A I Ori The levy could not be supported under a Entry of List II as it is not a tax on land revenue an expression which has a well defined connotation There is a clear distinction between a tax directly on land and a tax on income arising from land The cess is not a tax directly on land as a unit but only a tax on royalty which is indirectly connected with land According to the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying the bill the primary objective of the legislation is to condense and simplify the existing law on the subject by consolidating the different enactments customs and usages relating to the levy of cess in the State to cure defects and deficiencies therein and to introduce uniformity in the levy of cess throughout the State It will thus be seen that in place of a fixed rate an elasticity was provided for initially by requiring the rates to be specified in the Schedule differently for different minerals It also states the royalty would include any payments made or likely to be make to the <ORG> for the right of raising minerals from the land which shall be calculated on every tone of such minerals despatched from the land at the same rate as prescribed under the said Act or such other rate as may be fixed by the <ORG> but not exceeding the amount which would have been otherwise payable as royalty under the said Act Explanation In this section Grama Panchayat means Grama Panchayat constituted under the Orissa Panchayat Samitis Act The allotment of amounts to be utilised for the pur poses mentioned in clause a and of sub section shall be made in such proportion as may be prescribed BIHAR We shall now turn to the relevant provisions of the Bihar Act The definition as amended by the latter reads as follows royalty for the purpose of this Act in respect of mines and quarries means payment which includes dead rent made or likely to be made to the owner of mines and minerals for the right of working the same on the quantity or value of such produce by a lessee if the land had been under a lease granted under MMRD Act and rules made thereunder and includes any amount which <ORG> may demand from the appropriation of mines and minerals belonging to the <ORG> and any amount that may be paid as or in lieu of royalty for the right of working mines and quarries in areas held or acquired under any Act or agreement Cess has to be assessed The local cess shall be assessed on the annual value of lands and until provision to the contrary is made by the <ORG> on the royalty of mines and quarries sale value of the other immovable properties including forest produce and annual net profits from tramways and railways as contained respectively as prescribed in this Act and the rate at which the local cess shall be levied for each other shall be a in the case of royalty the rate will be determined by the government from time to time but it will not exceed the amount of royalty in the case such annual net profits fifteen paise on each rupee of such profits in the case of annual value of lands twenty paise per rupee of the annual value and in the case of sale value of immovable properties including first produce the rate will not exceed and the State Government may by notification prescribe from time to time the commodities on the sale of which cess would be levied along with the rate at which it would be levied and that the amounts to the credit of the funds as well as the cesses collected under Parts II and III should be utilised for special purposes connected respectively with energy development Section and read thus Section There shall be levied and collected a cess on land held in connection with mineral rights at such rate as may be notified by <ORG> per ton of major mineral raised and the rate of cess prevailing in respect of coal during the period commencing from the date of commencement of the Principal Act and ending on the date of commencement of the Madhya Pradesh Upkar Sanshodhan Adhiniyam shall be deemed to be the rate of cess notified under this sub section in respect of coal Provided the subject to the limitation mentioned above <ORG> may by notification increase or reduce the rate of cess at an interval of not less than one year where the rate is increased it shall not be in excess of fifty per cent of the rate for the time being in force Provided further that every notification under the above proviso shall be laid on the table of <ORG> and the provisions of Section A of the Madhya Pradesh General Clauses Act No The rate of cess to be notified for the first time in exercise of the powers conferred by Sub section shall be effective from the first of April The cess levied under sub section shall subject to and in accordance with the rules made in this behalf be assessed and collected by such agencies and in such manner as may be prescribed Section has however been omitted by an Amending Act of again with full retrospective effect i from It appears however that there was in force in Madhya Pradesh another statute levying mineral development cess The mineral areas development cess shall subject to and in accordance with the rules made in this behalf be collected by such agencies and in such manner as may be prescribed and shall be applied towards development of mineral bearing areas Being a fee <ORG> competence to impose it has to be determined with reference to Entry read with Entry of the State List At least in <ORG> the statute sought to include royalty within the meaning of land revenue but there is no such provision in the Orissa Act and this being so royalty or the tax thereon cannot be equated to land revenue If his observations in this context are read as a whole it would seem that he also was of opinion that a tax on royalty would be a tax on mineral rights for he observed at pp This raises a question as to what are taxes on mineral rights If taxes on mineral rights also include taxes on minerals produced there would be no difference between taxes on mineral rights and duties of excise under item of List I A comparison of List I and II of the Seventh Schedule shows that the same tax is not put in both the Lists It is said that there may be cases where the owner himself extracts minerals and does not give any right of extraction to somebody else and that in such cases in the absence of mining leases or sub leases there would be no way of leaving tax on mineral rights Where there is a lease of the building the annual value is determined by the lease money but there are many cases where owners themselves live in buildings It is argued that the tax here is therefore a tax on land and it is immaterial that this tax is quantified with reference to the income yielded by the land The Court indicated the following approach to the issue before it The first question which falls for consideration therefore is whether the impost in the present case is a tax on land within the meaning of Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution It is well settled that the entries in the three legislative lists have to be interpreted interpreted in their widest amplitude and therefore if a tax can reasonably be held to be a tax on land it will come within Entry it follows therefore that the use to which the land is put can be taken into account in imposing a tax on it within the meaning of entry of List II for the annual value of land which can certainly be taken into account in imposing a tax for the purpose of this entry would necessarily depend upon the use to which the land it put It is in the light of this settled proposition that we have to examine the scheme of of the Act which imposes a tax under challenge On the other hand it is contended for the respondents that whatever may have been the original intention the true and real impact of the cess is only on the royalties it is urged that for deciding whether the tax is really a tax on land as in <NAME> or whether it is really a tax on royalties which has been struck down in <ORG> it is not the form or the statutory machinery that matters one has to look at the real substance and true impact of the levy Upholding these contentions the <ORG> observed The question then is whether the impugned levy impedes the free flow of trade and commerce throughout the territory of India and if it does whether it falls within the exception carved out in article If the levy imposes a cess in respect of tea estate it may will be said that even though the free flow of trade is impeded in its Government throughout the territory of India it is in consequence of an indirect or remote effect of the levy and that it cannot be said that article is contravened But what is the position here Now for determining the true nature of the legislation whether it is a legislation in respect of tea estate and therefore of land or in respect of despatches of tea we must as we have said take all relevant provisions into account and ascertain the essential substance of it If there is no nexus at all it can conceivably be inferred that the levy is not what it purports to be All these cases were referred to in <ORG> where in the discussion on this point at page this Court said Any standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the levy There is force in the contention urged by Sri <NAME> Iyer that there is a difference in principle between a tax on royalties derived from land and a tax on land measured by reference to the income derived therefrom He drew attention to the observations of <NAME> In para of <ORG> that if the Explanation to had used the words surface rent in place of royalty the position would have been different and that if a cess on such surface rent or dead rent is charged it could be justified as a tax on land falling within the purview of Entry Here however the position is different and so he urged the nature of the levy is also different We may have considered these points as furnishing some ground to distinguish the present levy from that in india <ORG> but for the <ORG> specific disapproval of <NAME> and measuring the cess by reference to the income of other categories of land are valid there is no reason why alone should be treated differently and objected to as imposing a tax on royalties particularly when the levy also extends to dead rent There is no doubt an apparent anomaly in considering and as levying a tax on land but construing as imposing a tax on royalties and this anomaly has been noticed in <ORG> vide para Counsel for the assessees respondents invite attention to the opening sentence of para which runs In the aforesaid view of the matter we are of the opinion that royalty is a tax and argue that this clinches the issue He points out that though there is a reference in para to the conclusion of <NAME> in a judgement of <ORG> that royalty under of the MMRD Act is really a tax and a reference in para to the Rajasthan Punjab Gujarat and Orissa decisions to the effect that royalty is not a tax there is no discussion criticism or approval of any of the decision on this point and that therefore the first sentence of para relied upon for the respondents is non sequitir He submits that perhaps there is a typographical error in the first sentence of para and that the sentence should really read thus In the aforesaid view of the matter we are of opinion that cess is a tax and as such a cess on royalty being a tax on royalty is beyond the competence of <ORG> He submits that before we express any opinion on this issue we should consider the matter afresh and places before us extracts from various lexicons and dictionaries to show that a royalty is nothing more than the rent or lease amount paid to a lessor in consideration for the grant of a lease to exploit minerals We do not think that it is necessary for us to express an opinion either way on this controversy for it seems to us it is immaterial for the purposes of the present case This takes us to the second question posed by us initially and this turns on the effect of Act and the declaration contained in thereof which has been extracted earlier <ORG> has held that this is a clear bar on the State legislature taxing royalty so as in effect to amend the Second Schedule to the Central Act and that if the cess is taken as a tax falling under Entry it will be ultra vires in view of the provisions of the Central Act There is one great difficulty in accepting this solution to the <ORG> problem This consideration apart even assuming it is a fee the <ORG> legislature can impose a fee only in respect of any of the matters in the <ORG> List Under Entry of List I regulation of mines and mineral development is in the field of <ORG> legislation to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest to which reference will also be made later merely on the ground that it has some effect on such industry Before considering the above contention it will be useful to refer to certain earlier decisions of this Court which have a bearing on this issue While upholding the general right of <ORG> to legislate for the acquisition of even property vested in a <ORG> the Court pointed out that this could be done only if there is some provision in the Central Act expressly or necessarily implying that the property of the <ORG> is to be acquired by the <ORG> However the Court held when the requisite declaration under Entry is made the power to legislate for regulation and development of mines and minerals under the control of the <ORG> would by necessary implication include the power to acquire mines and minerals The Court applying <NAME> and <NAME> held that the whose whole of the legislative field in respect of minor minerals was covered by <ORG> legislation and Entry of List II was to the extent cut down by Entry of List I The old leases could not be modified except by a legislative enactment by <ORG> on the lines of of the Act To meet this difficulty and the difficulties that had been created by haphazard leases created by the erstwhile proprietors the <ORG> legislature passed the Haryana Minerals Vesting of Rights Act and issued notifications thereunder again acquiring the rights to the saltpetre in the lands putting up certain saltpetre bearing lands to auction It held that though the stated objects and reasons of the <ORG> Act showed that the acquisition was to be made to protect the mineral potentialities of the land and to ensure their proper development and exploitation on scientific lines and this did not materially differ from that which could be said to lie behind the Central Act the character of the <ORG> Act had to be judged by the substance and effect of its provisions and not merely by the purpose given in the <ORG>ment of Objects and Reasons In particular of the Central Act showed that <ORG> itself contemplated <ORG> legislation for vesting of lands containing minerals deposits in the <ORG> Government a feature that could be explained only on the assumption that <ORG> did not intend to touch upon the power of <ORG> legislatures under Entry of List II read with Entry of List III also showed that there was no intention to interfere with vesting of lands in the <ORG>s by the provisions of the Central Act Moreover power to acquire for purposes of development and regulation has not been exercised by Act of The existence of power of <ORG> to legislate on this topic as an incident of exercise of legislative power on another subject is one thing Legislative power of the <ORG> under Entry List II is eroded only to the extent control is assumed by the <ORG> pursuant to a declaration made by the <ORG> in respect of a declared industry as spelt out by the legislative enactment and the field occupied by such enactment is measure of erosion Subject to such erosion on the remainder the <ORG> legislature will have power to legislate in respect of a declared industry without in any way trenching upon the occupied field <ORG> legislature which is otherwise competent to deal with industry under Entry List II can deal with that industry in exercise of other powers enabling it to legislate under different heads set out in Lists II and III and this power cannot be denied to the <ORG> The contention that the impugned Act is in violation of section of the Central Act had no merit Here the question was whether the enactment of the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act and the Act precluded the State legislature from providing for the levy of a property tax by <ORG> constituted under a Act of the State legislature in respect of lands and buildings used for the purposes of and covered by coal mines Entry of List I relates to Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest the legislative field covered by Entry of List II will pass on to <ORG> by virtue of Entry List I But in order to judge whether on that account the State legislature loses its competence to pass the Act of it is necessary to have regard to the object and purpose of that Act and to the relevant provisions thereof under which <ORG> development Authorities are given the power to tax lands and buildings within their jurisdiction Section of the Act of which provides for the constitution of the special areas lays down by sub section that Notwithstanding anything contained in the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act the Madhya Pradesh <ORG>s Act <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> or a <ORG> as the case may be shall in relation to the special area and as from the date of the <ORG> Development Authority undertakes the function under clause of clause vi of Section ceases to exercise the powers and perform the function and duties which the <ORG> Development Authority is competent to exercise and perform under the Act of Section which defines the powers of the authority shows that those powers are conferred inter alia for the purpose of municipal adminstration Surely the functions powers and duties of Municipalities do not become an occupied filed by reason of the declaration contained in section of the mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act Though therefore on account of that declaration the legislative field covered by Entry List II may pass on to the <ORG> by virtue of Entry List I the competence of <ORG> to enact laws for municipal adminstration will remain unaffected by our declaration The power to impose tax on lands and buildings is derived by <ORG> from Entry of List II Taxes on lands and buildings The power of the municipalities to levy tax on lands and buildings has been conferred by <ORG> on <ORG> Those authorities have the power to levy that tax in order effectively to discharge the municipal functions which are passed on them It was found that <ORG> had become the local authority to discharge the functions of a municipal adminstration under a State Act and that the regulation of construction activities was one of the aspects of municipal adminstration and management In this situation the question posed was answered in the negative following <NAME> <ORG> and <NAME> While concerning itself generally with the requirements regarding grants of licenses and leases for prospecting and exploitation of minerals it contains certain provisions which are of direct relevance to the issue before us Power of <ORG> to make rules in respect of minerals <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licenses and mining leases in respect of minerals and for purposes connected therewith same area or in any other area selected by <ORG> whether by way of reimbursement of the cost of rehabilitation or otherwise by the person holding the prospecting license or mining lease which originally laid a duty on <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals in India has been amended by Act of to cover steps for the conservation and systematic development of minerals in India and for the protection of environment by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by prospecting or mining operations and the scope of the rule making power under has likewise been enlarged If one looks at the above provisions and bears in mind that in assessing the field covered by the Act of Parliament in question one should be guided as laid down in Hingir Rampur and <NAME> not merely by the actual provisions of the Central Act or the rules made thereunder but should also take into account matters and aspects which can legitimately be brought within the scope of the said statute the conclusion seems irresistible particularly in view of Hingir Rampur and <NAME> that the State Act has trespassed into the field covered by the Central Act The present legislation traceable to the legislative power under Entry or Entry of the State List which stands impaired by the <ORG> declaration under Entry can hardly be equated to the law for land acquisition or municipal administration which were considered in the cases cited and which are traceable to different specific entries in List II or List III As pointed out by Sri <NAME> there is a difference between the object of the ACt and its subject Even this was amended in whereafter there has been no restriction regarding the cess collected in respect of mining areas which form part of the consolidated fund of the State Before the Act wa passed it appears that the mine owners tried to put up small length roads and tramways for their own individual purpose but that obviously could not be as effective as roads constructed by the <ORG> and tramway service provided by it If it is held that this Act contains the declaration referred to in Entry there would be no difficulty in holding that the declaration covers the field of conservation and development of minerals and the said field is indistinguishable from the field covered by the impugned Act Therefore if a Central Act has been passed for the purpose of providing for the conservation and development of minerals and if it contains the requisite declaration then it would not be competent to <ORG> to pass an Act in respect of the subject matter covered by the said declaration In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or enforced all that this required is a declaration by <ORG> that it is expedient in the public interest to take the regulation and development of mines under the control of the <ORG> In this connection he relied most strongly on the terms of which laid a duty upon <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals in India and for that propose <ORG> may by notification make such rules as it deems fit The test which he suggested was whether if under the power conferred by of the Central Act <ORG> has made rules providing for the amenities for which provision was made by the Orissa Act and if <ORG> had imposed a fee to defray the expenses of the provision of these amenities would such rules be held to be ultra vires of <ORG> and this particularly when taken in conjunction with the matters for which rules could be made under to which reference has already been made We consider there is considerable force in this submission of learned counsel for the respondent and thus would require very detailed and careful scrutiny The question whether the State of Bihar had the authority to grant a lease for lifting coal slurry coming out of the appellants washeries and getting deposited on the river bed or other lands was answered in the negative the court came to the conclusion that the slurry was a mineral and that its regulation was within the exclusive jurisdiction of <ORG> We have therefore come to the conclusion that the validity of the impugned Act cannot be upheld by reference to Entry or Entry of List II <NAME> argued that the topic of legislation concerns land and therefore falls under entry of the State List and he drew our attention to other provisions on the subject of mines in the Land Reforms Act as originally passed The abolition of the rights of intermediaries to the mines and vesting these rights as lessors in <ORG> was a topic connected with land and land tenures But after the mining leases stood between <ORG> and the lessees any attempt to regulate those mining leases will fall not in entry but in entry even though the regulation incidentally touches land The pith and substance of the amendment to of the Reforms Act falls within entry although it incidentally touches land and not vice versa There are no clear indications in the stature that the amounts are collected by way of fee and not tax <NAME> submits that in the original counter affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> no case was sought to be made out that it was a tax on land the case was that it was a tax on mineral rights Article is in these terms Any taxes duties cesses or fees which immediately before the commencement of this Constitution were being lawfully levied by the Government of any <ORG> or by an municipality or other authority or body for the purposes of the <ORG> municipality district or other local area may notwithstanding that those taxes duties cesses or fees are mentioned in the Union List continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by <ORG> by law It has also been brought to our notice that a Bench of two Judges of this Court has already allowed an appeal by an assessee from a judgement of <ORG> to the contrary viz It has been brought to our notice also that <ORG> has recently invalidated the levy of the cess in <ORG> <ORG> CWJC and connected cases in a judgement dated following <ORG> Madhya Pradesh We now turn to the provisions of Madhya Pradesh Act of We are concerned only with Part IV which levies a cess not on land in general which could be referred to Entry or Entry but only on land held in connection with mineral rights which in the State are principally in regard to coal and limestone The quantity of major minerals produced from the land determines the liability to pay tax In these circumstances the impugned levy cannot be held to be a tax on land which is covered by Entry of the State List It is brought to our notice that <ORG> after <ORG> has reaffirment its conclusions in <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> No of in the light of <ORG> For the States however reliance is placed on the following observations in para of the judgement in <ORG> to contend to the contrary We see good deal of substance in this submission After all there was a decision of this Court in <NAME> case and amounts have been collected on the basis that the said decision was the correct position Analysing the various judgments delivered in that case he submitted that while <NAME> and four other judges pp approved of the applicability of this doctrine in India five other judges spoke against it pp and and the eleventh judge was neutral He therefore submitted that the judges who decided Golaknath were equally divided on the issue and so there is no reason disdained of the <ORG> binding on us In India however the application of the doctrine particularly in the context of an issue regarding the validity of a tax levy would run counter to specific provisions contained Articles and of the Constitution There is no scope for and no room for the exercise of any discretion by the <ORG> to say that there articles of the Constitution notwithstanding they would treat the legislation to be valid for a certain period or for certain purposes He urged that in some at least of the cases here there is no averment much less evidence of any irreparable hardship that is likely to result if a refund is ordered In addition to the above general arguments reliance had also been placed by the assessees on certain specific interim orders passed in these cases and it has been contended that these orders should be given effect to or at least taken into account in deciding the issue of the final relief to be granted It is therefore necessary to refer to these orders i In A Nos of there is no interim order staying recovery of the cess at all except of the arrears for the period from to and even this was made subject to the furnishing of a bank guarantee by the assessee ii In A of there was initially on an order of stay of recovery of cess on the furnishing of bank guarantees It was made clear that in case the levy of cess is held invalid there will be no hitch in refunding the amount On the assessee filed a writ petition challenging the levy as it was enahanced from to from Thereupon the assessee has preferred the unnumbered SLP on and SLP on respectively against the original judgement dated and the order on the review petition dated iv In the Bihar case there was an interim order on to the following effect On the stay application there will be no stay of recovery of cess but in case appellants succeed in appeal in this Court the excess amount so recovered will bepaid to the appellants with interest at the rate of from the date of recovery This was modified on in view of the judgement in <ORG> which had been delivered by this time and it was directed that the State of Bihar should not also enforce any demand for cess for the quarters ending December and thereafter until further orders Counsel for the assessees from Bihar Sri Chidambaram and <ORG> stated that they seek compliance with the order dated and would not insist on refund of cess collected earlier to that date The <ORG> found this request reasonable and passed the following order on The order dated passed in the above appeal is modified as follows The amount deposited by <ORG> in a separate account in the <ORG> in accordance with the directions issued by this Court on shall be paid to <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh In the event of <ORG> failing in this appeal the amount received by <ORG> under this order shall be refunded by that Government within three months from the date of the judgement to <ORG> with interest at per annum to disburse in favour of those who had paid it subject to such directions which this court may give in its judgement Fresh applications were filed by the <ORG> in a number of the other appeals seeking similar direction as in A but the request does not show that any such order were passed in appeal other than A We have given our earned consideration to these contentions and were are of opinion that the ruling in <ORG> concludes the issue There the <ORG> was specifically called upon to consider an argument that even if the statutory levy should be found invalid the <ORG> may not give directions to refund amounts already collected and the argument found favour with the bench of seven judges We are bound by their decision in this regard For instance there are cases where a comes to the conclusion that the termination of the services of an employee is invalid yet in refrains from giving him benefits of reinstatement i continuity in service on back wages One of the commonest issue that arose in the context of the situation we are concerned with is where a person affected by an illegal exaction files an application for refund under the provisions of the relevant statute of files a suit to recover the taxes as paid under a mistake of law Even if he files an application for refund or a suit for recovery of the taxes paid for several years the relief will be limited only to the period in regard to which the application for refund or a suit for recovery of the taxes paid for several years the relief will be limited only to the period in regard to which the application or suit is not barred by limitation If even this instance is sought to be distinguished as a case where the <ORG> hands are tied by limitations inherent in the form of forum in which the relief is sought let us consider a very case where a petitioner seeks relief against an illegal exaction in a writ petition filed under Article SCR the respondents who were dealers in tobacco in the <ORG> of Madhya Bharat filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution for the issue of writ of mandamus directing the refund of sales tax collected from them on the ground that the impugned tax was violative of Article a of the Constitution and that they had paid the same under a mistake of law It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that even if the provision violated the fundamental rights <ORG> should not exercise its discretionary power of issuing a writ of mandamus directing refund since there was unreasonable delay in filing the petition It has been made clear more than once that the power to give relief under Article is a discretionary power This is specially true in the case of power to issue writs in the nature of mandamus Among the several matters which <ORG> rightly take into consideration in the exercise of that discretion is the delay made by the aggrieved party in seeking the special remedy and what excuse there is for it Another matter which can be rightly taken into consideration is the nature of the facts and law that may have to be decided as regarded the availability of consequential relief A writ petition was filed by the petitioner contending that infringed Articles and of the Constitution and hence they were not liable to repay the amount This was dismissed on the ground that they had defrauded their customers and therefore not entitled to any relief even if there was a violation of fundamental rights Subsequently when coercive proceedings were taken for recovering the amounts as arrears of land revenue the petitioners paid the amounts in Much later there was a decision of this <ORG> striking down the corresponding provision of the Bombay Sales Tax Act as ultra vires The petitioners thereupon filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution claiming a refund of the amounts paid by them in consequence of the recovery proceedings It was held by four of the five learned Judges of this <ORG> that the writ petition should be dismissed on the ground of laches Chief Justice <NAME> held that though Article gives the right to move the <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of fundamental rights and <ORG> cannot place any hindrance in the way of an aggrieved person once the matter reached this court the extent or manner of interference was for the <ORG> to decide Similarly in inquiring into belated and stale claims this <ORG> should take note of evidence of neglect of the petitioner own rights for a long time or of the rights of innocent parties which might have merged by reason of the delay It was possible for this <ORG> to lay down any specific period as the ultimate limit of action and the case will have to be considered on its own facts was of the view that on the facts of the case there was no delay but that the period under the Limitation Act should not be applied to such cases and that a period of one year should be taken as a period beyond which the claim would be considered a stale claim unless the delay is explained The learned Judge observed for brevity we quote from head note Since the right given to the petitioners under Article is itself a fundamental right and does not depend on the discretionary powers of this <ORG> as in the case of Article it is inappropriate to equate the duty imposed on this <ORG> to the powers of Chancery <ORG> in England or the equitable jurisdiction of <ORG>s in the United States If this <ORG> could refuse relief on the ground of delay the power of the <ORG> under Article would be discretionary power and the right would cease to be a fundamental right The provisions contained in the Limitation Act do not apply to proceedings under Articles and and if these provisions of the Limitation Act are brought in indirectly to control the remedies conferred by the Constitution it would be a case of <ORG> indirectly abridging the fundamental rights which this court in <NAME> case To give an instance in recent years the question has often arisen whether a refund could be refused on the ground that the person who seeks the refund has already passed on the burden of the illegal tax to others and that to grant a refund to him would result in his unjust enrichment But we see no reason why the vital interests of the <ORG> taken note of by the learned judges in <ORG> should not be a relevant criterion for deciding that a refund should not be granted Though there are the dates of the Judgement of the appropriate <ORG> which may not constitute a declaration of law within the scope of Article of the constitution it cannot be gainsaid that the <ORG> cannot on any grounds of equity be permitted to retain the cess collected on and after the date of <ORG> judgement But we agree that to the extend refunds of amounts of cess collected after the relevant dates are permissible on the basis indicated by us the <ORG> should refund those amounts to the assessees directly or to the <NAME> from whom they were collected with interest at the rate directed by this <ORG> or mentioned in the undertaking from the date of the relevant judgment to the actual date of repayment
