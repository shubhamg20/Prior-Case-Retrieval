In addition to these five mortgages there were also three other mortgages of which the plaintiffs were not the direct mortgagees but assignees from those who were the original mortgagees The plaintiffs brought their suit to enforce the mortgages and in addition to joining the mortgagors they also joined certain persons who were defendants Nos to who had bought from the mortgagors the equities of redemption of the properties hypothecated by virtue of the five mortgage deeds referred to above It is also common ground that the plaintiffs had no notice of what had taken place between the mortgagors and the purchasers of the equities of redemption and were not privy to the contract There are also other cases which have been quoted by the learned Advocate for the appellant which certainly at first sight appear to support to some extent the learned Advocate argument I A their Lordships of <ORG> held that under certain circumstances to which I shall refer presently it was possible for a person who was no party to an agreement to take advantage of the provisions of such an agreement which were in fact beneficial to herself Then there is another case which was cited on behalf of the plaintiffs <NAME> <NAME> Ind it may indeed be said that the facts disclosed that the creditor was actually privy to and concerned in the transaction which took place between the transferee and the debtor In fact in the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> it is expressly stated that there was an arrangement between the plaintiff and defendant No by which the liability of defendant No under the transfer was acknowledged and accepted and it may also be observed that although under the mistaken idea of their true legal effect certain title deeds were actually handed over at that time by the purchaser to the plaintiff does constitute some authority to support the argument which has been addressed to us by the learned Advocate who has appeared for the appellants There are however on the other hand two cases which appear to be conclusive authority upon the point which has been argued in this appeal His Lordship continues The mortgagee has no right to avail himself of that There is still a later case in which the same proposition has been similarly set forth in another decision of their Lordships of <ORG> We have had the advantage however of seeing what the facts were from the record of this <ORG> the case having been tried on appeal on the th June before <NAME> and <NAME> JJ The mortgagee sued upon his mortgage not only the mortgagor but also the purchaser but this <ORG> refused to grant any personal decree against the purchaser holding that he the mortgagee could not avail himself of the stipulation made in the contract between the purchaser and the mortgagor Their Lordships have considered this case and they think it is clear that no personal liability was incurred by the purchasers of the equity of redemption It seems therefore that we are clearly bound by the authority of these two decisions of <ORG> which are so directly in point The appeal therefore must be dismissed with costs It is said by the learned Advocate who has appeared for the appellants and it may be mentioned that the question is referred to in ground No of the appellants grounds of appeal to this Court that there has been some arithmetical or other mistake with regard to the amount of costs which have been awarded to the defendants Nos to It is to be borne in mind that in the present case there was no notice to the plaintiff at the time of the contract In the judgment of <ORG> we see that the promisee that is to say the plaintiff had a proposal made to him by the promisor that is to say defendant No and he accepted it That is the distinction between the two classes of cases and I think the present case falls within the class indicated in the <ORG> cases which have been quoted
