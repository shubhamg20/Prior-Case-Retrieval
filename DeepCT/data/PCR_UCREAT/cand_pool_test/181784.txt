Both the above reference applications are disposed of by one single order as they relate to two different assessment years and but common question of law is involved in both these applications Brief facts of the case are that the Commissioner of Income tax passed an order under Section of the Act on April and another on September In response to the above notice the assessee filed its return of income on February The assessment was thereafter made by the Income tax Officer on April under Section of the Act The Commissioner of Income tax initiated proceedings under Section of the Act taking the view that the assessments made by the Income tax Officer were erroneous as they were prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> The Commissioner of Income tax held that the assessment orders passed by the Income tax Officer were erroneous as by these orders the income which was assessable to tax had been declared to be exempt and it has resulted in loss of lawful revenue to the State The Commissioner of Income tax as such set aside the orders passed by the Income tax Officer and gave direction to take proceedings for assessment de novo The <ORG> held that there was no error much less any error which might be prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> on the facts and in the circumstances of the cases The <ORG> as such by order dated August allowed both the appeals and set aside the orders passed by the Commissioner of Income tax It was thus submitted that the income received by the assessee having been derived from selling agency could not be said to be property held in trust as settled by the authors of the trust On the other hand Shri <NAME> learned counsel for the assessee trust submitted that the view taken by their Lordships of <ORG> in Dharmaposhanam Company case ITR has been overruled by a later decision of <ORG> in Addl It is submitted that the entire basis of the order of the learned Commissioner of Income tax was Dharmaposhanam Company case ITR SC but when <ORG> itself in <ORG> case ITR has held the same to be no longer good law the entire order of the Commissioner of Income tax falls to the ground and no question of law survives for the opinion of this court There was a clear case of the assessee that after the assessee trust has become the sole selling agent and continued to receive the commission income and there was no fundamental change in the character of commission income so far as the applicability of Section of the Act is concerned It has already been held in <ORG> case ITR SC that if the profit making activity is subservient to the charitable objects of general public utility then the exemption has to be allowed under Section of the Act There is no dispute in the present cases about the application of the income It was thus contended that the <ORG> committed no error of law and no question of law arises from the order of the Income tax Appellate <ORG> dated August We have given our thoughtful consideration to the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties The <ORG> considered the question whether there was any error in the order of the Income tax Officer within the meaning of Section of the Act and whether such error caused any prejudice to the interests of the <ORG> In order to assume jurisdiction under Section of the Act two things have to be established i that there is an error in the orders of the Income tax Officer and ii that the error is prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> Simply because there was a provision for not continuing the sole selling agency for more than five years in the agreement deed dated September the Commissioner of Income tax was not right in concluding that the question of receiving the commission income during the years under appeal would not have arisen in terms of the agreement deed dated September The clear case of the assessee is that after the trust became the selling agent in contradiction to the sole selling agency and continued to receive the commission income and there was no fundamental change in the character of commission income so far as exempting provisions of Section is concerned Unless the Commissioner of Income tax categorically says that there was some income from speculative business which could not qualify for deduction much less exemption under Section it cannot be said that there was any error in the order of the Income tax Officer relating to the assessment year In our view the above findings recorded by the <ORG> are purely findings of fact based on material on record and no question of law arises in the matter of such findings Had the case of <ORG> ITR SC been not overruled by <ORG> in <ORG> case ITR there would have been valid ground for a question of law arising in the present case but the said decision having been overruled there remains no res integra for being considered by this court In the result we find no force in these reference applications and the same are dismissed without any order as to costs
