The order in this case will also govern the disposal of Misc By these petitions under Article of the Constitution of India the petitioners have prayed that the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Upkar Adhiniyam Act No of as amended by the Madhya Pradesh Sanshodhan Adhiniyam Act No of imposing cess on land held in connection with mineral rights be declared as ultra vires A Mineral Area Development Cess was imposed by the State under the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Karadhan Adhiniyam on the land held under the mining leases Under the amended provisions of Section of the Code the Madhya Pradesh Land Under Mining Lease Quarry Leases Assessment Rules were framed and notices were sent to the holders of mining leases demanding land revenue Under the Act as it stood prior to its amendment by Act No of Energy Development Cess was levied by Part of that Act Urban Development Cess was levied by Part II of the Act Cess on Transfer of Vacant Land and Land Used for purpose of Agriculture was levied by Part II of the Act and Cess on storage of coal was levied by Part IV of the Act By the Madhya Pradesh Upkar Sanshodhan Adhiniyam Act No of the heading of Part IV of the Act was substituted by the heading Cess on Land held in connection with Mineral Rights By the amended provisions of Section of the Act cess was levied on land held in connection with mineral rights at the rate prescribed Section of the Act as amended provided that the proceeds of the cess on land held in connection with mineral rights might be utilised by <ORG> for the general development of the mineral bearing areas In pursuance of the provisions of the Act so amended notices were issued to the petitioners demanding cess on the land held in connection with mineral rights Aggrieved by that demand the petitioners have filed these petitions assailing the validity of the provisions of the Madhya Pradesh Upkar Sanshodhan Adhiniyam imposing cess on land held in connection with mineral rights When the matter came up for consideration before a Division Bench of this Court it was stated on behalf of the Slate that certain provisions of the impugned Act were likely to be amended and that the decision of this Court in <NAME> <ORG> of MPLJ required reconsideration Thereafter the Act was further amended by <NAME> Act No of deleting the provisions of Section of the Act which enabled the <ORG> to utilise the proceeds of cess on land held in connection with the mineral rights for the general development of the mineral bearing areas As the correctness of the decision rendered by another Division Bench of this Court in <NAME> case was questioned <ORG> was constituted to hear these petitions On behalf of the petitioners it was contended that as the cess levied under the impugned Act was a fee relatable to Entries and in List II of the VII Schedule to the Constitution it was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> having regard to the provisions of Entry in List I of the VII Schedule to the Constitution read with the provisions of the Act It was urged that the power of the <ORG> to legislate on any matter referable to Entry in List II of the VII Schedule to the Constitution was denuded by the declaration made by the <ORG> in Section of the Act It was further contended that even if it was held that the imposition of the cess under the provisions of the Act amounted to imposition of a tax and not a fee <ORG> had no power to impose tax on minerals as was sought to be done under the provisions of the impugned Act because the field of taxation in respect of land held in connection with mineral rights was occupied by the provisions of Sections and of the Act the Central Act of In reply it was contended on behalf of the respondents that what was levied by the provisions of the impugned Act was a tax and not a fee and that such imposition by <ORG> was permissible in view of Entries and in List II of VII Schedule to the Constitution It was urged that the field of taxation with regard to land held in connection with mineral rights was not covered by the Act and <ORG> was competent to enact a law in that behalf by virtue of Entries and in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution In view of the contentions advanced on behalf of the parties the first question that arises for consideration is whether the levy imposed by the impugned Act amounts to a fee or a tax There shall be levied and collected a cess on land held in connection with mineral rights at such rale as may be notified by <ORG> per ton of major mineral raised and the rate of cess prevailing in respect of coal during the period commencing from the date of commencement of the principal Act and ending on the date of Commencement of the Upkar Sanshodhan Adhiniyam shall be deemed to be the rate of cess notified under this sub section in respect of coal Provided further that every notification under the above proviso shall be laid on the table of <ORG> and the provisions of Section A of the General Clauses Act Act No of shall apply thereto as they apply to a Rule It has to be noted that Section of the Act which provided thar proceeds of the cess on land held in connection with the mineral rights may be utilised by the State <ORG> It is thus clear that after the aforesaid amendment there is no provision in the Act laying down any manner of utilisation of the proceeds of the cess recovered under the Act The Act now contains no provision to indicale that the cess in question is levied in consideration of any service to be rendered for the development of mineral bearing areas or for those from whom the cess is to be recovered In the first place it must be levied in consideration of certain services which the individuals accept either willingly or unwillingly and in the second place the amount collected must be earmarked to make the expenses of rendering these services and must not go to the general revenue of the State to be spent for general purposes It was then contended on behalf of the petitioners that in the return filed on behalf of the respondents it was stated that the proceeds of cess levied under the Act would be utilised by <ORG> The Act which imposes levy should indicate that it has some relation to the services to be rendered so as to impress it with the character of a fee Learned counsel for the respondent <ORG> contended that <ORG> has the power to impose the tax in question under Entry or of the <ORG> List Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that once a declaration had been made by <ORG> in Section of the Act that the regulation of mines and mineral development under the control of the <ORG> was expedient in the public interest the entire legislative field relating to mines and minerals was occupied and the <ORG> lost its legislative power in respect of that occupied field It was held by this Court that the Haryana Act was not in any way repugnant to the provisions of the Act of made by <ORG> and that the ownership rights could be validly acquired by the State Government under the State Act It was contended on behalf of the sugar undertakings that since sugar is a declared industry under the Industries Development and Regulation Act <ORG> alone was competent to pass a law on the subject and <ORG> had no competence to pass the impugned Act by reason of Entry List I read with Entry List II The majority speaking through one of us <NAME> <NAME> held that the legislative power of the <ORG> under Entry List II was eroded only to the extent to which control was assumed by <ORG> pursuant to the declaration made by the <ORG> in respect of a declared industry and that the field occupied by such enactment was the measure of the erosion of the legislative competence of the <ORG> legislature Our attention was then invited to the provisions of Section of the Act and it was urged that Section of the Act was wider in scope and amplitude than Section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act that Clause i of Sub section of Section of the Act of contained a provision for levy of taxes in respect of minerals and therefore the wider power conferred by Section of the Act must be held to include power to levy taxes in respect of minerals But the omission in Section of the Act of the power to levy taxes on minerals similar to that conferred by Section of Act is significant It shall be the duty of <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and systematic development of minerals in India and for the protection of environment by preventing or controlling any pollution which may be caused by prospecting or mining operations and for such purposes <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette make such rules as it thinks fit Section of the Act then empowers <ORG> to frame rules on matters specified in that provision without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by Section of the Act to frame rules in that behalf But a tax cannot be imposed by a rule unless the statute specifically authorises the imposition AIR SC at No tax can be imposed by any bye law or rule or regulation unless the statute under which the subordinate legislation is made specially authorises the imposition even if it is assumed that the power to tax can be delegated to the executive The basis of the statutory power conferred by the statute cannot be transgressed by the rule making authority A rule making authority has no plenary power It has to act within the limits of the power granted to it It was then contended on behalf of the petitioners that Section of the Act provided that any tax due under the Act or the rules made thereunder would be recovered in the same manner as an arrears of land revenue and therefore the Act must be held to contain provision for levy of a tax on minerals Having given our anxious consideration to the matter we have come to the conclusion that the power of <ORG> to legislate with respect to matters covered by Entries and of List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution has not been taken away by the provision of the Act Taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitations imposed by <ORG> by law relating to mineral development To ascertain whether the subject matter of the tax levied by the Act is covered by Entry let us turn to the charging section which is Section of the Act That section lays down that there shall be levied and collected a cess on land held in connection with mineral rights at such rate as may be notified by the State <ORG> It is sign if icant to note that cess is not imposed on all land and that it is not dependent either on the extent of the land held in connection with mineral rights or on the value thereof The subject matter of tax therefore is major mineral raised from the land held in connection with mineral right The tax is riot dependant on the extent of the land held in connection with mineral rights It is not a case where all land is liable to payment of cess that the liability is assessed on the basis of the value of the land and that the measure of the tax in so far as land held under a mining lease is concerned is the value of the minerals produced Under the impugned Act value of the land or of the minerals produced does not play any part in the levy of cess The quantity of major minerals raised from the land determines the liability to pay tax In these circumstances the impugned levy cannot be held to be a tax on land which is covered by Entry of the State List The following observations in that decision are pertinent at of AIR The scheme of Section therefore shows that whenever any land is used for the purpose of holding a market the owner occupier or farmer of that land has to pay a certain tax for its use as such But there is no tax on any transaction that may take place within the market Further the amount of tax depends upon the area of the land on which market is held and the importance of the market subject to a maximum fixed by <ORG> We have therefore no hesitation in coming to the conclusion on a consideration of the scheme of Section of the Act that the tax provided therein is a tax on land though its incidence depends upon the use of the land as a market Further as we have already indicated Section which uses the words impose an annual tax thereon clearly shows that the word thereon refers to any land for which a licence is issued for use as a market and not to the word market It was pointed out that although the same standard was adopted as a measure for the two levies the levies remained separate and distinct imposts by virtue of their nature The subject matter of tax is therefore not covered by Entry of the State List The next question for consideration is whether the impugned tax is a tax on mineral rights a subject covered by Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule This raises a question as to what meaning should be attached to the expression tax on mineral right <NAME> in his minority judgment has dealt with the question as to the scope of Entry a matter not dealt with by the majority judgment as follows at of AIR The next contention on behalf of the State of Orissa is that if the cess is not justified as a fee it is tax under Item of List II of the Seventh Schedule Item provides for taxes on mineral rights subject to any limitation imposed by <ORG> by law relating to mineral development This raises a question as to what are taxes on mineral rights Obviously taxes on mineral rights must be different from taxes on goods produced in the nature of duties of excise If taxes on mineral rights also include taxes on mineral produce there would be no difference between taxes on mineral rights and duties of excise under Item of List I A comparison of Lists I and II of the Seventh Schedule shows that the same tax is not put in both the Lists The difference can be understood if one sees that before minerals are extracted and become liable to duties of excise somebody has got to work the mines The usual method of working them is for the owner of the mine to grant mining leases to those who have got the capital to work the mines There should therefore be no difficulty in holding that taxes on mineral rights are taxes on the right to extract minerals and not taxes on the minerals actually extracted Thus tax on mineral rights would be confined for example to taxes on leases of mineral rights and on premium or royalty for that It is said that there may be cases where the owner himself extracts minerals and does not give any right of extraction to somebody else and that in such cases in the absence of mining leases or subleases there would be no way of levying tax on mineral rights Where there is a lease of the buildings the annual value is determined by the lease money but there are many cases where owners themselves live in buildings In such cases also taxes on buildings are levied on the annual value worked outaccording to certain rules There would be no difficulty where an owner himself works the mine to value the mineral rights on the same principles on which leases of mineral rights are made and then to tax the royalty which for example the owner might have got if instead of working the mine himself he had leased it out to somebody else Now from a perusal of Section of the Act it would be clear that in the instant case by the charging section tax is not imposed on the mineral rights of every holder of mining lease The tax is levied on minerals produced in land held under mining lease In these circumstances the tax levied by the Act cannot be held to be a tax covered by Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution The provisions of Section of the Upkar Adhiniyam Act No of as amended by the Upkar Sanshodhan Adhiniyam Act of imposing cess on land held in connection with mineral rights a re declared as ultra vires In the circumstances of the case parties shall bear their own costs of these petitions
