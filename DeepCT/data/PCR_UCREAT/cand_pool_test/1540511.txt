of the Police Act were exercising the powers of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure and their powers were subject to the same limitations to which the Governor was subject the officer exercising the power of dismissal was only indirectly exercising the Governor power to dismiss at pleasure Paragraph was not meant for the purpose of carrying out the object of Art was delivered by <NAME> SUBBA RAO This is an appeal by special leave against the judgment of <ORG> at Allahabad Lucknow Bench allowing the petition filed by the respondent under Art There is dispute in regard to the interpretation of the complaint On receipt of the said complaint <NAME> made enquiries and issued a notice to the respondent to show cause why his integrity certificate should not be withheld upon which the respondent submitted his explanation on October Thereafter <NAME> forwarded the file of the case to the Deputy Inspector General of Police Central Range who directed <NAME> to take proceedings under of the Police Act against the respondent The departmental proceedings were started against the respondent on November a charge sheet was served upon the respondent under of the Police Act stating that there were strong reasons to suspect that the respondent misappropriated a sum of Rs On January the Superin tendent of Police issued another notice to the respondent to show cause why he should not be reduced to the lowest grade of Sub Inspector for a period of three years On February the Inspector General of Police confirmed that order and the revision filed by the respondent against that order to <ORG> was also dismissed in August The State Government the Deputy Inspector General of Police Lucknow and the Inspector General of Police Uttar Pradesh Lucknow have preferred the present appeal against the said order of <ORG> We shall now proceed to consider the various contentions raised by learned counsel in the order they were raised and argued before us At the outset Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellants contended that there was no breach of the provisions of para If this contention be accepted no other question arises in this case therefore we shall deal with the same In such cases and in other cases until and unless a magisterial inquiry is ordered inquiry will be made under the direction of the Superintendent of Police in accordance with the following rules I Every information received by the police relating to the commission of a cognizable offence by a police officer shall be dealt with in the first place under Chapter XIV Criminal Procedure Code according to law a case under the appropriate section being registered in the police station concerned This provision expressly lays down that every information received by the police relating to the commission of a cognizable offence by a police officer shall be dealt with in the first place under Ch XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code This is a point raised before us for the first time This does not find a place even in the statement of case filed by the appellants Indeed it was common case that the information disclosed an offence committed by the respondent but it had been contended by the appellants that the misappropriation of the part of the money amounted to an offence under of the Indian Penal Code which is not a cognizable offence and it was argued on behalf of the respondent that it amounted to an offence under of the Indian Penal Code Even so it is said that whatever might been the contentions of the parties the information given by <NAME> to <NAME> clearly disclosed that no offence was alleged to have been committed by the respondent and that this Court would therefore be justified even at this very late stage to accept the contention of the appellants The notice issued by the Supe rintendent of Police on November to the respondent also charges him with an offence of misappropriation It is stated that the said notice only says that <NAME> had good reasons to suspect that the respondent misappropriated the sum of money and that it does not aver that he committed the offence of misappropriation But what matters is that <NAME> also understood from the information given and the enquiry conducted by him that the respondent had committed the offence In the counter affidavit filed by <NAME> on behalf of the State it was clearly averred that on September <NAME> appeared before him and filed a petition to the effect fiat one <NAME> and the respondent had misappropriated a sum of Rs In the circumstances we must hold that the information received by the police related to the commission of an offence by the respondent It is said that there was no entrustment made by <NAME> to the respondent and that therefore the offence did not fall under of the Indian Penal Code which is a cognizable offence but only under of the Indian Penal Code which is not a cognizable offence Under of the Indian Penal Code Whoever being in any manner entrusted with property or with any dominion over property dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use that property or dishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged or of any legal contract express or implied which he has made touching the discharge of such trust or wilfully suffers any person so to do commits criminal breach of trust If so the information discloses a cognizable offence We reject the first contention Rule III says When a Superintendent of Police sees reason to take action on information given to him or on his own knowledge or suspicion that a police officer subordinate to him has committed an offence under section of the Police Act or a non cognizable offence including an offence under section of the Police Act of which he considers it unnecessary at that stage to forward a report in writing to the District Magistrate under rule II above he will make or cause to be made by an officer senior in rank to the officer charged a departmental inquiry sufficient to test the truth of the charge Section of the Police Act empowers certain officers to dismiss suspend or reduce any police officer of the subordinate rank whom they shall think remiss or negligent in the discharge of his duty or unfit for the same Action under this section can therefore be taken in respect of i offences only under of the Police Act without involving any cognizable or noncognizable offences that is simple remissness or negli gence in the discharge of duty ii cognizable offences and iii non cognizable offences Though the word only is not mentioned in rule the offence under of the Police Act can in the context mean an offence only under of the said Act i an offence falling under the first category We therefore reject this contention The third contention advanced by learned counsel for the appellants raises a constitutional point of considerable importance But if there is a statute prescribing the terms of service and the mode of dismissal of the servant of the <ORG> the statute would control the pleasure of the <ORG> In India the Constitution as well as the earlier Constitution Act of as amended in and embodied the incidents of tenure at pleasure of His Majesty or the President or the Governor as the case may be but did not empower the Legislatures under the earlier Acts and the <ORG> and the Legislatures under the Constitution to make a law abrogating or modifying the said tenure therefore any law made by appropriate authorities conferring a power on any subordinate officer to dismiss a servant must be construed not to limit the power of His Majesty the President or the Governor as the case may be but only to indicate that they would express their pleasure only through the said officers The rules made in exercise of a power conferred on a <ORG> under a statute so delegating the power to a subordinate officer can only be administrative directions to enable the exercise of the pleasure by the concerned authorities in a reasonable manner and that any breach of those regulations cannot possibly confer any right on or give a cause of action to the aggrieved <ORG> servant to go to a court of law and vindicate his rights Alternatively he contends that even if the Police Act does not curtail the tenure at pleasure the <ORG> validly made that law and the <ORG> validly made statutory rules in exercise of the powers confered under that Act and that therefore the appropriate authorities can only dismiss the respondent in strict compliance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder The main difference between the Act of and that of was that in the former Act there was only one limitation on the <ORG> pleasure namely that no person in the service might be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed whereas in the latter Act a second limitation was imposed namely that no such person should be dismissed or reduced in rank until he had been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him see sub ss Until other provision is made in this behalf under this Constitution all the laws in force immediately before the commencement of this Constitution and applicable to any public service or any post which continues to exist after the commencement of this Constitution as an all India service or as service or post under the <ORG> or a <ORG> shall continue in force so far as consistent with the provisions of this Constitution The relevant provisions of the Constitution read thus Article Subject to the provisions of this Constitution Acts of the appropriate <ORG> may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any <ORG> Provided that it shall be competent for the President or such person as he may direct in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union and for the Governor of a <ORG> or such person as he may direct in the case of services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> to make rules regulating the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to such services and posts until provision in that behalf is made by or under an Act of the appropriate <ORG> under this article and any rules so made shall have effect subject to the provisions of any such Act Article Except as expressly provided by this Constitution every person who is a member of a defence service or of a civil service or holds any post connected with defence or any Civil Post under the Union holds office during the pleasure of the President and every person who is a member of a civil service of a <ORG> or holds any civil post under a <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the <ORG> the appropriate <ORG> may regulate the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services every person who is <ORG> member of a public service described therein holds office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be restrictive clause namely Subject to the provisions of this Constitution and if there is no restrictive clause in Art is subject to the provisions of Art with the result that the power of the <ORG> to lay down the conditions of service of persons appointed to public services would be subject to the tenure at pleasure under Art If there is a specific provision in some part of the Constitution giving to a Government servant a tenure different from that provided for in Art and which provide that the Judges of <ORG> the Auditor General the Judges of the High Courts and the Chief Election Commissioner shall not be removed from their offices except in the manner laid down in those Articles That may be so but there is no reason why Art In England all servants of the <ORG> hold office during the pleasure of the <ORG> the right to dismiss at pleasure is an implied term in every contract of employment of the <ORG> this doctrine is not based upon any prerogative of the <ORG> but on public policy if the terms of appointment definitely prescribe a tenure for good behaviour or expressly provide for a power to determine for a cause such an implication of a power to dismiss at pleasure is excluded and an Act of Parliament can abrogate or amend the said doctrine of public policy in the same way as it can do in respect of any other part of common law Section of the Government of India Act for the first time in by amendment statutorily recognized this doctrine but it was made subject to a condition or qualification namely that no person in that service might be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed Section of the Act of imposed another limitation namely that a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in i A It is not disputed that <ORG> can make law for the organization of the police and for the prevention and detection of crime thereof nothing in this Article shall prevent <ORG> or the <ORG> of the State from conferring by law functions on any authority subordinate to the Governor the <ORG> or the <ORG> of the State can confer the same power on any authority subordinate to the Governor or at any rate can make a law prescribing that the Governor shall exercise the said pleasure through a particular officer We cannot agree either with the premises or the conclusion sought to be based on it Article says that subject to the provisions of the Constitution the executive power of the <ORG> shall extend to matters with respect to which the <ORG> of the <ORG> has power to make laws If the <ORG> of the <ORG> has no power to make a law affecting the tenure at pleasure of the Governor the said power must necessarily fall outside the scope of the executive power of the <ORG> Article of the Constitution says that unless expresssly provided by the Constitution to the contrary every civil servant holds office during the pleasure of the Governor subject to the limitations prescribed under Art expressly provides for a different tenure Can it be said that the said Article confers on the <ORG> or the <ORG> a power higher than that conferred on them under Art of the Constitution It only preserves the power of the <ORG> which it has under the Constitution to make a law conferring functions on an authority subordinate to the Governor to dismiss a public servant at his pleasure a statute may confer a power on a subordinate officer to dismiss a servant only subject to conditions a subordinate officer functioning under an Act may not be able to dismiss a servant but the Governor may be able to do so under similar circumstances a subordi nate officer may dismiss a servant but the Governor may order his continuance in office A law made by the appropriate <ORG> or the rules made by the President or the Governor as the case may be under the said Article may confer a power upon a particular authority to remove a public servant from service but the conferment of such a power does not amount to a delegation of the Governor pleasure Whatever the said authority does is by virtue of express power conferred on it by a statute or rules made by competent authorities and not by virtue of any delegation by the Governor of his power basis for unlike in England a member of the public service in India is constitutionally protected at least in two directions i he cannot be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed ii he cannot be dismissed removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him These two statutory protections to the Government servant are now incorporated in Art This Article imposes two qualifications on the exercise of the pleasure of the President or the Governor and they quite clearly restrict the operation of the rule embodied in Art The most important of these two limitations is the provision prescribing that a civil servant shall be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him The appropriate <ORG> and <ORG> can test the validity of such a law on the basis whe ther the provisions prescribed provide for such an opportunity and if it is valid to ascertain whether the reasonable opportunity so prescribed is really given to a particular officer The <ORG> or the <ORG> of States cannot make a law abrogating or modifying this tenure so as to impinge upon the overriding power conferred upon the President or the Governor under Art The <ORG> or the <ORG> of States can make a law regulating the conditions of service of such a member which includes proceedings by way of disciplinary action without affecting the powers of the President or the Governor under Art The <ORG> and the <ORG> also can make a law laying down and regulating the scope and content of the doctrine of reasonable opportunity embodied in Art If a statute could be made by <ORG> within the foregoing permissible limits the rules made by an authority in exercise of the power conferred thereunder would likewise be efficacious within the said limits It follows that where the appropriate authority takes disciplinary action under the Police Act or the rules made thereunder it must conform to the provisions of the statute or the rules which have conferred upon it the power to take the said action If there is any violation of the said provisions subject to the question which we will presently consider whether the rules are directory or mandatory the public servant would have a right to challenge the decision of that authority Under of the said Act every person in civil service holds office during the pleasure of His Majesty Sub section of that section empowers the Secretary of <ORG> for India to make rules laying down among others the conditions of service and sub declares that no rules so made shall be construed to limit or abridge the power of the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> to deal with the case of any person in the civil service of the <ORG> in India in such manner as may appear to him to be just and equitable Two reasons were given for the conclusion namely i in express terms stated that the office was held during the pleasure and there was no room for the implication of a contractual term that the rules were to be observed and ii sub of and the rules made careful provisions for redress of grievances by administrative process and that sub reaffirmed the superior authority of the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> over the civil service It may be noticed that the rules framed in exercise of the power conferred by the Act was to regulate the exercise of His Majesty pleasure <NAME> if we may say so correctly stated the scope of the rule in <NAME> case in the decision in <NAME> case when he stated at The position of the Government servant was therefore rather insecure for his office being held during the pleasure of the <ORG> under the Government of India Act the rules could not override I A or derogate from the statute and the protection of the rules could not be enforced by action so as to nullify the statute itself There is another principle equally fundamental to the rules of construction namely that the rules shall be consistent with the provisions of the Act The decisions of <ORG> on the provisions of the earlier Constitution Act can be sustained on the ground that the rules made in exercise of power conferred under the Acts cannot override or modify the tenure at pleasure provided by or of the said Acts as the case may be It would not serve any purpose to consider every one of them in detail They express two divergent views one line relies upon the observations of <ORG> in <NAME> case and lays down that all statutory rules vis a vis the disciplinary proceedings taken against a <ORG> servant are administrative directions and the other applies the well settled rules of construction and holds that the appropriate authority is bound to comply with the mandatory provisions of the rules in making an inquiry under a particular statute If so it follows that the inquiry under the Act shall be made in accordance with its provisions and the rules made thereunder Then learned counsel contends that even if the said rules have statutory force they are only directory and the non compliance with the rules will not invalidate the order of dismissal made by the appropriate authority punish specified subordinate officers who are remiss or negligent in discharge of their duties or unfit for the same enables the Government to make rules to regulate the procedure to be followed by the magistrate and police officers in discharge of any duty imposed on them by or under the Act under read with of the Police Act the Police Regulations embodied in chapter XXXII were framed Paragraph gives the procedure to be followed in the matter of the inquiry against a police officer It reads Subject to the special provision contained in paragraph and to any special orders which may be passed by the Governor in particular cases a proceeding against a police officer will consist of A A magisterial or police inquiry followed if this inquiry shows the need for further action by A judicial trial or A departmental trial or both consecutively Paragraph says that there can be no magisterial inquiry under the Criminal Procedure Code when the offence alleged against a police officer amounts to an offence only under of the Police Act and it provides further that in such cases and in other cases until and unless a magisterial inquiry is ordered inquiry will be made under the direction of the Superintendent of Police in accordance with the rules given thereunder Under rule I thereof Every information received by the police relating to the commission of a cognizable offence by a police officer shall be dealt with in the first place under Chapter XIV Criminal Procedure Code according to law a case under the appropriate section being registered in the police station concerned There are six provisos to that rule There are other provisions dealing with the manner of conducting the inquiries and other connected matters The word shall in its ordinary import is obligatory but there are many decisions wherein the courts under different situations construed the word to mean may It is then observed They the rules are well known and there is no need to repeat them A valuable guide for ascertaining the intention of the <ORG> is found in <NAME> on The Interpretation of Statutes th edition at and it is On the other hand where the prescriptions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and where the invalidation of acts done in neglect of them would work serious general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have no control over those entrusted with the duty without promoting the essential aims of the legislature such prescriptions seem to be generally understood as mere instructions for the guidance and government of those on whom the duty is imposed or in other words as directory only The neglect of them may be penal indeed but it does not affect the validity of the act done in disregard of them After making the necessary investigation under chapter XIV of the Criminal Procedure Code <NAME> may as well come to the conclusion that the officer concerned is innocent and on that basis drop the entire proceedings On September he was returning from a village called Madhwapur when he saw a man who was subsequently found to be <NAME> coming from the side of a canal and going hurriedly into a field An inquiry was made by the Superintendent of Police and ultimately departmental proceedings under of the Police Act were taken against the respondent The reply of the appellant was two fold in the first place it was urged that did not apply as there was no report of a cognizable offence against the sub inspector and in the next place it was urged that the rules contained in the Police Regulations were only administrative rules and even if there was non compliance with any of them it would not affect the departmental proceedings taken against the respondent provided there was no breach of the guarantees contained in Art <ORG> held that there was a report of a cognizable offence under of the Indian Penal Code against the respondent and therefore the procedure provided by ought to have been followed It further held that had been framed under of the Police Act and was a statutory provision which had the force of law As such following the earlier view taken by <ORG> in two other cases it held that a dismissal as a result of departmental proceedings which took place without complying with would be illegal Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellant urges the same two points before us So far as the first point is concerned we are of opinion that there is no force in it There is no doubt that in the complaint made by <NAME> the name of the respondent was not shown in the heading but from the facts disclosed in the body of the complaint it is clear that the sub inspector searched the person of <NAME> and recovered a bundle containing currency notes When therefore he was satisfied that there was no reason to take any further action against <NAME> it was his duty to see that the entire amount taken by him from <NAME> on search was returned to him <NAME> This brings us to the main point in the present appeal It gives power to four grades of police officers to dismiss suspend or reduce any police officer of the subordinate ranks whom they think remiss or negligent in the discharge of his duty or unfit for the same That procedural provision is that where a report of a cognizable crime is made against a police officer belonging to the subordinate ranks it has to be registered as provided in Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure and investigated as provided thereunder The main contention on behalf of the appellant is that the Rules framed under of the Police Act are administrative rules and in any case they are only directory and non compliance with them would not vitiate the subsequent proceedings unless there is a breach of the guarantee contained in Art of the Constitution as all public servants hold their office at the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be other than those expressly excepted under the Constitution This brings us to a consideration of the tenure on which public servants hold office The position in England is that all public servants hold office at the pleasure of His Majesty that is to say their service was terminable at any time without amuse see <NAME> <NAME> By law however it is open to <ORG> to prescribe a different tenure and the King being a party to every Act of <ORG> is understood to have accepted the change in the tenure when he gives assent to such law see <NAME> <NAME> Section for the first time provided by statute that every person in the civil service of the <ORG> held office during His Majesty pleasure subject to the provisions of the Government of India Act and the rules made thereunder and the only protection to a public servant against the exercise of pleasure was that he could not be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed It was this section which came for consideration before the Privy <ORG> in <NAME> case and the Privy <ORG> held that in spite of the words <ORG> further held that the terms of assured that the tenure of office though at pleasure would not be subject to capricious or arbitrary action but would be regulated by the rules which were manifold in number most minute in particularity and all capable of change but there was no right in the public servant enforceable by action to hold his office in accordance with those rules and he could therefore be dismissed notwithstanding the failure to observe the procedure prescribed by them The main point which was urged in <NAME> case was that under XIV of the Civil Services Classification Rules no public servant could be dismissed removed or reduced in rank except after a properly recorded departmental inquiry In the Government of India Act laid down that except as expressly provided by this Act every person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure There were however two safeguards provided by sub ss The first was the same namely that no public servant will be dismissed by an officer subordinate to that who appointed him but a further exception was added to the pleasure tenure namely no public servant shall be dismissed until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Thus by the Government of India Act there were two statutory guarantees to public servants against the exercise of the pleasure of his Majesty but it is clear from of the Government of India Act that the pleasure of His Majesty to dismiss was not otherwise subject to rules framed under the subsequent provisions of the Government of India Act appearing in Chapter of Part dealing with public services <NAME> service or of a civil service of the <ORG> or of an all India service or holds any post connected with defence or any civil post under the <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the President and every person who is a member of a civil service of a <ORG> or holds any civil post under a <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the <ORG> It will be clear therefore that all public servants except as expressly provided by the Constitution hold their office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be Article then provides for two guarantees and is similar in terms to and of the Government of India Act and the two guarantees are the same namely i that no person shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed and ii no such person shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reason able opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him In this connection he relies on Art service of person appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the <ORG> or of any State lays down that it shall be competent for the President or the Governor as the case may be to make rules relating to recruitment and conditions of service until provision in that behalf is made by or under an Act of the appropriate <ORG> Therefore unless there is an express provision in the Constitution cutting down the pleasure tenure every public servant holds office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be which authorises <ORG> or the legislature of a State to confer functions on any I A The position therefore that emerges from the examination of the relevant Articles of the Constitution is that all public servants other than those who are excepted expressly by the provisions of the Constitution hold office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be and that no law or rule passed or framed under Art The police officers of the subordinate ranks are not expressly excluded from the operation of the pleasure tenure by any provision of the Constitution they therefore hold office during the pleasure of the Governor and the only protection that they can claim are the two guarantees contained in Art The rules therefore that are framed under would thus be of two kinds namely those which define the jurisdiction of four grades of officers to inflict a particular kind of punishment on a particular police officer of the subordinate rank they will be mandatory for they go to the root of the jurisdiction of the officer exercising the power but even these rules cannot go against the provisions of Art may be carried out and if there are any such rules they will be mandatory Before however we come to itself we may dispose of another argument namely that the four grades of officers who have the power to dismiss under are exercising the statutory authority vested in them and are not exercising the Governor pleasure of dismissal under Art and therefore their action in dismissing an officer is subject to all the rules framed for their guidance Thus it is open to the Governor to delegate his power of dismissal to officers subordinate to him but even when those officers exercise the power of dismissal the Governor is indirectly exercising it through those to whom he has delegated it and it is still the pleasure of the Governor to dismiss which is being exercised by the subordinate officers to whom it may be delegated Further though the Governor may delegate his executive power of dismissal at pleasure to subordinate officers he still retains in himself the power to dismiss at pleasure if he thinks fit in a particular case in spite of the delegation Therefore even where a subordinate officer is exercising the power to dismiss he is indirectly exercising the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure and so his power of dismissal can only be subject to the same limitations to which the power of the Governor would be subject if he exercised it directly and that it had been conferred on those police officers by law In our opinion that makes no difference to the nature of the power which is being exercised by these four grades of officers under the Police Act gives power to <ORG> or the legislature of a State by law to confer functions on any authority subordinate to the Governor When the function of dismissal is conferred by law on any authority subordinate to the Governor it is nothing more than delegation of the Governor executive power to dismiss at pleasure by means of law and stands in no better position than a delegation by the Governor himself under Art the officer exercising the power of dismissal is only indirectly exercising the Governor power to dismiss at pleasure and his order of dismissal has the same effect as the order of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure We may in this connection refer once again to the case of <NAME> where the dismissal was by an officer subordinate to the Governor of Madras but that dismissal was also held to be an indirect exercise I of His Majesty pleasure to dismiss and that is why it was held that if XIV of the Classification Rules was not complied with a public servant had no right of action against an order dismissing him at His Majesty pleasure Therefore whenever a subordinate officer exercises the power to dismiss whether that power is delegated by the Governor or is delegated under a law made under Art or under an existing law analogous to that he is merely exercising indirectly the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure and his action is subject only to the two guarantees contained in Art The fact therefore that the police officer in this case made the order of dismissal by virtue of will make no difference and he will be deemed to be exercising the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure by delegation to him by law of that power We may add that even where there is delegation by law of the power of the Governor to dismiss at pleasure the power of the Governor himself to act directly and dismiss at pleasure cannot be taken away by that law for that power he derives from Art This rule as we have already indicated provides that if there is any complaint of the commission of any cognizable crime by a police officer it must be registered in the relevant police station under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure and investigated in the manner provided by that Chapter The police officer making an investigation under Chapter XIV is not bound to examine the person against whom he is investigating though there is nothing to prevent him from doing so which says that a public servant shall not be dismissed without giving him a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Therefore not being meant for the purpose of carrying out the object of Art It appears to us that the object of is that the authority concerned should first make a preliminary inquiry to find out if there is a case against the officer complained against either to proceed in a court or to take departmental action But that in our opinion is what would happen in any case of complaint against a public servant in any department of Government No authority entitled to take action against a public servant would straightaway proceed to put the case in court or to hold a departmental inquiry It seems to us axiomatic if a complaint is received against any public servant of any department that the authority concerned would first always make some kind of a preliminary inquiry to satisfy itself whether there is any case for taking action at all but that is in our opinion for the satisfaction of the authority and has nothing to do with the protection afforded to a public servant under Art will be given to the public servant after the the authority has satisfied itself by preliminary inquiry that there is a case for taking action may come into play it appears that the Governor has exercised his pleasure in this case inasmuch as he dismissed the revisional application made to him by the respondent There appears no reason to hold that the Governor exercises his pleasure only when he passes the original order of dismissal but not otherwise This brings us to the last point which has been urged in this case and that is whether there was substantial compliance with We have already pointed out that there was no strict compliance with as no case wag registered on the complaint of <NAME> and no investigation was made under Chapter XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure But there is no doubt in this case that before the Superintendent of Police gave the charge sheet to the respondent in November which was the beginning of the departmental proceedings against the respondent he made a preliminary inquiry into the complaint of <NAME> and was satisfied that there was a case for proceeding against the respondent departmentally In these circumstances it appears to us that the spirit of was substantially complied with and action was only taken against the respondent when on a preliminary inquiry the Superintendent of Police was satisfied that departmental action was necessary In these circumstances we are of opinion that which in our opinion is directory was substantially complied with in spirit and therefore the subsequent departmental proceedings cannot be held to be illegal simply because there was no strict compliance with We would therefore allow the appeal BY COURT In accordance with the opinion of the majority this appeal is dismissed with costs
