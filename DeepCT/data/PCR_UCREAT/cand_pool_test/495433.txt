Since the Calcium Carbide listed under entry AA of the Schedule is assessable to duty ad valorem its value would be deemed to be the cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality is sold or capable of being sold Similarly the residuary entry making assessable to duty all other goods not elsewhere specified manufactured in a factory but not excluded by the said item is also not applicable Since however the petitioner started using Calcium Carbide manufactured at its factory for the manufacture of acetylene gas in their acetylene gas plant This intermediary product is not known to the market as calcium carbide for the following reasons It is not goods as known to the market The petitioner therefore seeks by this writ petition to get these orders quashed This product was actually sold in the market till by the petitioner and even thereafter is form and is placed in small trolly trays where it is allowed to cool and solidify Is the calcium carbide produced by the petitioner goods The question has three aspects material economic and legal It will then have utility and exchangeability In other words it will have a meaning for the market In the absence of actual evidence it cannot however be said if the substance manufactured by the petitioner can be called in its material and economic senses Carbide of Calcium and whether it can be saleable as such This lends substance to the view that Calcium Carbide is not goods unless it is marketable There is no denial by the respondents of this assertion The definition covers the present case because the calcium carbide is manufactured in one part of the factory while the acetylene gas is manufactured in another part thereof It cannot be said therefore that the so called calcium carbide made by the petitioner is removed from the factory in which it is made For the above reasons the writ petition succeeds the impugned orders of the Superintendent dated th January of the appellate Collector dated th November and of <ORG> dated th September are quashed
