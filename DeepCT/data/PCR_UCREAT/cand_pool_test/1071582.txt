Their complaint is that an application made by them to the Controller under Section of the Rent Act for a certificate certifying the standard rent of the said premises has been dismissed contrary to the terms of the section which oblige the Controller to fix the standard rent and to certify the same In my opinion upon the question of merits there is no answer to the applicants It appears that in Hare Street there is a large building which is numbered and and there is some confusion on the part of many people as to which part of the whole building is properly designated by one or other of these numerals It appears however that there is no doubt at all as to the rooms which were let to the applicants Easily ascertainable The Rent Controller in the course of his judgment says From the above it will be seen that there is no satisfactory evidence upon the record to prove the number of the premises comprising the three rooms let out to the applicants whether the number of the premises is and or and or and Hare Streets On this very ground the suit fails He also states that there is no satisfactory evidence before him to show what the rent of these identical rooms was in November The judgment concludes by saying that in the circumstances stated above as there is a confusion in the number of premises of which the rent is required to be standardized I dismiss this application In these circumstances it matters nothing whatsoever whether the premises in question have got three numbers or one number or have got no number at all and there is no justification for the Rent Controller refusal to comply with Section of the Calcutta Rent Act By the terms of Section the Controller may fix the standard rent at such amount as he deems just in any of a series of cases and one of the cases in which he may act in that manner is thus defined where for any reason any difficulty arises in giving effect to this Act For these reasons I do not think that there can be any serious question that if I have jurisdiction to do so I should send the case back to the Rent Controller with a direction to hear and determine the application according to law I propose to deal with this matter fully and carefully both out of respect to Mr <NAME> argument and because I think his client is entitled to this but in my opinion it is not true that in the end the question has been decided upon a wrong footing and it is a question on which though with some difficulty I incline to the opinion that the decision of <ORG> is right By Section when the Controller has given a decision fixing the standard rent and in that event only a certain right is given to the parties It is not what is technically known as revision or reference and it does not seem to me exactly the same thing as appeal by way of re hearing means in England As regards the two classes of Courts that are mentioned in Section two features are clear first that the decision shall be final secondly in addition to a general power to make Rules to carry out the purposes of the Act <ORG> has a particular power to make Rules regulating the procedure of these Courts This power must doubtless be read with Section It may be argued that <ORG> has superintendence over any <ORG> because it has power to alter the order and so to give a power of reference to any <ORG> Beyond this argument which in reference to special statutory <ORG>s unknown to the Code seems very precarious I can see nothing in the Code which even promises to be of any assistance on the present question unless it be that a comparison between Sections and appears to show that a <ORG> may be subordinate within the meaning of the Code in a purely administrative sense Mr <NAME> in support of the Rule that all other <ORG> of civil jurisdiction are subordinate to <ORG> and under its appellate jurisdiction in a wide sense unless the <ORG> has expressly provided to the contrary contended it As a general proposition applicable to Bengal it seems to me that on the face of the Act of and the Letters Patent no proposition so pimple and wide can possibly be correct As the present case arises within the Ordinary Original Jurisdiction it may be said that this principle was implicit in the authority of the Supreme <ORG> and that if so it is continued by Section of the Act of and by the Government of India Act The Act to begin with applies only to Calcutta in the sense of Municipal Calcutta and the word Calcutta throughout the Act has that particular meaning I will refer first to the cases under the Rent Act Act of where the order assailed was made under Section of Act There was no complaint that the <ORG> of limited jurisdiction had exceeded its authority The point was that the <ORG> had refused to do something on the ground that it had no power In that case the judgment of Mr Justice <NAME> showed by its reference to cases in which no appeal lies to the Judge that there is no reason to attribute the decision to any wider principle than I have mentioned wider language was used in <NAME> <NAME> Though a provision that the Commissioner shall be the High <ORG> has this effect Darbari Panjiara Bhathi Roy Ind If a case should arise by reason of an extension of the are under the Calcutta Rent Act in which <ORG> should have jurisdiction a question would then emerge which the cases I have been referring to do not answer The present question must it seems to me be decided ultimately upon consideration whether the giving of a new jurisdiction to the President is to be regarded as a new jurisdiction conferred on an existing <ORG> or to be regarded as the setting Up of a new <ORG> for a new purpose The <ORG> or the President have no general jurisdiction at all On the question whether there is one <ORG> from which in one jurisdiction an appeal lays to this <ORG> or two <ORG>s which should be regarded as absolutely separate I have come to the conclusion that the decision of <ORG> has all the common sense of the matter even if it may be doubted whether it has all the strict logic on its side After all the President for some purposes is the Judge and is the <ORG> appeals within the Calcutta Improvement Act lie mostly from his decisions and in view of he fact that appeals from a Rent Controller decisions may come as occasion arises either the Civil <ORG>s of the District or in Calcutta to the President I am in no way prepared to hold that an opinion which has been entertained by some four or five Judges of this <ORG> is not the better opinion For these reasons or perhaps I should say in these circumstances the Rule will be made absolute with costs
