The main questions to be determined in this appeal are whether the first respondent defendant hereinafter referred to as the responded is the rightful trustee of the temples of Malleeswara and Kesavaperumal situated in Black Town if so whether the suit in so far as it relates to the charge of neglect of duty alleged against him is unsustainable because no leave was obtained under Section of the Religious Endowments Act XX of and whether the respondent has been guilty of neglect of duty calling for notice at the hands of the <ORG> His son <NAME> junior succeeded him held the management up to the year and was succeeded by his younger brother <NAME> who died in He left a will whereby he appointed his own sister <NAME> and her husband <NAME> as his succeeding trustees and authorized them to appoint their own successors and thus diverted the devolution of the office from the family of <NAME> senior into the hands of persona who had no right thereto He held the office for twenty years and by his will appointed the respondent one of <NAME> senior great grandsons as his successor The first contention on behalf of the respondent was that granting for argument there was a vacancy on <NAME> death as urged for the appellants plaintiffs Nos to and Nos to the right of management reverted to the heirs of <NAME> senior as he was the founder It was next urged on behalf of the respondent that his appointment by <NAME> should be upheld on the ground that it was a transfer of the office to a person who being a member of the family of <NAME> senior and also in the line of heirs would have been entitled to succeed to the office of trustee had the right of the family not been extinguished by lapse of time it would seem as urged by Sir <NAME> not unreasonable to hold that where a person who had no right to the office of a trustee according to the rule of devolution established by the founder acquires a title to the office by prescription but restores it to one who except for the transferor prescriptive title could have taken the office according to the rules laid down by the founder such transfer should be treated as an exception to the general doctrine that a trusteeship is not assignable subject of course to the condition that no corrupt inducement has entered into the transaction and the interests of the trusts are not likely to be prejudicially affected That ground is that the respondent is a rightful trustee having been appointed by one who had acquired a valid title to the trusteeship with power to appoint a successor On the contrary <NAME> took possession of the office under a will which contained a provision for the appointment of a successor to herself and acting under that provision she appointed <NAME> giving him at the same time power to appoint his own successor When they exercised their powers of appointment they exorcised them as an incident to their office of trustee And such an estate being well known to and recognized by law there is no reason for holding that such a trusteeship should not be prescribed for or that <NAME> and <NAME> did not prescribe for it There <ORG> held that a person who acquired a right to a watan by adverse possession took the property attached thereto subject to the restriction incident to the tenure that an alienation of such property by the watandar had no effect beyond his life It must be held that such possession confers on the possessor the right of a mortgagee with power to sell and not minus such power Among the books to be so kept for the examination by worshippers there shall be a register showing the various immoveable properties belonging to the institution as also all the valuable moveable properties inclusive of jewels Either party may if necessity arises apply for further orders as to the manner in which the <ORG> should carry out the directions contained in the decree herein
