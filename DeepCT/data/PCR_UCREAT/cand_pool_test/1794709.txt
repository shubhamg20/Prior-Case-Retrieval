The respondent No the contractor approached the petitioner to refer the disputes to arbitration On th August the petitioner made an application before the arbitrator under section of the Act with the request to state the matter before him for the opinion of the <ORG> as special case Once the arbitrator enters on an arbitration he must not be guilty of any act which can possibly be construed as indicative of partiality or unfairness It is not a question of the effect which a misconduct on his part had in fact upon the result of the proceeding but of what effect it might possibly have produced It is not enough to show that even if there was misconduct on his part the award was unaffected by it and was in reality just the arbitrator must not do anything which is not in itself fair and impartial The purity of administration requires that the party to the proceedings should not have apprehension that the authority is biased and is likely to decide against the party but it is equally true that it is not every suspicion felt by a party which must lead to the conclusion that the authority hearing the proceedings is biased as held by the High <ORG> It cannot be and should never be in a judicial or quasi judicial proceeding that a party who is a party to the appointment could seek the removal of an appointed authority or an arbitrator on the ground that the appointee being his nominee had not acceded to his prayer about conduct of the proceedings There was no substance found in the alleged grounds of apprehension of bias examined in this light The petitioner insisted that the arbitrator should record the minutes setting out the entire oral arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner In any case it would be open to the petitioner to file a petition under section of the Act if the petitioner felt that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to entertain the reference The third circumstance was that the petitioner had filed an application under section of the Act calling upon the arbitrator to state a special case for the opinion of the <ORG> and the failure of the arbitrator to raise the question of law was indicative of bias Section confers power on the arbitrator to state a special case but it does not make it obligatory on the part of the arbitrator to state a special case as soon as the party desires it The <ORG> agreed with the High <ORG> that there is no rule which requires that the length of the argument should depend upon the magnitude of the claim made Another ground made was that there was a loss of confidence There was no reasonable ground for such a loss of confidence There was no reasonable ground of any suspicion of bias of the arbitrator This is a petition for leave to appeal under Article of the Constitution from the judgment and order of the learned Judge of <ORG> dated nd February By the impugned judgment the learned Judge has rejected the application for revocation of the authority of respondent No <NAME> sole arbitrator under sections and of the Arbitration Act hereinafter called the Act In order to appreciate the contentions raised it may be stated that <ORG> which was the petitioner in <ORG> and is the petitioner herein had invited tenders for the work of construction of terminal building of new international passenger complex Phase II at the Bombay Airport at Sahar Bombay Mohinder Singh and Company a partnership firm having registered office at Delhi and carrying on business in Bombay submitted a tender and it was accepted for the value of Rs A formal agreement followed on nd January It may be reiterated however that there was provision in the agreement for settlement of disputes through appointment of sole arbitrator under clause of the Conditions of Contract by the competent authority On th October the petitioner by its letter noted the fact that it has sent the minutes of the meeting with regard to the proceedings held on th and th September to the arbitrator as directed by him The petitioner approached <ORG> with the instant application The objections to the jurisdiction raised by the petitioner were that the claim made in the second and third references were barred by principles analogous to Order II Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure the Chief Engineer had no authority to refer the disputes to the arbitration the claims made by respondent No were beyond the stipulated period of days and therefore were not arbitrable and the time for declaring the award having expired the Arbitrator could not continue with the arbitration proceedings Thereafter the petitioner made an application before the arbitrator under section of the Act calling upon the arbitrator to state special case for the opinion of <ORG> on certain alleged legal objections The arbitrator rejected the preliminary objections by his order dated rd October and also the application for stating special case to <ORG> under section of the Act It was sought to be urged that the petitioner had lost confidence in the sole arbitrator and was apprehensive that the arbitrator was biased against the petitioner It is well said that once the arbitrator enters in an arbitration the arbitrator must not be guilty of any act which can possibly be construed as indicative of partiality or unfairness It is not a question of the effect which misconduct on his part had in fact upon the result of the proceeding but of what effect it might possibly have produced It is not enough to show that even if there was misconduct on his part the award was unaffected by it and was in reality just arbitrator must not do anything which is not in itself fair and impartial Lord <NAME> in The King De Vesci The Justices of Queen Country I observed as follows By bias I understand a real likelihood of an operative prejudice whether conscious or unconscious There must in my opinion be reasonable evidence to satisfy us that there was a real likelihood of bias I do not think that their vague suspicions of whimsical capricious and unreasonable people should be made a standard to regulate our action here It might be a different matter if suspicion rested on reasonable grounds was reasonably generated and but certainly mere flimsy grounds elusively generated and morbid suspicions should not be permitted to form a ground of decision But we agree with the learned Judge of the High <ORG> that it is equally true that it is not every suspicion felt by a party which must lead to the conclusion that the authority hearing the proceedings is biased While on this point we reiterate that learned counsel appearing for the petitioner in his submissions made a strong plea that his client was hurt and had apprehension because the arbitrator being the appointee of his client was not acceding to the request of his client which the petitioner considered to be reasonable We have heard this submission with certain amount of discomfiture because it cannot be and we hope it should never be in a judicial or a quasi judicial proceeding a party who is a party to the appointment could seek the removal of an appointed authority or arbitrator on the ground that appointee being his nominee had not acceded to his prayer about the conduct of the proceeding In the aforesaid light if the alleged grounds of apprehension of bias are examined we find no substance in them The learned Judge found that there was no merit in this complaint After th September the petitioner advocate orally made submissions that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to entertain the dispute In spite of it the petitioner insisted that the arbitrator should record the minutes setting out the entire oral arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioner In any case it will be open to the petitioner to file any petition in the <ORG> under section of the Act if the petitioner felt that the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to entertain the reference but the petitioner did not choose to adopt that course and proceeded to argue for a considerable length of time the issue of jurisdiction before the arbitrator The third circumstances was that the petitioner had filed application under section of the Act calling upon the arbitrator to state a special case for the opinion of the <ORG> on the question of law and the failure of the arbitrator to raise this question of law was indicative of the bias Section confers power on the arbitrator to state special case but it does not make it obligatory on the part of the arbitrator to state a special case as soon as the party desires to do so We agree with the learned Judge that there is no rule which requires that the length of argument should depend upon the magnitude of the claim made There was another ground sought to be made before us that there was a loss of confidence We find no reasonable ground for such loss of confidence It appears that the matter was adjourned thereafter but by merely making an application for adjournment and refusing to attend the arbitration proceeding a party cannot forestall arbitration proceeding There is a great deal of legitimate protest at the delay in judicial and quasi judicial proceeding Having given our anxious consideration to the grounds alleged in this application we find no ground to conclude that there could be any ground for reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner for revocation of the authority of the arbitrator appointed by the petitioner itself We are satisfied from the facts mentioned hereinbefore that there is no reasonable ground of any suspicion in the mind of the reasonable man of bias of the arbitrator
