The respondent who had been a member of <ORG> since instituted the present suit on July against the Secretary of <ORG> for India challenging the validity of an order by the latter dated August which purported to remove the respondent from <ORG> The High Commissioner for India and the High Commissioner for Pakistan have accepted that they should be treated us appellants in place of the Secretary of <ORG> for India by virtue of Section In the plaint the respondent claimed a declaration that the order of removal was ultra vires of the defendant that the order was not passed in due process of law and was wrongful illegal and of no consequence whatever that he was still a member of <ORG> and had a right to continue in it and to hold office from which he was removed by the illegal order of the defendant and that as a member of <ORG> he was entitled to all rights secured to him by the covenant and rules and regulations issued from time to time by the appropriate authority After trial <ORG> on March granted the present respondent a decree to the extent of granting a declaration that the order removing him from office was wrongful void illegal and inoperative and that he was still a member of <ORG> <ORG> also gave a certificate under Section of the Government of India Act that the case involved substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Act of The main questions raised in this appeal relate to the proper construction of Section of the Government of India Act and their Lordships propose to deal with these in the first instance In September the respondent received a letter from the Judicial Commissioner enclosing a letter from the Chief Secretary to <ORG> informing the Judicial Commissioner that <ORG> had decided to hold a departmental enquiry under Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules into the conduct of the respondent while stationed at Multan during and that eight charges had been framed against the respondent of which copies were enclosed Near the end there were two paragraphs interposed which clearly related to all the charges and were as follows That the above facts and his failure to offer any sufficient explanation up to the present are sufficient to prove that he had abused his position as an officer entrusted with power of appointment on behalf of the <ORG> to show favour to a relation of his to the detriment of other officials serving under him in contravention both of the recognised principles governing the conduct of Government servants as well as of the express orders of Government and that he further abused his position as an officer entrusted with powers of discipline over other officers of the <ORG> to persecute various persons who sought to protect their own interests in a legitimate manner Mr <NAME> examined the respondent on June in course of which the respondent pleaded guilty to the first two charges and without any further examination of witnesses he made his report on August In view of the opinion which their Lordships have formed as to the proper construction of Section of the Act of it is unnecessary to consider in further detail the validity of the enquiries held by Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> and whether the respondent was afforded a reasonable opportunity thereat of answering the charges The respondent made representations to the <ORG> protesting against the procedure of the enquiry and submitting arguments on the merits It is not disputed that the learned Chief Justice has correctly stated the respondent position at this time as follows Whatever representations were made it is clear that at no time before his removal from the service was Mr <NAME> allowed to see the reports of either Mr <NAME> or Mr <NAME> nor was he informed that either the Punjab Government or <ORG> or <ORG> or the Secretary of <ORG> were definitely proposing on the basis of these reports to remove him from the service But no opportunity to show cause against dismissal was given to him after dismissal had passed from being a possible punishment to the punishment proposed and recommended At no time was he given an opportunity before dismissal of making representations against the accuracy of facts found by Mr <NAME> or Mr <NAME> in their reports or against the adverse deductions drawn against him particularly by Mr <NAME> Except as expressly provided by this Act every person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> in India or holds any civil post under the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed from the service of His Majesty by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Provided that this sub section shall not apply a where a person is dismissed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge or where an authority empowered to dismiss a person or reduce him in rank is satisfied that for some reason to be recorded by that authority in writing it is not reasonably practicable to give to that person an opportunity of showing cause Notwithstanding that a person holding a civil post under the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure any contract under which a person not being a member of a Civil service of the <ORG> in India is appointed under this Act to hold such a post may if the Governor General or as the case may be the Governor deems it necessary in order to secure the service of a person having special qualifications provide for the payment to him of compensation if before the expiration of an agreed period that post is abolished or he is for reasons not connected with any misconduct on his part required to vacate that post st Is Sub section of Section qualified by Sub section ndly Is Sub section mandatory or permissive and rdly What is the proper construction of the words in sub section the action proposed to be taken in regard to him On the other hand Sub section of Section begins Notwithstanding that a person holding a civil post under the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure which is clearly expressed as an exception but the statutory provision which follows does not affect the terminability of the office It provides for a payment of compensation in certain events but does not curtail His Majesty power to terminate at His pleasure Subject to the provisions of this Act and of rules made thereunder every person in the civil service of the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure and may be employed in any manner required by a proper authority within the scope of his duty but no person in that service may be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed and the Secretary of <ORG> in Council may except so far as he may provide by rules to the contrary reinstate any person in that service who has been dismissed The later part of the sub section gives a limited right of appeal which is not relevant to the present purpose Under Sub section of Section the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> is empowered to make rules for regulating the classification of the civil services in India the methods of their recruitment their conditions of service pay and allowances and discipline and conduct Rule provides Without prejudice to the provisions of the Public <ORG> Inquiries Act no order of dismissal removal or reduction shall be passed on a member of a <ORG> other than an order based on facts which have led to his conviction in a criminal Court unless he has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and has been afforded an adequate opportunity of defending himself The grounds on which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges which shall be communicated to the person charged together with a statement of the allegations on which each charge is based and of any other circumstances which it is proposed to take into consideration in passing orders on the case At that enquiry oral evidence shall be heard as to such of the allegations as are not admitted and the person charged shall be entitled to cross examine the witnesses called as he may wish provided that the officer conducting the enquiry may for special and sufficient reason to be recorded in writing refuse to call a witness All or any of the provisions of the rule may in exceptional cases for special and sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing be waived where there is a difficulty in observing exactly the requirements of the rule and those requirements can be waived without injustice to the person charged It is to be observed that the provisions of Sub section of Section of the Act of are made subject to the provisions of this Act and of rules made thereunder that it makes express provision corresponding to Sub sections and of Section of but no express provision corresponding to Sub section of that matter was left to Rule Lord <NAME> in delivering the judgment of the <ORG> said at It is manifest that the stipulation or proviso as to dismissal is itself of statutory force and stands on a footing quite other than any matters of rule which are of infinite variety and can be changed from time to time it was held by the same <ORG> that failure to comply with the rules made under Sub section of Section of did not give any right of action Section and the rules make careful provision for redress of grievances by administrative process and it is to be observed that Sub section in conclusion reaffirms the supreme authority of the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> over the civil service These considerations have irresistibly led their Lordships to the conclusion that no such right of action as is contended for by the appellant exists They regard the terms of the section as containing a statutory and solemn assurance that the tenure of office though at pleasure will not be subject to capricious or arbitrary action but will be regulated by rule Contrasting the provisions of Section of with the provisions of Section of their Lordships have no difficulty in holdingin agreement with both <ORG> and <ORG> the provision as to a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed is now put on the same footing as the provision now in Sub section of Section which was the subject of decision in <NAME> case and that it is no longer resting on rules alterable from time to time but is mandatory and necessarily qualifies the right of the <ORG> recognised in Sub section of Section of The third question seeks the proper construction of the phrase A reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him In their judgment <ORG> said The plaintiff contention is that this opportunity should have been afforded to him after the finding of the enquiring officer had been considered and the punishment decided upon Eight charges were served on the plaintiff and at the end he was asked to show cause why he should not be dismissed removed or reduced or subjected to such other disciplinary action as the competent authority may think fit to enforce for breach of Government Rules and conduct unbecoming <ORG> The plaintiff contention that there should be two enquiries the first to establish that he had been guilty and the second to determine what should be the appropriate punishment and that in each stage he should have reasonable and independent opprotunities to defend and show cause does not appear to be correct or intended by the <ORG> In <ORG> <NAME> agreed with the conclusion of <ORG> on this question but the majority of the Court held a contrary view which is expressed by the learned Chief Justice as follows It does however seem to us that the sub section requires that as and when an authority is definitely proposing to dismiss or reduce in rank a member of the civil service he shall be so told and he shall be given an opportunity of putting his case against the proposed action and as that opportunity has to be a reasonable opportunity it seems to us that the section requires not only notification of the action proposed but of the grounds on which the authority is proposing that the action should be taken and that the person concerned must then be given a reasonable time to make his representations against the proposed action and the grounds on which it is proposed to be taken In our judgment each case will have to turn on its own facts but the real point of the subsection is in our judgment that the person who is to be dismissed or reduced must know that that punishment is proposed as the punishment for certain acts or omissions on his part and must be told the grounds on which it is proposed to take such action and must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause why such punishment should not be imposed Rule is concerned that the civil servant shall be informed of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and to afford him an adequate opportunity of defending himself against charges which have to be reduced to writing this is in marked contrast to the statutory provision of a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him It is on that stage being reached that the statute gives the civil servant the opportunity for which Sub section makes provision <ORG> altered the finding of <ORG> and made a declaration that the plaintiff Mr <NAME> was wrongly dismissed from <ORG> on June and has further ordered that <ORG> aforesaid do take such action in regard to any application duly made by or on behalf of Mr <NAME> for leave to amend to claim damages as to <ORG> shall seem right and they remitted the case to <ORG> It is sufficient to refer to the judgment of Lord <NAME> in the Scottish case of <NAME> The Admiralty in which the learned Judge after reviewing the various authorities states These authorities deal only with the power of the <ORG> to dismiss a public servant but they appear to me to establish conclusively certain important points It is enough that the servant is a public servant and that public policy no matter on what ground it is based demands the qualification If these conclusions are justified by the authorities to which I have referred then it would seem to follow that the rule based on public policy which has been enforced against military servants of the <ORG> and which prevents such servants suing the <ORG> for their pay on the assumption that their only claim is on the bounty of the <ORG> and not for a contractual debt must equally apply to every public servantsee Leaman King <NAME> Lord Advocate and other cases there referred to It also follows that this qualification must be read as an implied condition into every contract between the <ORG> and a public servant with the effect that in terms of their contract they have no right to their remuneration which can be enforced in a civil court of justice and that their only remedy under their contract lies in an appeal of an official or political kind In the present case there is no obligation as to pay in the respondent covenant as already mentioned The respondent sought to establish a statutory right to recover arrears of pay by action in the civil Court he made reference to certain sections of the Government of India Act viz He also referred to Section of the Government of India Act of which by Sub section provides the same remedies against the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> as might have been had against <ORG> if the Government of India Act and the Act of had not been passed but it has been settled ever since <NAME> <ORG> Bing Their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that the judgment and order appealed from should be varied by substituting in place of the declaration made therein a declaration that the order of August purporting to dismiss the respondent from <ORG> was void and inoperative and that the respondent remained a member of <ORG> at the date of the institution of the present action on July that the order for a remit to <ORG> should be set aside and that otherwise the judgment and order should be affirmed As prescribed by the Order in Council granting special leave the costs of the respondent will be paid by the appellant as between solicitor and client Their Lordships are not disposed to accede to the application made by the respondent during the hearing at which he was represented by counsel to be allowed the costs of his coming over to this country from India
