of the Sugar Control order fixing ex factory prices for sugar factories specified in the notification on the ground that the method adopted in fixing prices of sugar manufactured in various States was not correct HELD Price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative measure even though it may be based upon objective criteria found in a report or other material It could not therefore give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural justice has not been followed in fixing the price Reasonableness for purposes of judging whether there was an excess of power or an arbitrary exercise of it is really the demonstration of a reasonable nexus between matters which are taken into account in exercising a power and the purpose of exercise of that power The appellants have not asserted that they incurred losses or did not make reasonable profits It cannot be said that the <ORG> in fixing the price of sugar in took into consideration any extraneous matters or that it acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in doing so The expression have regard to only obliges the <ORG> to consider as relevant data the material to which it must have regard Furthermore the only adjustment provided for is before a fixation of the estimated Price having regard to the basis provided by the relevant schedule but there is no obligation whatsoever cast upon the <ORG> Items to be taken into account are broadly stated It is not possible to read into clause an obligation to fix the price either on an <ORG> basis or five region basis It is enough if the basis adopted is not shown to be so patently unreasonable is to be in excess of the power to fix price Mere is no allegation made by the appellants that the action of the <ORG> They challenged the notification dated issued by <ORG> under clause of the Sugar Control Order fixing ex factory prices for sugar factories specified in the notification But before us the appellants have confined their arguments to contentions based on the correctness of the method adopted in fixing prices of sugar manufactured in various States and the alleged failure of <ORG> to take into account the fact that there was an initial fixation of prices of sugar by a notification dated followed by a final fixation on We are therefore lot concerned now with any question relating to the validity of clause of the Sugar Control Order under which the notifications were issued Where the price or the maximum price has been so fixed no person shall sell or purchase or agree to sell or purchase any sugar at a price in excess of that fixed under sub clause Provided that the price at which sugar may be sold for delivery otherwise than ex factory shall not exceed the price or the maximum price as the case may be fixed under sub clause for sale ex factory plus such charges in respect of transport to any town or any specified area and other incidental charges as may be fixed by the concerned State Government or by any officer authorised in this behalf by <ORG> or <ORG> in accordance with the instructions issued by <ORG> in this behalf from time to time The expression having regard to only obliges the <ORG> to consider as relevant date material to which it must have regard See Ryots of Garabandho and other Villages Zemin dar of <ORG> Furthermore it should be noted that the only adjustment provided for is before a fixation of the estimated price having regard to the basis provided by the relevant schedule but there is no obligation whatsoever cast upon the <ORG> to make any adjustment to compensate for losses due to any previous erroneous fixations The grievance of the appellant <ORG> was that the Government had really divided the country into zones and that it had while doing so taken into consideration the conversion charges on the basis of five zones putting Haryana in the same zone as Madhya Pradesh Therefore we do not think that these assertions could prove any inequitable treatment meted out to the Haryana manufacturers of sugar in any case no breach of a mandatory duty which could justify the issue of a writ of mandamus was established Here the heads of costs are cost excluding basic cost of cane but including extra cost on cane packing grade differential selling expenses dearness allowance escalation for points But from both sets of schedules we find that there is considerable freedom given to the <ORG> in choosing what could properly determine the fair price to be fixed Items to be taken into account are broadly stated The criteria are elastic enough to either include or exclude some of the items put forward on behalf of the applicants as necessary to be taken into account There is nothing in the first set of schedules to indicate that excise duty must be taken into account in determining the cost of production It could more properly be taken into consideration in determining nit profits than in calculating cost of manufacture be that on particular items the <ORG> may have reasons to regard data collected in one region to be unreliable We cannot read into clause an obligation to fix the price either on an <ORG> basis or five region basis It is enough if the basis adopted is not shown to be so patently unreasonable as to be in excess of the power to fix price In any case the appellants objections could form the subject matter of representations which could have been made to the <ORG> by each of the parties affected Price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative measure even trough it may be based upon objective criteria found in a report or other material SupCI it could not therefore give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural justice has not been followed in fixing the price Reasonableness for purposes of judging whether there was an excess of power or an arbitrary exercise of it is really the demonstration of a reasonable nexus between the matters which are taken into account in exercising a power and the purposes of exercise of that power If the prices of yarn or cloth are fixed in such a way to enable the manufacturer or producer to recover his cost of production and secure a reasonable margin of profit no aspect of infringement of a fundamental right can be said to arise It was then said at In determining the reasonableness of a restriction imposed by law in the field of industry trade or commerce it has to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those who are engaged in these are alleging loss after the imposition of law will not render the law unreasonable In that context it said at page A unit wise fixation of price as suggested by counsel and payment on the basis of a price so worked out would mean perpetuating inefficiency and mismanagement and depriving the partial control policy of the incentives for economy and efficiency inherent in it We are therefore satisfied both on the language of the sub section the background in which it was enacted and the mischief the legislature sought to remedy through its working that the true construction is that a fair price has to be determined In respect of the entire produce ensuring to the industry a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar But this does not mean that Government can fix any arbitrary price or a price fixed on extraneous considerations or such that it does not secure a reasonable return on the capital employed in the industry In the cases before us the appellants have not asserted that they incurred losses or did not make reasonable profits We are not satisfied that the <ORG> in fixing the price of sugar in to which the Writ Petitions in the appeals before us are confined took into consideration any extraneous matters or that it acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in doing so in <ORG> case which is accepted by both sides as the basic or the most comprehensive case from the point of view of relevant material on record the counter affidavit filed by <NAME> Joint Secretary <ORG> gives the matters taken into account for the impugned price fixation as follows With reference to paragraphs and of the Writ Petition I say that the correct facts are as follows a The fixation of ex factory price of sugar is necessarily to be done initially about the time when the crushing season starts or when the deliveries from new season production commence It is incorrect to state as has been done in paragraphs and of the Writ Petition that clause of the Sugar Control Order makes provision for any adjustment in respect of deliveries of sugar made prior to the date of any notification issued thereunder It is also incorrect to state as has been done by the petitioner that the price which is so fixed under the Sugar Control Orders if fixed on the basis of the previous year results The statement by the petitioner that the price is fixed by <ORG> on the basis of the previous year working is on the face of it incorrect as in such an event there would be no necessity of making any estimate for the purpose of price fixation Clause gives <ORG> power to fix the maximum sugar prices by notification in the official Gazette from time to time it was therefore contended on behalf of <ORG> that both the notifications complied with the requirements of the Control Order because there is neither a provision for a provisional fixation to be followed by a final fixation for a season nor is any period of time between one fixation and another specified Although the passage set out above primarily refers to other matters which are to be taken into account in determining the ex factory selling price of white sugar yet it is relied upon by Mr <NAME> inasmuch as the terms year to year in the same zone and determined annually occur here As <ORG> pointed out it cannot be contended that the estimate of manufacturing costs land the resulting fixation of price made in the beginning of February Was wholly unrelated to the actual conditions which came to light after the working results of the crushing season as a whole were known at the end of the season No provision has been brought to our notice to indicate how the <ORG> would be responsible to manufacturers for an erroneous fixation of price at which sugar may be sold during a particular season by manufacturers to dealers who can sell it to the consumers We find it very difficult to understand how the manufacturers could claim any thing even by means of suits from dealers with whom there were no agreements providing that any variation in price to be fixed by the <ORG> will enable the manufacturers to recover the balance in case the fixation was too low It is enough to mention here that no such provision in any agreement has been brought to our notice In <ORG> case there was an understanding given in <ORG> by <ORG> that the <ORG> will pay the syndicate the balance on a redetermination of price if the price fixed by the <ORG> was found to be too low We have no doubt that undertaking exhausted itself with proceedings in <ORG> when the writ petition in appeal before us now failed There is no allegation made by the appellants that the action of the <ORG> It is well established practice that Courts do not issue writs or make declarations which are futile There is no prohibition against such fixation of price twice within a season It had no retrospective effect Nevertheless the well recognised rule that no writ or order in the nature of a Mandamus would issue when there is no failure to perform a mandatory duty applies in this country as well As a general rule the order will not be granted unless the party complained of has known what it was he was required to do so that he had the means of considering whether or not he should comply and it must be shown by evidence that there was a distinct demand of that which the party seeking the mandamus desires to enforce and that that demand was met by a refusal These appeals must be and are hereby dismissed but in the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs
