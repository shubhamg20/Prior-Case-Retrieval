The rd defendant pleaded that there was no privity between him and the plaintiff and that there was no cause of action On the findings of facts of the <ORG> below the only question for decision is whether a contract between A and to pay who is a creditor of A would without more entitle to sue We have already set out the sale deed and we think that on the terms of the sale deed there is no trust express or implied created and that the sale deed merely constitutes the vendee the agent of the vendor to pay some of his creditors A distinction has been drawn between cases where the defendant has constituted himself the agent of plaintiff to pay him a particular sum of money received from a third person and cases where there is no such agency of trust express or implied is that a stranger to the consideration cannot sustain an action on the promise made between two persons unless he has in some way intervened in the agreement There are decisions which decide that the rule of English Law as laid down in <NAME> <NAME> Jur There are other decisions which are to the effect that the principle in <NAME> <NAME> Jur There are other decisions which take a middle course and decide that the rule in <NAME> <NAME> Jur A A A mortgaged certain properties to He sold the property to and left with him sufficient money out of the consideration to redeem obtained a decree on his mortgage and as the sale proceeds were insufficient to meet his claim he applied for a personal decree against on the ground that was liable as he retained part of the consideration payable to A agreeing to pay it to It was held by <NAME> and <NAME> JJ The action is brought by a mortgagee to enforce against a purchaser of the mortgaged property an undertaking that he entered into with his vendor The mortgagee has no right to avail himself of that The purchaser entered into no contract with him and the purchaser is not personally bound to pay this mortgage debt Tae learned <NAME>udges observed The learned <NAME>udge held that as there was no privity between the plaintiff and nd defendant with regard to the mortgage Ex which was confirmed in appeal we think we may take it as settled law in Madras that a stranger to a contract cannot without more sue to enforce it It is unnecessary therefore to refer with details to cases in Madras which took the opposite view <NAME> I A In that case there was an arrangement made between the defendant and the father of the plaintiff who was then a minor on the occasion and in consideration of her marriage with the defendant son who was also a minor that a certain sum should be paid to the plaintiff for her betel nut expenses etc from the date of the marriage Their Lordships pointed out that in India where marriages were arranged during minority and contracts for the benefits of the minors were entered into by parents and guardians it would cause serious injustice if the strict rule of English Law were applied observed First it is contended on the authority of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME>ur Here the agreement executed by the defendant specifically charges immoveable property for the allowance which he binds himself to pay to the plaintiff He referred to the numerous cases on the subject Cases where on a partition a benefit is secured to the female members of the family who would be entitled in law to maintenance or cases of family settlement stand on a different footing there was a deed of partition whereby provision was made for the plaintiff maintenance and it was held that although the plaintiff was no party to the document she was entitled to sue The learned Judges held that a person who was not a party to a document but in whose favour a charge was created by such document was entitled to maintain a suit to enforce its terms either as the actual beneficiary or as the charge holder and referred to Rukhmabai <NAME> Bom I A After referring to that case and to the provisions of Hindu Law he observes All I desire to say is that I think that in view of that the provisions of law in such matters should be applied with greater flexibility than they would be applied in England and that it is quite possible to argue that such a case as this if it occurred in England would be covered by the general principle I have referred to Cases of estoppel or of novation obviously stand on a different footing and have nothing to do with the principle laid down in <NAME> <NAME> Jur it was held that where a life policy was expressed to be for the benefit of the wife of the assured she was not entitled to sue as no trust was created in her favour and she was a third party to the contract refers to the rule of English Law that if A contracts with for a benefit to be given to although that was the object and purpose of the contract may not sue on that contract unless in certain excepted cases and then refers to the excepted sases I A to suppose that in India persons who were not parties to a contract could be admitted to sue thereon except where there was an obligation in equity amounting to a trust arising out of the contract or in case of communities where marriages were contracted for minors by parents and guardians The learned Chief Justice observed But putting aside such cases I see no reason to think that the law in India contains a series of exceptions to the principle that a contract can only be sued upon as such by a party thereto It is another matter altogether to say that a person not a party to a contract may bring a suit upon the contract by reason of near relationship to the promisee where after holding that though the policy of insurance effected by the assured upon his own life was for the benefit of his wife it did not create any trust in her favour the learned Judges dealt with the question whether she could sue on the contract apart from any trust and observed It was however argued that as under Section Clause of the Contract Act the consideration might be provided by some other person the plaintiff could sue oh a policy the consideration for which was provided by her husband There is however nothing in the present case to show that the plaintiff was either the promisor of the promisee and therefore a party to the agreement There is nothing in the Act to show an intention that a person not a party to the contract can sue on it A I where their Lordships of the Privy Council held that a recital in a sale by A to that is to pay of a mortgage would give no cause of action to the mortgagee to sue The learned Judge quotes the judgment of Lord <NAME> who dismissed the appeal with the following remark Their Lordships have considered this case and they think it is clear that no personal liability was incurred by the purchasers of the equity of redemption Their Lordships therefore think that the decree of <ORG> was right and that the point made by the appellant failed It is argued that where all the parties to a contract are before the <ORG> and complete justice can be done between them there is nothing to prevent the <ORG> from giving a decree to a person although he is not a party to the contract and that this is one of the exceptions that should be grafted on the rule in <NAME> <NAME> Jur There is nor thing in the observations of <NAME> to indicate that the mere presence of parties would make the rule in <NAME> <NAME> Jur observed But apart from that where a Court has before it all persons and is in a position to do complete Justice to the case it would be straining the law to hold that the suit should fail on the ground that the defendant did not Contract with the plaintiff to pay the amount Which he contracted to pay on his behalf With respect it seems to us that if the law is that a person hot a party to a contract cannot sue on the contract though a benefit is secured to him and unless the case falls within the exceptions indicated in the cases above referred to the plaintiff has no cause of action it is no answer to say that all the parties are before the <ORG> There should be a right to relief in respect of the transaction set out is the plaint before a party can be added as defendant We do not think that there is any legal basis for holding that the mere joinder of the original parties to the contract would give the plaintiff a cause of action which does not exist before the suit
