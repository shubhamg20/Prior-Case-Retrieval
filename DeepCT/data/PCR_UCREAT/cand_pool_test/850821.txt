The request having been rejected he filed a writ petition under Art It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the first respondent not being a free person could exercise only such privileges a were conferred on him by the order of detention and the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order which regulated the terms of the respondent detention did not confer on him any privilege or right to write a book and send it out of the prison for publication HELD i It cannot be said that the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order which lays down the conditions regulating the restrictions on the liberty of a detenu conferred only certain privileges on the detenu If this argument were to be accepted it would mean that the detenu could be starved to death if there was no condition providing for giving food to the detenu As there is no condition in the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order prohibiting a detenu from writing a book or sending it for publication the State of Maharashtra in refusing to allow the same infringed the personal liberty of the first Respondent in derogation of the law whereunder he was detained of the Constitution was that the right to move <ORG> or <ORG> remained suspended during the period of emergency if a person was deprived of his personal liberty under the Defence of India Act or any rule or order made thereunder If a person was deprived of his personal liberty not under the Act or rule or order made thereunder but in contravention thereof his right to move the said courts in that regard would not be suspended Since the State Government refusal to allow publication of the first respondent book was in contravention and derogation of the law under which he was detained he had the right to move <ORG> under Art and the said <ORG> was empowered to issue an appropriate writ or direction to the said Government to act in accordance with law Thereafter he filed a petition under Art It further held that there were no rules prohibiting a detenu from sending a book outside the jail with a view to get it published The contentions of the learned Additional Solicitor General may be briefly stated thus When a person is detained he loses his freedom he is no longer a free man and therefore he can exercise only such privileges as are conferred on him by the order of detention of the Constitution as the rights enshrined in the said article are only the attributes of a free man Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the detenu raised before us the following two points a restriction of the nature imposed by the Government on the detenu can only be made by an order issued by the appropriate Government under cls In effect it said that the right to move <ORG> or <ORG> remained suspended if such a person had been deprived of his personal liberty under the Defence of India Act or any rule or order made thereunder If a person was de lived of his personal liberty not under the Act or a rule or order made thereunder but in contravention thereof his right to move the said <ORG> in that regard would not be suspended If it was in contravention of the said Rules he would have the right to approach <ORG> under Art Briefly stated the scheme of the said and I provisions is that a person can be detained if the appropriate Government is satisfied that in order to prevent him from doing the prejudicial acts mentioned in of the Rules it is necessary to detain him in prison subject to the conditions imposed in the manner prescribed in sub If that happens <ORG> in terms of Art of the Constitution can issue an appropriate writ or direction to the authority concerned to act in accordance with law There is no provision in that Order dealing with the writing or publication of books by a detenu There is therefore no restriction on the detenu in respect of that activity If a man person is free it is then and then only that he can exercise a variety of other auxiliary rights that is to say he can within certain limits speak what he likes assemble where he likes form any associations or unions move about freely as his own inclination may direct reside and settle anywhere he likes and practise any profession or carry on any occupation trade or business Relying upon these observations it is argued that freedom to publish is only a component part of that of speech and expression and that in the light of the said observations as the detenu ceased to be free in view of his detention he cannot exercise his freedom to publish his book Different reasons are given by the learned Judges fro arriving at the same conclusion Therefore it cannot be said that the said principle was accepted by all the learned Judges who took part in <NAME> case The apart there are five distinct lines of thought in the matter of reconciling Art We find it difficult to accept the argument that the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order which lays down the conditions regulating the restrictions on the liberty of a detenu conferred only certain privileges on the detenu If this argument were to be accepted it would mean that the detenu could be starved to death if there was no condition providing for giving food to the detenu As there is no condition in the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order prohibiting a detenu from writing a book or sending it for publication the State of Maharashtra infringed the personal liberty of the first respondent in derogation of the law whereunder he is detained In the view we have taken another argument advanced by Mr <NAME> namely that the restriction can only be imposed by an order made under or of the Rules and that too in strict compliance with of the Act need not be considered We do not express our view on this question one way or other
