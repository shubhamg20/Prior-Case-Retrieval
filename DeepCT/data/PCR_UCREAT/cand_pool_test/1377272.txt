Heard learned counsel on both the sides This appeal arises out of the judgment and order passed by <ORG> on th Jun in I No of the Act would not mean the record as it stands at the time of examination by the Commissioner but it means the record as it stands at the time the order in question was passed by the <ORG> The respondent firm during the previous year relevant to the assessment year had constructed a cinema theatre and in the return filed by it had shown the cost of construction at Rs Therefore the Commissioner of Income Tax issued a notice under Section of the Income Tax Act to the assessee on the ground that investment not accounted for by the assessee firm should have been brought to tax and the income Tax officer having not done so his order was erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the <ORG> The assessee preferred an appeal to <ORG> against that order At the instance of the <ORG> the question stated above was referred to <ORG> of karnataka for its opinion <ORG> ITR held that though the record contemplated by section does not mean only the order of assessment but it comprises all proceedings on which the assessment is based yet if there was some record which was not available on the date of completion of assessment that record would not form part of the order of the assessment authorities It therefore answered the question in affirmative i in favour of the assessee and against the <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the <ORG> submitted that in view of the amendments made in Section by the Finance Act and the Finance Act of the term record would mean all records relating to that proceeding available at the time of examination by the Commissioner He further submitted that even though the Valuation Report submitted by the Departmental Valuation Officer was not available to the Income Tax officer when he had passed the assessment order it became a part of the record and therefore it was open to the Commissioner to consider the same while exercising his revisional power under that section <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the assessee submitted that as the Commissioner had passed the order on rd March the amendments made in Section in and though with retrospective effect cannot have the effect of validating the order of the Commissioner which was illegal when passed She submitted that when the order was passed by the Commissioner the correct position of law was that only that record which was available to the income Tax Officer could be considered by the Commissioner for the purposes of exercising his power under Section In her submission the amendment had only limited retrospective effect If an order passed by the Commissioner under Section after st June was challenged on the ground that he had taken into consideration the material which was not available to the Income tax Officer when he had passed the assessment order then its validity had to be determined on the basis that not only all the record of that proceeding but the record relating to it was also available to the Commissioner But an order passed before st June if it was illegal for the reason that it had taken into consideration other material also then the amendment of did not have the effect of making it legal It enables the Commissioner to call for and examine the record of any proceeding under the Act and pass such order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the assessment and directing a fresh assessment if he considers that any order passed by the assessing officer is erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> The reason why the <ORG> had to make that amendment is stated in the Memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill of We will refer to only that part which is relevant for us It was observed by the <ORG> that the provision as it stood then had given rise to judicial controversy in respect of the following It has been held in some cases that the word record in section could not mean the record as it stood at the time of examination by the Commissioner but it meant the record as it stood at the time of examination by the Commissioner but it meant the record as it stood at the time when the order was passed by the Assessing Officer The Memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill makes that clear Under the existing provisions of Section of the Income tax Act and corresponding provisions of the Wealth tax Act and the Gift tax Act the Commissioner of Income tax is empowered to call for and examine the record of any proceeding and if he considers that the order passed by the Assessing Officer is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of <ORG> he may pass such order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the same or directing a fresh assessment After referring to the history of this provision we will now refer to the decisions which were relied upon by the learned counsel in support of the rival contentions with respect to the correct interpretation of the word record Therefore the materials which were not in existence at the time the assessment was made but afterwards came into existence cannot form part of the record of the proceeding of the <ORG> at the time he passes the order and accordingly it cannot be taken into consideration by the Commissioner for the purposes of invoking his jurisdiction under this section for he is not an appellate authority under this section and exercise only revisional jurisdiction and hence he can only take into consideration the record as it stood before the <ORG> and the materials in such record for the purposes of ascertaining whether the order in question was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue In other words any material which comes into existence later on cannot form part of the record of the <ORG> for the puposes of invoking the Commissioner power under of the Act And it is only after the proceeding is lawfully initiated by the Commissioner on the basis of the record of the <ORG> that the Commissioner can take into account any material which may come into existence later on in view of the expression after making or causing to be made such enquiry as he deems necessary used in the second limb of this section <ORG> however did not consider the effect of the said amendments as it was of the view that there was no occasion for the <ORG> to consider the scope of the amended Section because it came into force only in much later than the order disposing of the revision and therefore no such question arose out of the order of the <ORG> It was submitted by the learned counsel for the respondent that Section as thus interpreted by the Calcutta and <ORG>s before it was amended in and and therefore that was the correct legal position till st June On appeal by the assessee the Income Tax Appellate <ORG> held that the expression record in section of the Act cannot mean the record as it stands at the time when the action under that section is taken but it means the record it stands when the assessment order was passed by the assessing officer She further submitted that in a matter arising under the Wealth tax Act <ORG> had also taken the same view and the <ORG> special leave petitions Nos of Commissioner of Wealth tax vs <NAME> ITR Statutes though were heard after the said two amendments this Court dismissed them summarily and thus the view taken by the <ORG> was upheld In that context the question which had arisen for consideration was whether the Commissioner in exercise of jurisdiction under Section the Act could have relied upon the valuation report which had come into the possession of the Income tax Officer subsequent to the completion of the assessment It further held that where any proceeding is initiated in the course of the assessment proceeding having a relevant and material bearing on the assessment to be made and the result of such proceeding was not available with the Income tax officer before the completion of the assessment but the result came subsequently the revising authority is entitled to look into such material as it forms part of the assessment records of the particular assessment year The revisional power conferred on the commissioner under Section is of wide amplitude It empowers the commissioner to make or cause to be made such enquiry as he deems necessary in order to find out if any order passed by the assessing officer is erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue After examining the record and after making or causing to be made an enquiry if he considers the order to be erroneous then he can pass the order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify Obviously as a result of the enquiry he may come in possession of new material and he would be entitled to take that new material into account If the material which was not available to the Income Tax Officer when he made the assessment could thus be taken into consideration by the Commissioner after holding an enquiry there is no reason why the material which had already come on record though subsequently to the making of the assessment cannot be taken into consideration by him Moreover in view of the clear words used in clause of the explanation to Section it has to he held that while calling for and examining the record of any proceeding under Section it is and it was open to the Commissioner not only consider the record of that proceeding but also the record relating to that proceeding available to him at the time of examination The view that we are taking receives support from the two decisions of this Court though the point which is raised before us was not specifically raised in those tow cases whereby lause of the explanation was also amended with retrospective effect from st June held that the consequence of the said amendment made with retrospective effect is that the powers under Section of the Commissioner shall extend and shall be deemed always to have extended to such matters as had not been considered and decided in an appeal In respect of those three items the Commissioner had exercised his power under Section of he income Tax Act and therefore the question which had arisen for consideration was whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the order of assessment passed by the <ORG> read with section on had merged with that of the Commissioner appeals dated in respect of the three items in dispute so as to exclude the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Income Tax under sec Thus the amendment made in clause was held applicable to the orders passed before st June In the appeal filed by the assessee the order of Commissioner was challenged inter alia on the ground that the power under Section could have been invoked on the basis of the record as it stood when the order was passed by the Income Tax Officer and that it was not open to the Commissioner to take into account dissolution of the assessee firm which took place after passing of the assessment order because that circumstance was not disclosed by the record which was before the Income Tax Officer Rejecting this contention this Court held As regards his taking into consideration an event which had occurred subsequent to the passing of the order by the Income Tax Officer it may be stated that in Explanation in Section there is an express provision wherein it is prescribed that record shall include and shall be deemed always to have included all records relating to any proceeding under this Act available at time of examination by the Commissioner The death of one of the two partners resulting in the dissolution of the assessee firm on account of such death took place prior to the passing of the order by the commissioner and it could therefore be taken into consideration by him for the purpose of exercising his powers under Section of the Act In that case also the amendment was held applicable to an order passed before st June We therefore allow this appeal set aside the judgment and order passed by <ORG> and answer the question referred to <ORG> in the negative i in favour of the <ORG> and against the assessee
