The learned trial Judge <NAME> took the latter view and by his decree of August found in favour of <NAME> but on appeal <NAME> and <NAME> found in favour of <NAME> and their decree of July dismissed the suit We are of opinion that this contention is unsound and that the principle of vested interest while the actual enjoyment of the expected interest is postponed till the termination of the life estate as expounded by their Lordships of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> I A has no application to cases of the description now before us When a Hindu female is thus in possession she represents the estate completely and though her powers of disposition may be of a restricted character no one else has a vested interest in the estate during her lifetime Similarly when a founder has given valid directions as to the devolution of the <NAME>ship as in the present case upon the death of the last <NAME> the office vests in persons who at the time constitute the heirs of the founder provided the last <NAME> has not taken it absolutely when the oftice has so vested in them upon the death of each member of the group it passes by succession to his heir This is the principle for which Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellants now contends that the necessity of treating the sebait in office as completely representing the idol and its property prevents the recognition of any other person as having a vested interest in remainder and thus prevents any interests in the sebaiti from being as the learned trial Judge expresses it carried along the straight line of inheritance from the founder during the time that the office is held by any person to whom the founder has granted the sebaiti but not absolutely or so as to devolve upon his heirs The learned Chief Justice took the view that subject to the right given to <NAME> by the deed of the sebaitee and the right of disposing of it remained vested in <NAME> and on <NAME> death passed to <NAME> as his heir <NAME> then had not only a life sebaitee but the right of disposing of the sebaitee he had the complete heritable and descendible rights of a sebait Their Lordships do not appreciate that any question arises in this case as to a right of disposing of the sebaiti and they do not here discuss this somewhat special subject matter He was critical of the observation that there is no vested remaindtr in anybody in such cases If it is disposed of completely and absolutely in favour of another person there remains nothing in the grantor except the possibility of a reverter when there is a failure of extinction of the line of <NAME>s indicated by him It must be noticed however that though certain cases are referred to in the judgment in <NAME> case the learned Judges do not profess to be following any previous decision as covering the particular point now in question Taking their stand upon the proposition that the entire office is vested in the person who holds it at any given time they arrive at the conclusion that it is impossible to give recognition to any interest as vested in another This is all the more advisable in the present case since there are elements in the Hindu law of idol and sebait which the ordinary Hindu law of property finds somewhat intractable This was made clear by the sixth paragraph of his affidavit of August and it was accepted that as <NAME> put it in his judgment <NAME> would succeed along with the heirs of <NAME> and <NAME> as joint heirs of the testator It requires an intermediate case to raise the difficulty which is here presented a case where the only disposition made by the founder is that he has made a grant to or to and in succession of the office of <ORG> without intending or at least without effectively directing that the heirs of either are to take Unless therefore there be cogent reason to the contrary the principle to be applied to the intermediate case would seem to be that the course of devolution prescribed by the ordinary law should give way so far as is necessary to let in the persons nominated by the founder but no further It is not a theory which anyone maintains nor would it serve the appellants purpose to suggest it It must further be accepted that the founder may direct that a designated person should hold the office during that person life either immediately or on the death of a previous holder and that such direction subject to the relevant conditions as to perpetuity whatever these may be will be good although it carries no right to the heirs of the grantee and does not amount to a complete disposal of the sebaiti But what claim to interference with the idol worship or property can be based upon a right which has not vested in possession Why in any case should the element of office be regarded so little or disregarded so completely The Courts need give no countenance to such suggestions If the office is heritable property and may be the subject of a grant limited to the period of the donee life the grant may be regarded as disabling the founder and any heir of his from having or asserting during the donee life any right to represent the idol or manage its affairs or from impairing in any manner the right of sebaiti which has been granted and which has long been well defined by the law and practice of Hindus
