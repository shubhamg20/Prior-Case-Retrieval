The defendants thereupon preferred an appeal The learned Subordinate Judge who dealt with that appeal dismissed the plaintiffs claim holding that although he found in favour of the plaintiffs on the merits the decree of <ORG> was to be reversed and the suit dismissed on the ground that notices under Section Act were neither sufficient nor properly served The plaintiffs have then preferred this second appeal and on their behalf the findings of the Subordinate Judge both on the question of sufficiency of the notices as also on the question of their service have been challenged in this appeal The learned Subordinate Judge has found that upon the evidence in the case proper execution of the am mukhtearnamas had not been duly proved and further more that although in the am mukhtearnamas power was given to the am mukhtears to sue in ejectment there was nothing said conferring any authority to the am mukhtears to issue notices to quit Moreover even if there was any defect in the am mukhtearnamas as regards these matters the plaintiffs could have proved that the notices were issued under authority duly given by the ladies because the law does not say that such authority must necessarily be given in writing It may also be mentioned that the power to sue in ejectment should ordinarily be taken to include power to take up such action as may be necessary as preliminaries to the institution of such a suit He held that her evidence to that effect was not forthcoming and it should be taken that the notice was not served on <NAME> The notices that were given in this case were addressed to all the joint tenants and copies of such notice are alleged to have been served upon the joint tenants severally On examination of the facts of that case however it appears that all that has been laid down in that case is that the notice in order to give rise to this presumption must be addressed to all the joint tenants and that where no notice was addressed to one of of the joint tenants the mere service of the notice on the other joint tenants is not sufficient notice to quit according to law In the present case the notices that were issued were addressed to all the joint tenants It has been held in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Cal The question whether the notice and the suit covered the entire tenancy or whether they have left out a part of it which is in the defendants occupation will have to be re investigated and in view of the fact that it was not specifically raised in the pleadings and there is not much indication in the judgment of <ORG> showing that it was canvassed there we think that while we shall make an order for remand to the lower appellate Court for proper investigation of that question and for a clear finding on it we shall give the parties an opportunity to adduce such further materials as they may desire to do in connexion with this question Costs of this appeal will abide the result
