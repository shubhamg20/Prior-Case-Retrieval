JUDGMENT <NAME> This appeal is directed against the order of a learned Single Judge of this court dismissing an application under Order rules I and read with Section of the Code of Civil Procedure moved by the appellant in Suit No of filed by it in this court claiming that the respondents herein were guilty of passing off their goods bearing the appellant trade mark and in consequence praying for the issue of a permanent injunction restraining respondents from using the trade mark of the appellant and holding that they arc liable to render accounts pay damages and surrender all goods bearing the appellant trade mark Pending the disposal of the suit the appellant prayed for issue of temporary injunction interms of its prayer for permanent injunction against the respondent It is also claimed by respondents that the said mark is common to the trade There was some confusion caused as to what the mark in suit is The mark in question are the words RAJARANI and these two words arc written or embossed or printed or stamped in a particular manner It may be noticed that the learned Single Judge has observed that the appellant had used the mark in question even prior to and tharespondent No cannot be said to be the originator of the mark when it started processing the goods of the appellant three factors have to be kept in view namely the establishment of a prima facie case the balance of convenience between the parties and whether if the interim injunction is not issued it will cause irreparable injury to the applicant But this prima facie case made out by the appellant is said to be considerably watered down or weakened by the fact that the mark is alleged to be common to the trade and the various registrations adverted to in the learned Single Judge order The first point therefore that arises for consideration is whether this approach is correct In <ORG> <ORG> I Delhi the law regarding registered and unregistered trade marks has been very succinctly enunciated by <NAME> and this we say with great respect Who has got a better right of the two INthis appeal against the order of rectification four points arise for decision It does however facilitate a remedy which may be enforced and obtained throughout <ORG> and it established the record of facts affecting the right to the mark Registration itself does not create a trade mark The trade mark exists independently of the registration which merely affords further protection under the statute Registration itself does not create a trade mark The trade mark exists independently of the registration which merely affords further protection under the Statute For the purpose of claiming such proprietorship of a mark it is not necessary that the mark should have been used for considerable length of time As a matter of fact a single actual use with intent to continue such use eo instanti confers a right to such mark as a trademark It is sufficient if the article with the mark upon it has actually become a vendible article in the market with instent on the part of the proprietor to continue its production and sales It is not necessary that the goods should have acquired a reputation for quality under that mark Actual use of the mark under such circumstances as showing an intention to adopt and use it as a trade mark is the test rather than the extent or duration of the use It observed that the onus of proving user is on the person who claims it It has been urged on behalf of the respondents that inasmuch as the appellant had failed to show exclusive user no prima facie case had been made out by it for issue of an interim injunction From a reading of the judgments in <ORG> case we cannot accept the contention that there is any rule of law laid down by any court that exclusive user must be shown before a case can be said to have made out for issue of an interim injuction It was next contended that a passing off action is an action in deceit and the appellant had to prove that either there has been actual passing off or the use of the mark by the respondents has actually caused confusion or damage to the appellant The gist of the action is that the plaintiff by using and making known the mark or get up in relation to his goods and thus causing it to be associated or identified with those goods has acquired a quasi proprietary right to the exclusive use of the mark or get up in relation to goods of that kind which right is invaded by any person who by using the same or some deceptively similar mark or get up in relation to goods not of the plaintiff manufacture induces customers to buy from him goods not of the plaintiff manufacture as goods of the plaintiff manufacture thereby diverting to himself orders intended for and rightfully belonging to the plaintiff If there is a likelihood of the offending trade mark invading the proprietary right a case for injunction is made out Ropi Industries I Delhi we are of the opinion that the appellant has made out a case which requires consideration That the said mark has some novelty and attractiveness is evident from the fact that both the appellant and the respondents have applied for registration of that mark in their favor We now come to the question of balance of convenience It has been urged on behalf of the respondents that the mark RAJA RANI is common to the trade and for this purpose reliance has been placed on the registration in Andhra Pradesh and Amritsar There is a distinction between a mark being common on the register and common to the trade There is no evidence on record to show that there is actual user of this mark by any party other than the parties before us We cannot accept that there is any prima facie evidence of respondent No being the owner of the mark We now come to the question of irreparable injury It is said that there is nothing on the record to show that any loss has been occasioned to the appellant and in any case the respondents can be ordered to keep accounts It will take some time before the suit is decided At the moment no plea of common or concurrent user has been raised by the respondents but there is nothing to prevent them from doing so in future if they are allowed to use the trade mark for the duration of the pendency of the suit We therefore accept this appeal reverse the judgment of the learned Single Judge and issue an interim injunction against the respondents restraining them from using the trade mark described by us earlier on any voiles that they may manufacture or market or process The appeal is disposed of with the above observations but we do not make any order as to costs at this stage
