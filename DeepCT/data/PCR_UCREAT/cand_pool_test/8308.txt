The Municipal authorities having failed to take action pursuant to the directive the State of Punjab directly issued a notification under sec The petitioner challenged the constitutional validity of the said statutes and levy on the following grounds There are no guidelines for the exercise of the wide fiscal power of the <ORG> or <ORG> which make it too unreasonable to be salvaged by Art HELD There is nothing in Art If the Municipal body proposed to impose a tax it is required to offer an opportunity to the residents of area No taxation without representation is not applicable to a <ORG> controlled by an elected legislature exercising its power of taxation The legislature cannot delegate the essential legislative functions There is a clear purpose contained in the provisions about the purpose and limit of the tax A It is too late in the day to contend that the jurisprudence of delegation of legislative power does not sanction parting with the power to fix the rate of taxation given indication of the legislative policy with sufficient clarity JUDGMENT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos of There are also octroi levies of per cent and educational tax of per cent and these add up to a considerable burden but the commodity taxed is foreign liquor Indian made or other whose consumer usually belongs to the well to do sectors The municipal authorities having tarried too long or totally failed to take action pursuant to this directive the State directly entered the fiscal arena and issued a Notification under dated May which reads thus Whereas <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section of section of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act A PSLG dated th April required of <ORG> in Punjab to impose tax on the sale of Indian made Foreign Liquor at the rate of rupee one per bottle by the th May Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section of section of the Punjab Municipal Corporation Act the President of India is pleased to impose modify the tax on the sale of Indian made Foreign Liquor within <ORG> at the rate of rupee one per bottle The triple shapes of the fatal constitutional pathology are that a of the Act suffers from the vice of excessive delegation or legislative abdication there are no guidelines for the exercise of the vagariously wide fiscal power of the corporation or <ORG> which make it too unreasonable to be salvaged by Art We have to consider these grounds of attack on the notification which are the emphatic submissions of <NAME> who led the arguments There are more subsidiary submissions urged by other counsel on a lower key though but we have to deal with them too in due course There is nothing in Art Maybe in marginal cases where the virtual impact of irrationally uniform impost on the same subject is glaringly discriminatory expropriatory and beyond legislative competence different considerations may arise but to condemn into invalidity a tax because it is levied at a conveniently flat rate having regard to the commodity or service which has a high range of prices and the minimal effect on the overall price its easy means of collection and a variety of other pragmatic variables is an absurdity especially because in fiscal matters large liberality must be extended to the <ORG> having regard to the plurality of criteria which have to go into the fiscal success of the measure But in deciding whether a taxation law is discriminatory or not it is necessary to bear in mind that the State has a wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and that a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others <NAME> urged that obligated the municipal body to offer an opportunity to the residents of the city to file objections to the tax proposed and consider them before finalising the impost For this simple reason there is no merit in the submission No taxation without representation is a slogan with a different dimension and has nothing to do with a levy by a government controlled by an elected legislature exercising its power of taxation There is already a sales tax on foreign liquor at the rate of per cent under the Punjab General Sales Tax Act The Government exercises the power of the corporation under and cannot enter what is forbidden ground for the latter Therefore the submission has no substance and we reject it But there is a danger inherent in such a process of delegation It may not lay down any policy at all it may declare its policy in vague and general terms it may not set down any standard for the guidance of the executive it may confer an arbitrary power on the executive to change or modify the policy laid down by it without reserving for itself any control over subordinate legislation But the said liberal construction should not be carried by the <ORG>s to the extent of always trying to discover a dormant or latent legislative policy to sustain an arbitrary power conferred on executive authorities It is the duty of the <ORG> to strike down without any hesitation any arbitrary power conferred on the executive by the legislature Article comes into play when law is made for purposes of taxation and that law must comply with Part III In the absence of the rate of taxation being indicated by the <ORG> <NAME> and other counsel appearing on either side drew our attention to <ORG> the land mark case on the point But before we enter into a fuller discussion we may concretize the specific contention urged by counsel for the petitioners Can such non fixation of at least the maximum rate of taxation be upheld or does it enable the delegate to usurp the essential functions of the legislature When we proceed further to sub section the <ORG> is clothed with the power to notify the tax which the corporation shall levy and in exercising this power not even the wholesome obligation of receiving representations could considering objections contained in the Proviso to is present In <ORG> supra it was contended that the rate of tax was an essential feature of legislation and if the power to fix it were abandoned it amounted to abdication of legislative power After an exhaustive examination of the judgments of this <ORG> <NAME> reached the conclusion that there was clear authority that the fixing of rates may be left to the non legislative body If this possibility exists and there is no guideline given to the non legislative body in the matter of fixation of rates the result may be a frustration of the legislative object itself For this reason the <ORG> in the <ORG> supra case observed as axiomatic No doubt when the power to fix rates of taxes is left to another body the legislature must provide guidance for such fixation The question then is was such guidance provided in the Act We first wish to observe that the validity of the guidance cannot be tested by a rigid uniform rule that must depend on the object of the Act giving power to fix the rate It is said that the delegation of power to fix the rates of taxes authorised for meeting the needs of the delegate to be valid must provide the maximum rate that can be fixed or lay down rules indicating that maximum It seems to us that there are various decisions of this Court which support the proposition that for a statutory provision for raising revenue for the purposes of the delegate as the section now under consideration is the needs of the taxing body for carrying out its functions under the statute for which alone the taxing power was conferred on it may afford sufficient guidance to make the power to fix the rate of tax valid In the Western India Theatres case supra the power given to the corporation of the city of Poona in terms very wide to levy any other tax came to be considered from the point of view of abdication of legislative function It is often given power to decide when and in what manner the functions are to performed That we think would be sufficient guidance to make the exercise of its power to fix the rates valid Therefore in the case of a municipal body however large may be its needs there is a limit to those needs in view of the provisions of the Act creating it In such circumstances there is a clear distinction between delegating a power to fix rates of tax like the sales tax to <ORG> and delegating a power to fix certain local taxes for local needs to a municipal body A review of these authorities therefore leads to the conclusion that so far as this Court is concerned the principle is well established that essential legislative function consists of the determination of the legislative policy and its formulation as a binding rule of conduct and cannot be delegated by the legislature Further it appears to us that the nature of the body to which delegation is made is also a factor to be taken into consideration in determining whether there is sufficient guidance in the matter of delegation It is too late in the day to contend that the jurisprudence of delegation of legislative power does not sanction parting with the power to fix the rate of taxation given indication of the legislative policy with sufficient clarity The guidance may take the form of providing maximum rate of tax upto which a local body may be given the discretion to make its choice or it may take the form of providing for consultation with the people of the local area and then fixing the rates after such consultation It may also take the form of subjecting the rate to be fixed by the local body to the approval of <ORG> which acts as a watch dog on the actions of the local body in this matter on behalf of the legislature So long as the legislature has made provision to achieve that reasonable rates of taxation are fixed by local bodies whatever may be the method employed for this purpose provided it is effective it may be said that there is guidance for the purpose of fixation of rates of taxation So long as the law has provided a method by which the local body can be controlled and there is provision to sec that reasonable rates are fixed it can be said that there is guidance in the matter of fixing rates for local taxation As we have already said there is pre eminently a case for delegating the fixation of rates of tax to the local body and so long as the legislature has provided a method for seeing that rates fixed are reasonable be it in one form or another it may be said that there is guidance for fixing rates of taxation and the power assigned to the local body for fixing the rates is not uncontrolled and uncanalised In the Municipal Corporation of Delhi supra case it was significantly observed According to our history also there is a wide area of delegation in the matter of imposition of taxes to local bodies subject to controls and safeguards of various kinds which partake of the nature of guidance in the matter of fixing rates for local taxation It is however urged that of the Act provides for the supersession of the <ORG> in case it is not competent to perform or persistently makes default in the performance of duties imposed upon it by or under the Act or any other law or exceeds or abuses its power In such a case the elected body may be superseded and all powers and duties conferred and imposed upon the <ORG> shall be exercised and performed by such officer or authority as <ORG> may provide in this behalf It is urged that when this happens the power of taxation goes in the hands of some officer or authority appointed by Government who is not accountable to the local electorate and who may exercise all the powers of taxation conferred on the elected <ORG> by the Act Here again there is a limit to which the taxing power of the <ORG> can be exercised in the matter of optional taxes as well even though there is no maximum fixed as such in the Act In <ORG> a further point fell for consideration which has some relevance to the present set of arguments Furthermore if the <ORG> were to misuse the flexibility of the power given to it in fixing the rates the State legislature can at any moment withdraw that flexibility by fixing the maximum limit up to which the <ORG> can tax In view of the decisions cited above it is not possible for us to agree with counsel contention that the Act confers on the <ORG> such arbitrary and uncontrolled power as to render such conferment an excessive delegation We have no hesitation in holding that the law is well settled and none of the canons governing delegation of legislative power have been breached in the present case Corporations are created for the purposes of carrying out the provisions of the Act and they are charged with municipal administration see Money shall be spent by the municipality only according to budget provisions and budget estimates shall be submitted to <ORG> for approval which has the power to modify them To set the record straight we must state that many municipal bodies do exercise their limited powers properly and serve the public without nagging interference by Government officials So there is not much force in the submission that under governmental action may be a blind man buff not intelligent appreciation Moreover there is overall control by the legislature sometimes ineffective sometimes meaningful It is familiar knowledge that there are a number of institutionalised means by which the legislature exercises supervision and control over municipal matters We cannot therefore dismiss the legal position that there is control by the <ORG> over <ORG> in its supervision of municipal administration therefore delegated legislation cannot be said to be uncontrolled or unchecked by the delegator We may now refer to a few decisions which have been brought to our notice by counsel appearing for the municipal bodies and the State of Punjab to make out that the needs of municipalities and the pressures of local people are within the ken of <ORG> and they also respond like municipal bodies and guide themselves in the manner corporations do Great stress was laid on <NAME> case which dealt with subordinate legislation elaborately and upheld the validity of a provision where superficially viewed too wide a power had been delegated It may not lay down any policy at all It may declare its policy in vague and general terms it may not set down any standard for the guidance of the executive it may confer an arbitrary power on the executive to change or modify the policy laid down by it without reserving for itself any control over subordinate legislation Kropp upheld the validity of delegation of the power to fix rates to <ORG> in that case The learned Judge quoted the Privy Council which held that the <ORG> was entitled to use any agent or machinery that it considered for carrying out the object and the purposes of the Acts and to use the Commissioner for Transport as its instrument to fix and recover the licence and permit fees provided it preserved its own capacity intact and retained perfect control over him that as it could at any time repeal the legislation and withdraw such authority and discretion as it had vested in him it had not assigned transferred or abrogated its sovereign power to levy taxes nor had it renounced or abdicated its responsibilities in favour of a newly created legislative authority and that accordingly the two Acts were valid Lord <NAME> of <ORG> said What they the legislature created by the passing of the Transport Act could not reasonably be described as a new legislative power or separate legislative body armed with general legislative authority see Burah A By that standard there is nothing unconstitutional about of the Act We do not have to go that far in the present case and so we make no final pronouncement on this extension of delegations jurisprudence We must state while concluding that <ORG> has overruled similar contentions on grounds which have our approval see AIR and <ORG>
