There is also the prayers for possession for injunction damages and accounts <NAME> the mother of the plaintiff died in November prior to the death of <NAME> On the application of <NAME> this <ORG> by an order dated directed that <NAME> be added as a defendant and the plaint amended accordingly It is to be noted that though the suit was instituted originally after obtaining leave under Clause of the Letters Patent no further leave under Clause was obtained for either of the amendments effected Leave was given to them to file additional written statements after the amendments The defendant <NAME> filed her own written statement after being added as a party There are altogether four written statements on record three by the two original defendants <NAME> and <NAME> and one of <NAME> In their written statements the defendants <NAME> and <NAME> denied that <NAME> had any authority to adopt that there was any custom to give and take a daughter son in adoption or that there was in fact an adoption It is further pleaded in the additional written statement that even if the property was purchased by <NAME> with his own money in he by his act and conduct led the defendant <NAME> to believe that the property belonged to <NAME> having been purchased with her stridhan money and that the defendant <NAME> acted upon the said belief It is pleaded that the suit is not maintainable is bad for non joinder of necessary parties and is barred by limitation and that this <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain this suit a Is the Deed of Trust dated in respect of premises Nos and Jagabandhu Bural Lane void for uncertainty Does the said deed amount to a gift of the said premises Has not the said deed been acted upon or give effect to Has this <ORG> jurisdiction to try this suit Is the suit barred by limitation It is convenient at this stage to consider a point of law raised by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the defence which if upheld must lead to the dismissal of the suit The point of law raised is that this <ORG> has no jurisdiction to give any relief to the plaintiff in this suit Leave under Clause of the Letters Patent was obtained on the averment that part of the estate left in respect to which relief is sought is situate outside the jurisdiction of this <ORG> Mr <NAME> contention is that the suit as originally instituted was bad for non joinder of <NAME> another daughter of <NAME> who along with <NAME> inherited to the estate if the plaintiff is not the adopted son of <NAME> There are averments in the plaint to the effect that the plaintiff title has been denied by the defendants and the defendants <NAME> arid <NAME> are dealing with the estate situate at Calcutta in denial of the plaintiff title A part of the cause of action to institute this suit therefore arose within the jurisdiction of this <ORG> and in order to give jurisdiction to the <ORG> to try this suit leave under Clause would be necessary Whichever way the plaint is read <NAME> is a necessary party and in the absence of <NAME> no relief could be granted to the plaintiff in this suit as originally framed <NAME> was however added as a party on her own application by an order dated No leave was obtained under Clause by the plaintiff after this amendment Mr <NAME> contends that when a new party is added as a defendant it is a new suit as against this defendant and fresh leave is imperative to give jurisdiction to this <ORG> if part of the land is situate outside jurisdiction in case the suit is one for land or if part of the cause of action arose outside jurisdiction if the suit is not for land The suit was settled in terms of a settlement filed in <ORG> and a decree was passed in terms of settlement <NAME> was paid a certain sum of money and was declared along with others to have no share in the four valuable properties allotted to <NAME> and Tulsiprosad which last two were entitled to get owelty from certain defendants Usual leave was given to the next friend and guardian to settle the suit on terms filed and the settlement was certified to be for the benefit of the minors Subsequently a suit was filed by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> inter alia for a declaration that the consent decree was void and that it be see aside so that the suit may be reheard In this view of the matter His Lordship held that no party was added and no leave was necessary In that view of the matter the Appeal <ORG> held that leave was imperative and in the absence of such leave the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass a decree against <NAME> It is a clear authority for the proposition that when a new party is added fresh leave under Clause must be obtained and the leave originally obtained would not suffice There was the usual decree that the Calcutta property be sold We are not called upon in this case to consider whether the added defendant <ORG> is entitled to any relief in the plaintiffs suit The decision of the Bombay High <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <ORG> ILR Bom has also been cited by Mr <NAME> in support of the proposition that <ORG> alone the added defendant is entitled to take the objection and the objection is not open to any other party The original defendants therefore are not entitled to take the point that this <ORG> has no jurisdiction by reason of the fact that no leave was obtained when <ORG> was added as a party by the order of this <ORG> on her own application and the plaint amended accordingly Mr <NAME> however while arguing the case made it clear that though he is addressing his argument not on all issues raised in the case he is doing so to avoid repetition He expressly stated that on the issues on which he did not address any argument he would adopt the arguments to be addressed by Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing for defendants Nos and Plaintiff thereupon made an application for adding <NAME> a party defendant and the order was made adding <NAME> a party Agaimst this order adding <NAME> a party an appeal was taken by <NAME> on the ground that the effect of adding <NAME> as a party was the institution of a new suit without obtaining the necessary leave under Clause of the Letters Patent The <ORG> held that the only party competent to appeal against the order adding her a party is <NAME> and not the original defendant <NAME> <NAME> would be entitled to take the point at the proper time and may be at the trial the suit might be dismissed on that ground as against her That had however nothing to do with the suit against <NAME> The claim now made after addition is that either <NAME> or <NAME> was liable and there are really two suits rolled into one If however <NAME> is held to be liable as the owner of the firm then the question will arise whether in the absence of leave the <ORG> had jurisdiction to pass a decree against <NAME> In the instant case the suit must be either decreed or dismissed as against all and the suit cannot be decreed against the original defendants and dismissed against the added defendant Where the plaintiff seeks leave to amend his own plaint by adding a party he institutes a new suit as against the added party There is substantial argument on either side An application for amendment made on behalf of the plaintiff and an application for amendment made on behalf of the defendant must be treated on the same footing Nor can the added defendant be heard to raise objection to jurisdiction when he himself applied to be added as a party in a suit originally instituted by the plaintiff after duly obtaining leave under el I therefore hold but not without hesitation that in the absence of the plaintiff obtaining leave when <ORG> was added as a party this <ORG> has jurisdiction to entertain the suit and pass a decree against <ORG> But the new cause of action is in respect to the same land in respect to which the suit was instituted after obtaining leave under Clause of the Letters Patent Further the new cause of action introduced by the amendment in the instant case relates to land situate wholly within the jurisdiction of this Court In my judgment this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this suit even though no leave under Clause of the Letters Patent was obtained for either of the amendments effected The case of adoption as made in the plaint is that there is a custom and practice prevailing amongst the <NAME> community that at daughter son can be validly given and taken in adoption that <NAME> gave authority to his wife to adopt a son to him and that in fact <NAME> did adopt the plaintiff as a son on There were other persons present including <NAME> He said that two other certified copies were also obtained on his behalf which he had in his possession and which were shown to the <ORG> by his counsel Mr <NAME> There are some mistakes in the translation originally filed There is no doubt that the entry has been made in the wrong book The document does not state when the adoption was taken though it does suggest that it took place on the same date There is no evidence who this <NAME> is The witnesses who gave evidence that the necessary ceremonies had been performed are <NAME> <NAME> the plaintiff and his father <NAME> Churiwalla There is the evidence of registration and there is the certified copy which proves that on the original of the certified copy was registered It must be held on the present evidence tendered by the plaintiff on this point which I accept that the document was executed on which was subsequently registered on If the document was in fact executed who other than <NAME> could have done it It is to be noted that there is clear proof that in the middle of June July <NAME> was anxious to take <NAME> in adoption If as I hold that the document was genuine there could hardly be any reason for the plaintiff to withhold it assuming he had the document In order to enable the plaintiff to tender the certified copy as a secondary evidence it is enough for the plaintiff to prove that the original is not in his possession and so far as he is concerned it is lost The first overt act took place on when <NAME> lodged a diary to the effect that on the same date at a <NAME> came and was trying to get possession of the household articles left by <NAME> at Mullick Street and thereby threatening the complainant to deprive him of his legal rights of getting possession of the deceased articles This diary entry is proved by the police officer who made it <NAME> evidence in answer to is as follows No I stated before the police that I was the son of the late <NAME> and that there was a deed of adoption and I was the rightful owner of her properties and that the defendant <NAME> had wrongfully and forcibly entered the house I find neither reason nor authority in support of such a proposition No doubt a statement made to a police officer cannot be admissible as an evidence of confession of guilt If his evidence is accepted that he did refer to the deed of adoption to the police then for the first time on he asserted his title as the adopted son of <NAME> There was no reason why the police officer should not record what <NAME> stated There was no reason whatsoever for the police officer not to record <NAME> statement if in fact such a statement was made I have not the least doubt that till May the parties were living in amity and it is only after <NAME> obtained the certified copy of the deed of adoption that disputes started and <NAME> title as the adopted son to inherit the estate of <NAME> was asserted According to <NAME> it took place at about that is to say two hours after the party returned back from the burning ghat According to <NAME> it took place in the early hours of the following morning I have no hesitation in holding that the funeral and sradh of <NAME> were performed by <NAME> the nearest agnate <NAME> was told that there was a registered document which will prove his case Advertisements were issued in the papers and shortly thereafter the suit was instituted on Why <NAME> did nothing before the receipt of the certified copy If he knew as a fact that <NAME> was given in adoption by him at <NAME> and taken by <NAME> and that a deed was executed immediately after evidencing adoption if he knew all these facts this inaction cannot be explained He would not have allowed <NAME> to take possession of the movable and immovable properties of <NAME> and <NAME> and be a mere idle spectator If <NAME> knew that there was a registered deed of adoption and his evidence is that he was shown this deed by <NAME> then he need not have waited to receive the certified copy to decide his course of action There is however no evidence that <NAME> or his wife <NAME> were also willing to give <NAME> in adoption The oral evidence of <NAME> that he subsequently changed his mind is hardly acceptable Witnesses may lie but evidence of conduct proved by cogent evidence is always dependable On this basis Mr <NAME> made his submission If there was any talk at all of adoption as deposed by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> it was a talk of the most casual kind and was not a solemn act of <NAME> giving authority to his wife to adopt a son Mr <NAME> argued that the letter of <NAME> to <NAME> proves that <NAME> intended to adopt <NAME> and <NAME> was urging <NAME> to give his son <NAME> in adoption It is not permissible from this fact to infer that there was in fact authority given to <NAME> in and that <NAME> and <NAME> and all concerned had full knowledge of this fact On the evidence it is impossible for me to hold that <NAME> gave authority to <NAME> to adopt after the birth of <NAME> in in case <NAME> had no natural son or in case the natural son died after the death of <NAME> Excluding the case of <NAME> held against by <NAME> <NAME> there are altogether six cases three of them very recent one years old and another or years In the instant case though there is evidence of adoption of grandsons by daughter there is no general evidence by a priest pundit or leading member of the community in support of such custom But in my judgment they may be proved by other evidence as well If there is evidence that even after such adoption the adoptive father and the adoptive son or their respective families have not been socially ostracised or that the adoption has not been challenged and title of the adopted son to inherit the property of the adoptive father has not been disputed in a court of law or otherwise by anyone else who would otherwise be entitled to the estate and the adopted son has been allowed to enjoy the property of the adoptive father that would be good evidence of approval of the community of such adoption and the existence of custom in modification of Sastric Law is thereby proved In the instant case there is no evidence that the families which were parties to the adoption of a grandchild by daughter have been socially ostracised or that in case of old adoption the right of the adopted son to inherit the property of the deceased father has been challenged There is no rebutting evidence tendered by the defendants Mr <NAME> strongly relies on the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case reported in Ind App PC in support of his argument that to establish a general custom of the Agarwal community a larger number of such adoptions in a number of centres of Agarwal population must be proved Of the remaining cases there was the concurrent finding of both the courts that six have not been proved The custom alleged in the pleading was this Among the Jains adoption is no religious ceremony and under the law or custom there is no restriction of age or marriage among them It was a case of succession and the question was whether there was a local custom applicable to a small class Tula in a district of Punjab whereby a collateral of the tenth degree takes precedence over a married daughter in succession to non ancestral estate It is to be noted that neither party proved any specific instance in this case so there was no rebutting evidence and the case was disposed of on presumptive evidence of the entries and the evidence of custom as recorded in the Manual In argument I put this question to Mr <NAME> that if for years past it is proved that there is a custom in existence would that have the force of law Mr <NAME> replied that from this proof of existence for the last years the <ORG> will infer that it was in existence from time immemorial hence ancient and it has the force of law If however it is proved that previous to years there was a case of such adoption but not approved of or accepted by the then Hindu society then according to the reasoning of Mr <NAME> the proof of the custom for subsequent years will not establish its antiquity and its validity as a customary law there is no recital that <NAME> purchased the property with <NAME> money not as a trustee but as before or the rent receipts were granted to the tenants by <NAME> not as a trustee are not evidence of any great weight to prove that the deed was not acted upon I attach no importance to their oral testimony as to who was the owner of the property <NAME> or <NAME> There is no evidence worth the name to that effect In the absence of any such evidence in the instant case the doctrine relied on by Mr <NAME> has no application Having regard to the relationship between the parties I make no order as to costs
