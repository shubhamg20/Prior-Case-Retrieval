Subsequently in the year the respondent services were regularised and he was also confirmed on the post of Assistant Engineer The respondent was promoted to the post of Executive Engineer by a Government Order on the basis of seniority cum merit The government accepted the said recommendation of <ORG> and passed an order dated compulsorily retiring the respondent from service The respondent herein filed a writ petition before <ORG> at Allahabad challenging the order dated compulsorily retiring him from service The respondent also filed a second writ petition before <ORG> challenging the order dated whereby the government directed for recovery of Rs <ORG> first took up the writ petition which was directed against the order dated and set aside the order impugned in the writ petition on the ground that the respondent was not responsible for any loss caused to the government in the purchase of the materials for the department <ORG> was of the view that so far as the recovery of money stoppage of increment and censure entry for the year are concerned the same having been set aside in connected writ petition the said adverse materials are rendered non existent and the same could not have formed basis of passing of the order compulsorily retiring the respondent Therefore <ORG> excluded the said adverse materials while testing the validity of the order of compulsorily retiring the respondent In this way <ORG> excluded the second and third adverse materials which the government took into account while forming its opinion to compulsorily retire the respondent By the aforesaid process of elimination of adverse entries <ORG> found that there was no foundation or basis available to the government to form an opinion to compulsorily retire the respondent arising out of Civil first which arises out of the judgment of <ORG> whereby the order compulsorily retiring the respondent from service was set aside Learned counsel for the appellant urged that under law relating to compulsory retirement the State government is entitled to take into account the entire service record preference being given to the later entries while considering whether an officer is required to be retained in the service after he attains the age of years or has put in qualifying service and the view taken by <ORG> that entries only for the period of ten years immediately prior to the date of order of compulsory retirement could only be looked into is patently erroneous However learned counsel appearing for the respondent supported the judgment of <ORG> and contended that the entries falling only within ten years of the order of compulsory retirement can only be looked into while exercising power of compulsory retirement and any consideration of adverse material beyond ten years from the date of order of compulsory retirement would vitiate the order of compulsory retirement It appears that <ORG> on the said premise held that entries in the character roll being beyond ten years of passing of the order of compulsory retirement the order passed by the <ORG> government compulsorily retiring the respondent was arbitrary It is not disputed that the aforesaid entry in the character roll of the respondent was taken into account by <ORG> while recommending the compulsory retirement of the respondent and the <ORG> government also took into consideration the said entry while passing the order compulsorily retiring the respondent FR provides that notwithstanding anything contained in clause a or clause the appointing authority may at any time by notice to any government servant whether permanent or temporary without assigning any reason require him to retire after he attains the age of fifty years or the government servant may by notice to the appointing authority voluntarily retire at any time after attaining the age of forty five years or after he has completed qualifying service of twenty years a any entries relating to any period before such government servant was allowed to cross any efficiency bar or before he was promoted to any post in an officiating or substantive capacity or on an ad hoc basis or any entry against which a representation is pending provided that the representation is also taken into consideration along with the entry or any report of <ORG> constituted under the Uttar Pradesh Vigilance Establishment Act Before we advert to the question which we are required to decide it is necessary to notice the nature of an order compulsorily retiring a government servant under FR SCR it was held that an order of compulsory retirement is neither a punishment nor any stigma attached to it and it was held therein as thus There is no such element of charge or imputation in the case of compulsory retirement It is true that this power of compulsory retirement may be used when the authority exercising this power cannot substantiate the misconduct which may be the real cause for taking the action but what is important to note is that the directions in the last sentence of Note to Article A make it abundantly clear that an imputation or charge is not in terms made a condition for the exercise of the power While <ORG> or this <ORG> would not examine the matter as an appellate court they may interfere if they are satisfied that the order is passed a mala fide or that it is based on no evidence or that it is arbitrary in the sense that no reasonable person would form the requisite opinion on the given material in short if it is found to be a perverse order If a conduct of a government employee becomes unbecoming to the public interest or obstruct the efficiency in public services the government has an absolute right to compulsorily retire such an employee in public interest During pendency of the writ petition in <ORG> <ORG> on a claim petition filed by the respondent shifted the entry from to The aforesaid adverse entry which could have been taken into account while considering the case of the respondent for his compulsory retirement from service was duly considered by <ORG> and said single adverse entry in itself was sufficient to compulsorily retire the respondent from service It was not urged before us that the order compulsorily retiring the respondent was mala fide or was not in the public interest and in the absence of such a case we do not find any infirmity in the order compulsorily retiring the respondent from service
