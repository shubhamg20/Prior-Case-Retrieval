Sub section provides for payment to such a seller a the price agreed upon consistently with the controlled price if any fixed under the section the price calculated with reference to the controlled price if any and where none of these applies a price calculated at the market rate prevailing in the locality at the date of the sale Sub section lays down that where any producer is required by an order made with refer ence to cl of sub to sell any kind of sugar and either no notification in respect of such sugar has been issued under sub A or any such notification having been issued has ceased to remain in force by efflux of time then notwithstanding anything contained in sub there shall be paid to that producer an amount therefore which shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as <ORG> may by order determine having regard to a the minimum price if any fixed for sugarcane by <ORG> under this section the manufac turing cost of sugar the duty or tax if any paid or payable thereon and the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar and different prices may be determined from time to time for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar The <ORG> by notifications dated th November and th July issued in exercise of the power under sub The petitioners owners of sugar mills operating in the State of Uttar Pradesh in areas classified for the purpose of determining the price of levy sugar as West and East zones challenged the validity of the said orders on the grounds that they were ultra vires the Act and violative of their fundamental rights as the prices of levy sugar had been determined arbitrarily with reference to the average cost profiles of factories grouped together in zones without regard to their individual capacity and cost characteris tics that although the <ORG> has the discretion to fix different prices for different areas or for different facto ries or for different kinds of sugar such wide discretion has to be reasonably exercised that the words having regard to occurring in sub is a mandatory require ment demanding strict compliance with clauses a to that the ingredients of the said clauses should therefore have been examined with reference to each producer as a condition precedent to the determination of the price of sugar that <ORG> had not applied its mind to the relevant questions to which they were expected to have regard to in terms of thesub section and that the expression determine used in sub section indicates that the order to which that expression referred to is quasi judicial amenable to judicial review that to group together factories having a high cost profile and to determine a price special ly applicable to them is to put a premium on incompetence if not mismanagement and that the orders determining the price of sugar in terms of sub section were of general application and therefore legislative in character and the omission if any to consider the peculiar problems of individual producers was not a ground of judicial review The notifications dated th November and th July issued under sub There is no merit in the challenge The words having regard to in sub are the legislative instruction for the general guidance of the <ORG> in determining the price of sugar In considering the reasonableness of the order made by the <ORG> in exercise of its power under sub the <ORG> will not strictly scrutinise the extent to which matters mentioned in cls In the instant case the material brought to the notice of the <ORG> does not support the arguments at the bar that <ORG> had not applied its mind to the relevant questions to which they were expected to have regard in terms of the statute Where an authority to whom power is delegated is entitled to sub delegate his power be it legislative executive or judicial then such authority may also give instructions to his delegates and these instructions may be regarded as legislative It affects the rights of individuals in the abstract When the function is treated as legislative a party affected by the order has no right to notice and bearing unless of course the statute so requires Any Act of the repository of power whether legisla tive or administrative or quasi judicial is open to chal lenge if it is in conflict with the Constitution or the governing Act or the general principles of the law of the land or it is so arbitrary or unreasonable that no fair minded authority could ever have made it Prices are determined with reference to the geographical cum agro economic considerations and the aver age cost profiles of factories located in their respective zones There are sugar factories in the country and the present intervener has members Besides there are members with the cooperative sector Mr <NAME> submits that the present case is squarely covered by the decisions of this Court in <ORG> etc In the report of <ORG> it was pointed out that the Government had actually fixed the prices for zones which meant that from four zones the number had been increased to twenty two or more but these reasons have no relation to the zonal system The contention of the producers that they have been incurring losses on ac count of the zonal system is opposed to the evidence pro duced by them There is abundant justification for continuing and sustaining the zonal system For all these reasons there is ample justification in continuing and sustaining the zonal system for the purpose of price fixation There is no discrimination in the classification of zones on a geographical cum agro economic consideration and any such classification is perfectly consistent with the principle of equality There is great force in the submission of the respond ents that to group together factories having a high cost profile and to determine a price specially applicable to them is as recognised by this <ORG> in Panipat supra and Anakapalle supra to put a premium on incompetence if not mismanagement With larger receipts they offered in the following season a higher price to the farmer the sugarcane grower who in turn grew and offered more cane section which empowers <ORG> to require any person dealing in any essential commodity to sell the whole or a specified part of such commodity to <ORG> or <ORG> or to a nominee of such Government It reads Without prejudice to the generality of the powers conferred by sub section an order made thereunder may provide a for requiring any person holding in stock or engaged in the production or in the business of buying or selling of any essential commodity a to sell the whole or a specified part of the quantity held in stock or produced or received by him or in the case of any such commodity which is likely to be produced or received by him to sell the whole or a speci fied part of such commodity when produced or received by him to <ORG> or <ORG> or to an officer or agent of such Government or to a Corporation owned or controlled by such Government or to such other person or class of persons and in such circumstances as may be specified in the order This subsection oper ates only where an order has been made under sub section with reference to clause of sub section Where neither clause a nor clause applies either because there is no agreement or because there is no controlled price the seller has to be paid as per clause a price calculated at the market rate prevailing in the locality at the date of the sale The power to issue the direction is notwithstanding anything contained in sub section Any such notifica tion will remain in force for any specified period not exceeding months Where any producer is required by an order made with reference to clause of sub section to sell any kind of sugar whether to the Central Government or a State Government or to an officer or agent of such Govern ment or to any other person or class of persons and either no notification in respect of such sugar has been issued under sub section A or any such notification having been issued has ceased to remain in force by efflux ot time then notwithstanding anything contained in sub section there shall be paid to that producer an amount therefore which shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as the Central Government may by order determine having regard to a the minimum price if any fixed for sugarcane by <ORG> under this section the manufacturing cost of sugar the duty or tax if any paid or payable thereon and the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar and different prices may be determined from time to time for different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar Explanation For the purposes of this sub section produc er means a person carrying on the business of manufacturing sugar The sub section lays down two conditions which must exist before it applies The first is that there must be an order made with reference to sub section cl and the second is that there is no notification under sub section A or if any such notification has been issued it is no longer in force owing to efflux of time to sell any kind of sugar there shall be paid to that producer an amount therefore that is for such stock of sugar as is required to be sold and secondly that such amount shall be calculated with reference to such price of sugar as <ORG> may by order determine having regard to the four factors set out in cls <ORG> in and <ORG> in had worked out the zonal cost schedules on the basis of averaged recovery and duration the minimum and not the actual price of cane the averaged conversion costs and recommended a reasonable return on the capital employed by the industry in the business of manufacturing sugar Clauses a to of sub section postulate that the price of sugar must be determined having regard to the minimum price if any fixed for sugarcane by the Central <ORG> the manufacturing cost of sugar the duty or tax applicable in the zone and the securing of a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufac turing sugar a reasonable return on the capital employed in the business of manufacturing sugar which must mean the business as a whole and not the business of manu facturing levy sugar only and secondly from the fact of the <ORG> having all along used the same phraseology while recommending Rs The cost schedules prepared by these bodies were for determining a fair price in relation to the entire sugar produced by the industry and the return which should be granted to it on the capital employed in the industry and not with respect to that stock only required to be sold under sub sec The petitioners further contend that the Act requires the <ORG> to have regard to clauses a to and therefore it is mandatory on the part of the <ORG> to act strictly in compliance with the provisions of those clauses in determining the prices A observed with reference to the expression having regard to The form of words used no doubt lends itself to the sugges tion that regard should be paid only to the two matters mentioned but it appears to their Lordships that it is impossible to arrive at a conclusion as to reasonableness by considering the two matters mentioned isolated from other relevant factors Under the phrase Regard may be had to the facts which the <ORG> may thus take cognizance of are to be a guide and not a fetter The words having regard to in the sub section are the legislative instruction for the general guidance of the <ORG> in determining the price of sugar The reasona bleness of the order made by the <ORG> in exercise of its power under sub section will of course be tested by asking the question whether or not the matters mentioned in clauses a to have been generally considered by the <ORG> in making its estimate of the price but the Court will not strictly scrutinise the extent to which those matters or any other matters have been taken into account There is sufficient compliance with the sub section if the <ORG> has addressed its mind to the factors mentioned in clauses a to amongst other factors which the <ORG> may reasonably consider to be relevant and has come to a conclusion which any reasonable person placed in the position of the <ORG> would have come to The Attorney General submits that orders determining the prices of sugar in terms of the sub section are of general application and therefore legislative in character He asks And what of directions of a general character given by a minister to a nationa lised industry Are these various orders legislative or administrative <NAME> says that the correct Comd there is an infinite series of gradations with a large area of overlap between what is plainly legislation and what is plainly administration where a Minister or other authority is given power in a statute or an instrument to exercise executive as opposed to legislative powers as for example to requisition property or to issue a licence and delegates those powers generally then any instructions which he gives to his delegates may be legisla tive Where an authority to whom power is delegated is entitled to sub delegate his power be it legislative executive or judicial then such authority may also give instructions to his delegates and these instructions may be regarded as legislative Justice <NAME> definition which is what is called the time test and which <NAME> describes as one which has produced many unsatisfactory practical results reads A judicial inquiry investigates declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist Legislation on the other hand looks to the future and Ibid changes existing conditions by making a new rule to be applied thereafter to all or some part of those subject to its power In the words of Chief Justice <NAME> rule making is normally directed toward the formulation of requirements having a general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class <NAME> says an adjudication on the other hand applies to specific individuals or situations When the function is treated as legislative a party affected by the order has no fight to notice and heating unless of course the statute so re quires In the case of subordinate legislation it may happen that Parlia ment may itself provide for a notice and for a hearing But where the legislature has not chosen to provide for any notice or hearing no one can insist upon it and it will not be permissible to read natural justice into such legislative activity It is true that with the proliferation of delegated legislation there is a tendency for the line between legislation and administration to vanish into an illusion Administrative quasi judicial decisions tend to merge in legislative activity and con versely legislative activity tends to fade into and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi judicial activi ty Stating that rule making is of general application to all members of a broadly identifiable class while adjudication is applicable to specific individuals or situations the learned Judge observes A price fixation measure does not concern itself with the interests of an individual manufacturer or producer It is intended to operate in the future It is conceived in the interests of the general consumer public The right of the citizen to obtain essential articles at fair prices and the duty of the <ORG> to so provide them are transformed into the power of the <ORG> to fix prices and the obligations of the producer to charge no more than the price fixed The learned Judge emphasises Price fixation may occasionally assume an administrative or quasi judicial character when it relates to acquisition or requisition of goods or property from individuals and it becomes necessary to fix the price separately in relation to such individuals Such situations may arise when the owner of property or goods is compelled to sell his property or goods to the government or its nominee and the price to be paid is directed by the legislature to be determined accord ing to the statutory guidelines laid down by it In such situations the determination of price may acquire a quasiju dicial character It could not there fore give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural jus tice has not been followed in fixing the price price fixation is made a quasi judicial function for specified purposes or cases it is really legislative in character in the type of control order which is now before us because it satisfies the tests of legislation It is meant to lay down a general rule applicable to all persons or objects or transactions of a particular kind or class It would appear that what the learned Judge had in mind was an order by which the amount was calculated in terms of sub section in respect of each individual producer and not an order determining the price of sugar We therefore understand the observation of the learned Judge on this point as applicable only to the individual order fixing the amount in terms of the sub section and not to orders determining the price of sugar which are what the impugned orders are SCR equality and arbi trariness are sworn enemies one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch As stated by Lord <NAME> of <ORG> in Chief Constable of <ORG> <NAME> WLR at The function of the court is to see that lawful authority is not abused by unfair treatment and not tO attempt itself the task entrusted to that authority by the law The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that the indi vidual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the authority after according fair treatment reaches on a matter which it is authorised by law to decide for itself a conclu sion which is correct in the eyes of the court Even if the statutory order is passed in good faith and with the best of intention to further the purpose of the legislation which confers the powers since the <ORG> has to act in accordance with and within the limits of that legislation its order can also be challenged if it is beyond those limits or is passed on grounds extra neous to the legislation or if there are no grounds at all for passing it or if the grounds are such that no one can reasonably arrive at the opinion or satisfaction requisite under the legislation In any one of these situations it can well be said that the authority did not honestly form its opinion or that in forming it it did not apply its mind to the relevant facts In Renusagar SCC Mukharji as he then was states The exercise of power whether legislative or administrative will be set aside if there is manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary Similarly if the power has been exercised on a non consideration or non application of mind to relevant factors the exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous The true position therefore is that any act of the repository of power whether legislative or administrative or quasi judicial is open to challenge if it is in conflict with the Constitution or the governing Act or the general principles of the law of the land or it is so arbitrary or unreasonable that no fair minded authority could ever have made it The impugned orders are undoubtedly based on an exhaus tive study by experts material brought to our notice by the petitioners does not support the arguments at the bar that <ORG> has not applied its mind to the relevant questions to which they are expected to have regard in terms of the statute SCC at We do not agree with the basic premises that price fixation primarily affects manufacturers and producers It is for their protection that price fixation is resorted to and any increase in price affects them as seriously as any decrease does a manufacturer if not more When we consider the limit ing conditions of litigation the adaptability of the judi cial process only to issues definitely circumscribed and susceptible of being judged by the techniques and criteria within the special competence of lawyers it is clear that the Due Process Clause does not require the feel of the expert to be supplanted by an independent view of judges on the conflicting testimony and prophecies and impressions of expert witnesses In all such cases judicial in quiry is confined to the question whether the findings of fact are reasonably based on evidence and whether such findings are consistent with the laws of the land Even if it is true that the petitioners as individuals are at a disadvantage and have suffered losses on account of the present system an assertion which has not been established and which by its very nature is incapable of determination by judicial review that is not sufficient ground for inter ference with the impugned orders We see no merit in the challenge against the im pugned orders However we do not make any order as to costs
