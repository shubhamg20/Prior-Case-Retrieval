The commissioners considered the declarations and decided to submit the matter under section to the tribunal constituted for the purpose of that section to ascertain whether there was a prima facie case The registrar refused the plaintiffs request explaining that it would not be in accordance with the practice of the tribunal when considering whether or not there was a prima facie case The plaintiffs then issued an originating summons asking the court whether the tribunal was bound to give the <NAME> an opportunity to deal with the commissioners statement and counter statement and to address argument and adduce evidence before the tribunal and the procedure which the tribunal intended to adopt was in accordance with the rules of natural justice The plaintiffs appealed on the grounds inter alia that the judge misdirected himself in holding that <ORG> originating summons did not raise any question open to serious argument in <ORG> and that he ought to have held that the summons raised such a question and to have dismissed the motions The facts are further stated in the judgment of Lord Denning <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> for the plaintiffs All the case have to be considered in their context They say that Mr and Mrs <NAME> obtained a tax advantage in that transaction that it was not an ordinary commercial transaction and they propose to make an adjustment to counteract that tax advantage They are designed to ensure that the taxpayer is not harassed by a section notice unless the circumstances justify it If the taxpayer is of opinion that the section does not apply to him he can within thirty days make a statutory declaration to that effect stating the facts and circumstances upon which his opinion is based In that case they must send to the special tribunal a certificate saying they propose to take further action Then there is this important provision The tribunal shall in any such case take into consideration the declaration that is the statutory declaration and the certificate that is the certificate of the commissioners and the counter statement if any that is the counter statement of the commissioners and shall determine whether there is or is not a prima facie case for proceeding in the matter If the tribunal determine that there is no prima facie case the tax payer goes clear But if they decide that there is a prima facie case the commissioners can then proceed to give a section notice stating the adjustments necessary to counteract the tax advantage They have sent to the tribunal a certificate and a counter statement Now at this stage the plaintiffs have taken out an originating summons They claim that before the tribunal determines whether or not there is a prima facie case they are entitled to be heard or if not to be heard at least to see the counter statement of the commissioners and to correct any statement in it to which they object They contend that although section does not so provide nevertheless natural justice requires it that statutory tribunals have no power to administer an oath and need not examine witnesses They can obtain information in any way they think best always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to their view They must however always give a party fair opportunity for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial to his view But I must say there is a great difference between on the one hand a tribunal which has to decide on the rights and wrongs of the parties and on the other hand a tribunal which has to determine simply whether there is or is not a prima facie case In seeing whether there is a prima facie case a tribunal has of course to consider the case presented by one side but it need not at that stage hear the other side <ORG> reminded us of grand jury The master has to see if there is a prima facie case or a good arguable case and he does so without at that stage hearing the other hand in committal proceedings before magistrates the accused must be present and be heard to argue there is no prima facie case When <ORG> thus expressly states the matters which are to be taken into consideration But as the enquiry is only to see if there is a prima facie case there is no reason to make any such implication If the tribunal decide that there is a prima facie case the taxpayer will have full opportunity to see the counter statement and to make his case before the special commissioners and the tribunal They too have only to decide whether there is a prima facie case I would dismiss this appeals There is no prima facie presumption that <ORG> intended that the rules of natural justice applicable to final determinations whether subject to appeal or not have to look far in the practice of this court to see that that kind of inquiry is dealt with frequently ex parte and I need only mention an application for leave to serve a writ out of the jurisdiction under Ord or an application for leave to apply for an order of prohibition mandamus or certiorari under Ord When one examines the procedure laid down in section of the Finance Act it is in my view quite apparent that the kind of determination with which we are concerned at this stage is the latter kind of determination that is to say a preliminary one made on the application ex parte of <ORG> If he does that then <ORG> if they wish to proceed further in the matter which they need not do make an application under subsection which is plainly an ex parte application to the tribunal to determine whether there is or is not a prima facie case for proceeding in the matter The question to which they have to address their minds is do these documents disclose a case which merits further inquiry as to whether the circumstances described in subsection of the Act exist in the case of that taxpayer There is in my view no room in this procedure and in the face of the express words of the statute for the application of the well known doctrine to which Mr <NAME> has referred that you must give to the other side an opportunity of commenting upon the material on which a tribunal intends to act which is adverse to a particular party <NAME> Although I find myself in agreement with my brethren for once that fact does not induce in me a state of unbridled happiness Even though we are here concerned with the material upon which the tribunal should determine simply whether a prima facie case for issuing a section notice has been made out rather than a final determination of the rights of the parties if the taxpayer equally with the Commissioners of Inland Revenue a knew what material was being placed before the tribunal and had an opportunity of commenting upon that material I entertain no doubt that greater satisfaction would enure to the taxpayer than under the present one sided system and might well result in a saving of costs on both sides It is not without significance that despite the mountain of authorities which have almost completely obscured our view of counsel and the many reported decisions relating to the requirements of natural justice not a single authority has been cited to this court which applies the audi alteram partem rule to the determination of whether a prima facie case exists Appeal dismissed with costs
