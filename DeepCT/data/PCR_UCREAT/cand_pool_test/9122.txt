The main charge against him was that in his capacity as a public servant he committed criminal breach of trust in respect of a sum of Rs by way of loan from one <NAME> misrepresenting to him that it was required by the then Subordinate Judge and that by such representation he dishonestly induced the said <NAME> to issue a cheque for the sum of Rs It is the prosecution case that the appellant had misappropriated the amount and that on receipt of the above telegram by the District Judge he realised the urgency of finding the money somehow and that he accordingly made attempts to raise the money by way of a loan Failing in these attempts he approached one <NAME> for the amount of Rs He informed him that he had issued the cheque to accommodate him His defence is that it was the Subordinate Judge <NAME> that misappropriated the amount and that it was at his request and under his specific authority that he made the attempts to raise the sum of Rs by way of loan on his behalf locally and that he made use of it in his attempts to raise the loan for him He relies on the evidence of the very witnesses whom he is said to have approached for the loan in support of this defence It may be mentioned that after we heard the arguments fully on these appeals we have been informed that the appellant has served out the sentences of imprisonment The learned Judge of <ORG> who dealt with this matter in revision sums up the position as follows in his judgment It cannot be denied that there are circumstances in the evidence on the record which point towards both conclusions The learned Judge however came to the conclusion that the Courts below have carefully considered the circumstances for and against and that they rightly held that it was <NAME> the appellant who was responsible for the embezzlement and that his efforts to throw the blame on the Subordinate Judge <NAME> were false The question threfore that arises in this case is whether the circumstances brought out are or clear as to show that the defence is false or improbable It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established and alt the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused In other words there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused The first question that arises in this case is whether from the circumstances it is so well established beyond doubt that it is the appellant that has misappropriated the amount in question There are at the outset two circumstances against him that the amount in question was drawn by him from the <ORG> and that it remained unpaid to the parties concerned viz Thus not only was there a departure from the previous practice by way of drawing cash also for the outlying stations under the specific orders of the Subordinate Judge but when delay in payment was made a matter of complaint no action was taken thereon but there was only an attempt to gain time by adopting the device of appearing to make a general change in the practice for the future and asking the outlying Nazirs to go over to Sadar for receiving the moneys It cannot be disputed that under the rules the responsibility was entirely that of the Subordinate Judge and that it was a serious one and that a disclaimer thereof is not to be lightly accepted The Punjab Financial Rules lay down as follows The head of an office is personally responsible for every pay drawn on a bin signed by him or on his behalf until he has paid it to the person entitled to receive it and obtained his receipt duly stamped where necessary on the office copy of the pay bill also deposes that he made similar admission before <NAME> in the departmental enquiry against the appellant which followed pending the prosecution The reasons given by the trial Court and the appellate Court for this are not by themselves convincing We have had the opportunity of looking at the original Ruqqa The impression of the <ORG> below in this behalf is mere speculation and there is nothing in the evidence of the Subordinate Judge to indicate any such likelihood The very next day after the incident took place i on the th December the appellant sent two letters Exs While this inference is not without force it must be noticed that the accused who has put forward this Ruqqa in the forefront of his defence throughout and who has admitted the genuineness of the two letters Exs A may have been due to some confusion at the time for we find that in Ex which is much more detailed and categorical as regards the material facts in this case the only Ruqqa stated to have been returned to the Subordinate Judge is the second Ruqqa of the th December the first Ruqqa dated the th December while there is reference to both in the contents thereof It is sufficient to say that we cannot agree with the view taken by the Courts below that it is proved to be a forgery In this context it is also relevant to consider whether there is any indication in the case as to who out of the two was likely to have had need for the money at the time But his assumption that there is no indication in the evidence that the Subordinate Judge had any need for the money at the time is not correct I think I gave that cheque to the accused for getting it credited into my account with <ORG> and gave him another cheque either to <NAME> my orderly or to the accused and perhaps this cheque was for Rs There is also some evidence in support of this Having regard to the nature and contents of the letter and the fact that it has been sent by registered posts the next day from different place probably at a distance called Daulatpur as indicated by the stamping on the registered envelope thereof we are not able to share the view that there was time enough for concocting such a false defence in this letter For instance the learned Judge of <ORG> thinks that there was no necessity for the Subordinate Judge <NAME> to repudiate the whole scheme when confronted by <NAME> on the th December after the loan had in fact been raised and the money was about to be realised which would tide over the embezzlement and give <NAME> a breathing space for some time if in fact he was a party and indeed the principal figure in the embezzlement With respect the learned Judge does not seem to have appreciated that the fact of <NAME> having issued a cheque in the name of the Subordinate Judge himself makes all the difference Again the Courts below were inclined to think that if the defence of the appellant was true and he had in his possession a <NAME> Ex the appellant would have at once put it forward on the th itself at the premises of <ORG> when <NAME> stopped payment on the ground of misrepresentation of the Subordinate Judge authorisation in this behalf There are a number of other similar circumstances relied on by the Courts below into which it is unnecessary to go at length They have also virtually ignored a crucial circumstance in favour of appellant <NAME> There is however one other aspect of the matter which requires consideration We have been shown no rule which authorises or enables the Civil <NAME> in such cases to keep custody of the money with himself pending disbursal If there was any such rule such custody may well amount to entrustment
