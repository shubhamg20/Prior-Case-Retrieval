An interesting question regarding the allowability of the expenditure incurred on the foreign tour of the wife of a senior partner in computing the income under the head Profits and gains of business under of the I Act hereinafter referred to as the Act arises in this reference under of the Act at the instance of the <ORG> The assessee is a firm of five partners carrying on business in wholesale piece goods and as exporter of handloom goods to foreign countries The partner of the assessee who undertook the foreign tour was claimed to be a diabetic and it was therefore stated that it became necessary for his wife to accompany him for the purpose of attending on him On appeal by the assessee the <ORG> found relying upon the correspondence between the assessee and <ORG> relating to the release of foreign exchange as well as the medical certificates and recognising what was styled as a modern trend in commercial and business organisations requiring the wives of the top executives to accompany their husbands on foreign trips that the expenses incurred in connection with the trip of the wife of the partner of the assessee were wholly and exclusively incurred for business purposes In addition the <ORG> also found that the wife of the partner of the assessee was trained in modern designs which the growth of the business of the assessee and that considering the export of the assessee the expenses incurred by the assessee in connection with the foreign tour of the wife of the partner cannot be considered to be unreasonable In this view the <ORG> directed the <ORG> to allow the entire expenses incurred for the partner of the assessee and his wife as claimed in the computation of the income of the assessee for the assessment year In support of this reference the learned counsel for the <ORG> first contended that the expenses incurred by the assessee in connection with the foreign tour of the wife of the senior partner of the assessee would partake the character of personal expenses and do not qualify for allowance under of the Act Referring to the medical certificates the learned counsel for the <ORG> pointed out that they at best indicated that the partner of the assessee was in need of attention owning to his being afflicted by diabetes but that would not render the expenses incurred in that connection any the less personal On the other hand the learned counsel for the assessee submitted that the expenses incurred on the wife who accompanied her husband the partner on his foreign tour cannot be characterised as personal as the expenditure had been incurred for her while the partner on tour was on a business tour It was also submitted that though such expenses might appear at first blush to be personal yet the main or predominant purpose of incurring the expenditure was for business and even if there was a personal element in the expenditure so incurred that would only be incidental and would not render the expenses a personal one We may immediately state that the second aspect of the aforesaid submission of the learned counsel for the assessee forms part of a more elaborate second argument of the learned counsel for the <ORG> and we therefore propose to deal with that aspect later in the course of the judgment while considering the second argument on behalf of the <ORG> There is no dispute that <NAME> a partner of the assessee who undertook the foreign tour is a diabetic The two decisions relied on by the learned counsel for the <ORG> are apposite Repelling that argument <ORG> pointed out that personal expenses would include expenses on the person of the assessee or to satisfy his personal needs such as clothing food etc of dated October ITR infra had occasion to consider this question though with reference to a private limited company the assessee in that case The managing director had undertaken a business tour of Japan and as he was in indifferent health his wife accompanied him to look after him In this case also it does not appear that the wife of the partner of the assessee who undertook the foreign tour with the partner of the assessee was qualified or trained as a nurse or even if she was it would not have made any difference to the claim for deduction made by the assessee for the wife of the partner who accompanied her husband on a foreign tour did so only with a view to look after him so that he may not be deprived of the company of the wife while on such foreign tour which she would have done even otherwise if he had stayed at home At best it can be said that the wife of the partner who accompanied him on the foreign tour continued to fulfil her role and discharge her duties as a housewife even while her husband was on tour and that certainly could not have had any value as such especially when she did not devote her time and attention to the business as such In this there is only the satisfaction or fulfillment of the personal need of the partner to have his wife with him to attend on him and no more and by no stretch of imagination the expenditure incurred in that connection can be said to relate to business The learned counsel for the <ORG> next submitted that even assuming that the expenditure incurred related to business purposes such expenditure was not laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business In other words the argument is that the expenditure was laid out for a dual purpose namely to satisfy the personal needs as well as for purposes of business and not solely and exclusively for business purposes and that would take it out of of the Act Reliance in this connection was placed by the learned counsel on both sides upon a large number of decisions to which we shall make a reference later in the course of this judgment If there is a dual purpose then it is obvious that the expenditure would not qualify for allowance for it will cease to be wholly and exclusively laid out for business purposes The expenditure incurred is thus laid out in part for the advantage benefit and well being of the partner of the assessee and it is distinct and different from the amount expended for purposes of business or trade Even according to the claim made by the assessee the expenditure is a business expenditure wholly and exclusively Viewed thus the expenditure in this case had a twin purpose and did not qualify for allowance <NAME> referred to the evidence of the solicitor and found therefrom that the expenses of the American visit by the solicitor were incurred for a dual purpose namely the advancement of his profession and the enjoyment of a holiday a distinct purpose other than carrying on business and therefore the expenses incurred cannot be held to be wholly and exclusively laid for the purpose of profession The <ORG> opposed this on the ground that the expenditure apart from the telephone charges was not wholly and exclusively incurred for the purpose of his profession as a trade mark agent or alternatively was incurred for his maintenance or other private purposes and as the expenditure had dual purposes it could not apportioned and merited disallowance in full It was pointed out that boarding and lodging expenses of a partner cannot be said to be wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business for such expenditure had to be incurred though it may be that a partner going on tours may have to spend more on his boarding but he may have to spend something even if he had remained at the headquarters and such an expenditure had to be incurred at least for preservation of life and therefore the money cannot be said to have been wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for business purposes On appeal <NAME> considering the finding rendered by the Commissioners ruled that the expenditure was incurred to enable the taxpayer to continue to play the guitar and also enjoy and practice his hobby of playing that instrument and there was material on which the Special Commissioners could reach the conclusion that there was a dual purpose and therefore paragraph a of of the I Act was applicable In this judgment though there is no pointed reference to the duality of the purpose of the expenditure as justifying the disallowance of a claim for expenditure yet it appears to indicate that if it is partly for pleasure and partly for business of wholly for pleasure in either event the disallowance could be upheld related to the claim for deduction made by a company as an expenditure under xv of the Indian I Act a payment made to the auditors of the company to meet the expenses required to defend certain disciplinary proceedings brought against the auditors at the instances of one of the shareholders The departmental authorities negatived the claim but the Tribunal upheld it and on a further reference to this court it was held that the disciplinary proceedings initiated against the auditors of the company was personal to the auditors and did not have the effect of affecting the company interest in any manner and the expenditure cannot be considered to have been incurred by the company in connection with the carrying on of its business and cannot therefore be considered as having been laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for business purposes of the company The decision does not throw any light upon the duality of the purpose as such but proceeds on the footing that the expenditure was incurred not for purposes of carrying on business of the company and therefore not eligible for an allowance under xv of the Act The departmental authorities negatived that claim but the Tribunal gave partial relief and on a reference <ORG> held that the finding was to the effect that though the chairman was allowed to take his wife it was not justified by any legitimate business needs and there was no finding that the wife rendered any service in connection with the business of the assessee and therefore the expenses incurred on the wife were not allowable as business expenditure Inspector of Taxes TC <ORG> considered the question whether the appellant solicitor firm which had incurred expenses in entertaining clients was entitled to a deduction of those expenses on the ground that they were incurred for the purpose of earning profits and were money wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of profession within rule a of the Rules applicable to Cases I and II of Schedule to I Act <NAME> Inspector of Taxes <NAME> WLR ITR Ch dealt with a case of husband and wife who were the sole directors of a private limited company who went on a tour to Australia to study refrigeration methods But on appeal by the <ORG> contending that the expense incurred on the wife could not be deducted <NAME> held that there is no rule that merely because the expenses incurred by the husband are allowable the wife expenses also should be allowed and that the only asset of the wife was that she was a good conversationalise but that could not have had any value at all when she did not attend the business premises and though there was a business element in her visit it was not wholly and exclusively for the company business purposes and therefore her travel expenses could not be claimed as a deduction This decision also illustrates that the expenses incurred in connection with the travel of the wife of a company director who does not attend to the business of the company on such tour cannot be stated to be wholly and exclusively laid out for business purposes to be eligible for the allowance under of the Act However the General Commissioners found that the expenditure was incurred for a dual purpose namely to enable her to earn profits in her profession and to enable her to be properly clothed during the time she was engaged in her professional activity On a consideration of the principles laid down in the aforesaid decisions it is difficult to support the conclusion that the expenditure in question was wholly and exclusively laid out for business purposes and we are totally unable to share the view of the <ORG> in this regard There yet remains the second question referred to us In course of the order of the <ORG> it is stated that the wife of the partner of the assessee is trained in modern designs and that helped the growth of the business of the assessee and the export sales of the assessee rose to lakhs of rupees and as a result of the foreign tour the assessee became the third largest exporter of cotton handloom garments It was also further pointed out by the learned counsel for the <ORG> that even if as a result of the incurring of expenditure there had been some indirect advantage to the assessee that would not suffice to permit the expenditure as an allowable expenditure under of the Act Attention was also drawn by the learned counsel for the <ORG> in this connection to the passage in Halsbury Laws of England fourth edition volume paragraph at page We find from paragraph of the order of the <ORG> that it is stated therein that the wife of the partner who went on a foreign tour accompanying him is trainees in modern designs which would help to develop the business of the assessee and that there was a steep rise in the export sales of the assessee as a result of the foreign tour undertaken by the partner of the assessee which become the third largest exporter of cotton handloom garments Similarly in paragraph of the order the <ORG> a reference has been made to the statement of the <ORG> in the course of his order and the <ORG> further proceeds to state that it is not the case of the <ORG> that this finding is incorrect We may immediately point out that there was no material on the basis of which the <ORG> could have made that statement and come to the conclusion he did The <ORG> has merely put its rubber stamp on it as it were without ascertaining whether there was any basis or material in support of the statement of the <ORG> or the conclusion arrived at by him In this case as pointed our earlier we find that the <ORG> had made the statements and also arrived at the conclusions or findings based on no evidence and had freely drawn upon its imagination and imported facts and circumstances not apparent from the record with a view to support the claim made by the assessee for the allowance of the expenditure incurred in connection with the foreign tour of the wife of the partner of the assessee as an allowable item under of the Act Besides there is another error in the reasoning of the <ORG> in that it seems to take the view that the foreign tour of the wife of the partner of the assessee had been productive of increased business for the assessee It is in this connection that the passage upon which reliance was place by the learned counsel for the <ORG> in Halsbury Laws of England fourth edition volume paragraph at page becomes relevant and that passage is to the following effect Counter and indirect advantage are usually too remote to permit of the deduction of an expense connected with such advantages and money so expended is not wholly and exclusively laid out or expended for the purpose of the trade We have already pointed out how the expenses had no connection whatever with the business as they were personal expenses or in any case the expenses had been incurred for a dual purpose and therefore do not qualify for an allowance under of the Act In view of the foregoing we answer the questions referred to us in the negative and in favour of the <ORG> The assessee will pay the costs of this reference to the <ORG>
