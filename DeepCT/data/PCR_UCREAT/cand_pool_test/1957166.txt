other accused <NAME> and <NAME> were charged with offences under Sections read with Section of the on the allegation that on th January at about in the area of village Nizamwala in furtherance of their common intention which was to commit the murder of one lady Smt <NAME> by intentionally causing her death whereas the other two accused committed offences under Section read with Section of the Accused <NAME> was also charged with an offence under Section for having fired a gun shot at one <NAME> with such intention and under such circumstances that if by that act he had caused the death of <NAME> he would have been guilty of murder while the appellant was charged with an offence under Section read with Section It was also alleged that at the same time and place in furtherance of their common intention accused <NAME> Voluntarily caused hurt to <NAME> by means of a gandasa which is an instrument of cutting and thereby committed an offence punishable under Section whereas appellant and <NAME> accused were alleged to have committed offences punishable under Section read with Section of the Appellant was also charged along with other co accused for having committed an offence under Section read with Section of the for having voluntarily caused grievous hurt to one <NAME> On th January at about a <NAME> came to the house of <NAME> and remained there upto in connection with the distribution of sweets on the occasion of the birth of his <NAME> grand child Meanwhile <NAME> accused armed with his gun <NAME> accused armed with a single barrelled gun and <NAME> accused armed with grandasa came to the house of <NAME> and <NAME> raising lalkaras On receipt of telephonic message Inspector <NAME> of <ORG> Mallanwala went to <ORG> Ferozepore and recorded the statement of <NAME> which formed the basis of the First Information Report Thereafter he went to the spot lifted blood stained earth and recovered one empty catridge case from there After investigation the appellant along with his co accused were chargesheeted and ultimately their case was committed to the court of Sessions for trial The learned Trial Judge after recording evidence and hearing the rival versions took the view that appellant was guilty of an offence under Section of the for killing Smt <NAME> accused was sentenced under Section and was directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one and a half years and to pay a fine of Rs and in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for two months while the appellant and another accused <NAME> were sentenced under Section read with Section and were directed to undergo rigorous imprisonment for six months each and to pay a fine of Rs each and in default of payment of fine to further undergo rigorous imprisonment for one month each Learned advocate appearing for the appellant contended that when <ORG> came to the conclusion that the appellant had a right of private defence of body having received number of injuries in the incident <ORG> instead of carrying this conclusion to its logical end wrongly assumed that the appellant had exceeded his right of private defence of body as his reasonable apprehension could be of having caused simple hurt at the hands of the complainant party and therefore he had a right to give only grievous hurt but could not have caused any fatal injury by the use of his firearm When <NAME> appellant apprehended simple hurt at the hands of the compainant party he had the right to give a grievous hurt but he obviously exceeded the right of private defence of his person and caused one fire arm injury which proved fatal Consequently <NAME> is found guilty for an offence under section Part I Indian Penal Code Now it must be noted that according to <ORG> the appellant had a right of private defence as he had sustained number of injuries in the incident The right of private defence of body extends under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section to the Voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated namely First Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise be the consequence of such assault Secondly Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault Thirdly It is true that the first injury caused on his head had fortunately not resulted into a fracture but when it was caused with a sharp cutting instrument on the vital part of his body namely right side of head it cannot be gainsaid that at least a reasonable apprehension would arise in his mind at the spur of the moment that if he does not retaliate by using his weapon namely the gun with which he was armed he would certainly suffer at least a grievous hurt as a consequence of the assault by the party It is obvious that if an accused with an intention to kill his victim fires a shot at him which misses the target and hits any other innocent person fatally he would remain guilty of an offence of murder but if the accused had no such intention and was protected by right of private defence under the situation and circumstances in which it could extend to even causing death of assailant as laid down by Section and if in exercise of that right of private defence the blow fatally falls on an innocent person the action would still remain protected under Section of the Such situations have to be judged in the light of what happens on the spur of the moment on spot and keeping in view the normal course of human conduct as to how a person would react under such circumstances in a sudden manner with an instinct of self preservation Such situation have to be judged from the subjective point of view of the accused concerned who is confronted with such a situation on spot and cannot be subjected to any microscopic and pedantic scrutiny SCC a Division Bench of this Court speaking through <NAME> made the following pertinent observations the onus which rests on an accused person under Section Evidence Act to establish his plea of private defence is not as onerous as the unshifting burden which lies on the prosecution to establish every ingredient of the offence with which the accused is charged beyond reasonable doubt While holding that the accused was entitled to the right of private defence extending to even causing death in such a case he was acquitted of the offence under Section According to that section the right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of dager to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed and such right continues so long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues To say that the appellant could only claim the right to use force after he had sustained a serious injury by an aggressive wrongful assault is a complete misunderstanding of the law embodied in the above section The right to punish for the commission of offences vests in the <ORG> which has a duty to maintain law and order and not in private individuals It cannot be laid down as a general rule that the use of a lathi as distinguished from the use of a spear must always be held to result only in milder injury <ORG> seems in this connection to have overlooked the provision contained in section I But while dealing with the appellant case curiously enough <ORG> has denied him the right of private defence on the sole ground that he had given a dangerous blow with considerable force with a spear on the chest of the deceased though he himself had only received a superficial lathi blow on his head Consequently it must be held that the appellant had a right of private defence of body which extended to even causing death and in exercise of that right if he fired one gun shot which unfortunately killed an innocent person that is Smt
