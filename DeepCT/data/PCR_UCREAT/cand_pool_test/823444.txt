On appeal by special leave it was urged on behalf of the appellants that the sum paid by the assessee under of the Estate Duty Act were not expenditure of the assessee company and therefore they could not be deducted from its profits in computing its assessable income under xv of the Act and that even if it was revenue expenditure it was not laid out or expended wholly or exclusively for the purpose of the assessee business within the meaning of the said sub clause Held i There was nothing on the record to show whether in England where the concerned share holders died the resident company could recover the amount representing the estate duty paid by it in India from the legal representative of the deceased share holders ii The expression for the purpose of the business in xv of the Act is wider in scope than the expression for the purpose of earning profits The purpose shall be for the purpose of the business that is to say the expenditure incurred shall be for carrying on the business and the assessee shall incur it in his capacity as a person carrying on the business It cannot include sums spent by the assessee as agent of a third party whether the origin of the agency is voluntary or statutory in that event he pays the amount on behalf of another and for a purpose unconnected with the business The judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These two appeals by special leave raise the question whether the estate duty paid by the resident <ORG> hereinafter called the assesses incorporated outside India on behalf of members not domiciled in India is deductible from its profits in computing its assessable income under xv of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter called the Act The appeals preferred by the assessee to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner were dismissed On further appeal to <ORG> it held that the assessee was entitled to deduct the said amount in computing its profits and on that finding it set aside the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner The present appeals by special leave have been filed against the said order of <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the Commissioner of Income tax raised before us the following two points The sums paid by the assessee under of the Estate Duty Act are not expenditure of the assesseeCompany and therefore they cannot be deducted from its profits in computing its assessable income under xv of the Act and even if it is revenue expenditure it is not laid out or expended wholly or exclusively for the purpose of the assessee business within the meaning of the said sub clause Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely xv any expenditure not being an allowance of the nature described in any of the clauses to xiv inclusively and not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee laid out or expended wholly or exclusively for the purpose of such business profession or vocation Company to furnish particulars of deceased inemberrs to the Controller Where a company incorporated outside India carried on business in the territories to which this Act extends and has been treated for the purposes of the Indian income tax Act Xi of as resident for two out of three completed assessments immediately preceding such company shall within three months of the receipt of intimation of the death of a member dying after the commencement of this Act fur nish to the Controller such particulars as may be prescribed in respect of the shares of the deceased member in the company and shall be liable to pay estate duty at the rates mentioned in Part III of the Second Schedule on the principal value of the shares held by the deceased in the company except in cases where the deceased member was a person domiciled in India and the person accountable has obtained a certificate from the Controller showing that either the estate duty in respect thereof has been paid or will be paid or that none is due as the case may be Under this section in the circumstances mentioned therein a company is liable to pay estate duty in respect of the shares of the deceased member of the company on the princi pal value of the share held by the deceased in the company under this section a statutory obligation is imposed on the company to pay the estate duty on the shares of a deceased non resident member If such a member of the company had died in India subject to the conditions mentioned in the section the company would not be liable to pay the estate duty payable on the shares held by the deceased Nor sub of which says that a person having an interest in any property who pays the estate duty in respect of that property shall be entitled to the like charge as the estate duty in respect of that property had been raised by means of a mortgage to him has application for it cannot be said that the company has any legal interest in the shares owned by a third party Beforethe Amending Act of the language of the predecessor of this clause read thus not being in the nature of capital gains incurred solely for the purpose of earning such profits or gains Some of the decisions cited at the <ORG> both English and Indian throw some light on the construction of the said expression and we would therefore briefly notice them There a brewing company which also owned licensed houses in which it carried on the business of innkeepers incurred damages and costs to the amount of pound on account of injuries caused to a visitor staying at one of its houses by falling in of a chimney It must be made for the purpose of earning the profits Lord <NAME> definition appears to be much narrower than that of the Lord Chancellor for the former restricts the expression to mean that the expenditure should have been made only for the purpose of earning profits <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> noticed that the qualifictaion for the purpose of earning profits was a slight expansion of the words of the statute though he ex pressed the view that it brought out the real import of the relevant section In <NAME> <ORG> the court allowed a deduction in respect of sums paid by the respondent firm in discharging the liabilities of the business outstanding at the date of the said respondent purchased the business from a third party on the ground that the said expenditure having been incurred for the purpose of preserving the goodwill and for ensuring the continuity of supply of raw material and labour was wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of its business I find it quite impossible to say that there is no evidence to justify those findings Lord <NAME> after referring to the relevant case law and to Lord <NAME> formula made the following observations this seeems to me to be an assumption wholly unwarranted by the evidence There is no evidence that a transfer of the assets to a national body or authority would not destroy or adversely affect the company business It is clear on the authorities that Lord <NAME> formula includes expenditure for the purpose of preventing a person from being disabled from carrying on and earning profits in the trade This decision also restated the two tests namely i that the expenditure should be for carrying on the business to earn profits in the trade and ii that the expenditure shall be incurred by the assessee in his capacity of a person Suppl <NAME> in <ORG> Keene reaffirmed the second test in the following words I find however in <ORG> case what appears to me to be a clear answer to the present appeal The view of two of the members who agreed with the view of <ORG> prevailed <NAME> Inspector of Taxes <NAME> covered the entire ground over again in the context of a question whether the appellant company therein which was incorporated and resident in the United Kingdom and carrying on the business of a large general stores in Buenos Aires having paid in Argentina a tax known as the substitute tax to which it was liable could claim deduction under the Income tax Act and Geo On that finding the learned Judge came to conclusion that it was a liability which the Company had undertaken for the purpose of its trade and was therefore a payment made wholly and ex clusively for the purpose of the company trade The test laid down by Lord <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> namely the disbursement must be made for the purpose of earning profits has been accepted and followed throughout though the content of that test has been expanded to meet diverse situations i whether the expenditure was incurred for the purpose of carrying on of the business and for removing obstacles and impediments in the conduct of the business and ii whether the assessee paid the amount in his capacity as businessman or in his personal capacity observed The result is that when a claim is made for a deduction for which there is no specific provision in section whether it is admissible or not will depend on whether having regard to accepted commercial practice and trading principles it can be said to arise out of the carrying on of the business and to be incidental to it It is true that this decision did not arise under xv of the Act but the principle that the expenditure incurred by the assessee in his capacity as agent of another is not a deductible item equally applies to the present case <NAME> <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> after considering the relevant decisions concluded thus Applying the law as laid down in those cases to the present case the conclusion is that the amountn dispute was laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the respondent business because if the supply of jockeys of efficiency and skill failed the business of the respondent would no longer be possible The expression for the purpose of the business is wider in scope than the expression for the purpose of earning profits The purpose shall be for the purpose of the business that is to say the expenditure incurred shall be for carrying on of the business and the assessee shall incur it in his capacity as a person carrying on the business It cannot include sums spent by the assessee as agent of a third party whether the origin of the agency is voluntary or statutory in that event he pays the amount on behalf of another and for a purpose unconnected with the business We answer the question in the negative In the result the appeals are allowed with costs
