First Appeal No of came up for disposal before a <ORG> of this court comprising <NAME> Chief Justice and <NAME> their Lordships were of the opinion that there was some divergence of opinion on this subject in the different <ORG> in the country and consequently they made the following order of reference on October The point sought to be raised in this appeal relates to the quantum of compensation awarded by <ORG> in favour of the respondents A preliminary objection has been raised on behalf of the respondents that it is not open to the appellant to challenge the quantum of compensation awarded by the <ORG> Sections read with Sections and do not operate as a bar to the raising of such a plea in the appeal It seems that there is divergence of opinion among the Indian <ORG> on the question of law debated before us We are given to understand that there is a recent judgment of this court rendered in Civil Misc At the outset Lwould like to point out with due respect to the referring Bench that in all the judgments noticed in the order of reference there is no divergence of opinion and all the judgments noticed therein lay down the proposition that it is not open to an insurer to question an award of the <ORG> on the question of quantum only except on the grounds contained in Section of the Act This position is conceded by Mr <NAME> also but his argument is that Section of the Act is not exhaustive and that there are no limitations prescribed by Section of the Act of the nature and character of Section of the Act and therefore an insurer has a right to challenge an award of the <ORG> on all the grounds including the challenge to the quantum of compensation in an appeal in <ORG> If after a certificate of insurance has been issued under Sub section of Section in favour of the person by whom a policy has been effected judgment in respect of any such liability as is required to be covered by a policy under Clause of Sub section of Section being a liability covered by the terms of the policy is obtained against any person insured by the policy then notwithstanding that the insurer may be entitled to avoid or cancel or may have avoided or cancelled the policy the insurer shall subject to the provisions of this section pay to the person entitled to the benefit of the decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if he were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with any amount payable in respect of costs and any sum payable in respect of interest on that sum by virtue of any enactment relating to interest on judgments No sum shall be payable by an insurer under Sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the court of the bringing of the procedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceeding is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds namely a that the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein before the accident giving rise to the liability and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that the person to whom the certificate was issued has made an affidavit stating that the certificate has been lost or destroyed or that either before or not later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provisions of Section or that there was been a breach of a specified condition of the policy being one of the following conditions namely i a condition excluding the use of the vehicle a for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward or for organised racing and speed testing or for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a public service vehicle or a goods vehicle or without side car being attached where the vehicle is a motor cycle or ii a condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or iii a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war riot or civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular A Where any such judgment as is referred to in Sub section is obtained from a court in the State of Jammu and Kashmir or in a reciprocating country and in the case of a foreign judgment is by virtue of the provisions of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure conclusive as to any matter adjudicated upon by it the insurer being an insurer registered under the Insurance Act and whether or not he is registered under the corresponding law of the reciprocating country shall be liable to the person entitled to the benefit of the decree in the manner and to the extent specified in Sub section as if the judgment were given by a court in India Provided that no sum shall be payable by the insurer in respect of any such judgment unless before or after the commencement of the pro ceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the court concerned of the bringing of the proceedings and the insurer to whom notice is so given is entitled under the corresponding law of the State of Jammu and Kashmir or the reciprocating country to be made a party to the proceedings and to defend the action on grounds similar to those specified in Sub section Where a certificate of insurance has been issued under Sub section of Section to the person by whom a policy has been effected so much of the policy as purports to restrict the insurance of the persons insured thereby by reference to any conditions other than those in Clause of Sub section shall as respects such liabilities as are required to be covered by a policy under Clause of Sub section of Section be of no effect Provided that any sum paid by the insurer in or towards the discharge of any liability of any person which is covered by the policy by virtue only of this sub section shall be recoverable by the insurer from that person If the amount which an insurer becomes liable under this section to pay in respect of a liability incurred by a person insured by a policy exceeds the amount for which the insurer would apart from the provisions of this section be liable under the policy in respect of that liability the insurer shall be entitled to recover the excess from that person In this section the expressions material fact and material particular mean respectively a fact or particular of such a nature as to influence the judgment of a prudent insurer in determining whether he will take the risk and if so at what premium and on what conditions and the expression liability covered by the terms of the policy means a liability which is covered by the policy or which would be so covered but for the fact that the insurer is entitled to avoid or cancel or has avoided or cancelled the policy No insurer to whom the notice referred to in Sub section or sub Section A has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in Sub section or Sub section A otherwise than in the manner provided for in Sub section or in the corresponding law of the State of Jammu and Kashmir or of the reciprocating country as the case may be Section lays down On receipt of an application for compensation made under section A <ORG> shall after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard hold an enquiry into the claim and may make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom compensation shall be paid and in making the award <ORG> shall specify the amount which shall be paid by the insurer Section provides Procedure and powers of Claims Tribunals In holding any inquiry under Section <ORG> may subject to any rules that may be made in this behalf follow such summary procedure as it thinks fit <ORG> shall have all the powers of <ORG> for the purpose of taking evidence on oath and of enforcing the attendance of witnesses and of compelling the discovery and production of documents and material objects and for such other purposes as may be prescribed and <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> for all the purposes of section and Chapter XXXV of the Code of Criminal Procedure Vof A Where in the course of any inquiry <ORG> is satisfied that i there is collusion between the person making the claim and the person against whom the claim is made or ii the person against whom the claim is made has failed to contest the claim it may for reasons to be recorded by it in writing direct that the insurer who may be liable in respect of such claim shall be impleaded as a party to the proceeding and the insurer so impleaded shall thereupon have the right to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that are available to the person against whom the claim has been made Subject to the provisions of Sub section any person aggrieved by an award of a Claims Tribunal may within ninety days from the date of the award prefer an appeal to <ORG> Provided that <ORG> may entertain the appeal after the expiry of the said period of ninety days if it is satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from preferring the appeal in time Whereas Sub section of Section is only a declaratory provision it deems an insurer to be a judgment debtor when a decree is passed against an insured under certain circumstances rendering him liable to a third party Sub section of this section lays down that an insurer to whom notice of the proceeding is given would be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the grounds specified in various clauses of the sub section Section A provides that in a case where <ORG> is satisfied that there is collusion between the insured and the claimant it may for reasons to be recorded in writing direct that the insurer who may ultimately be found liable in respect of the claim if not already a party be impleaded as a party to the proceedings and the insurer so impleaded shall have the right to resist the claim on all or any of the grounds which are available to an insured Such an appeal may be filed within days from the date of the award although <ORG> can if satisfied that the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause to file the appeal in time condone the delay From a plain reading of Section it at once emerges that an insurer apart from the rights under the statute has no right to be impleaded as a party to a petition for compensation and once impleaded as a party it can exercise only those rights which are provided to it by the statute and it is Section which details the grounds which are available to an insurer A reference to Sub section of Section which provides that no insurer shall be entitled to avoid his liability except in the manner provided for in Sub section also support this view It says that no insurer to whom the notice of the action has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability under Sub section otherwise than in the manner provided for in Sub section Now the only manner of avoiding liability provided for in Sub section is by successfully raising any of the defences therein mentioned The statute has no doubt created a liability in the insurer to the injured person but the statute has also expressly confined the right to avoid that liability to certain grounds specified in it It is not for us to add to those grounds and therefore to the statute for reasons of hardship We are furthermore not convinced that the statute causes any hardship First the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge He can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and this he has full liberty to do In <ORG> <NAME> ACJ <ORG> had also an occasion to consider this question in some depth It makes no difference whether the proceedings for the recovery of compensation were by way of a suit in a civil court before the Amendment Act of or by way of an application in <ORG> after the said amendment It also makes no difference whether the insurer entered appearance and filed his written statement after a notice was issued to him under the provisions of Section of the said Act or whether he has impleaded as a party at the very inception However the insurer can in the name of the insured raise every such defence as an insured can raise including the absence of negligence provided it has reserved that right by policy of insurance In <ORG> <NAME> ACJ it was opined that apart from the defences which came within the scope of Section of the Act an insurer could not jtake up any other defence either in the original claim petition or in an appeal arising from an award given by the <ORG> itwasopined at of AIR Mys it is clear that insurer can urge all the defences open to the insured only when the insurer defends the action in the name of the insured On the other hand the insured the owner of the lorry and the driver of the lorry who were respondents and before the <ORG> had filed their objections and the appellant had filed a separate statement of objections Unless the appellant had defended before the <ORG> the action in the name of the insured the only defences which it the appellant could urge before the <ORG> and which it can urge in this appeal are those specified in Clauses a to of Sub section of Section of the Act The Full Bench after a review of a catena of authorities came to the conclusion that the insurance company could defend an action only on the grounds specified in Section of the Act and not on other grounds unless it had obtained leave of <ORG> under Section A of the Act The mere non filing of the appeal by the insured however was not considered enough for allowing the insurance company to challenge the award on the grounds other than those specified in Section of the Act The following observations of <ORG> are significant at of AIR <NAME> As the facts of this case show the insured had entered contest and there is no reason to hold in the absence of any allegation and something more that the insured has been colluding with the claimant In the instant case therefore to the insurer the restriction under Section of the Act applies and he could not travel beyond the restriction imposed by the statute either before the <ORG> or in appeal before this court None of the conditions as provided in this section exists in the present case It may however be added that as we shall show while considering the appeal by the truck owner even on merits there is no substance in this appeal Thus from a review of the aforesaid judgments it becomes clear that an insurer cannot resist the claim before the <ORG> or challenge the award of the <ORG> in appeals on grounds other than those enumerated in Section of the Act except where the insurer has reserved a right in the policy of insurance to defend the claim in the name of the assured himself or where the <ORG> or the court is satisfied that the assured and the claimant have colluded with each other and in exercise of the powers under Section A have granted permission to the insurer to defend the claim on all the grounds on which an assured could defend the claim Mr <NAME> has argued that Section of the Act does not impose any limitation on the grounds on which a party can file an appeal against an award of the <ORG> It is urged that Section is not exhaustive and that it does not cover cases in which compensation has been granted arbitrarily and that in any event the limitations contained in it cannot be read into Section to restrict the grounds on which an appeal can be filed It is urged that the insurer on whom the ultimate liability to satisfy the award falls must have the right to question the quantum of compensation awarded by the <ORG> Sections to of the Act provide for compulsory insurance of a motor vehicle before it can be used on any public road and lay down the liability of the insurer to pay to the claimant directly whenever there is a decree or the judgment of a tribunal or a court as the case may be Section provides for the constitution of <ORG> and confers jurisdiction on it to adjudicate upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving death or bodily injuries to persons resulting from a motor vehicle accident Section deals with the procedure and powers of the <ORG> while Section provides for an appeal from an award made by the Claims <ORG> Section provides for the recovery from the insurer of compensation money awarded by the <ORG> as arrears of land revenue and Section excludes the jurisdiction of civil courts to entertain any question relating to claims for compensation arising out of a motor vehicle accident in such areas where there exists a duly constituted Claims <ORG> An award made under Section has three components firstly it specifies the amount of compensation if any payable to the claimants which appears to the <ORG> to be just and reasonable secondly it specifies the person or persons to whom the compensation is to be paid and thirdly it specifies the amount out of the awarded compensation which is required to be paid by the insurer Before a person can file an appeal under Section of the Act he has to be an aggrieved party It is not possible to give an exhaustive definition of the expression aggrieved party and the expression has to be interpreted in the context in which it appears in a particular statute As a general principle it has been held by the courts that a person who feels disappointed with the result of a case is not necessarily a person aggrieved to be so classified he must be disappointed of a benefit which he would have received if the order had gone the other way If he was not entitled to that relief in the first place he cannot be aggrieved if the relief was denied to him but if he was entitled to it and the same has been denied to him he would be a person aggrieved Thus a party would be regarded as an aggrieved party for the purposes of Section where the claim or defence available to that party did not find favour with the <ORG> in making an award It is unimaginable that an insurer which before the <ORG> had only limited defences can file an appeal on other grounds also If a particular defence was not available to a party before the <ORG> the question of it not having found favour with the <ORG> does not arise because no party can be aggrieved of any adverse decision on a ground which was not available to it Thus it is manifest that whereas an insured would have the right to challenge an award on all the grounds which were available to it before the <ORG> an insurance company would be entitled to challenge the award only on the grounds which were available to it under Section of the Act This is manifest from the plain phraseology of Section of the Act which reads thus Notwithstanding anything elsewhere contained in any law a person issuing a policy of insurance under this section shall be liable to indemnify the person or classes of persons specified in the policy in respect of any liability which the policy purports to cover in the case of that person or those classes of persons However no sum shall be payable by an insurer under Section in respect of any award unless before or after the commencement of the proceeding in which the award is given the insurer had notice through the <ORG> of the bringing of those proceedings It is only an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is given who shall be entitled to be made a party to the proceedings and to defend the action on the grounds contained in Section of the Act unless the insurer had reserved in the policy of insurance a right to defend the action in the name of the insured in which event he can defend on all the grounds on which the insured could defend Under the second head an insurer can plead that there was no negligence on the part of the insured and raise all such pleas in defence to the claim as are available to an insured to show that the insured had not incurred any liability This however can be done by the insurer only if the insurer had reserved in the policy of insurance a right to defend the claim in the name of the insured If there is no such reservation made in the policy of insurance then Section strictly debars an insurer from taking any defence other than those enumerated therein to show that the insurer was not liable although the insured has incurred liability Where an insurer finds that it has not reserved such a right but that the insured and the claimant have colluded with each other as it is a possibility that cannot be ignored it is open to an insurer to bring that fact to the notice of the <ORG> and seek its permission under Section A to contest the claim on all the grounds available to an insured On being satisfied that there is such a collusion the <ORG> would grant permission and on such permission being granted the insurer steps into the shoes of the insured and defends the claim on all available grounds If the award goes against the insurer it can challenge it in appeal also on all such grounds on which it had contended the claim before the <ORG> The Act had confined the right to avoid the liability of the insurer to the injured on certain grounds specified in it An insurer can avoid any hardship by remaining vigilant during the trial of the claim petition and also by providing in the policy of insurance for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and that he had full liberty to do The aforesaid discussion leads to the conclusion that an insurer is not entitled to resist the claim or the award where the insured has been found liable on grounds not enumerated under Section of the Act where the term of the policy of insurance provides that the insurer has the right to defend the action in the name of the insured the insurer shall have the right to defend and if he does so all the defences as are open to the insured can be urged by the insurer both to resist the claim as well as the award if it appears that the claimant and the insured have colluded then after receiving permission of the <ORG> under Section A the insurer can defend the claim as well as the award on all grounds which are available to the insured and except for the aforesaid contingencies an insurer cannot question an award in appeal and unless the case of the insurer is covered by or conclusions as noticed above an insurer cannot in an appeal against the award question the quantum of compensation only Whether the deceased <NAME> had died due to the injuries sustained in the accident that took place on rd April at Badshah Chowk caused by <NAME> who was driving the vehicle No JKT while the deceased was crossing the road OPP Whether the vehicle involved in the accident was insured with NA No Whether the vehicle involved in the accident had been sold by NA to NA on th April The insurer had neither sought the permission of the <ORG> under Section A nor had it reserved any right in the policy to defend the claim in the name of the insured The learned <ORG> found that the accident had taken place due to the negligence of <NAME> driver of taxi No JKT and that the deceased could not be held liable for any contributory negligence was awarded as compensation and the liability to pay that amount was fixed on the appellant Since as already noticed the insurance company had not reserved in the insurance policy any right to defend in the name of the insured and further since the insurance company did not seek any leave of the <ORG> expressly or impliedly under Section A to defend in the name of the insured who had been set ex parte it is not now open to the appellant to challenge the quantum of compensation or the finding of the <ORG> about negligence of the driver of taxi No JKT The compensation awarded is not outside the limits of the liability of the insurer under the policy or the statute and as such the insurer cannot avoid the liability to pay the awarded amount Even otherwise the cross objections have no merit and there is no scope for enhancement of the compensation Mr <NAME> appearing for the appellant has urged that the claim petition was barred by time and therefore no compensation could have been awarded by the <ORG> to the claimant It is also transpires from the record that notice of the claim petition was issued to the respondents including the appellant but they avoided service and consequently on an application filed by the claimant service on the respondents was effected by publication in a newspaper Mr <NAME> then filed an application before the <ORG> for setting aside the ex parte proceedings against the insurance company and notice of the said application was given to respondent No on January By order of the <ORG> dated February the ex parte proceedings taken against the appellant were set aside subject to payment of costs and the appellant herein was given an opportunity to file objections to the claim petition by February However neither costs were paid nor any objections were filed to the claim petition by the appellant and on April the appellant insurance company again absented itself and the case was set ex parte against it and the claimant was directed to produce ex parte evidence on May of the claim petition before the <ORG> but he chose not to do so despite numerous opportunities granted to him In the facts and circumstances of the case I hold that this appeal has no merits and I dismiss the same with costs First Appeal No of The salient facts giving rise to this appeal are that on December at <NAME> <NAME> father of respondent No met with an accident caused by truck No JKN owned by respondent No and which was being driven at the time of the accident by respondent No The insurer has filed this appeal questioning the award on all the grounds Objections were filed to the claim petition by the appellant and it was pleaded therein that the accident had not been caused due to the alleged rash or negligent driving of the vehicle by the driver of the truck The insurer therefore with the permission of the <ORG> and without any objection having been raised by the claimant contested the claim petition on all grounds on which an insured could defend the action Has not non applicant No any liability to pay the compensation as the vehicle was being plied in contravention of the policy conditions of the route permit granted for its use Was the accident caused due to rash and negligent driving of the driver which resulted in causing the death of the father of the applicant <NAME> A corroborated <NAME> A in all material particulars both as regards the manner in which the accident took place and the negligence of the driver in causing the accident He went on to add that when the body was pulled out from under the truck the deceased was breathing heavily and that he died soon thereafter <NAME> A <NAME> A <NAME> and <NAME> A Ws also corroborated the statement of the aforesaid witnesses as regards the rash and negligent manner in which the truck was being driven by its driver and the manner in which the accident causing the death of <NAME> <NAME> took place All these witnesses categorically asserted that the deceased had died as a result of the accident The evidence of the eye witnesses <NAME> <NAME> and others as noticed above conclusively establishes that the accident took place due to rash and negligent driving of the truck by its driver From their evidence it emerges that <NAME> had been run over by the truck and that he died due to the injuries received by him in the accident The fact that the accident took place on the main road opposite a garden and the truck ran over the deceased whose body had to be pulled out from under the truck also lends credence to the evidence led by the claimant about the manner in which the accident took place As a matter of fact instead of disproving the case of the claimant his evidence lends credence to her case inasmuch as he did not dispute that the accident in question had taken place on the date and the time alleged and that the deceased had died as a result of the accident Learned counsel for the appellant has been unable to show any error in the finding arrived at by the <ORG> and from what I have said above I find no reason to take a different view either It is also urged that the <ORG> should have taken into account the effect of accelerated payment and made some deduction on that account The court came to the conclusion that the loss to the dependants Was Rs and that in my opinion would be the fair and just compensation to be paid to the claimant The claimant snail also be entitled to receive interest at the rate of on this amount from the date of tne application till the realisation of the awarded amount
