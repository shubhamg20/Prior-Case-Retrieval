In one batch of cases filed by dependents of deceased and injured persons <ORG> Ernakulam by judgment dated held that the driver of the bus was negligent and passed awards against the owner of the bus and <ORG> but dismissed the claim against the <ORG> on the ground that there was no negligence on the part of the driver of the railway engine concerned or on part of the <ORG> Administration In two other cases which were decided in an earlier judgment dated the same <ORG> at Ernakulam had held the <ORG>s Administration also liable on account of its negligence in regard to the same accident There was some delay on the way and the passengers were finding fault with the driver in regard to the said delay It appears that the driver was angry with some of the passengers who found fault with him for delay and he told them that he would abandon the bus and reached Cochin and proceeded to Kaady via Angamali It is now found on evidence that the caution board at the entrance of the level crossing was moth eaten and the writings thereon could not be deciphered by any one even if one was inclined to read The train was visible to the driver and passengers at a distance of The driver drove the vehicle and was crossing the railway line when the vehicle stopped on the track and did not move We have heard the counsel on both sides From the submissions the following points arise for consideration What are the common law duties of a motor vehicle driver at a railway level crossing Whether on facts the bus driver was negligent Whether under the doctrine of imputation the negligence of the driver in which the passengers travelled could be imputed to the passengers by the railways as part of the defence for the purpose of raising a plea of contributory negligence of the passengers Whether under the law of torts the claimants in rail motor collisions can claim that the obligations of the <ORG> under statute as well as under common law will run concurrently What are the common law duties of the railways at level crossings and whether the <ORG> is bound to take cognizance of the increase in the volume of traffic and ought to have installed gates and kept a watchman at the level crossing Whether a public authority upon whom powers are conferred by statute to exercise discretion for benefit of the public can be said to be under a duty of care so that omission to exercise that power could be treated as negligence at common law giving a right to compensation If not whether there are any exceptions to the rule that a statutory may can never give rise to a common law ought What is the effect of the omission of the <ORG> to exercise power under Section and Whether <ORG> has jurisdiction under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act read with Section thereof corresponding to Section and respectively of the Motor Vehicles Act to adjudicate a claim against <ORG> when a motor vehicle is hit by a railway train and whether the <ORG> can pass an award under Section against the <ORG> also in addition to an award against the owner of the vehicle driver and the insurer Point The facts of the case before us reveal that the driver as well as the passengers in the bus saw the train at a distance of one kilometer from the level crossing There is no evidence that the engine driver was negligent In fact if he had applied the brakes when the saw the bus about feet away while the train was running at a speed of per hour there would have been a derailment of several compartments of the train itself There was no notice as contemplated by the rule which laid down an extra obligations on the conductor to get down from the vehicle as stared in clause of Rule In our opinion in the absence of a board statutory requiring the vehicle to stop and the conductor to get down there was only an ordinary common law duty as applicable to prudent persons It has been held by the Courts that there is no absolute duty at common law to get down from the vehicle invariably The get out of the car requirement was in the absence of special requirement an uncommon precaution likely to be futile and sometimes even dangerous said <NAME> In our opinion there was no duty in the absence of a board directing the driver or conductor to get out of the vehicle but there was certainly a duty to stop see and hear at the unmanned level crossing It may be right to insist that the driver of the vehicle should stop the vehicle look both ways to see if a train is approaching and thereafter only drive his vehicle after satisfying himself that there was no danger in crossing the railway track Inasmuch as in this case the driver did not stop the vehicle at the unmanned crossing it must in our view be held that he was guilty of negligence even though there was no curve or obstruction at the point The question is whether the driver negligence in any manner vicariously attaches to the passengers of the motor vehicle of which he was the driver There is a well known principle in the law of torts called the doctrine of identification or imputation This principle has been applied in latter cases no passengers travelling in a motor vehicle whose driver is found guilty of contributory negligence There is no rule that the driver of an omnibus or a coach of a cab or the engine driver of a train or the captain of a ship on the one hand and the passengers on the other hand are to be identified so as to fasten the latter with any liability for the former contributory negligence A contention was raised for <ORG> that there was no pleading in regard to the negligence of <ORG> It read as follows Whether the accident was caused due to the negligence of all or any of the respondents or of the bus driver The claimants and the bus owner led evidence and were elaborately cross examined by the <ORG> We shall now deal with the main point The section on the other hand only confers a power on <ORG> to issue a requisition to the <ORG> administration i the General Managers or the <ORG> Companies if any to take steps as per section Obviously if <ORG> does not think fit to exercise that power and does not think fit to exercise that power and does not issue any such requisition the occasion for the <ORG> Administration to take steps under section as per the statutory mandate will not arise It has been contended for the claimants that under the common law the <ORG> as an occupier of the level crossing for the purpose of running railway trains which are inherently dangerous to those who use the public road at that point has special responsibilities as a responsible body to see that accidents are kept at the minimum That was a case which arose from the judgment of <ORG> In that case Lord <NAME> stated Theoretically in such a situation there are two duties of care existing concurrently neither displacing each other He asked who then in law is my neighbour The answer seems to be persons who are closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question On facts in <ORG> case it was found that to vehicles crossed the level crossing per day and it was held that the railway company could not say he stated that the greater the thoroughfare over any part of the line the greater care and vigilance that ought to be exercised by those who have the charge of the trains para it is stated that if there is increase in the number local inhabitants using the level crossing then reasonable additional precautions must be taken He said even if the car driver knew that there was a crossing the road users should be altered at the proper moment by the boards and it is not a case for remote knowledge but one for immediate alertness The most obvious way of doing it is to provide gates or chain barriers and to post a watchman who should close them shortly before the trains pass <ORG> in our view rightly observed that the bus driver was from Tamil Nadu he was not familiar with this place in Kerala State where the accident occurred there was no caution board or other indication to show that the road was cutting across a railway line and there were no gates or hand rails to alert the passer by For the aforesaid reasons no case is made out by the appellant for disturbing the finding of <ORG> that applying common law principles the <ORG> must also be deemed to be negligent is not converting the unmanned level crossing into a manner one with gates having regard to the volume of rail and road traffic at this point Point Point is whether omission to perform public law statutory duties can or cannot give rise to actions at private law and if they cannot ordinarily whether there are any exceptions We are here concerned with the question as to whether omission on the part of <ORG> to take a decision whether or not to exercise powers under Section of the Railway Act in particular under clause and of Section amounted to a breach of a statutory duty giving rise to a cause of action for damaged based on negligence In that context this court had occasion to refer to the principles laid down by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> vs <NAME> AC as regards proximity and neighbourhood and to the extension of these principles by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> vs Merton London Borough AC to cases of omission on the part of local authorities to properly scrutinise building plans where such omissions resulted in the cracking of walls of the buildings constructed thereby causing economic losses This court also referred to <NAME> vs <ORG> AC which overrules <NAME> We are referring to this aspect because the extent to which private law rights under common law can arise on account of non performance of statutory mandatory or discretionary duties or omission to exercise such statutory powers can differ from country to country We may state that there are two distinct types of cases The case before us belongs to the latter category The local authority had no power to enter on the land of the owner and remove the mound but had power under Section to issue a requisition to the land power to remove the mound But in <ORG> Vs Kent Ac Lord <NAME> had stated Where a statutory authority is entrusted with a mere power it cannot be made liable for any damage sustained by a member of the public by reason of its failure to exercise that power A duty of care at common law can be derived from the authority duty in public law to give proper consideration to the question whether to exercise power or not A public body almost always has a duty in public law to consider whether it should exercise its powers but that did not mean that it necessarily owed a duty of care which might require that the power should be actually exercised If the policy of the Act was not to create a statutory liability to pay compensation the same policy should certainly exclude the existence of a common lae duty to care There was exceptions in which a statutory may could create a common law ought The two minimum pre conditions for basing a duty of care on the exercise of a statutory power were firstly that it would have been irrational not to have exercised the power so that there was a public duty to act and secondly that there were exceptional grounds for holding that the policy of the statute must have been to require compensation to be paid to persons who woudl suffer damage because the power conferred was not exercised at all or not exercised when it was generally expected to be exercised So far as the first conditions relating to irrationality is concerned reference was made by <ORG> in the above case to the principle of particular reliance laid down by <NAME> of <ORG> in <ORG> vs <NAME> CLR at and also to the other alternative principle of general reliance laid down by <NAME> It is stated that a plaintiff is entitled to rely on reasonable care and proper precautions being taken and in places to which the pxblic has access he is entitled to assume the existence of such protection as the public has through custom become justified in expecting <ORG> then refers to a large number of cases of railway accidents He observed as follows at of CLR But an authority may by its conduct place itself in such a position that it attracts a duty of care which calls for exercise of the power That it is the conduct of the authority in creating the danger that attracts the duty of care is demonstrated by <NAME> Vs Glossop Corporation There are situations in which the authority occupation of premises or its ownership or control of a structure in a highway or public place attracts to it a duty of care And then there are situations in which a public authority not otherwise under a relevant duty may place itself in such a position that others rely on it to take care for their safety so that the authority comes under a duty of care calling for positive action <NAME> vs <ORG> KB In Canada it has been held in Swanson Estate Vs Canada th by <ORG> that the special protection in favour of the <ORG> must be limited only to those functions of <ORG> that are considered to be governing and that the decision of the regional director of a licencing body to allow an airline to continue unsafe flying practices was not part of a governmental function and the transport regulator was liable for negligence Applying the principle laid down by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> vs <NAME> there is in our opinion a clear indication in section and of the Railways Act itself that the affected parties are intended to be compensated because of the non exercise of the aforesaid statutory powers by the railways upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death or bodily injury of persons arising byt of the sue of motorvehicles or damage to any property of a third party so arising or both On the other hand Section corresponding to Section of the new Act of is procedural and is in two parts The first part states that after following certain procedure the Claims <ORG> shall make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom compensation shall be paid But it is the second part of Section on which the appellant <ORG> has relied and that part reads as follows In making the award <ORG> shall specify the amount which shall be paid by the insurer or owner or driver of the vehicle involved in the accident or by all or any of them as the case may be This is further made clear from Section of the Act which states that <ORG> shall entertain any question relating to any claims for compensation which may be adjudicated upon by the Claims <ORG> In our view when we are concerned only with Section and when Section does not and cannot control Section a claim is entertainable by the <ORG> if it arises out of the use of the use of a motor vehicle and if it is claimed against persons or agencies other than the driver owner or insurer of the vehicle provided in tort such other persons or agencies are also claimed to be liable as point tort feasors We may also refer to the observations of <NAME> in same case to the following effect Further Section of the Act provides of recovery of the compensation from any person as arrears of land revenue and recovery under that Section is not restricted to the owner driver or insurer specified in the second part of Section But on facts the decision is correct inasmuch as through it was an accident between a lorry and a train at a railway crossing it was a case where the driver cleaner etc travelling in the lorry were injured and there was no claim against the lorry owner But certain general broad observations made in these two cases that in no circumstances a claim can be tried by the <ORG> against the persons agencies not referred to in the second part of Section are not correct Further as pointed by <ORG> claims where it is alleged that the driver owner of the motor vehicle is solely responsible for the accident claims on the basis of the composite negligence of the driver of the motor vehicle as well as driver or owner of any other vehicle or of any other outside agency would be maintainable before the <ORG> but in the latter type of case if it is ultimately found that there is no negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle or there is no defect in the vehicle but the accident is only due to the sole negligence of the other parties agencies then on that finding the claim would them become one of exclusive negligence of railways For all the aforesaid reasons these appeals are dismissed but without costs
