By the time A No Reliving on that decision it was argued on behalf of the Official Receiver that since the mortgage had been found to be an act of insolvency in the order of adjudication as a transfer made with intent to prefer a creditor the order of adjudication was conclusive and that the appeal had consequently to be allowed and the mortgage set aside There was no appeal against A No of but the order of adjudication was appealed against by <NAME> in A No of on the file of <ORG> Objection was taken to the maintainability of the appeal on the ground that the mortgagee was neither a creditor nor a person aggrieved within the meaning of Section of the Provincial Insolvency Act It is said that notice of the civil miscellaneous petition on which this order was made was not given to the creditors respondents in the civil revision petition The objection that the appeal to the lower appellate Court is not maintainable since no appeal had been filed against the order in I A No of must also be overruled as the effect of setting aside the order of adjudication if it should be set aside in A No of would be to bring the insolvency proceedings to an end and thereby render ineffective the order made in I A No of It is not suggested that the lower appellate Court is precluded by any doctrine of res judicata from deciding A No of by reason of the fact that no appeal had been filed against the order in I A No of A person aggrieved must be a man who has suffered a legal grievance a man against whom a decision has been pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him of something or wrongfully refused him something or wrongfully affected his title to something In illustration of the definition he then went on to refer to Ex parte Ellis Ch wherein it was held that where an adjudication of bankruptcy had been made founded upon the execution of a bill of sale as an act of bankruptcy the holder of the bill of sale was a person aggrieved by the adjudication and was entitled to appeal from it because it affected his property In Ex parte <NAME> Ch the argument of the counsel who maintained that the holder of the bill of sale was not entitled to appeal from the adjudication was that his right to enforce his bill of sale was not affected by the fact that it had been treated by <ORG> as an act of bankruptcy and that if the trustee attempted to set it aside he would have an opportunity of trying the question where Lord <NAME> Master of the Rolls set out the definition from Ex parte Sidebotham Ch already quoted and pointed out that it is not an exhaustive definition but is an affirmative definition of a person who may appeal and at all events it includes a person who has asked for a decision for which he had a right to ask and has been wrongfully refused Lord <NAME> then quoted from the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> in In re Sidebotham Ch that the general rule is that an appeal must be by the party that means one of the parties to the dispute which is brought before the <ORG> for its decision who has endeavoured to maintain the contrary of that which has taken place This in Lord <NAME> opinion was to the same effect as part of the definition of <NAME> <NAME> Lord <NAME> then gave in his own words the effect of the judgments of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> It means he said that where there are two parties to the application the one applying the other asking that the application may be refused one of them has endeavoured to maintain the contrary of that which has taken place and according to this definition he is a party against whom a decision has been green and according to both definitions he has a right to appeal on the ground that he is legally a person aggrieved by the decision being in the same position as a party to a litigation The decision does not directly bear on the question which now arises as the words of Section had not to be construed in it The mere fact that if all the claims of the creditors who have proved were set aside or discharged by payment he would have an interest in the surplus which might be left over gave him no right to interfere with or embarrass the administration of the estate He had nothing more than a contingent chance an alienee of an insolvent property was held not to be a person aggrieved by an order admitting proof in a creditor favour The principle of In re Lamb Ex parte The Board of Trade would also seem to apply as the mortgagee was brought before the <ORG> to submit to the decision in the insolvency petition and he had as a party to that petition a right to ask that it may be refused and this is according to Ex parte Official Receiver In re <NAME> sufficient to give him sufficient locus standi to maintain the appeal I set aside the order of dismissal passed by the lower appellate Court and direct that the appeal should be restored to file and disposed of according to law
