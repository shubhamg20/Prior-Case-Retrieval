The defendants admitted the amount of the deposit and interest and also the two contracts sued upon but contended that there were other contracts and several payments by them on account of the transactions which resulted in a loss to the plaintiff and the amount of Rs was payable by the plaintiff to the defendants and that the whole matter had been referred by the defendants to the arbitrators of <ORG> and therefore the Court had no jurisdiction to try the suit It is urged on behalf of the applicant that so far as the deposit of Rs was concerned the arbitrators had no power to decide the question relating thereto and that the arbitrators could only give an award in respect of the two contracts which were in the sanctioned form and the award was illegal so far as it proceeded to take into consideration all other contracts alleged by the defendants which were not in the sanctioned form A member whose constituent has agreed in writing to sign the prescribed form of contract and fails or refuses to do so after terms have been arranged shall be treated in all respects as if he had done so and both parties shall have the rights and remedies accorded by these by laws It would therefore follow that the applicant could bring a suit in <ORG> on the two contracts which were in the sanctioned form to recover the deposit and also the profit accruing thereunder and it would be open to the defendants to apply under the Indian Arbitration Act to stay the action but it is not open to the defendants to say that the action would not lie I can see nothing in that clause to make arbitration a condition precedent to the right to bring an action It seems to mo to be an ordinary provision for referring disputes to arbitration and such a provision does not in any way oust the jurisdiction of the <ORG> If an action is brought in respect of a matter covered by the arbitration clause the defendant can apply under the Indian Arbitration Act to stay the action but it is not open to him to say that the action does not lie With regard to by law it was held that a suit could not be maintained on a contract which was not in compliance with the statutory form unless there was an agreement in writing to sign the prescribed form of contract In the present case it is alleged on behalf of the applicant that there were only two contracts in writing in the sanctioned form on which the suit is based and that the arbitrators took into consideration other contracts which were not in the sanctioned form nor was there any agreement in writing to sign those contracts It is urged on the other hand that the award SIC not disclose the fact that the arbitrators took into consideration contracts which were not in the sanctioned form It is therefore contended on behalf of the applicant that the arbitrators took into consideration contracts which were not in the sanctioned form and that the whole award is illegal and void as the award which is legal so far as it is based on the contracts in sanctioned forms cannot be separated from the other portion of the award which is based on contracts which were illegal and void The remarks in the judgment of the learned Chief Judge lend support to the contention on behalf of the applicant that the arbitrators took into consideration other contracts between the parties which were not in the sanctioned form though there is no specific and clear finding on that point it was held that if in the event of an award made by arbitrators on grounds some of which did while the others did not justify the exercise of their jurisdiction the Court cannot hold with certainty that the arbitrators acted exclusively on grounds within their jurisdiction and the award is null and void on the principle that if the bad is not separable from the good the whole is bad Where the parties to a suit refer their disputes to arbitration without the intervention of the <ORG> and an award is made an application to pass a decree in terms of the award is an application to record a compromise within the meaning of Order XXIII Rule But when parties have been negotiating for a settlement and one party con aiders a settlement has been arrived at which the other party denies or where there has been a settlement which one party seeks to avoid on any of the grounds on which an agreement can be avoitied recourse is had to Order XXIII Rule so that the <ORG> may determine whether an adjustment has actually been made or whether an adjustment made is one which can be recorded <NAME> however at page held that Order XXIII Rule of the Civil Procedure Code contains provisions corresponding to the plea of accord and satisfaction after writ and that an agreement to refer to arbitration after suit together with the award thereon is on the same footing as a direct settlement between the parties but the award to be effective for such a plea must be a valid one according to the general rules of law governing the validity of awards in arbitration proceedings Under by law such contracts must be in writing in the form given in the appendix It would therefore follow that the arbitrators had no jurisdiction to decide disputes arising out of contracts not in the sanctioned form In cases where an arbitrator enters upon a consideration of matters which are not referred to him or which he has no jurisdiction to try by arbitration clause or submission between the parties the appearance of the party after objection taken and protest made does neither give the arbitrator authority to make an award nor estop him from urging that the arbitrator has exceeded his authority It is urged on behalf of the applicant that he was never prepared to refer the dispute between the parties on contracts which were not in the sanctioned form to arbitration and the award on such contracts as were not in the sanctioned form would be illegal and void It would therefore appear that if the contention of the applicant which the arbitrators entered upon a consideration of matters when they had no jurisdiction to do so is correct it cannot be said that the suit has been adjusted by a lawful compromise It would therefore be necessary to send the case back to the lower <ORG> to decide on taking fresh evidence if necessary whether the arbitrators took into consideration the contracts which were not in the sanctioned form and which were illegal and void under Section of the Bombay Cotton Contracts Act XIV of If the <ORG> comes to the conclusion that the arbitrators took into consideration contracts which were not in the sanctioned form the award would be illegal and void and the legal part of the award would not be capable of being separated from the illegal part The plaintiff filed his suit on February On March the defendants filed the following written statement Say it was one <NAME> who was doing business in the name of <NAME> by whom all the transactions mentioned in the plaint were done and all orders for the transactions given to the defendants Say that disputes having arisen between the SIC all matters have been referred by the defendants to <ORG> for their arbitration and the said Association have already appointed arbitrators and the matter is pending before the said arbitrators After hearing them fully and carefully looking into the accounts correspondence and papers in respect of the above matter we find that the plaintiffs claim of Rs The plaintiff objected that the award was null and void because the arbitrators had taken into consideration certain transactions which were not in the prescribed contract forms as required by by law of <ORG> The learned Judge said that he appreciated the force of the argument but he held that there was a valid reference to arbitration under by law A and that the award was binding on the parties as an adjustment of the suit But it appears from the judgment of the learned Chief Judge that he dealt with the case on the basis that there were some other transactions between the parties which contravened the provisions of by law and that the award covered these transactions also For the purposes of this application we must take it that the facts are so and consider whether on that basis the suit has been rightly dismissed As I have found some difficulty in analysing the learned Judge reasoning I quote the relevant passage from his judgment in full The arbitration was however set up under by law A of the bylaws framed under the Act was an admitted claim or not They had jurisdiction even if it was admitted which it was not because it was unpaid I think power is taken in oases of admitted but unpaid claims deliberately by the <ORG> in respect of brokers and others so that where they find that there are unjustifiable instances of any broker admitting claims but not paying them action can be taken against him In investigating the dispute they had therefore to refer to the whole account and in doing so if they took into consideration liabilities under non sanctioned contracts it would not vitiate or invalidiate their award as it would not amount to any judicial misconduct on their part Taking plaintiff case at its best there was an unpaid claim arising under sanctioned contracts and if there was an unpaid claim a reference was called for as a reference has to be made in case of all unpaid claims Really speeking he should have referred the matter to arbitration as defendant was not paying him his admitted claim Even if under the Limitation Act the remedy of the parties to have the award enforced as an order of the <ORG> or otherwise is barred it cannot be said that they have no other rights in respect of it I find that there was a valid reference and that there is an award published under it Whether the plaintiff appeared before the arbitrators under protest or not does not affect the submission and the award as under the by law there was a valid reference The findings appear to be There was a valid reference to arbitration under by law A and as there was a valid reference and an award published under it and as the award is not invalidated by judicial misconduct on the part of the arbitrators the fact that the arbitrators took into consideration liabilities under void contracts not being in the learned Judge view judicial misconduct therefore the award is binding as an adjustment of the suit I do not say that it would necessarily have made any difference if the plaintiff and the defendants had agreed that the whole series of transactions including the void contracts should be referred to the arbitrators but it is important to bear in mind that there was no such agreement The learned Judge says that the plaintiff had an unpaid claim namely for Rs arising out of or relating to the two contracts made subject to the by laws that really speaking he ought to have referred the matter to arbitration himself and that as he did not the arbitrators had jurisdiction to consider the claim on the defendants reference But the real question which it seems to me the learned Judge has hardly faced is this When there is an unpaid claim or a dispute arising out of or relating to a series of transactions consisting partly of contracts made subject to the by laws and partly of contracts not so made does bylaw A empower one party to refer the whole matter to arbitration without the consent of the other and if a reference is so made have the arbitrators authority to deal with the whole series of transactions Now there was no agreement between the parties as I have said and the arbitration proceedings depend for their validity on the provisions of by law A In Clause such contracts mean contracts made subject to the by laws and the meaning of the clause seems to be that when commission agents or brokers are concerned in such contracts and there is a dispute as to their rights or liabilities the dispute shall be referred to arbitration although they were not actually parties to the contracts There is nothing in the by law then which gives power to one of the two disputing parties to refer any matters to arbitration which do not arise out of valid contracts and the learned Judge finding that there was a valid reference in this case appears to me to be clearly wrong What he says is In investigating the dispute they had therefore to refer to the whole account and in doing so if they took into consideration liabilities under non sanctioned contracts it would not vitiate or invalidate their award as it would not amount to any judicial misconduct on their part It seems that this might mean either that the arbitrators were justified in looking at the whole account or that they were not justified in doing so but the <ORG> could not interfere and must accept the award because there is nothing amounting to judicial misconduct As I have suggested it is by no mears clear that the award would have been valid if it had been entirely within the terms of the submission for if the arbitrators were at liberty to take account of the contracts not in the prescribed form they would be giving effect to contracts which the law has declared to be void and that would apparently be contrary to public policy In that connection I may refer to the cases cited in <NAME> Commentary on Order XXIII Rule under the heading Lawful agreement or compromise th Edition page but I need not go into the cases in detail because in the view I take the point does not actually arise in this case If on the other hand the learned Judge view was that the award was not a lawful one but that he had no jurisdiction to go into that question then on that point also I think he was clearly wrong For these reasons I agree with the order proposed by my learned brother
