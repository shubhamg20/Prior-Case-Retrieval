She died as a result of excessive burn injuries on her person Charge sheet was submitted against him by the police and the case was committed to <ORG> for trial of the respondent Code on the ground that there was not sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial against respondent and he was discharged in accordance with section If the Judge considers that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing as enjoined by If on the other hand the Judge is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which is exclusively triable by the court he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused as provided in But at the initial stage if there is a strong suspicion which leads the court to think that there is a ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence then it is not open to the court to say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused It is only for the purpose of deciding prima facie whether the court should proceed with the trial or no The evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in cross examination or rebutted by the defence evidence if any cannot show that the accused committed the offence then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial But if on the other hand it is so at the initial stage of making an order under or then in such a situation ordinarily and generally the order which will have to be made will be one under and not under After setting aside the orders of High <ORG> and <ORG> the <ORG> directed that appropriate charge or charges be framed against the respondent and trial to proceed in accordance with law <NAME> brother of <NAME> who is a Professor of Botany in the said College and lives nearby came to the scene of occurrence Eventually Charge Sheet was submitted against him by the police and the case was committed to <ORG> for trail of the respondent under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure hereinafter called the Code When the case was opened in <ORG> IIIrd Additional Sessions Judge at Motihari in Sessions Trial No by the Additional Public Prosecutor in accordance with section of the Code a plea was raised on behalf of the respondent that there was not any sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial against him and he should be discharged in accordance with section It is neither necessary nor advisable for us to mention in any great detail the facts of the prosecution case against the respondent or refer to all the materials and the evidence which may be produced by the prosecutor when a trial proceeds in <ORG> Since for the brief reasons to be stated hereinafter we are going to set aside the orders of the Courts below and direct the trial to proceed against the respondent we would like to caution that nothing which may have to be said in support of our order in this judgment is meant and should be understood to prejudice in the least the case of either party at the trial sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused he shall discharge the accused and record his reasons for so doing as enjoined by section If on the other hand the Judge is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which is exclusively triable by the <ORG> he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused as provided in section At that stage the <ORG> is not to see whether there is sufficient ground for conviction of the accused or whether the trial is sure to end in his conviction But at the initial stage if there is a strong suspicion which leads the <ORG> to think that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence then it is not open to the <ORG> to say that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused But it is only for the purpose of deciding prima facie whether the <ORG> should proceed with the trial or not if the evidence which the Prosecutor proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in cross examination or rebutted by the defence evidence if any cannot show that the accused committed the offence then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial An exhaustive list of the circumstances to indicate as to what will lead to one conclusion or the other is neither possible nor advisable We may just illustrate the difference of the law by one more example But if on the other hand it is so at the initial stage of making an order under section or section then in such a situation ordinarily and generally the order which will have to be made will be one under section and not under section The question to be decided at the trial would be whether the respondent as is the prosecution case had murdered her and set fire to her body or whether she committed suicide by herself setting fire to it This undoubtedly is a serious matter for decision at the trial The at this stage the Additional Sessions Judge was not right when he said it appears that there is neither direct evidence nor any circumstantial evidence to connect the accused with the alleged murder of <NAME> For the reasons stated above we set aside the impugned orders of <ORG> and <ORG> and direct that appropriate charge or charges will be framed against the respondent and the trial shall proceed further in accordance with the law
