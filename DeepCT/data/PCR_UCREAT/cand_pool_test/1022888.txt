After the judgment of <ORG> Rules and of the A Distillery Rules were suitably amended with effect from August When leave was granted by <ORG> of <ORG> to appeal against the judgment of <ORG> the correctness of the decision in appellants case reported in SCR was doubted and the matter was referred to a larger Bench Though initially the law was and law still is there is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to a tax No man now can get away with a tax avoidance project with the mere statement that there is nothing illegal about it The evil consequence of tax avoidance are manifold i there is substantial loss of much needed public revenue particularly in a welfare State like ours ii there is the serious disturbance caused to the economy of the country by the piling up of mountains of blackmoney directly causing inflation iii there is the large hidden loss to the community by some of the best brains in the country being involved in the perpetual war waged between the tax avoider and his expert team of advisers lawyers and accountants on the side and the tax gathered and his perhaps not so skillful advisers on the other side iv there is the sense of injustice and inequality which tax avoidance arouses in the breasts of those who are unwilling or unable to profit by it and last but not least is the ethics to be precise the lack of it of transferring the burden of tax liability to the shoulders of the guideless good citizens from those of the artful doggers These rules do not detract from the position that payment of excise duty is the primary and exclusive obligation of the manufacturer and if payment be made under a contract or arrangement by any other person it would amount to meeting of the obligation of the manufacturer and nothing more In every transaction of sale there is bound to be a seller at one end and a buyer at the other and transfer of title in the goods takes place for a consideration And on this reasoning it would make no difference whether the amount of excise duty is included in the price changed by the dealer or is shown as a separate item in the bill The position is not different when under a prior agreement the legal liability of the manufacturer dealer for payment of excise duty is satisfied by the purchaser by direct payment to the excise authorities or to the State exchequer A The conclusion reached in the appellants case in SCR on the second aspect of the matter namely when the excise duty does not go into the common till of the assessee and it does not become a part of the circulating capital it does not constitute turnover is not the decisive test for deter mining whether such duty would constitute turnover The relevant consideration is not whether the law permits the incidence of the duty to be passed on to the purchaser but whether there is a prohibition against passing of it If there is no bar the incidence would be passed on to the purchaser in accordance with normal commercial practice The following Judgments were delivered CHINNAPPA REDDY While I entirely agree with my brother <NAME> in the judgment proposed to be delivered by him I wish to add a few paragraphs particularly to supplement what he has said on the fashionable topic of tax avoidance Though initially the law was and I suppose the law still is there is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to a tax There is of course no doubt that they are within their legal rights but that is no reason why their efforts or those of the professional gentlemen who assist them in the matter should be regarded as a commendable exercise of ingenuity or as a discharge of the duties of good citizenship If it can be seen that a document or transaction was intended to have effect as part of a nexus or series of transactions or as an ingredient of a wider transaction intended as a whole there is nothing in the doctrine to prevent it being so regarded to do so is not to prefer form to sub stance or substance to form For this there is authority in the AB We were referred at our request in this connection to the various enactments by which <ORG> has from time to time tried to counter tax avoidance by some general prescription We were referred also to well known sections in Australia and New Zealand Australia Income Tax Assesment Act section New Zealand Income Tax Act section replacing earlier legislation Further it was pointed out that the capital gains tax legislation starting with the Finance Act does not contain any provision corresponding to section Whatever a statute may provide it has to be interpreted and applied by the courts and ultimately it will prove to be this area of judge made law that our elusive journey end will be a found Lord <NAME> put it even more forcefully The error if I may venture to use that word into which the courts below have fallen is that they have looked back to and not forward from Should it be allowed to rear its head in India I have referred to the English cases at some length only to show that in the very country of its birth the principle of Westminister has been given a decent burial and in that very country where the phrase tax avoidance originated the judicial attitude towards tax avoidance has changed and the smile cynical or even affectionate though it might have been at one time has now frozen into a deep frown No one can now get away with a tax avoidance project with the mere statement that there is nothing illegal about it There is not behind taxing laws as there is behind laws against crime an in dependent moral obligation First there is substantial loss of much needed public revenue particularly in a welfare state like ours Then there is the large hidden loss to the community as pointed out by Master <NAME> in <ORG> by some of the best brains in the country being involved in the perpetual war waged between the tax avoider and his expert team of advisers lawyers and accountants on one side and the tax gatherer and his perhaps not so skilful advisers on the other side Then again there is the sense of injustice and inequality which tax avoidance arouses in the breasts of those who are unwilling or unable to profit by it Excise duty as defined in section of the Excise Act is leviable on the manufacture of liquor and the manufacturer cannot remove the same from the distillery unless the duty imposed under the Excise Act has been paid This Court took the view We hold that intending purchasers of the Indian liquor who seek to obtain distillery passes are also legally responsible for payment of the excise duty which is collected from them by the authorities of the excise department Precedents ere referred to and the Court came to the conclusion that excise duty did not go into the common till of the appellant and did not become a part of the circulating capital On payment of the excise duty by the holder of licence a distillery pass for the removal of spirit fit for human consumption may be granted in favour of any of the following persons only namely a a person holding a licence in the Andhra Pradesh or in other States for sale of spirit by wholesale or retail and when the spirit is to be transported or exported beyond the limits of the district in which the distillery is situ ated to a person holding a permit signed by the Excise Superintendent of the district of destination or an officer of that district authorised in this behalf Reliance was placed on the earlier decision of this Court <NAME> Mr <NAME> appearing in support of the appeal at the very commencement of his submissions stated that there was no constitutional question involved in the appeal <NAME> Sons held There is in theory nothing to prevent <ORG> from imposing a duty of excise on a commodity as soon as it comes into existence no matter what happens to it afterwards A taking authority will not ordinarily Impose such a duty because it is much more convenient administratively to collect the duty tax in the case of most of the Indian Excise Acts when the commodity leaves the factory for the first time and also because the duty is intended to be an indirect duty which the manufacture or producer is to pass on to the ultimate consumer which he could not do if the commodity had for example been destroyed in the factory itself It is the fact of manufacture which attracts the duty even though it may be collected later Sea Customs Act this Court said With great respect we accept the principles laid down by the said three decisions and in the matter of levy of an excise duty and the machinery for collection thereof These rules therefore do not detract from the position that payment excise duty is the primary and exclusive obligation of the manufacturer and if payment be made under a contract or arrangement by any other person it would amount to meeting of the obligation of the manufacturer and nothing more In every transaction of sale there is bound to be a seller at one end and a buyer at the other and transfer or title in the goods takes place for a consideration When he sells goods manufactured by him he always passes on the excise duty to the purchaser And on this reasoning it would make no difference whether the amount of excise duty is included in the price charged by the dealer or is shown as a separate item in the bill The price of an ounce of tobacco is what it is because of the rate of tax but on a sale there is only one consideration though made up of cost plus profit plus tax That is the whole consideration for the sale and there is no reason why the whole amount paid to the seller by the purchaser should not be treated as the consideration for the sale and included in the turnover We would like to point out that the relevant consideration is not whether the law permits the incidence of the duty to be passed on to the purchaser but whether there is a prohibition against the passing of it If there is no bar the incidence would be passed on to the purchaser in accordance with normal commercial practice Sale of liquor has now been made exigible to tax at every point other than the point of last sale in the State Again it was said that the price paid by the purchaser was not so much money for the article plus tax but a composite sum Therefore in calculating the total turnover there is nothing wrong in treating the tax as part of the turnover because turnover means the amount of money which is turned over in the business We are of the view that the conclusion reached in the appellant case in on the second aspect of the matter namely when the excise duty does not go into the common till of the assesses and it does not become a part of the circulating capital it does not constitute turnover is not the decisive test for determining whether such duty would constitute turnover Support was also sought from the observations of the same learned Judge as he then was in the case of Commissioner of Income I Such artifice or device may apparently show the income as accruing to another person at the same time making it available for use and enjoyment to the assessee as in a case falling within section or mask the true character of the income by disguising it as a capital receipt as in a case falling within section or assume diverse other forms But there must be some artifice or device enabling the assessee to avoid payment of tax on what is really and in truth his income There is of course no doubt that they are within their legal rights but that is no reason why their efforts or those of the professional gentlemen who assist them in the matter should be regarded as a commendable exercise of ingenuity or as a discharge of the duties of good citizenship In our view therefore there is no merit in the appeal and the same is liable to be dismissed with costs
