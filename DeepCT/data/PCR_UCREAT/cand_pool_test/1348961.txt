Before the actual setting up of the factory the appellant requested <ORG> by letter for a concessional frieght rate for the carriage of Naptha to the factory When the factory was almost ready for operation the appellant again requested <ORG> by letter for charging the rate under classification instead of special quoted by it The appellant filed a complaint under section a and of the <ORG> Act before <ORG> Dismissing the appeal the <ORG> HELD Three questions arise for consideration of the <ORG> whether <ORG> was bound to allow the concessional rate offered to the appellant that is special quoted in its letter Ex On merits also there is no justification to demand that neptha should take the same freight rate as that of the crude oil Considering the conclusion of the <ORG> on this question it appears the <ORG> has not correctly understood the doctrine of promissory estoppel The party asserting the estoppel must have relied and acted upon the assurance given to him It is not necessary to prove further any damage detriment or prejudice to the party asserting the estoppel A promise intended to be binding intended to be acted upon and in fact acted upon is binding said Lord <NAME> sitting as a trial judge in <ORG> <ORG> it requires that he who seeks equity must do equity Or there may be several representations from the same party in regard to different matters In the instant case there was one representation by the Rajasthan government to supply power to the appellant factory at concessional rate There is another representation from the same government to exempt the appellant from payment of tax for a certain period No question of estoppel arises in favour of the appellant in the case out of the representation made in Ex The <ORG> agreed with the conclusion of the <ORG> but not for all the reasons stated The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal with Special Leave is against the order and judgment dated July of <ORG> Madras in complaint filed by the appellant under Section of the Indian Railways Act No of <ORG> in its reply maintained that while quoting the concessional rate equal to Special it was made clear to the company that the rate was subject to review when the traffic starts moving and that concessional rate was provisional in character There was no scope for any such understanding since the <ORG> reserved its right to determine the correct rate when the traffic started moving Upon the submissions made by learned counsel on both sides the following questions arise for our consideration Whether <ORG> was bound to give the concessional rate offered to the company under Ex dated November Whether the rate charged for the carriage of Naptha between Bajuva and Dadhevi is unreasonable Whether the <ORG> are showing undue preference or advantage in respect of other traffic and contravening the provisions of Section of the <ORG> Act We may conveniently take up third question first for consideration The relevant provisions of the Railways Act which have a material bearing on the question are these Section provides for filing complaints against <ORG> In the light of these principles the <ORG> considering the material on record held that there is no evidence produced by the Company to justify any grievance under Section We see no reason to disagree with this conclusion In fact Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant also did not seriously dispute the correctness of that finding recorded by the <ORG> It must be born in mind that the railways are run as commercial undertaking and at the same time it being an instrumentality of the <ORG> should serve the national interest as well There is however no obligation on the railways to pass on the extra amount realised by the carriage of goods to customers The counsel urged that there is no justification shown for this wide disparity in the first place These and other relevant factors have been taken into account by the <ORG> for rejecting the demand of the company for parity in freights This Court cannot interfere with such a finding in this appeal under Article of the Constitution On the merits also we see no justification to demand that <ORG> should take the same freight rate as that of crude oil CS was a definite encouragement to the complainant to set up the Kota factory there is no evidence on record to show that the withdrawal of the concession by Ex It is true that is the formative period it was generally said that the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked by the promisee unless he has suffered detriment or prejudice It was often said simply that the party asserting the estoppel must have been induced to act to his detriment All that is now required is that the party asserting the estoppel must have acted upon the assurance given to him Must have relied upon the representation made to him It is not necessary to prove further any damage detriment or prejudice to the party asserting the estoppel This position has been made clear by Lord <NAME> himself in his article Recent Developments in the Doctrine of Consideration <ORG> Vol Just a contract is different from tort and from estoppel so also in the sphere now under discussion promises may give rise to a different equity from other conduct It should not be necessary for the other party to show that he acted to his detriment in reliance on the promise There he said It is often said simply that the party asserting the estoppel must have been induced to act to his detriment Although substantially such a statement is correct and leads to no misunderstanding it does not bring out clearly the basal purpose of the doctrine That purpose is to avoid or pre vent a detriment to the party asserting the estoppel by compelling the opposite party to adhere to the assumption upon which the former acted or abstained from acting This means that the real detriment or harm from which the law seeks to give protection is that which would flow from the change of position if the assumption were deserted that led to it So long as the assumption is adhered to the party who altered his situation upon the faith of it cannot complain His complaint is that when afterwards the other party makes a different state of affairs the basis of an assertion of right against him then if it is allowed his own original change of position will operate as a detriment His action or inaction must be such that if the assumption upon which he proceeded were shown to be wrong and an inconsistent state of affairs were accepted as the foundation of the rights and duties of himself and the opposite party the consequence would be to make his original act or failure to act a source of prejudice This passage was referred to with approval by Lord <NAME> in Central Newbury Car Auction Ltd Unity Finance Ltd All at The said passage has also been quoted with approval by <NAME> as he then was in <ORG> state of Ors The learned Judge then said We do not think that in order to invoke the doctrine of promissory estoppel it is necessary for the promisee to show that he suffered detriment as a result of acting in reliance on the promise But we may make it clear that if by detriment we mean injustice to the promisee which could result if the promisor were to recede from his promise then detriment would certainly come in as a necessary ingredient The detriment in such a case is not some prejudice suffered by the promisee by acting on the promise but the prejudice which would be caused to the promisee if the promisor were allowed to go back on the promise It therefore requires that he who seeks equity must do equity As in the instant case there was one representation by <ORG> to supply power to the company at concessional rate There was another representation from the same Govern <NAME> ment to exempt the company from payment of tax for certain period In this context we may usefully refer to the following passage from Halsbury Laws of England Halsbury Laws of England th Edn We therefore agree with the conclusion of the <ORG> but not for all the reasons stated however we make no order as to costs
