HEADNOTE This appeal by special leave was directed against the order of <ORG> asking <ORG> under Of the Income tax Act to submit a supplementary statement of case on points which were never raised by the parties nor decided by the Income tax Authorities or the <ORG> <ORG> held that the mere receipt of the cheques by post at Bhavnagar was not conclusive in absence of a further finding as to whether the cheques were sent by post without any request express or implied having been made by the assessee and observed as follows But we cannot shut out the necessary inquiry which even from our own point of view is necessary to be made in order that we should satisfactorily answer the question raised in the Reference of the Income tax Act we have a right independently of the conduct of the parties to direct the <ORG> to state further facts so that we may properly exercise our advisory jurisdiction The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal with special leave arises out of a judgment and order of <ORG> at Bombay dated September delivered in Income Tax Reference No of made by <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> to <ORG> under of the Indian Income tax Act XI of hereinafter referred to as the Act whereby <ORG> directed the <ORG> to submit a supplementary statement of case on the points mentioned therein He held that the income amounting to Rs There was no dispute in regard to the sale proceeds received through <ORG> The appellant had contended that the amounts had been received at Bhavanagar by cheques drawn on banks in British India The Appellant preferred appeals to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner Ahmedabad Range against this order of the Income tax Officer for the said two assessment years The <ORG> stated inter alia as follows There is no evidence that the cheques from <ORG> were received in Bhavnagar In respect of the assessment year the <ORG> after directing the Income tax Officer to verify the correctness of the figure of the amounts received by the appellant by cheques from the Government i It may be pointed out that neither did the Incometax Officer when the proceedings were before him or when the proceedings were before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner nor did the <ORG> when the proceedings were before the Tribunal at any stage contend that the cheques aggregating to the said amounts in the said two years were not received at Bhavnagar because of the alleged posting of the cheques in British India and or by reason of the allega tion that the cheques were sent by post and or that the post office was the agent of the appellant and that too in spite of the decision in the case of <ORG> which decision had already been pronounced by then and where the said question had been debated and argued by the <ORG> The only ground urged by the <ORG> at all material stages was that because the amounts which were received from the merchants or the Government were received by cheques drawn on Banks in British India which were ultimately encashed in British India the monies could not be said to have been received in Bhavnagar though the cheques were in fact received at Bhavnagar In the said applications the facts which were admitted and or found by the Tribunal and which were necessary for drawing up a statement of the case were stated as under Regarding items of Rs received from <ORG> in the accounting years relevant to the assessment for and respectively the amounts were received by cheques drawn on <ORG> No evidence was produced by the assessee at any stage even before <ORG> that the cheques were received at Bhavnagar nor was any evidence produced to show that these cheques were received as unconditional discharge of debtor liability received in the accounting years relevant to the assessments for and respectively the relevant facts are that the company received these cheques and sent them to their bankers in Ahmedabad for collection The <ORG> held that the sale proceeds were received at Bhav nagar on the basis of <ORG> decision in the Kirloskar Brothers case without enquiring as to whether the cheques were received by the company in unconditional discharge of the drawer liability of the fact that the assessees in the said two appeals had expressly requested the <ORG> to remit the amounts by cheques the assessees had constituted <ORG> their agent to receive on their respective behaves the said cheques which were posted by the <ORG> at Delhi having addressed them to the assessees outside British India The two letters showing that the cheques from <ORG> were received by post were evidently put in with a view to show that the order of the <ORG> dated July was correct in making the presumption that the letters containing the cheques were addressed to the appellant at Bhavnagar and in holding that the cheques were received from the <ORG> at Bhavnagar There was no other reason so far as the record then stood to make any reference to the said two letters Out of the facts stated above the <ORG> raised the following question of law Whether the receipt of the cheques in Bhavnagar amounted to receipt of sale proceeds in Bhavnagar The said Reference was heard by <ORG> on September and judgment was delivered the same day whereby <ORG> held that it was not possible to answer the question in the absence of materials as to whether the cheques which were received in Bhavnagar were posted by the Government at the request of the appellant and <ORG> observed The question that has been submitted to us by the <ORG> is whether the receipt of the cheques in Bhavnagar amounted to receipt of sale proceeds in Bhavnagar This question over looks the important aspect which was dealt with both by us in <NAME> case and also by <ORG> Unless we are in a position to say whether the cheques were sent to Bhavnagar by post without there being a request express or implied by the assessee the mere receipt of the cheques in Bhavnagar would not constitute receipt of sale proceeds in Bhavnagar When we look at the statement of the case there is no reference at all to this aspect of the case But it observed in this context But we cannot shut out the necessary inquiry which even from our own point of view is necessary to be made in order that we should satisfactorily answer the question raised in the Reference of the Income tax Act we have a right independently of the conduct of the parties to direct the <ORG> to state further facts so that we may properly exercise our advisory jurisdiction The appellant filed a petition in <ORG> on November for the grant of a certificate under A of the Act to appeal to this Court from the said judgment and order of <ORG> This application was dismissed by <ORG> by its order dated December with the result that the appellant presented on December a petition in this Court for special leave to appeal from the said judgment of <ORG> dated September This Court by its order dated March granted special leave to appeal such leave being limited to the question whether <ORG> had jurisdiction under section of the Act to call for a supplemental statement of case This is how the appeal has come up for hearing and final disposal before us The appeal raises an important question as to the nature scope and extent of the jurisdiction vested in <ORG> under section of the Act and we shall now address ourselves to that question Within sixty days of the date upon which he is served with notice of an order under sub section of section the assessee or the Commissioner may by application in the prescribed form accompanied where application is made by the assessee by a fee of one hundred rupees require <ORG> to refer to <ORG> any question of law arising out of such order and <ORG> shall within ninety days of the receipt of such application draw up a statement of the case and refer it to <ORG> Provided that if in the exercise of its powers under sub section <ORG> refuses to state a case which it has been required by the assessee to state the assessee may within thirty days from the date on which he receives notice of the refusal to state the case withdraw his application and if he does so the fee paid shall be refunded If on any application being made under sub <ORG> refuses to state the case on the ground that no question of law arises the assessee or the Commissioner as the case may be may within six months from the date on which he is served with notice of the refusal apply to <ORG> and <ORG> may if it is not satisfied of the correctness of the decision of <ORG> require <ORG> to state the case and to refer it and on receipt of any such requisition <ORG> shall state the case and refer it accordingly If <ORG> is not satisfied that the statements in a case referred under this section are sufficient to enable it to determine the question raised thereby the <ORG> may refer the case back to <ORG> to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the <ORG> may direct in that behalf The <ORG> no doubt has got before it he facts which are admitted and or found by the <ORG> and which are necessary for drawing up a statement of the case and it is the facts admitted and or found by it that would form the basis on which the statement of case would be drawn and references of the question of law made by the <ORG> to <ORG> If such facts were not there whether in the order of the <ORG> or in the record before it there would certainly not be any foundation for the raising of any question of law either in the abstract or otherwise and it is only a question of law which would arise out of such facts which are admitted and or found by the <ORG> that would be the substratum of the reference to <ORG> Section which gives the power to <ORG> to require the <ORG> to state the case and refer the question of law to it also proceeds on the same basis and even where <ORG> exercises the power under it can only require the <ORG> to state the case on any question of law arising out of such order The scope and subject matter of the reference under therefore is co extensive with that of the reference under of the Act and <ORG> has no power or jurisdiction under to travel beyond the ambit of Section comes into play only when the <ORG> refuses to state the case on the ground that no question of law arises and if <ORG> is not satisfied of the correctness of the decision of the <ORG> it has got the power and jurisdiction to require the <ORG> to state the case and refer the same to it On the conditions of and being thus complied with the statement of case has to be drawn up by the <ORG> and the question of law arising out of its order referred to <ORG> for its opinion This statement of case which is based as stated above on the facts which are admitted and or found by the <ORG> may not contain sufficient material to enable <ORG> to determine the question raised thereby and in that case <ORG> under is vested with the jurisdiction to refer the case back to the <ORG> to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the <ORG> may direct in that behalf only for the purpose of determining the question referred to it If under and the statement of case has to be drawn up on the basis of the facts which are admitted and or found by the <ORG> and this is the requirement also of para of the prescribed form the scope of such statement of case cannot in our opinion be in any manner enlarged by the power which is given to <ORG> under to make such additions thereto or alterations therein in the statement of case as the <ORG> may direct in that behalf In order to satisfactorily discharge that advisory jurisdiction <ORG> must have before it all the facts which are admitted and or found by the <ORG> properly set out in the Statements in the case Even though the terms of are wide enough to comprise such additions thereto or alterations therein as the <ORG> may direct in that behalf the scope of such directions has got to be read in the context of and in conjunction with the provisions of and and under the guise of that direction <ORG> cannot refer the case back to the <ORG> to find new facts or embark upon a new line of enquiry which would enable either the assessee or the Commissioner to make out a case which had never been made during the course of the proceedings before the Income tax authorities or the <ORG> so far The practice followed in this Court in references under section of the Act has always been to limit the party at whose instance a reference has been made to the points raised and canvassed before the <ORG> In hearing a reference under section this <ORG> does not sit in appeal from the assessment and it is not called upon to give its advice on matters which the <ORG> was not asked to decide and which the <ORG> neither decided nor included in the statement of case for the opinion of this <ORG> We quite appreciate the difficulty of the <ORG> as it has to deal with a large number of cases and it may be that in many cases the decision may seem obvious to the <ORG> and it might dispose of an appeal by a very short order A statement of the case is not intended for the purpose of buttressing up the order of the Appellate <ORG> or further fortifying it by requisitioning to its aid materials and evidence which were not before the <ORG> but which it discovers by investigation after the order was passed in appeal Much more so would be the case where no such material and evidence were at all in existence when <ORG> in exercise of its jurisdiction under of the Act referred the case back to the <ORG> and asked it to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the <ORG> may direct in order to enable it to determine the question raised thereby We have merely the jurisdiction to answer the question of law referred to us and we are not concerned with any questions which are pure questions of fact or its determination by the <ORG> The learned Judges refused to accede to this contention for the reason that no such appli cation was made before the <ORG> and that it was a point which ought not to be allowed to be taken for the first time in <ORG> Surely before the <ORG> there must have been a discussion as to the position with reference to the movables as distinct from the immovables under the transaction and if the appellant considered that in view of that distinction further enquiry was called for it was incumbent upon it to apply to the <ORG> itself to order it and not having done so it had no right to call upon <ORG> to remand the matter for that purpose If there is no power in <ORG> to remand the case to the <ORG> for fresh findings of facts on further enquiry in the manner stated above much less would <ORG> have the power while exercising its jurisdiction under of the Act to I refer the case back to the <ORG> to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the Court may direct as would require the <ORG> to embark upon a fresh line of enquiry which had never been canvassed at any time before the Income tax authorities or the <ORG> in the first instance and record fresh findings on evidence adduced by the parties in that behalf The matter then went back to another Commissioner who instead of re stating the case as he was ordered by <ORG> to do sent up a letter to <ORG> stating that he had not heard the party in regard to the opinion of the Commissioner and that in any event he should not consider that he had power within to vary an opinion given under if no new facts were admitted it is not open to <ORG> in the exercise of its jurisdiction under of the Act to raise a new question and to require the <ORG> to entertain a fresh line of enquiry hear the parties in regard to the same and record fresh finding of fact which would enable either the assessee or the Commissioner to advance a case which had never been made by it before the Income tax authorities or the <ORG> and which therefore could not be said to arise out of the order of the <ORG> the nature scope and extent of the jurisdiction of <ORG> under of the Act was not specific ally discussed and the only order which was passed was that the case be remanded to <ORG> for disposal after taking such action under sub section of of the Act as <ORG> might think fit in the light of the judgment The same observations which we have made earlier while discussing the case of Commissioner of <ORG> <NAME> would apply to this case also and the observations of <ORG> really do not militate against the position as we have laid down above The question of law which was referred by the <ORG> to <ORG> for its decision was Whether the receipt of the cheques at Bhavnagar amounted to receipts of sale proceeds in Bhavnagar and it was only based on the facts admitted and or found by the <ORG> which had relevance only to that question and not to the question which was sought to be mooted by <ORG> in its judgment under appeal We are therefore of opinion that <ORG> was in error in not deciding the reference before it and answering the question on the facts disclosed in the statement of case
