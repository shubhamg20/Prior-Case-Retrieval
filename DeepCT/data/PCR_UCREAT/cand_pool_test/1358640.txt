This appeal by special leave is directed against a judgment dated October of <ORG> and Haryana On October the appellants filed a suit for permanent injunction restraining the defendant <ORG> from realising the profession tax demanded by it per letters Nos to dated May amounting to Rs The appellants challenged the validity of the assessment contending that construed in the light of the definition given in Section of the Punjab General Clauses Act the term person occurring in Section of the Punjab Municipal Act includes a firm and since the trade carried on by the firm is one the tax could be levied only on the firm and not on the partners individually The learned single Judge who heard the appeal affirmed the judgment and decree of the first appellate court on the reasoning which may be summed up as under The term person in Section of the Municipal Act interpreted in the light of the definition given in Section of the Punjab General Clauses Act includes a partnership Under Clause of Section of the Municipal Act the basis on which the liability to pay tax arises is the trade profession or business and if the trade and business is one carried on by several persons collectively in partnership then the partnership alone and not the individual partners are liable to pay the tax that the liability on the partners will fall twice which is not contemplated by the scheme and language of the Municipal Act even though all the partners are jointly and severally liable to any tax for the partnership business In support of his conclusion that the tax was on trade and not on persons the learned Judge by way of analogy referred to Clauses a and of Sub section Before us Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the plaintiff appellants has adopted the reasons given by the learned Single judge of <ORG> His argument is that if the interpretation placed by <ORG> of <ORG> is allowed to stand it will lead to anamolous and unconstitutional results In these premises it is contended that an interpretation of Section which may lead to unconstitutional or irrational results should be eschewed With regard to the question of jurisdiction it is contended that since <ORG> had in the exercise of its powers clearly acted beyond its jurisdiction the suit was maintainable in <ORG> Explanation A person in the service or person holding an office under <ORG> or <ORG> or a local or other public authority shall be deemed to be practising a profession within the meaning of this sub section Controversy thus becomes narrowed down into the issue Whether persons collectively doing business in partnership in the municipality fulfil the second condition That is to say such persons carry on any trade or ceiling in the municipality within the contemplation of Clause There is nothing in the language of Section or the scheme of the Municipal Act which warrants the construction that persons who are carrying on a trade in association or partner ship with each other cannot be individually taxed under Clause of Section To hold that persons who are collectively carrying on a trade in the municipality cannot be taxed individually could be to read into the statute words which are not there There are no words in Clause or elsewhere in the statute which expressly or by necessary implication exclude or exempt persons carrying on a trade collectively in the municipality from being taxed as individuals Thus both the conditions necessary for levying a tax under Clause of Sub section of Section of the Municipal Act existed in this case In the view we take we do not think it necessary to go further into the question whether the definition of person given in Section of the Punjab General Clauses Act can be imported into the statute under consideration so as to include a contractual firm also within the purview of the expression persons used in Clause of Section Indeed the entire effort to import the definition of person given in the General Clauses Act into Section of the Municipal Act is directed to find a foundation for the argument that the construction adopted by <ORG> could lead to double taxation and even unconstitutional results The arguments advanced on behalf of the appellants on this aspect of the matter are merely hypothetical and speculative This takes us to the second question whether <ORG> had jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit Then there is a proviso to this sub section which says hat when the Deputy Commissioner or such other officer as aforesaid is or was when the tax was imposed a member of the <ORG> the appeal shall lie to the Commissioner of the <ORG> From a conjoint reading of Sections and it is plain that the Municipal Act gives a special and particular remedy for the person aggrieved by an assessment of tax under this Act irrespective of whether the grievance relates to the rate or quantum of tax or the principle of assessment The Act further provides a particular forum and a specific mode of having this remedy which is analogous to that provided in Section of the Indian Income tax Act Section forbids in clear terms the person aggrieved by an assessment from seeking his remedy in any other forum or in any other manner than that provided in the Municipal Act It is well recognised that there a Revenue Statute provides for a person aggrieved by an assessment thereunder a particular remedy to be sought in a particular forum in a particular way it must be sought in a particular form in a particular way it must be sought in that form and in that manner and all other forums and modes of seeking it are excluded Construed in the light of this principle it is clear that Sections and of the Municipal Act bar by inevitable implication the jurisdiction of <ORG> where the grievance of the party relates to an assessment or the principle of assessment under this Act The <ORG> inter alia contended that <NAME> was not common salt and <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit The trial court held that <NAME> was not common salt within the meaning of item of the schedule that the imposition of tax on it under item of the Schedule was illegal and therefore <ORG> had jurisdiction to hear and determine the suit by virtue of Section of the CPC On appeal <ORG> held that <ORG> has as jurisdiction and dismissed the suit The assessee came in appeal to this Court by certificate granted by <ORG> and contended that since the impugned levy was not made under the Municipal Act but in derogation thereof <ORG> had jurisdiction to entertain and determine the suit By no stretch of imagination can it be said in the facts and circumstances of the case that in assessing the appellants individually and not collectively to the tax in question <ORG> abused its powers under the Act It follows therefore that <ORG> jurisdiction to entertain and decide the suit was barred even if the dispute raised therein related to the principle of assessment to be followed
