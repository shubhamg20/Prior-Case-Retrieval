The appellant came to this Court with certificate The questions that fell for consideration were i whether the word DROPOVIT was deceptively similar to the word PROTOVIT and thus offended the provision of of the Trade and Merchandise Act ii whether the word DROPOVIT was an invented or a descriptive word for the purpose of of the Act It is not right to take a portion of the word and say that because that portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the other case there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion the corresponding letters and in PROTOVIT could not possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and the words were so dissimilar that there was no reasonable probability of confusion between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of view It was true that the word DROPOVIT was coined out of words commonly used by and known to ordinary persons knowing English But the resulting combination produced a new word a newly coined word which did not remind an ordinary person knowing English of the original words out of which it was coined unless he was so told or unless at least he devoted some thought to it Appeal from the judgment and order dated August of <ORG> in Appeal No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal is brought by certificate from the judgment of <ORG> dated August in application no of upholding in part the judgment of Mr Justice <NAME> dated December in Miscellaneous Petition No of On December the appellant applied for registration of its trade mark PROTOVIT The appellant thereafter used that mark on multi vitamin preparations in liquid tablet forms and its goods are being sold under that mark at least since the year The appellant took the matter in appeal to <ORG> The appellant preferred an appeal under Letters Patent but the appeal was dismissed by a Division Bench consisting of Chief Justice <NAME> and <NAME> on August But it is not disputed that under of this Act the decision of this case is governed by the provisions of Act no of hereinafter called the Act Section reads On application made in the prescribed manner to <ORG> or to the Registrar by any person aggrieved the tribunal may make such order as it may think fit for cancelling or varying the registration of a trade mark on the ground of any contravention or failure to observe a condition entered on the register in relation thereto be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion The first question to be considered in this appeal is whether the word DROPOVIT is deceptively similar to the word PROTOVIT and offends the provision of of the Act The difference is this When you deceive a man you tell him a lie You may indeed tell him the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth but still you may cause confusion in his mind not by any fault of yours but because he has not the knowledge or ability to It is not right to take a portion of the word and say that because that portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the other case there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion appellant indicate that the last three letters VIT is a well known common abbreviation used in the pharmaceutical trade to denote Vitamin preparations If greater regard is paid to the uncommon element in these two words it is difficult to hold that one will be mistaken for or confused with the other The letters and in DROPOVIT and the corresponding letters and in PROTOVIT cannot possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and the words are so dissimilar that there is no reasonable probability of confusion between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of view In <ORG> counsel for the respondent made a statement that the respondent was willing that the Court should direct in exercise of its powers under that the Registrar should limit the respondent trade mark DROPOVIT to medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations and substances containing principally vitamins and that the appeal should be decided on this basis As we have already observed the evidence shows that there are as many as trade marks in <ORG> with the suffix VIT The question of confusion must hence be determined on the basis that the goods with one of the two rival trade marks would be sold only by such a licensed dealer and would not be available in any other shop Having taken into account all circumstances of the present case we are of the opinion that <ORG> and the Joint Registrar of Trade Marks were right in holding that there was no real tangible danger of confusion if respondent trade mark was allowed to continue to remain on the Register and the application for rectification made by the appellant should be dismissed A trade mark shall not be registered in Part A of the register unless it contains or consists of at least one the following essential particulars namely one or more invented words one or more words having no direct reference to the character or quality of the goods and not being according to its ordinary signification a geographical name or a surname or a personal name or any common abbreviation thereof or the name of a sect caste or tribe in India It is contended on behalf of the It must be a word having no meaning or no obvious meaning until one has been assigned to it The question arising in this case is whether the word DROPOVIT would strike an ordinary person knowing English as meaning We see no reason therefore to differ from the reasoning of <ORG> on this aspect of the case It is true that the word DROPOVIT is coined out of words commonly used by and known to ordinary persons knowing English But the resulting combination produces a new word a newly coined word which does not remind an ordinary person knowing English of the original words out of which it is coined unless he is so told or unless at least he devotes some thought to it
