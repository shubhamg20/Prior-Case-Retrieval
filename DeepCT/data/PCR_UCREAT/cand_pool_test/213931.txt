The provisions of this Section shall have effect notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any <ORG> <ORG> or other authority and notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act or in the Industrial Disputes Act or any other law for the time being in force or any practice usage or custom or any contract agreement settlement award or other instrument All public Sector banks including <ORG> come under the purview of the Payment of Bonus Act and the intention is that no bonus other than what is required to be paid under the Payment of Bonus Act shall be paid to the employee of <ORG> or of any other pubic sector bank It is proposed to make express provisions in this behalf in <ORG> Act and the enactment relating to the other public sector banks The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects The bonus which was directed to be paid was in the nature of deferred wages and the impugned legislation had the effect of freezing wages <ORG> is not vested with the power to reduce the wages and therefore the legislation is ultra vires Amendment even if accepted to be valid can only have prospective effect Unfortunately <ORG> did not take note of the Amendment Act and Custom even if it acquires a force of law can be changed as there is no fundamental right involved in any custom Bonus cannot be called deferred wages and even if it is conceded for the sake of argument that the payment of customary bonus was a condition of service after insertion of Section A by the Amendment Act the same has no operation The Amendment Act really brought in a curative provision and no retrospective effect has been given to the Amendment Act But if the words used in a statute are clear and unambiguous then the statute itself declares the intention of the legislature and in such a case it would not be permissible for a court to interpret the Statute by examining the Objects and Reasons for the Statute in question <ORG> has normally power within the frame work of the Constitution to enact legislation which modified principles enunciated by this Court as applicable to the determination of any dispute and by exercising that power the <ORG> does not perpetrate fraud on the Constitution The power to make laws includes power to give it retrospective effect at defines retrospective statutes in the following words A statute is to be deemed to be retrospective which takes away or impairs any vested right acquired under existing laws or creates a new obligation or imposes a new duty or attaches a new disability in respect to transactions or considerations already past Retrospective is somewhat ambiguous and that good deal of confusion has been caused by the fact that it is used in more senses than one In general however the <ORG> regards as retrospective any statute which operates on cases or facts coming into existence before its commencement in the sense that it affects even if for the future only the character or consequences of transactions previously entered into or of other past conduct Thus a statute is not retrospective merely because it affects existing rights nor is it retrospective merely because a part of the requisite for its action is drawn from a time and antecedents to its passing The above passage was quoted with approval by <ORG> this Court in the case of The Asstt It was observed in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Realty Co at observes that If a statute is passed for the purpose of protecting the public against some evil or abuse it may be allowed to operate retrospectively although by such operation it will deprive some person or persons of a vested right There is no quarrel and in fact in our opinion rightly that legislature cannot by a mere declaration without anything more directly overrule reverse or override a judicial decision However it may at any time in exercise of the plenary powers conferred on it by the Constitution render a judicial decision ineffective by enacting a valid law on a topic within its legislative field fundamentally altering or changing with retrospective curative or neutralizing effect the condition on which such decision is based see I Saxena etc There is a distinction between encroachment on the judicial power and nullification of the effect of a judicial decision by changing the law retrospectively Even assuming that the <ORG> in a given case has an ulterior motive in moving a legislation that motive cannot render the passing of the law mala fide The amendment made by the impugned enactments is to the State <ORG> Act and other statutes relating to some other <ORG>s The <ORG> undoubtedly has power in terms of Section of the State <ORG> Act to change the conditions of service of those of its employees who had earlier served with Imperial <ORG> of India So far as other employees are concerned Section of the Act empowers the <ORG> to determine terms and conditions of their service The <ORG> has power to legislate on the topic of bonus and it is not precluded from legislating on that topic other than the Bonus Act There is nothing to show that the <ORG> intended to exercise appellate powers over the <ORG> or <ORG> by enacting the amending Act In view of what has been stated above the conclusion is inevitable that <ORG> judgment does not suffer from any infirmity to warrant interference The appeal is accordingly dismissed with no orders as to costs
