The facts necessary for understanding the contentions of the parties are these Against the decree passed in the suit the petitioners preferred an appeal On behalf of the appellants it is urged that since the decree has been set aside by <ORG> there is no jurisdiction for the <ORG> to confirm the sale This has not been done in this case because the petitioners contend that there is no necessity for making the deposit as the decree has been set aside on the date of the petition The respondent raises also a preliminary objection that no second appeal lies but the appellant has filed also a civil revision petition The question to be decided with reference to the first prayer of the appellants in the petition is whether the decree i under which the sale took place should still be subsisting at the time of the confirmation for the sale to be confirmed Section of the present Code runs as follows Where immovable property is sold in execution of a decree and such sale has become absolute the property shall be deemed to have vested in the purchaser from the time when the property is sold and not from the time when the sale becomes absolute Such certificate shall bear the date of the confirmation of the sale and so far as regards the parties to the suit and persons claiming through or under them the title to the property sold shall vest in the purchaser from the date of such certificate and not before provided that the decree under which the sale took place was still subsisting at that date There are two important differences between Section of the present Code and the corresponding portion of Section of the Code of The other difference is that the statement in the old section that the property vests in the purchaser from the date of the certificate and not before was subject to a proviso that the decree under which the sale took place was still subsisting at that date Mr <NAME> argues that the omission of the proviso in Section does not introduce any change in the law that the existence of the decree has been always a necessary condition to give jurisdiction to the <ORG> to confirm the sale that without a decree there can be no justification for the confirmation of the sale that the principle is a general rule of jurisprudence that has always been recognised in the Civil Procedure Codes that that being so the <ORG> thought that it was unnecessary to state it specifically and therefore dropped it out in the new Act of Having regard to the arguments of Mr <NAME> which I shall presently refer to Mr <NAME> also contends that there is no connection between the proviso and the time when the property vests in the purchaser Mr <NAME> arguments may be summarised as follows a Title to property vested in the purchaser from the date of the certificate under Section of the Act of in order that title may start from that date it is a necessary preliminary that there should be a subsisting decree at that date and this was the reason why the <ORG> introduced the proviso that the decree under which the sale took place should be subsisting at that date Under the present Code the title to the property vests in the purchaser when the sale becomes absolute from the time when the property is sold and not from the date when the sale becomes absolute and so it will be sufficient to give title to the purchaser if there is a subsisting decree at the date of the sale The existence of a decree at the date when the sale becomes absolute being thus unnecessary it is argued that the proviso was dropped in the present Code and therefore the sale can be confirmed even though there is no subsisting decree at the date of the confirmation This argument is met by Mr <NAME> Aiyar as already stated by saying that even before the Act of the rule was that the title to the property vested in the purchaser from the time of the sale and notwithstanding that law the existence of the rule contained in the proviso was then recognised Another part of Mr <NAME> argument has reference to Order Rule Civil Procedure Code which says that where no application has been made under Rules or or where such application is made and disallowed the <ORG> shall make an order confirming the sale It is argued that the language of the rule is imperative and that if after a sale no application has been made to set it aside as in the present case then the <ORG> is bound to confirm the sale and cannot refuse to do so on the ground that the decree has been set aside and does not exist or on any other ground I shall first consider the history of the proviso and then examine whether there is any necessary connection between the rule contained in it and the time when the property becomes vested in the purchaser and lastly deal with the argument based on Order Rule Civil Procedure Code Section states that after a sale of immovable property shall have become absolute in manner aforesaid the <ORG> shall grant a certificate to the person who may have been declared the purchaser at such sale to the effect that he has purchased the right title and interest of the defendant in the property sold and such certificate shall be taken and deemed to be a valid transfer of such right title and interest Section of the Act corresponds with Section and the first part of Section of Act VIII of Such certificate shall bear the date of the confirmation of the sale and so far as regards the parties to the suit and persons claiming through or under them the title to the property sold shall vest in the purchaser from the date of such certificate and not before provided that the decree under which the sale took place was still subsisting at that date Mr <NAME> argument already noticed is that though the proviso was first introduced by Act XII of the principle underlying it was recognised by <ORG> even before that date under the Act of and that the amendment by introducing the proviso was only stating a principle that was already recognised and that when this was found to be so later the proviso was dropped out as an unnecessary provision that therefore no change in the law has taken place and that even now the existence of a decree is absolutely necessary for the confirmation of a sale To support this contention in all its entirety the appellant will have to show not only that the principle of the proviso was recognised even before the amendment of the Act of but also that there was no necessary relation between the time when the title to property became vested in the purchaser and the rule contained in the proviso or in other words that even before the amendment when the principle of the proviso was used to be freely recognised and given effect to the title to the property of the auction purchaser used to relate to the date of the sale It was held that the <ORG> which had made the decree ceased from the moment of the reversal to have jurisdiction to take any further steps to execute the decree and that the confirmation of the sale would confer no title It is argued that in this decision even without any enactment of a proviso like the one in Section the principle was recognised and given effect to under the Act of and that it was on account of this decision the <ORG> enacted the proviso by the Amending Act XII of Therein the Committee stated We have also altered Section so as to make it clear that the title to the property sold vests from the date of the certificate only when the decree under which the sale took place was still subsisting at that date This will preclude the doubt which has we understand arisen in Bombay where a certificate was granted to an auction purchaser in ignorance of the fact that the decree under which the sale took place had been previously reversed on appeal To this argument Mr <NAME> responds that there was no settled law on that point during the operation of the Acts of and and so when the <ORG> decided to recognise the existence of the principle of the proviso by introducing the amendment it at the same time stated clearly the law relating to the time when the title of the auction purchaser would commence with the result that we find in Section the law was stated to be this that the title to the property sold shall vest in the purchaser from the date of such certificate and not before provided that the decree under which the sale took place was still subsisting at that time thus establishing an intimate relation between the time when the property vests and the condition laid down in the proviso The facts of the case are thus stated in the headnote The defendant became a purchaser at an execution sale of a share of certain property of which the plaintiff held another share partly as Zemindar and partly as putnidar the sale took place in September but the defendant did not obtain possession until confirmation of the sale in May It may appear at first sight that this decision supports Mr <NAME> view but the true scope and significance of the decision is thus explained in Mr <NAME> Commentaries on the Civil Procedure Code of see page The case was referred to a Full Bench because the decisions were conflicting on the point whether the title of the auction purchaser under a decree relates back to the date of the sale see <NAME> <NAME> or merely takes effect from the date of confirmation see <NAME> Judoonath Hazrah and it will be observed that this was not decided except for the purpose of the particular suit On the question under consideration there was no settled law under the Act of and the decision cannot be said to lay down a proposition of law applicable to all the cases By Section of the Amending Act of it was enacted that the title of the auction purchaser to the property would start from the date of the certificate and in order that it may be so formal recognition was given to the principle that there must be a decree in existence at the time of the certificate and then the proviso came to be enacted as a necessary condition upon which would depend the commencement of the title of the auction purchaser and when the law on the latter point was altered there was no need for the existence of the proviso and so it was dropped out from the new Code Order Rule provides that where no application is made under Rules or or where such application is made and disallowed the <ORG> shall make an order confirming the sale and thereupon the sale shall become absolute Under this rule the act of confirmation of sale should follow automatically after sale has taken place when no such application as is referred to in Rule was made or when such application was made and disallowed In the course of their judgment the following observations occur When once a sale has been effected a third party interest intervenes and there is nothing in this rule to suggest that it is to be disregarded That this is so is in their Lordships opinion clear under the wording of Rule which provides that in such a case i where the sale has been duly carried out if no application is made under Rule the <ORG> shall make an order confirming the sale and thereupon the sale shall become absolute It may be observed that their Lordships made no reference to cases under Rule or referred to in Rule as these had no application to the case before them The learned Judges in that case held that the private satisfaction of a decree certified in <ORG> after sale of immovable property has been held and before the confirmation is ordered does not extinguish the decree and prevent the <ORG> from confirming the sale where a third person has purchased the property bona fide at the auction sale Sub rule lays down the conditions under which alone the <ORG> is permitted to make an order setting aside the sale Later on the learned Judge observed as follows If the <ORG> had desired to refuse confirmation and veto the purchaser rights on any grounds other than those mentioned in Rules or of the Order there was nothing to prevent it from providing for such a contingency in the Code If it had intended to leave him to the mercy of the decree holder and judgment debtor by enabling them to defeat his rights and even to oust the <ORG> jurisdiction by a private pact of their own formed behind the purchaser back the Code would have expressly provided for the exercise of such a right Mr <NAME> tries to distinguish the case on the ground that it relates to a case of the private satisfaction of the debt by adjustment outside the <ORG> Regarding this argument the learned Judge <NAME> A observed as follows If the intention of the <ORG> had been to make the acquisition of title by the auction purchaser contingent upon the decree being a subsisting decree at the date of the confirmation there was no point in deleting the words to that effect from Section of the old Civil Procedure Code when Section of the new Code was in its stead enacted If that decree ceased to exist at the date of the sale there is no debt to recover and therefore the <ORG> loses its jurisdiction to sell the judgment debtor property and consequently every sale held under such circumstances must be treated as a nullity To show that confirmation of a sale can be refused on grounds other than those mentioned in Rule and therefore impliedly it can be refused if there was no subsisting decree at that time and that therefore the argument based on the language of Order Rule should not be accepted the learned Counsel for the appellant has drawn my attention to cases under Section Civil Procedure Code mentioned in Mulla Civil Procedure Code at under the heading A judgment debtor may seek to set aside a sale on grounds other than those mentioned above the grounds mentioned above being on deposit under Order Rule for material irregularity under Order Rule and for fraud under Order Rule These are instances of cases where the <ORG> held that in law there was no sale at all To such a class of cases Order Rule will not apply cases to which that rule relates being only cases of valid sale where no application is made under Rules or or where such application is made and disallowed This also may be treated as a case having regard to the fact that the <ORG> was misled into passing an order for sale where there has been no valid sale This was also a case where there was no valid sale as there was no decree justifying the sale at the time when it was held Order Rules and pre suppose a valid decree under which the sale is held and the first three rules provide for setting aside the sales and Rule says that if there be no application for setting aside the sale or such an application is made and disallowed the sale shall be confirmed Rule does not affect the power of the <ORG> to refuse to confirm a sale or make it compulsory to confirm the sale when the <ORG> finds that the sale is held under a decree which did not authorise the sale For the above reasons the first prayer in the appellants petition asking the <ORG> to refuse to confirm the sale on the ground that the decree was reversed in appeal had to be disallowed In this connection I may draw attention to the opinion expressed in <NAME> Civil Procedure Code which supports this view Under the present section therefore a sale held in execution of a decree may be confirmed in any event where the purchaser is a third party though the decree has been reversed before confirmation of the sale See Order Rule and note the words the <ORG> shall make an order confirming the sale There are various objections in granting this alternative prayer There is a still more serious objection to the grant of the appellants alternative prayer This has admittedly not been done by them in this case In this connection my attention was drawn by Mr <NAME> to the decisions in <NAME> <NAME> I Mad Petition also and if <ORG> order is wrong this Court may well interfere with it under Section Civil Procedure Code as the question involved is without doubt a question of jurisdiction namely whether the Court has jurisdiction to confirm a sale when the decree on which the sale is based has been reversed in appeal subsequent to the sale and before its confirmation But the respondent presses the preliminary objection for another reason and it is this namely that if I hold that there is no second appeal and therefore deal with the case as a Civil Revision Petition then my order will be final and not be subject to any further appeal but if I deal with the case as a second appeal then the order passed by me will be subject to a Letters Patent Appeal provided I give permission to file an appeal If the appellants petition to <ORG> is to be considered as one under Order Rule then it is clear that there is only one appeal under the Code against the order that may be passed upon it and against the appellate order only a revision under Section Civil Procedure Code can be filed and not a second appeal But the appellants have filed their application under Section Civil Procedure Code also The learned Judge ends his discussion of the question with this observation <ORG> as I understand them hold that the condition in Section Civil Procedure Code that the question should be one arising between the parties is satisfied by the question being one of a nature in which the parties to the suit are adversely interested though the person actually raising it in any particular case against one party may not be the representative of the other party In fact they gave an extended meaning to these words In this case there can be no doubt that the question for decision is one of a nature in which the auction purchaser and the judgment debtors are adversely interested and it therefore follows that the petitioners application would fall under Section Civil Procedure Code and if so an appeal against the first Court order will lie to the appellate Court and against that Court order a second appeal will lie to this Court the order passed on an application under Section being in the nature of a decree that a question arising for decision between the judgment debtor and auction purchaser does not fall under Section and the decision thereon is not appealable The appellants learned Counsel in that case accepted the preliminary objection and I therefore dismissed the second appeal
