Section gave power to the <ORG> to exempt from the operation of the Act such lands or class of lands which the <ORG> may by notification decide There was however no time fixed for the conduct of the survey The petitioners who owned forest in the <ORG> challenged the constitutional validity of the Act on the grounds that the provisions of the Act contravened Arts per acre imposed very unreasonable restrictions on the right to hold property the Act did not lay down any provision calling for a return from the assessee for an enquiry or investigation of facts before the provisional assessment was made or any right of appeal to any higher authority and in fact did not make any provision for hearing the assessee at any stage gave arbitrary power to the <ORG> to pick and choose in the matter of grant of total or partial exemption from the provisions of the Act and the tax proposed to be levied had absolutely no relation to the production capacity of the land sought to be taxed or to the income they could derive and therefore the Act had been conceived with a view to confiscating private property there being no question of any compensation being paid to those who may be expropriated as a result of the working of the Act Consequently there was no attempt at classification in the provisions of the Act and it was one of those cases where the lack of classification created inequality Section A of the Act which enabled the <ORG> to make a provisional assessment of the basic tax payable by the holder of unsurveyed land imposed unreasonable restrictions on the rights to hold property safeguarded by Art Section of the Act which vested the <ORG> with the power wholly or partially to exempt any land from the provi sions of the Act did not lay down any principle or policy for the guidance of the exercise of discretion by the <ORG> in respect of the selection contemplated by the section and was therefore discriminatory in effect and offended Art The Act was also confiscatory in character inasmuch as the provisions of the Act had the effect of eliminating the private owners through the machinery of the Act without proposing to acquire the privately owned forests in the <ORG> after satisfying the conditions laid down in Art Article of the Constitution which provided that the <ORG> shall not levy or collect a tax except by authority of law referred to a valid law and in order that the law might be valid the tax proposed to be levied must be within the legislative competence of the <ORG> imposing a tax and authorising the collection thereof and secondly the tax must be subject to the conditions laid down in Art Section even if it were considered invalid on the ground that it gave arbitrary power to the <ORG> and offended Art As there was no want of legislative competence theAct could not be assailed as a piece of colourable legislation on the ground that though in form a taxing statute it in effect was intended to expropriate lands by imposing a tax too heavy for the land to bear The Act came into force on June and the Amending Act on August The petitioners are owners of forest areas in certain parts of the State of Kerala which before the reorganisation of States formed part of the State of Madras Thus the petitioner has not the right fully to exploit the forest wealth in his forest area and has to depend upon the previous permission of the Collector In exercise of the powers given to the Collector under the Madras Act aforesaid the petitioner lessee was given permission to cut certain trees in his forest which brings to the petitioner by way of income from The Petitioner had made an application to the District Collector under the Madras Preservation of Private Forests Act for felling trees in an area of one thousand acres but the Collector was pleased to grant permission to out trees from acres only in the course of five years at the rate of acres a year These petitions have been opposed on behalf of the first respondent and the allegations and submissions made in the petitions are sought to be controverted by a counter affidavit sworn to by an Assistant Secretary of the Kerala Gover nment in <ORG> It is contended therein on behalf of the respondent that the petitions are not maintainable in as much as no fundamental rights of the petitioners have been infringed that the allegations about the income from the forest lands are not admi tted and by way of submission it is added they are irrelevant for the purposes of these petitions It is submitted that the validity of the Act has to be determined in the light of Art It is denied that the tax imposed was harsh or arbitrary or has the effect of violating the petitioner right of holding property and it was asserted that the allegations in respect of income from the forests are entirely irrelevant as the tax was not a tax on income but was an impost on land It is also stated that the areas shown in the notices served on the petitioners are based on information available to the Collector of the District and lastly it is stated that only notice has been issued calling upon the petitioners to make their representations if any to the proposed provisional assessments The assessments have not yet been made and therefore there is no question of demand of tax being enforced by coercive processes Section lays down the rate of the tax which by the Amendment has been raised to Rs of land per annum and the basic tax charged and levied at that rate shall be the tax payable to the <ORG> in lieu of any existing tax in respect of land Section preserves the right of the <ORG> to levy certain irrigation and water cesses and lays down that the Act shall not affect the power of the <ORG> to levy any rate or alter any existing rate of irrigation or water cess on any land as they deem fit Section saves the right of the <ORG> which accrued to it before the Act came into force as also the conditions of any agreement Section vests the <ORG> with the power to make rules for carrying into effect the provisions of the Act with particular reference to the power to make rules for the apportionment of the basic tax charged on certain kinds of holdings for defining the powers and duties of the officers appointed under the Act and for determining the kist instalments and the due date for the payment thereof After a regular assessment has been made any amount paid towards the provisional assessment made under sub section shall be deemed to have been paid towards the regular assessment and when the amount paid towards the provisional assessment exceeds the amount payable under the regular assessment the excess shall be refunded to the person assessed Every landholder shall pay to the Collector or other officer empowered by him in this behalf the land tax due from him on or before the day fixed for payment under the rules framed under of the Land Tax Act By A it authorises the Government to make a provisional assessment in respect of land which has not been surveyed and such provisional assessment is made payable by the person made liable under the Act It has thus the merit of brevity as also of simplicity derived from the fact that a tax is levied at a flat rate irres pective of the quality of the land and consequently of its productive capacity per acre is proposed to be levied under the Act it is further contended it imposes very unreasonable restrictions on the right to hold property and is thus an invasion on the rights guaranteed to the petitioners under Art The Act does not lay down any provision calling for a return from the assessee for any enquiry or investigation of facts before the provisional assessment is made or for any right of appeal to any higher authority from the order of provisional assessment in fact there is no provision for hearing the assessee at any stage Section quoted above gives uncanalised unlimited and arbitrary power to the Government to pick and choose in the matter of grant of total or partial exemption from the provisions of the Act Lastly it has been urged that the whole Act has been conceived with a view to confiscating private property there being no question of any compensation being paid to those who may be expropriated as a result of the working of the Act This last argument is based on the assertion that the tax proposed to be levied on private property in the State of Kerala has absolutely no relation to the paying capacity of the persons sought to be taxed with reference to the income they could derive or actually did derive from the property On behalf of the State of Kerala the learned Advocate General has argued that though in most of the cases that is to say except in seven petitions Petitions and the lands have not been surveyed the areas mentioned in the notices proposing provisional assessment have been ascertained through the local agencies of the Government Hence there was no necessity for making provision for a detailed enquiry or investigation There was therefore no need for laying down any elaborate procedure as in other instances of taxing statutes There is a presumption that the authority appointed by the Government would act bona fide and in a proper manner If there was any case of unfair dealings the matter could be brought to the <ORG> On the legal aspect of the controversy raised on behalf of the petitioners it was argued that the Act has its justification in Art Finally it was urged that the question of the amount of income derived by the petitioners from the property sought to be taxed is wholly irrelevant because the Act was not a tax on income but it was a tax on the property itself The most important question that arises for consideration in these cases in view of the stand taken by the <ORG> of Kerala is whether Art Article imposes a limitation on the taxing power of the <ORG> in so far as it provides that the <ORG> shall not levy or collect a tax except by authority of law that is to say a tax cannot be levied or collected by a mere executive fiat It has to be done by authority of law which must mean valid law In order that the law may be valid the tax proposed to be levied must be within the legislative competence of the <ORG> imposing a tax and authorising the collection thereof and secondly the tax must be subject to the conditions laid down in Art is that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the equality clause in Art It cannot be disputed that if the Act infringes the provisions of Art For the purpose of these cases we shall assume that the <ORG> <ORG> had the necessary competence to enact the law though the petitioners have seriously challenged such a competence Similarly different kinds of property may be subjected to different rates of taxation but so long as there is a rational basis for the classification Art though the <ORG> are not concerned with the policy underlying a taxing statute or whether a particular tax could not have been imposed in a different way or in a way that the <ORG> might think more just and equitable Under the Act in question we shall take a hypothetical case of a number of persons owning and possessing the same area of land It is also clear that there is no attempt at classification in the provisions of the Act of the Act quoted above particularly the latter part which vests the <ORG> with the power wholly or partially to exempt any land from the provisions of the Act is clearly discriminatory in its effect and therefore infringes Art In determining the question of the validity or otherwise of such a statute the Court will not strike down the law out of hand only because no classification appears on its face or because a discretion is given to the <ORG> to make the selection or classification but will go on to examine and ascertain if the statute has laid down any principle or policy for the guidance of the exercise of discretion by the <ORG> in the matter of the selection or classification The observations quoted above from the unanimous judgment of this Court apply with full force to the provisions of the Act There is no question of severability arising in this case because both the charging sections and authorising the <ORG> to grant exemptions from the provisions of the Act are the main provisions of the Statute which has to be declared unconstitutional of the Constitution we find that A is also equally objectionable because it imposes unreasonable restrictions on the rights to hold property safeguarded by Art It lays down detailed procedure as to notice to the proposed assessee to make a return in respect of property proposed to be taxed prescribes the authority and the procedure for hearing any objections to the liability for taxation or as to the extent of the tax proposed to be levied and finally as to the right to challenge the regularity of assessment made by recourse to proceedings in a higher <ORG> The Act thus proposes to impose a liability on land holders to pay a tax which is not to be levied on a judicial basis because the procedure to be adopted does not require a notice to be given to the proposed assessee there is no procedure for rectification of mistakes committed by <ORG> there is no procedure prescribed for obtaining the opinion of a superior <ORG> on questions of law as is generally found in all taxing statutes and no duty is cast upon <ORG> to act judicially in the matter of assessment proceedings The principal Act was passed by the legislature of the State of Travancore Cochin and the Amending Act by the legislature of the State of Kerala in which the State of Travancore Cochin had been merged The Act as amended and hereafter referred to as the Act levied a certain basic tax on all lands in the State of Kerala It appears from the preamble that the Act was passed as it was deemed necessary to provide for the levy of a low and uniform rate of basic tax on all lands in the State Section fixes the rate of the tax at per cent which works out at Rs The first ground on which the validity of the Act is challenged is that it offends the provision as to the equal protection of the laws contained in Art It is said that it is bound to happen that some owners make no income out of their lands or make a small income and they would have to pay the tax out of their pocket while the owners of better classes of lands yielding larger income would be able to pay the tax out of the income from the lands In order however to pass the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled namely i that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differential which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and ii that differential must have a rational relation to the object The question then is is that differentia intelligible and has that differentia a rational relation to the object of the Act Now it seems to me that both the tests are satisfied in the present case That is quite an intelligible basis on which to make a classification holders of varying areas of land can I find no reason Again if the tax which could be imposed on land had to be correlated to its productivity then the <ORG> would have no power to tax unproductive land and the provision in the Constitution that it would have power to tax land would to that extent be futile It seems to me that a contention leading to such a result cannot be accepted Reliance was placed for the petitioners on <ORG> <ORG> in support of the contention that a tax on land not based on its productivity violates Art I am unable to hold that this case supports the contention What had happened there was that a certain statute had imposed a tax ad valorem on all coal situated in a certain area and in assessing the tax the coal of <ORG> had been assessed by the authorities concerned at its full value while the coal of the rest of the class liable to the tax had been assessed at a lower value Then it seems to me that if the contention of the petitioners is right and land could be taxed only on its productivity for the same reason taxes on all other things would have to be correlated to the income to be derived from them In the absence of such knowledge the tax which was payable on the basis of the areas of the holdings could not be assessed on unsurveyed lands so the section provides that pending the survey the Government will have power to make a provisional assessment on unsurveyed lands The contention is that a A gives arbitrary power to the <ORG> to make a provisional assessment on any person it chooses leaving out others from the provisional assessment Section A is also attacked on the ground that it is against rules of natural justice in that it does not say that in making the provisional assessment any hearing would be given to the person sought to be assessed or requiring a return from him or giving him a right of appeal in respect of the provisional assessment made It seems to me however that if according to the rules of natural justice the assessee was entitled to a hearing an assessment made without giving him such a hearing would be bad Such a reading is not impossible in the present case as there is nothing in the Act indicating that the rules of natural justice need not be observed It was said in <NAME> man <ORG> where a statute requiring an architect to give a certain certificate which did not provide the procedure as to how the architect was to conduct himself came up for consideration that No doubt in the A it has been said In giving judicial powers to affect prejudicially the rights of person or property a statute is understood as silently implying when it does not expressly provide the condition or qualification that the power is to be exercised in accordance with the fundamental rules of judicial procedure such for instance as that which requires that before its exercise the person sought to be prejudicially affected shall have an opportunity of defend ing himself In so far as this Act confers a power on the <ORG> to discharge the judicial duty of making a provisional assessment which the petitioners say it does it must imply that the judicial process has to be observed As regards the return that seems to me not to be of much consequence This section gives power to the <ORG> to exempt from the operation of the Act such lands or class of lands as the <ORG> may by notification decide It therefore seems to me that it gives arbitrary power to the <ORG> and offends Art It may be pointed out that it is not alleged in the petitions that the <ORG> has exempted any lands or class of lands from the operation of the Act That section provides that if any difficulty arises in giving effect to the provisions of this Act the <ORG> may by order do anything not inconsistent with such provisions which appears to it to be necessary or expedient for removing the difficulty The power given under it cannot be said to be uncontrolled for it must be exercised consistently with the Act and to remove difficulties arising in giving effect to the Act The validity of the Act is also challenged on the ground that it infringes Art Now there is no dispute that the rate of tax fixed by the Act is a very low rate It is said that under the Madras Preservation of Private Forests Act Act XXVII of which applies to the lands with which we are concerned as they are situated in an area which previously formed part of the State of Madras the owners of the forests can work them only with the permission of the officer mentioned in that Act There is nothing to show that in all times to come the income from the land including the income from the forest will be less than the tax imposed on it by the Act The validity of the Act is challenged also on the ground that it offends Art If the statute is otherwise valid as I have found the present Act to be it cannot even if it deprives any person of property be said to offend Art In the present case there being in my view no want of legislative competency in the legislature which passed the Act in question the Act cannot be assailed as a piece of colourable legislation I may add that I do not accept the argument that the Act is in its nature expropriatary or that the tax imposed by it is really excessive It is conceded that <ORG> has power to impose a tax on land under entry of List in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution but it is said that land as mentioned in that entry does not include lands on which forests stand There is however no power to impose a axon forests while there is power under entry of that list to tax land Therefore it is said that there is no power to impose tax on lands on which forests stand and the Act in so far as it imposes tax on lands covered by forests which the lands of the petitioners are is hence incompetent It is not in dispute that <ORG> has no power to impose a tax on a matter with regard to which it has the power to legislate but has been given no express power to impose a tax In Shorter Oxford Dictionary one of the mean ings of forest is given as an extensive tract of land covered by trees and undergrowth sometimes intermingled with pastures
