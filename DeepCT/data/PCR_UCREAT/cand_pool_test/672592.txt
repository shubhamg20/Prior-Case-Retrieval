The question raised in this Appeal is whether the period of limitation for making deposit in an application to set aside sale of immovable property under Order XXI Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure is days from the date of sale being the period prescribed in Order XXI Rule or days from the date of sale as prescribed in Article of the Limitation Act Briefly stated the facts are as follows On th February a decree was obtained in a suit based on a promissory note executed on st January That decree was put into execution and the property of the Judgment debtor was attached and put up for sale reported in AIR Madras that there was an inconsistency in these two provisions and that the legislature should take steps to remove the inconsistency reported in held that the limitation period for making deposit in an application for setting aside sale under Order XXI Rule is days from the date of sale as prescribed under Order XXI Rule It was noted that under Article Limitation Act the period for making an application for setting aside the sale was days It was noted that in the Limitation Act was amended and the period of Limitation to file an application to set aside sale was extended from days to days This Court noticed that the Statement of Objects and Reasons in extending the period to days was as follows An application to set aside a sale in execution of a decree on deposit under Rule of Order XXI is required to be made within days from the date of the sale Experience shows that this period is too short and often causes hardship because the judgment debtors usually fail to arrange for moneys within that time In the circumstances Entry of the Schedule to the Limitation Act is being amended to increase the period of limitation to days in respect of an application to set aside a sale in execution of a decree The advantage of the increased period of limitation will also be available to an application under Rule or Rule of Order XXI to set aside a sale in execution of a decree It was however held that Order XXI Rule and Article Limitation Act operated in different fields and that there was no repugnancy between the two Assuming there is a defect or an omission in the words used by the legislature the court would not go to its aid to correct or make up the deficiency The court cannot add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there especially when the literal reading produces an intelligible result Where the language of the statute leads to manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the enactment the court can of course adopt a construction which will carry out the obvious intention of the legislature We see no merit in the argument that Article must override Rule of Order XXI in respect of limitation That object was accomplished by prescribing a longer period for filing an application to set aside a sale in execution of a decree In no other respect did the legislature evince an intention to extend the period prescribed for making the deposit When this Special Leave Petition reached hearing on th September another three Judge Bench of this Court did not agree with the view expressed in <NAME> case That Bench therefore referred the matter to a five Judge Bench for considering the correctness of the view taken in <NAME> case We therefore refer this matter to a five judge bench for considering the correctness of the view taken in that case and for the purpose direct that the papers of this case be laid before Hon ble the I for constituting a five judge bench Under these circumstances this matter has come before <ORG> of five Judges for deciding the question mentioned above Mr <NAME> relied heavily on <NAME> case He submitted that even though the legislature intended to extend time to make deposit they did not do so He frankly admitted that if the language of the statute leads to a manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the enactment the <ORG> could adopt a construction which would carry out the obvious intention of the legislature He submitted that in the construction of the two provisions i Order XXI Rule and Article Limitation Act there was no contradiction or ambiguity or defect or omission He submitted that this was a matter exclusively within the domain of legislation by <ORG> and the <ORG> could not presume deficiency and supply the omission He relied on the decision of this Court in <NAME> case and submitted that there was an apparent conflict He submitted that the Courts must give an interpretation which would give effect to the intention of the legislature We have considered the submissions made by the parties The settled principles of interpretation are that the <ORG> must proceed on the assumption that the legislature did not make a mistake and that it did what it intended to do The <ORG> must as far as possible adopt a construction which will carry out the obvious intention of the legislature Undoubtedly if there is a defect or an omission in the words used by the legislature the <ORG> would not go to its aid to correct or make up the deficiency The <ORG> could not add words to a statute or read words into it which are not there especially when the literal reading produces an intelligible result If the rationale in <NAME> case is accepted there is a manifest contradiction Order XXI Rule provides that an application to set aside sale can be made if the amounts mentioned therein are deposited The Limitation Act also prescribes no period for making a deposit However Article Limitation Act prescribes a period within which an application to set aside a sale should be made Unless there was a period prescribed for making a deposit the time to make the deposit would be the same as that for making the application This is so because if an application is made beyond the period of limitation then a deposit made at that time or after that period would be of no use The relevant portion of Order XXI Rule reads as follows Where such application is made and allowed and where in the case of an application under Rule the deposit required by that rule is made within days from the date of sale the <ORG> shall make an order setting aside the sale The question then would be whether by merely amending Article Limitation Act the legislature has achieved the object for which it increased the period of limitation to file an application to set aside sale Having given our careful consideration to the question we are of the opinion that there is no anomaly and that there are no different periods of limitation for making deposits and or filing an application for setting aside the sale It is by virtue of Order XXI Rule that an application for setting aside a sale and a deposit can be made Thus an application can be made within the period prescribed under Article Limitation Act In our view therefore the view expressed in <NAME> case that Order XXI Rule prescribes a period of limitation for making a deposit is not correct In this view of the matter we see no merits in the Appeal
