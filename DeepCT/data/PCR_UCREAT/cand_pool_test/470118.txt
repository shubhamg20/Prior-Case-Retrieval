The respondent who ranked and in the list filed a petition for the issue of a mandamus claiming that since there were vacancies the appellant was not entitled to fill up only seven The appellant justified their action on the ground that in the interest of maintaining high standards of judicial competence they were not prevented from fixing a higher standard while making the actual appointment Allowing the appeal to this Court HELD In order that mandamus may issue to compel an authority to do something it must be shown that the statute imposes a legal duty on that authority and that the aggrieved party had a legal right under the statute to enforce its performance The advertisement that there were vacancies did not give the respondent a right to be appointed merely because there are vacancies or a list had been prepared There was nothing arbitrary in fixing for the purpose of selection because <ORG> itself intimated such a view to the Punjab <ORG> That was a Writ Petition filed by respondents to for a mandamus Respondents who ranked and respectively in that list did not get an order of appointment although there were vacancies The reason for not making the appointments was that in the view of <ORG> which was the same as that of <ORG> previously intimated to <ORG> candidates getting less than of marks in the examination should not be appointed as Subordinate Judges in the interest of maintaining high standards of competence in Judicial Service Respondents to who expected to be appointed filed the petition claiming that since there were vacancies and they had the necessary qualifications for appointment <ORG> was not entitled to pick and choose only seven out of them for appointment because to do so would be to prescribe a standard which was not contemplated by the rules but was against them The appellant on the other hand contended that the rules did not oblige them to fill in all the vacancies and it was open to them the <ORG> to appoint the first seven candidates front the list in the interest of maintaining high standards There was no question of picking and choosing <ORG> agreed with the contention of the <ORG> that merely because the advertisement was for filling vacancies the first candidates in the list had no right to be appointed in the posts but held that as long as there are requisite number of vacancies unfilled and qualified candidates were available those candidates had a legal right to be selected under rule It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the above finding against the <ORG> was erroneous Part deals with the preparation and submission of rolls of those who are qualified under Part A ii Candidates will be selected for appointment strictly in the order in which they have been placed by <ORG> in the list of those who have qualified under rule It will be seen from this that the function under the rules given to <ORG> was to hold the examination and then prepare a list strictly in accordance with merit on the basis of the marks received in the examination and this list was to be published in <ORG> There is no question of <ORG> making any recommendations They show that the examination is the final test apart from medical examination as per rule in Part for a candidate appointment to the post of the Sub ordinate Judge and once the list is prepared by <ORG><ORG> strict in order of merit neither the <ORG> mission nor the <ORG> nor <ORG> can depart from the order of merit given in the list except where reservations have been made in favour of backward classes and Scheduled castes and tribes in accordance with rule ii The advertisement that there are vacancies to be filled does not also give him a right to be appointed It appears that in the present case <ORG> had sent up the rolls of the first candidates because the <ORG> had been informed that there are vacancies This will clearly go to show that <ORG> itself had recommended earlier to <ORG> that only candidates securing marks or more should be appointed as Subordinate Judges and <ORG> in the interest of maintaining high standards in the service had agreed with that opinion It agrees that the advertisement mentioning vacancies did not give a right to any candidate to be appointed to the post of a Subordinate Judge Even so it somehow persuaded itself to spell out a right in the candidates because in fact there were vacancies At one place it was stated so long as there are the number of vacancies to be filled in and there are qualified candidates in the list forwarded by <ORG> along with their Rolls they have got a legal right to be selected under rule ii in Part There is no constraint that the <ORG> shall make an appointment of a Subordinate Judge either because there are vacancies or because a list of candidates has been prepared and is in existence Since there is no legal duty on <ORG> to appoint all the persons who are in the list and the petitioners have no legal right under the rules to enforce its performance the petition is clearly misconceived It was however contended by Dr <NAME> on behalf of the respondents that since rule of Part makes candidates who obtained per cent or more in the competitive examination eligible for appointment <ORG> had no right to introduce a new rule by which they can restrict the appointments to only those who have scored not less than It is contended that <ORG> have acted arbitrarily in fixing per cent as the minimum for selection and this is contrary to the rule referred to above The argument has no force There is nothing arbitrary in fixing the score of for the purpose of selection because that was the view of <ORG> also previously intimated to the Punjab <ORG> on which the Haryana <ORG> thought fit to act that <ORG> had somehow contravened rule of Part The appeal must therefore be allowed and the order passed by <ORG> set aside
