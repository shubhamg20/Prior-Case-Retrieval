ANUSUYA DEVI DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> RAMASWAMI CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC ACT Income tax Act and question not raised before <ORG> either in appeal or application to state a case If <ORG> can direct reference on such question If <ORG> must answer question referred Power to reframe question and call for additional statement from <ORG> when to be exercised There were proceedings for re assessment of the total income of the assessee wherein it was stated before the Income tax Officer on behalf of the respondent that during the previous years her husband was giving gifts to the respondent and was also setting apart money exclusively for her and their children and that the fund so accumulated amounting to Rs The respondent then filed an application under to state a case to the <ORG> The <ORG> thereafter heard the reference and decided in favour of the assessee holding that the <ORG> ignored a part of the declaration made by the respondent that high denomination notes were received from the bank in Calcutta in September no opportunity was given by the <ORG> to the respondent to clear up the discrepancies in her statements made at the time of the disclosure of the high denomination notes and before the Income tax Officer and it was not open to the <ORG> hearing a reference under to hold contrary to the decision recorded at the time when the <ORG> was directed to state the case on a question that the question did not arise out of the order of the <ORG> The statement was made for the first time in the petition under The plea of want of opportunity was not raised before the <ORG> and therefore the validity of the conclusion of the <ORG> on the evidence could not be assailed before the <ORG> on the ground that the departmental authorities had violated the basic rules of natural justice without raising that question before the <ORG> Further when the <ORG> did not direct the <ORG> to state a case on the question it must be deemed to have rejected the application to refer that question and the order of rejection having become final this <ORG> cannot set it aside without an appeal by the respondent Appeal from the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> in Income tax Reference No of Beside pointing out the discrepancies in the statements made from time to time which rendered her case unreliable the <ORG> expressed the view that gifts made during a long period of to years could not all have been made only in thousand rupee notes In her application for stating a case to <ORG> on eleven questions set out therein <NAME> asserted that in her declaration under of the High Denomination Bank Notes Demonetisation Ordinance she had given information pursuant to the queries as follows Reasons for keeping above in No bank account <NAME> who delivered the principal judgment of the <ORG> observed that the <ORG> had apparently ignored a part of the declaration made by <NAME> that high denomination notes out of those encashed in January were received from a Bank in Calcutta in realization of a cheque for Rs drawn in September by <NAME> her eldest son that there was reason to doubt that statements referred to in his order by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner were made by <NAME> or her attorney and that in any event opportunity to clear up the discrepancies between the statement made at the time of the disclosure of the high denomination notes and the statements said to have been made before the Income tax Officer or before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner ought to have been given to her order of the <ORG> suffered from those infirmities the learned Judges of <ORG> answered the question in the affirmative The statement that out of high denomination notes disclosed by <NAME> notes were received in realization of a cheque drawn by <NAME> at Rajkot was made for the first time in a petition under it did not find place in the statement before the Income tax Officer nor in the grounds of objection raised before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and But that evidence was not before the <ORG> and the order of the <ORG> was not open to the objection that it had decided the appeal before it on a partial review of the evidence The reason of the rule is clear <ORG> cannot hold that the decision of the <ORG> refusing to state a case on a particular question is incorrect if the <ORG> was not asked to consider whether the question arose out of its order and whether it was a question of law If the power of <ORG> to refuse to answer questions other than those which are questions of law directly related to the dispute between the tax payer and the department and which when answered would determine qua that question the dispute be granted we fail to see any ground for restricting that power when by an erroneous order <ORG> has directed the <ORG> to state a case on a question which did not arise out of the order of the <ORG> The <ORG> cannot in this case be charged with recording its decision without considering all the evidence on the record the decision of the <ORG> was clearly based on appreciation of evidence on the record before it and <ORG> was in our view incompetent to direct the <ORG> to state the case on the question which was directed to be referred and dealt with by <ORG> There is also no ground for believing that <NAME> was not given an opportunity to clear up the discrepancies between the statements made by her or on her behalf from time to time in connection with the encashment of the high denomination notes That plea was not raised before the <ORG> and the validity of the conclusion of the <ORG> on appreciation of evidence cannot be assailed before <ORG> on the ground that departmental authorities had violated the basic rules of natural justice without raising that question before the <ORG> But power to reframe a question may be exercised to clarify some obscurity in the question referred or to pinpoint the real issue between the tax payer and the department or for similar other reasons it cannot be exercised for reopening an enquiry on questions of fact which is closed by the order of the <ORG> Whether there is any material before the Tribunal to hold that the said sum of Rs The Appellate Assistant Commissioner observed that on the statement made by <NAME> that she had received the amount from her husband in the year of account and that it was unfortunate that there was no complete record of the earnings and withdrawals The appeal must therefore be allowed and the order passed by <ORG> set aside
