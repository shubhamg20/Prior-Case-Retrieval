On the night between nd and rd December there was a massive escape of lethal gas from the MIC Storage tank at the Bhopal plant resulting in the tragic death of about people The present Writ Petitions challenge the constitutional validity of the said Act inter alia on the grounds that the Act is violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles and of the Constitution that the Act is violative of the Principles of Natural Justice mainly on the ground that <ORG> being a joint tort feasor in that it has permitted establishment of such factories with out necessary safeguards has no locus standi to compromise on behalf of the victims that the victims and their legal heirs were not given the opportunity of being heard before the Act was passed that in the guise of giving aid the <ORG> could not destroy the rights inherent in its citizens nor could it demand the citizens to surrender their rights to the <ORG> that vesting of the rights in <ORG> was bad and unreasonable because there was conflict of interest between the <ORG> and the victims In entering upon the settlement in view of of the Act regard must be had to the views of the victims and for the purpose of giving regard to these appropriate notices before arriving at any settlement was necessary In some cases however post decisional notice might be sufficient but in the facts and the circumstances of the present case no useful purpose would be served by giving a post decision al hearing having regard to the circumstances mentioned in the order of this <ORG> dated th May and having regard to the fact that there are no further additional data and facts available with the victims which can be profitably and meaningfully presented to controvert the basis of the settlement and further having regard to the fact that the victims had their say or on their behalf their views had been agitated in these proceedings and will have further opportunity in the pending review proceedings Justice is a psychological yearning in which men seek acceptance of their view point by having an opportunity of vindication before the forum or the authority enjoined or obliged to take a decision affecting their right Yet in the particular situations one has to bear in mind how an in fraction of that should be sought to be removed in accord ance with justice It has to be borne in mind that if so judged it passed the test of reasonableness then the possi bility of the power conferred being improperly used is no ground for pronouncing the law itself invalid But there is no prohibition or inhibition for Indian <ORG> taking over the claims of the victims or for the <ORG> acting for the victims as the Act has sought to provide The Act does provide a special procedure in respect of rights of the victims and to that extent the <ORG> takes upon itself the rights of the victims The disaster being unique in its character and in the recorded history of industrial disaster situated as the victims were against a mighty multinational with the presence of foreign contingency lawyers looming on the scene there were sufficient grounds for such differentia tion and different treatment The representa tion of the victims by <ORG> cannot be held to be bad and there is and there was no scope of violation of any principle of natural justice If there was any remote conflict of interests between the <ORG> and the victims from the theoretical point of view the doctrine of necessity would override the possible violation of the principles of natural justice that no man should be Judge in his own case <ORG> in order to effectively safeguard the rights of the victims in the matter of the conduct of the case was entitled to act as parens patriae which position was reinforced by the statutory provisions namely the Act It has to be borne in mind that conceptually and jurispru dentially the doctrine of parens patriae is not limited to representation of some of the victims outside the territo ries of the country There is no bar on the <ORG> to assume responsibili ties analogous to parens patriae to discharge the <ORG> obligations under the Constitution But quite apart from that it has to be borne in mind that in this case the <ORG> is acting on the basis of the Statute itself There is no reason to confine the parens patriae doctrine to only quasi sovereign right of the <ORG> independent of and behind the title of the citizen The power to compromise and to conduct the proceed ings are not uncanalised or arbitrary Section provides for the substitution of the <ORG> with the right to represent and act in place of whether within or outside India every person who has made or is entitled to make a claim in respect of the disaster The <ORG> has taken over the rights and claims of the victims in the exercise of sovereignty in order to discharge the constitutional obligations as the parent and guardian of the victims who in the situation as placed needed the umbrella of protection Thus the <ORG> has the power and jurisdiction and for this purpose unless the Act is otherwise unreasonable or violative of the constitutional provisions no question of giving a hearing to the parties for taking over these rights by the <ORG> arises These give the <ORG> an exclusive right to act in place of the persons who are entitled to make claim or have already made claim A Sections and of the Act should be read together alongwith other provisions of the Act and in particular sections and of the Act The Act was so designed that the vic tims of the disaster are fully protected and the claims of compensation or damages for loss of life or personal in juries or in respect of other matters arising out of or connected with the disaster are processed speedily effec tively equitably and to the best advantage of the claim ants Section of the Act is subject to other provisions of the Act which includes Sections and In view of the principles settled by this <ORG> and accepted all over the world in a case of this magnitude and nature when the victims have been given some say by Section of the Act in order to make that opportunity contemplated by section of the Act meaningful and effective it should be so read that the victims have to be given an opportunity of making their representation before the court comes to any conclusion in respect of any settlement If the victims want to advert to certain aspect of the matter during the proceedings under the Act and settlement indeed is an impor tant stage in the proceedings opportunities must be given to the victims It is not a case of one having common interest with others A In the instant case there is no question of aban donment as such of the suit or part of the suit the provi sions of order XXIII Rule would also not strictly apply However Order XXIH Rule of the Code is an important and significant pointer and the principles behind the said provision would apply to this case The said rule pro vides that no agreement of compromise in a representative suit shall be entered into without the leave of the <ORG> expressly recorded in the proceedings and sub rule of rule enjoins that before granting such leave the court shall give notice in such manner as it may think fit in a representative action In as much as section of the Act had given a qualified right of participation to the victims there cannot be any question of violation of the principles of natural justice This interpretation of the Act is further strengthened by the fact that a claimant has been defined in clause of Section as a person who is entitled to make a claim and the expression person in Section includes the <ORG> Therefore the Act proceeded on the assumption that the <ORG> could be a claimant being a person as such The rules of natural justice can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made If the statute conferring the power is silent with regard to the giving of a pre decisional hearing to the person affected the administrative decision after post decisional hearing was good A In the instant case no question of violation of the principle of natural justice arises and there is no scope for the application of the principle that no man should be a Judge in his own cause The adjudication would be done by the courts and therefore there is no scope of the violation of any principle of natural justice It is on this promise or premise that the <ORG> would be justified in taking upon itself the right and obligation to proceed and prosecute the claim and deny access to the courts of law to the victims on their own It has to be borne in mind that the language of the Act does not militate against this construc tion but on the Contrary Even if there was any remote conflict of interests between the <ORG> and the victims on account of the sharesholding doctrine of necessity would override the possible violation of the principles of natural justice The jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain suit would still arise out of section of the <ORG> and the substantive cause of action and the nature of the reliefs available would also continue to remain un changed The promises made to the victims and hopes raised in their hearts and minds can only be redeemed in some measure if attempts are made vigorously to distribute the amount realised to the victims in accordance with the scheme For this purpose the <ORG> should have the matter examined by such body as it considers necessary and proper like <ORG> or other competent bodies Many of these industries are engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities which pose potential threat to life health and safety of persons working in the factory or residing in the surround ing areas Though working of such factories and plants is regulated by a number of laws of our country there is no special legisla tion providing for compensation and damages to outsiders who may suffer on account of any industrial accident In the instant case there is no scope for any doubt regarding the liability of the <ORG> for the damage caused to the human beings and nature in and around Bhopal Save only that they cannot file a suit themselves their right to acquire redress has not really been abridged by the provisions of the Act In other words while seeming to deprive the claimants of their right to take legal action on their own it has preserved those rights to be exercised indirectly There is only a restriction of this right which in the circumstances is totally reasonable and justified It is common knowledge that any authority given to conduct a litigation cannot be effective unless it is accom panied by an authority to withdraw or settle the same if the circumstances call for it There were possibilities that the litigation may have to be fought out to the bitter finish There were possibilities that the <ORG> might be willing to adequately compensate the victims either on their own or at the insistence of the <ORG> concerned There was also the possibility which had already been in evidence before Judge <NAME> that the proceedings might ultimately have to end in negotiated settlement The legislation therefore cannot be considered to be unreasonable merely because in addition to the right to institute a suit or other proceedings it also empowers the <ORG> to withdraw the proceedings or enter into a compromise In the field of torts under the common law of Eng land no action could be laid by the dependants or heirs of a person whose death was brought about by the tortious act of another on the maxim actio personalis maritur cum persona although a person injured by a similar act could claim damages for the wrong done to him On that night there was massive escape of lethal gas from the MIC storage tank at Bhopal Plant of <ORG> hereinafter referred to as <ORG> resulting in large scale death and untold disaster He was later released on bail On th Decem ber <ORG> filed a written statement contending that they were not liable on the ground that they had nothing to do with <ORG> and that they were a different legal entity and that they never exercised any control and that they were not liable in the suit The charge sheet there was under sections of the Indian Penal Code read with section and the charge was against Shri <NAME> <NAME> It was further stated that apart from the design defects the <ORG> did not take any adequate remedial action to prevent back flow of solution from VGS into RVVH and PVH lines There were various other acts of criminal negligence alleged <ORG> passed an order staying the operation of the order dated directing the defendant applicant to deposit Rs mil lions within two months from the date of the said order On th April the judgment and order were passed by <ORG> modifying the order of the Distt <ORG> held that under the substantive law of torts the Court has jurisdiction to grant interim relief under Section of the CPC On th June Judge <NAME> passed an order restrain ing the <ORG> from settling with any individual gas leak plaintiffs On th September special leave was granted by this Court in the petition filed by <ORG> against the grant of interim relief and <ORG> was also granted special leave in the petition challenging the reduc tion of quantum of compensation from Rs crores to Rs crores The proof of the cake is in its eating it is said and it is perhaps not possible to ignore the terms of the settlement reached on th and th February in considering the effect of the lan guage used in the Act That order recited that having considered all the facts and the circumstances of the case placed before the <ORG> the material relating to the proceedings in the <ORG> in the United States of America the offers and counter offers made between the parties at different stages during the various proceedings as well as the complex issues of law and fact raised and the submissions made thereon and in particular the enormity of human suffering occasioned by the Bhopal Gas disaster and the pressing urgency to provide immediate and substantial relief to victims of the disaster the <ORG><ORG> found that the case was preeminently fit for an overall settlement between the parties covering all litigations claims rights and liabil ities relating to and arising out of the disaster and it was found just equitable and reasonable to pass inter alia the following orders Upon full payment in accordance with the <ORG> directions the undertaking given by <ORG> pursuant to the order dated November in the District <ORG> Bhopal stands discharged and all orders passed in Suit No of and or in any Revision therefrom also stand discharged It appears from the statement of objects reasons of the Act that the <ORG> recognized that the gas leak disaster involving the release on nd and rd December of highly noxious and abnormally dangerous gas from a plant of <ORG> a subsidiary of <ORG> was of an unprecedented nature which resulted in loss of life and damage to proper ty on an extensive scale as mentioned before It was stated that the victims who had managed to survive were still suffering from the adverse effects and the further complica tions which might arise in their cases of course could not be fully visualised Thereafter the Act was passed which received the assent of the President on th March It says that claims means i a claim arising out of or connected with the disaster for compensation or damages for any loss of life or personal injury which has been or is likely to be suffered ii a claim arising out of or connected with the disaster for any damage to property which has been or is likely to be sustained iii a claim for expenses incurred or required to be incurred for containing the disaster or mitigating or otherwise coping with the effects of the disaster iv any other claim including any claim by way of loss of business or employment arising out of or connected with the disas ter A claimant is defined as a person entitled to make a claim It has been provided in the Explanation to Section that for the purpose of clauses and where the death of a person has taken place as a result of the disaster the claim for compensation or damages for the death of such person shall be for the benefit of the spouse children including a child in the womb and other heirs of the deceased and they shall be deemed to be the claimants in respect thereof It provides as follows Subject to the other provisions of this Act <ORG> shall and shall have the exclusive right to represent and act in place of whether within or outside India every person who has made or is enti tled to make a claim for all purposes con nected with such claim in the same manner and to the same effect as such persons The provisions of sub section shall apply also in relation to claims in respect of which suits or other proceedings have been instituted in or before any court or other authority whether within or outside India before the commencement of this Act Provided that in the case of any such suit or other proceeding with respect to any claim pending immediately before the commencement of this Act in or before any court or other authority outside India the Central Govt Section deals with the powers of <ORG> Section deals with powers to delegate Section deals with limitation while section deals with the power to frame Scheme Section deals with the overriding effect and provides that the provisions of the Act and of any Scheme framed thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than the Act or any instrument having effect by virtue of any enactment other than the Act Commissioner he may prefer an appeal against such order to the Commissioner who shall decide the same It provides that there shall also be a Claims and Relief <ORG> which will include the amounts received in satisfaction of the claims and any other amounts made available to the Commissioner as donation or for relief purposes Sub clause thereto provides that in case of a dispute as to disbur sal of the amounts received in satisfaction of claims an appeal shall lie against the order of the <ORG> <NAME> and Mr <NAME> have made various submissions challenging the valid ity of the Act on various grounds And the test of reasonable ness wherever prescribed should be applied to each indi vidual Statute impugned and no abstract standard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases He in this background urged that these considerations assume immense importance to shape human fights jurispru dence under the Constitution and for the Third World to regulate and control the power and economic interests of multinational corporations and the power of exploitation and domination by developed nations without submitting to due observance of the laws of the developing countries Article states that everyone has the right to an effective remedy by competent <ORG> for acts violating fundamental rights guaranteed to him by the Con stitution or by the law Right to equality is guaranteed to every person under Art in all matters like the laws of procedure for enforcement of any legal or constitutional right in every jurisdiction sub stantive law defining the rights expressly or by necessary implications denial of any of these rights to any class of citizens in either field must have nexus with constitution ally permissible object and can never be arbitrary Articles dealing with different fundamen tal rights contained in Part III of the Constitution do not represent entirely separate streams of rights which do not mingle at any point of time Reliance was placed on the observations in <NAME> <ORG> Before we deal with the various other contentions raised in this case it is necessary to deal with the appli cation for intervention and submission made on behalf of <ORG> in Writ Petition No wherein Mr <NAME> in his written submission had urged for the intervener that Article of the Constitution neither confers nor creates nor determines the dimensions nor the permissible limits of restrictions which appropriate legislation might impose on the right to life or liberty He submitted that provisions for procedure are relevant in judicial or quasi judicial proceedings for enforcement of rights or obliga tions However when this contention was sought to be urged before this Court on th April after hearing all the parties it appeared that there was no dispute between the parties in the instant writ petitions between the victims and <ORG> that the rights claimed in these cases are referrable to Article of the Constitution Therefore no dispute really arises with regard to the contention of <ORG> and we need not consider the submissions urged by <NAME> on behalf of the intervener in this case By the order dated rd March Writ Petitions Nos and have been directed to be disposed of by this Bench He challenges the validity of the Act on various grounds He contends that <ORG> should not have the exclusive right to represent the victims in suits against <ORG> and thereby deprive the victims of their right to sue and deny access to justice In order to determine the question whether the Act in question is constitutionally valid or not in the light of Articles and of the Constitution it is necessary to find out what does the Act actually mean and provide for The Act in question as the Preamble to the Act states was passed in order to confer powers on <ORG> to secure that the claims arising out of or connected with the Bhopal gas leak disaster are dealt with speedily effectively equitably and to the best advantage of the claimants and for matters incidental thereto Our attention was also drawn by the learned Attorney General to the proceed ings of <ORG> wherein the Hon ble Minister <NAME> explained that the bill enabled the Govern ment to assume exclusive right to represent and act whether within or outside India in place of every person who had made or was entitled to make claim in relation to the disas ter and to institute any suit or other proceedings or enter into any compromise as mentioned in the Act Before we deal with the question of constitutionali ty it has to be emphasised that the Act in question deals with the Bhopal gas leak disaster and it deals with the claims meaning thereby claims arising out of or connected with the disaster for compensation of damages for loss of life or any personal injury which has been or is likely to be caused and also claims arising out of or connected with the disaster for any damages to property or claims for expenses incurred or required to be incurred for containing the disaster or making or otherwise coping with the impact of the disaster and other incidental claims The power that has been given to <ORG> is to represent the claims meaning thereby the monetary claims The expression <ORG> shall and shall have the exclusive right to represent and act in place of whether within or outside India every person who has made or is entitled to make a claim for all purposes connected with such claim in the same manner and to the same effect as such person read as it is means that <ORG> is substituted and vested with the exclusive right to act in place of the victims i eliminating the victims their heirs and their legal representatives in respect of all such claims arising out of or connected with the Bhopal gas leak disas ter The right therefore embraces right to institute proceedings within or outside India along with right to institute any suit or other proceedings or to enter into compromise Therefore in cases where such suits or proceedings have been instituted before the commencement of the Act in any court or before any authority outside India the section by its own force will not come into force in substituting the Central Govern ment in place of the victims or the heirs or their legal representatives but <ORG> has been given the right to act in place of or along with such claimant provided such court or other authority so permits There is the concept known both in this country and abroad called parens patriae at it is stated that parens patriae is the inherent power and author ity of a <ORG> to provide protection to the person and property of persons non suijuris such as minor insane and incompetent persons but the words parens patriae meaning thereby the father of the country were applied originally to the <NAME> and are used to designate the <ORG> referring to its sovereign power of guardianship over persons under disability Emphasis supplied In the opinion by <NAME> <NAME> joined by <NAME> Chief Justice and <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> J<NAME> it was held that Puerto Rico had a claim to represent its quasi sovereign interests in federal court at least which was as strong as that of any <ORG> and that it had parens patriae standing to sue to secure its residents from the harmful effects of discrimination and to obtain full and equal participation in the federal employment service scheme established pursu ant to the Wagner Peyser Act and the Immigration and Nation ality Act of On its plain terms the <ORG> has taken over the exclusive right to represent and act in place of every person who has made or is entitled to make a claim for all purposes connected with such claim in the same manner and to the same effect as such person But there is no prohibition or inhibition in our opinion conceptually or jurisprudential ly for Indian <ORG> taking over the claims of the victims or for the <ORG> acting for the victims as the Act has sought to provide The actual meaning of what the Act has provided and the validity thereof however will have to be examined in the light of the specific submissions advanced in this case She drew our attention to the fact that the Act was to meet a specif ic situation that had arisen after the tragic disaster and the advent of American lawyers seeking to represent the victims in American courts She drew our attention to the parliamentary debates as mentioned hereinbefore She drew our attention to the expression parens patriae as appearing in the Words and Phrases Volume She drew our attention to the American Constitutional Law by <NAME> Edition at paragraph where it was stated that in its capacity as proprietor a state may satisfy the requirement of injury to its own interests by an assertion of harm to the state as such As we have indicated before conceptually and juris prudentially there is no warrant in the background of the present Act in the light of circumstances of the Act in question to confine the concept into such narrow field We also do not find any reason to confine the parens patriae doctrine to only quasisovereign right of the <ORG> independent of and behind the title of the citi zens as we shall indicate later It was therefore submitted that to the extent it was a law relating to civil procedure it sets up a different procedure for the Bhopal gas victims and denies to them equality before law violating Article of the Constitution It was contended on behalf of <ORG> that the Act was passed to give effect to the Directive Principle as enshrined under Article A of the Constitu tion of India <NAME> submitted that sections and as noted above give exclusive power to the <ORG> to represent the victims and there is deprivation of the victims right to sue for the wrongs done to them which is uncanalised and unguided and the expression due regard in section of the Act does not imply consent and as such violative of the rights of the victims According to her a combined reading of sections and of the act lead to the conclusion that the victims are displaced by <ORG> which has constituted itself as the surrogate of the claimants that they have no control over the proceedings that they have no right to decide whether or not to compromise and if so on what terms and they have no right to be heard by the court before any such compromise is effected Therefore section read with section according to her hands over to the <ORG> all effective rights of the victims to sue and is a naked usurption of power Reference was made to section a and and disbursal of claims under sections and The Act it was urged deprives the victims of their rights out of all proportion to the object sought to be achieved namely to sue in foreign jurisdic tion or to represent those incapable of representing them selves The Act is it was contended unconstitutional because it deprives the victims of their right to life and personal liberty guaranteed by Article The right to life and liberty includes the right to sue for violations of the right it was urged The right to life guaranteed by Article must be interpreted to mean all that makes life livable life in all its fullness According to counsel it includes the right to livelihood Reference was made to the decision of <NAME> Supp According to counsel appearing for the victims the Act read strictly infringes the right to life and personal liberty because the right to sue by the affected person for damages flowing from infringement of their rights is taken away Such depravation according to counsel of the right is not in accordance with procedure established by law inasmuch as the law which takes away the right i impugned Act is neither substantively nor procedurally just fair or reasonable There is there fore no reason shown to exist for divesting them of that right and vesting that on <ORG> All the counsel for the victims have emphasised that vesting of the right in <ORG> is bad and unrea sonable because there is conflict of interests between the <ORG> and the victims This conflict of interest will continue it was emphasised to adversely affect the victims inasmuch as section of the Act read with clauses and of the Scheme empower the <ORG> to process claims determine the category into which these fall deter mine the basis on which damages will be payable to each category and determine the amount of compensation payable to each claimant Reference was also made to <NAME> case supra It was contended by counsel that the right to natural justice is the right to be heard by <ORG> at the pre decisional stage i before any compromise is effected and accepted It was also pointed out that <ORG> was under a duty to sue <ORG> which it had failed and neglected to do Alternatively it was contended by the counsel that since the statute neither expressly nor by necessary implication bars the right to be heard by <ORG> before any compromise is effected such a right to a pre decisional hearing by <ORG> must be read into section of the Act The Act sets up a procedure differ ent from the ordinary procedure established by law namely Civil Procedure Code In this connec tion reliance was placed on the provisions of Order I Rule Order Rule proviso Order Rule and Order Rule of CPC and it was submitted that these are not inconsistent with the Act No qualification according to counsel had been prescribed for the appointment of a Commissioner and clause of the Scheme framed under the Act vests in the Commis sioner the judicial function of deciding appeals against the order of the Deputy Commissioner registering or refusing to register a claim It was further submitted that clause of the Scheme is unreasonable because it replaces an inde pendent and impartial civil court of competent jurisdiction with <ORG> which is a joint tort feasor for the purpose of determining the total amount of compensa tion to be apportioned for each category of claims and the quantum of compensation payable for each type of injury or loss It was submitted that the said function is a judicial function and if there is any conflict of interest between the victims and <ORG> vesting such a power in <ORG> amounts to making it a judge in its own cause Even otherwise according to counsel <ORG> has been sued as a joint tort feasor and as they would have a vested interest in depressing the quantum of damages payable to the victims Clause of the Scheme according to counsel is unreasonable inasmuch as it does not take into account the claims of the victims to punitive and exemplary damages and damages for loss and destruction of environment Counsel submitted that if section is to be held to be intra vires the word exclusive should be severed from section and on the other hand if section is held ultra vires then victims who have already filed suits or those who had lodged claims should be entitled to continue their own suits as well as Suit No as plaintiffs with leave under Order Rule Counsel submitted that this <ORG> should set up a procedure which would ensure that an impartial judge assisted by medical experts and assessors would adjudicate the basis on which an individual claimant would fall into a particular category Neither section nor section of the Act gives any right to the victims on the other hand it is a complete denial of access to justice for the victims according to him He also submitted that section of the Act as it stands gives no right to the victims and as such even assuming that in order to fight for the rights of the victims it was necessary to substitute the victims even then in so far as the victims have been denied the right of say in the conduct of the proceedings this is disproportionate to the benefit conferred upon the victims Mr <NAME> additionally further urged that by the procedure of the Act each individual claim had to be first determined and the <ORG> could only take over the aggregate of all individual claims and that could only be done by aggregating the individual claims of the victims It was submitted on behalf of the victims that <ORG> owned of the shares in <ORG> and therefore it was incompetent to represent the victims There was conflict of interest between the <ORG> and <ORG> and so Central <ORG> was incompe tent It was submitted that the pleadings in the court of the United States and in the Bhopal court considered in the context of the settlement order of this Court accepted by the Union of India establish that the victims individuality were sacrificed wontedly and callously and therefore there was violation according to some of the victims both in the Act and in its implementation of Articles and of the Constitution This Court was incompetent to grant immunity against criminal liabilities in the manner it has purported to do by its order dated th th February it was strenuously suggested by counsel There were no essential legislative guidelines for determining the rights of the victims the conduct of the proceedings on behalf of the victims and for the relief claimed There is a real and marked distinction between the sovereign functions of the government and those which are non sovereign and some of the functions that fall in the latter category are those connected with trade commerce business and industrial undertakings <NAME> submitted that the gas victims had legal and moral right to sue the governments and so it had full right to im plead all the necessary and proper parties like <ORG> <ORG> and also the then Chief Minister <NAME> of the State He drew our attention to Order rule of the Civil Procedure Code He submitted that in this Act there is denial of natural justice both in the institution under section and in the conduct of the suit under section It was submitted that when the Bhopal Gas disaster took place which was the worst industrial disaster in the world which resulted in the deaths of several thousands of people and caused serious injuries to lakhs others there arose a right to the victims to get not merely damages under the law of the torts but also arose clearly by virtue of right to life guaranteed as fundamen tal right by Article of the Constitution a right to get full protection of life and limb The second point that <NAME> made was that the Act so far as it empowered <ORG> to represent and act in place of the victims is in respect of the civil liability arising out of disaster and not in respect of any right in respect of criminal liability according to <NAME> cannot have any right or authority in relation to any offences which arose out of the disaster and which resulted in criminal liability It was submitted by <NAME> that even this <ORG> has no jurisdiction whatsoever to transfer any criminal proceedings to itself either under any provi sion of the Constitution or under any provision of the Criminal Procedure Code or under any other provision of law and therefore if the settlement in question was to be treated not as a compromise but as an order of the <ORG> it would be without jurisdiction and liable to be declared so on the principles laid down according to <NAME> by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra Mr <NAME> submitted that the suit which may be brought by <ORG> against <ORG> under section of the Act would be a suit of the kind contemplated by the Explanation to Order rule of the Code of Civil Procedure since the victims are not parties and yet the decree obtained in the suit would bind them Therefore there is nothing which is inconsist ent with the provisions of Order Rule of the <ORG> to which the provisions Section of the Act be applied <NAME> and Mr <NAME> submitted that these procedures must be construed in accordance with the provisions contained in Order Rule <ORG> and an opportunity must be given to those whose claims are being compromised to show to the court that the compromise is not fair and should not accordingly be permit ted by the court It was then submitted that section of the Act only empowers <ORG> to represent and act in place of the victims and to institute suits on behalf of the victims or even to enter into compro mise on behalf of the victims The jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain suit would still arise out of section of the <ORG> and the substantive cause of action and the nature of the reliefs available would also continue to remain unchanged According to Shri <NAME> even if all the details were not available at the time when the suit was filed the details of the victims damages had to be procured and specified in the plaint before a proper decree could be passed in the suit It was submitted that there was nothing in the Act which permitted <ORG> to enter into any general compromise with <ORG> providing for the lumpsum amount without disclosure as to how much amount is payable to each victim Shri <NAME> urged that if the Act is construed in such a manner that it did not create such an obligation on <ORG> the Act cannot be upheld as a reasonable provision when it deprived the victims of their normal legal rights of immediately obtaining compensation from <ORG> <NAME> appearing for the petitioners in Writ Petition No submitted that the Act dis placed the claimants in the matter of their right to seek redressal and remedies of the actual injury and harm caused individually to the claimants by conferment of exclusive right to sue in place of victims according to him contravened the procedure established by law The right to enter into compromise it was further submitted without consultation of the victims if that is the con struction of section read with section of the Act then it is violative of procedure established by law It was submitted that the Act in question is different from the concept of parens patriae because there was no special need to be satisfied and a class action according to <NAME> would have served the same purpose as a suit brought under the statute and ought to have been preferred because it safeguarded claimants right to procedural due process The Government of India in order to effectively safeguard the rights of the victims in the matter of the conduct of the case was entitled to act as parens patriae which position was reinforced by the statutory provisions namely the Act It has to be borne in mind that conceptually and jurisprudentially the doctrine of parens patriae is not limited to representation of some of the victims outside the territories of the country In our opinion conceptually and jurisprudentially there is no bar on the <ORG> to assume responsibilities analogous to parens patriae to discharge the <ORG> obligations under the Constitution It has to be borne in mind as was stressed by the learned Attorney General that conferment of power and the manner of its exercise are two different matters It was submitted that the power to conduct the suit and to compromise if neces sary was vested in <ORG> for the purpose of the Act The power to compromise and to conduct the proceedings are not uncanalised or arbitrary It has to be borne in mind that if upon so judged it passes the test of reasona bleness then the possibility of the powers conferred being improperly used is no ground for pronouncing the law itself invalid Sections and of the Act should be read together as contended by the learned Attorney General along with other provisions of the Act and in particular sections and of the Act The Act was so designed that the victims of the disaster are fully protected and the claims of compensation or damages for loss of life or personal injuries or in respect of other matters arising out of or connected with the disaster are processed speedily effectively equitably and to the best advantage of the claimants Section of the Act is subject to other provisions of the Act which includes sections and Learned Attorney General submitted that the dominus litis carries with it the right to conduct the suit in the best manner as it deems fit including the right to withdraw and right to enter into compromise In such a situation the <ORG> of India acting in place of the victims necessarily should have right under the statute to act in all situations including the position of withdrawing the suit or to enter into com promise In this connec tion our attention was drawn to the definition of Dominus Litis in Black Law Dictionary Fifth Edition which states as follows Dominus litis He drew our attention to the fact that the victims had filed separate consolidated complaints in addition to the complaint filed by the Government of India Judge <NAME> of <ORG> had passed orders permitting the victims to be represented not only by the private Attorneys but also by the Govt Learned Attorney General further contended that pursuant to the orders passed by Judge <NAME> imposing certain conditions against <ORG> and allowing the motion for forum non convenience of the <ORG> that the suit came back to India and was instituted before <ORG> Even in the Indian suits these private parties have been permitted to continue as parties represented by separate counsel even though the Act empowers the <ORG> to be the sole plaintiff The aforesaid <ORG> had also intervened in the civil appeals preferred pursuant to the special leave granted by this <ORG> to the <ORG> of India and <ORG> Carbide against the judgment of <ORG> for interim compensation Mr <NAME> one of the petitioners in the writ petition had watched the proceedings and after the <ORG> had passed the order on th February mentioned that he had filed a suit for Rs Our attention was drawn to the fact that Section of the Act provides that the provisions of the Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other enactment other than the Act Furthermore inasmuch as Section had given a qualified right of partic ipation to the victims there cannot be any question of violation of the principles of natural justice According to him the extension of the principles of natural justice beyond what is provided by the Act in Sections was unwarranted and would deprive the provisions of the Statute of their efficacy in relation to the achievement of speedy relief which is the object intended to be achieved at wherein it was held by the learned Single Judge that the plaintiff in a representative suit had right to compromise subject to the conditions that the suit was properly filed in terms of the provisions of that Rule and the settlement was agreed bona fide Learned Attorney General in that context contended that when the suit was validly instituted the plaintiff had a right to compromise the suit and there need not be any provision for notice to the parties represented before entering into any compromise By virtue of the powers of attorney <ORG> it was stated had the authority to file the suits and to compromise the interests of the victims if so re quired Therefore it is wholly wrong to contend it was urged that Section ii is inconsistent with individu al right of election and at the same time it provides the centralised decision making processes to effectively adjudge and secure the common good It was emphasised that it has to be borne in mind that a com promise is a legal act In this connection reference was made to Section of the Act Our attention was drawn to several decisions for the power of this Court under Articles and of the Con stitution He submitted that it has to be borne in mind that if the contentions of the petitioners are entertained the rights theoretically might be upheld but the ends of justice would stand sacrificed It was further submitted by the learned Attorney General that while <ORG> had proceeded against the <ORG> it had to represent the victims as a class and it was not possible to define each individual right after careful scrutiny nor was it necessary or possible to do so in a mass disaster case The settlement was a substitute for adjudication since it involved a process of reparation and relief Hence we have to examine the question whether even on the assumption that there was negligence on the part of <ORG> in permitting licensing of the industry set up by <ORG> in Bhopal or permitting the factory to grow up such permission or conduct of <ORG> was responsible for the damage which has been suffered as a result of Bhopal gas leakage If in such circumstances it was urged on behalf of the <ORG> the public exchequer is made liable it will cause great public injury and may result in drainage of the treasury In any event it was urged on behalf of the <ORG> If there was any remote conflict of interests between <ORG> and the victims from the theoretical point of view the doctrine of necessity would override the possible violation of the principles of natural justice that no man should be Judge in his own case The representation of the victims by the <ORG> cannot be held to be bad and there is and there was no scope of violation of any principle of natural justice There was no scope of violation of the principle of natural justice on this score Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in <ORG> State of A SCR where it was held that the doc trine of de facto representation envisages that acts per formed within the scope of assumed official authority in the interest of public or third persons and not for one own benefit are generally to be treated as binding as if they were the acts of officers de jure Inasmuch as good deal of criticism was advanced before this Court during the hearing of the arguments on behalf of the petitioners about the propriety and validity of the settle ment dated th th February even though the same was not directly in issue before us it is necessary to refer briefly to what <ORG> has stated in the said order dated th May This <ORG> recognised that there was another aspect of the review pertaining to the part of the settlement which terminated the criminal proceedings The basic consideration the <ORG> recorded moti vating the conclusion of the settlement was the compelling need for urgent relief and the <ORG> set out the law delays duly considering that there was a compelling duty both judicial and humane to secure immediate relief to the victims The <ORG> recorded that the response of learned counsel was positive in at tempting a settlement but they expressed a certain degree of uneasiness and skepticism at the prospects of success in view of their past experience of such negotiations when as they stated there had been uninformed and even irresponsi ble criticism of the attempts at settlement The Court referred to <NAME> case reiterated by <ORG> bearing in mind the factors that if the suit proceeded to trial the plaintiff Union of India would obtain judgment in respect of the claims relating to deaths and personal injuries in the following manner a Rs lakhs in each case of death Rs lakh in each case of total permanent disability Rs From those figures it came to the conclusion that the total number of fatal cases was about and of grievous and serious personal injuries as verifiable from the records was So far as the other question name ly the vital juristic principles of great contemporary relevance to the Third World generally and to India in particular touching problems emerging from the pursuit of such dangerous technologies for economic gains by multi nationals in this case the <ORG> recognised that these were great problems and reiterated that there was need to evolve a national policy to protect national interests from such ultra hazardous pursuits of economic gain and that Jurists technologists and other experts in economics Before considering the question of constitutional validity of the Act in the light of the background of the facts and circumstances of this case and submissions made it is necessary to refer to the order dated rd March passed by <ORG> in respect of writ peti tions Nos and consisting of learned Judges presided over by the Hon ble the Chief Justice of India In writ petition No there is consequential prayer to set aside the order dated th February This follows from the construction of the Act from the language that is apparent Hence the submissions made on behalf of some of the victims that the Act was bad as it abridged or took away the victims right to proceed criminally against the delinquent be it <ORG> or <ORG> or jointly or severally the <ORG> of India <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh or Mr <NAME> the erstwhile Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh is on a wrong basis By the Act the extent of liability is not in any way abridged and therefore if in case of any industrial disaster like the Bhopal Gas Leak disaster there is right in victims to recover damages or compensation on the basis of absolute liability then the same is not in any manner abridged or curtailed This <ORG> held that the rule in Ry lands <NAME> supra laid down a principle that if a person who brings on his land and collects and keep there anything likely to do harm and such thing escapes and does damage to another he is liable to compensate for the damage caused This rule applies only to nonnatural user of the land and does not apply to things naturally on the land or where the escape is due to an act of God and an act of a stranger or the default of the person injured or where the things which escape are present by the consent of the person injured or in certain cases where there is a statutory authority This <ORG> noted that law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs of the fast changing society and keep abreast with the economic developments taking place in the country This <ORG> reiterated there that if it is found necessary to construct a new principle of liability to deal with an unusual situa tion which has arisen and which is likely to arise in future on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous industries which are concomitant to an industrial economy the <ORG> should not hesitate to evolve such principle of liability merely because it has not been so done in England According to this <ORG> an enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dangerous industry which poses potential threat to the health and safety of the persons working in the factory and residing in the surrounding areas owes an absolute and non delegable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to anyone It was urged before us that there was an absolute and strict liability for an enterprise which was carrying on dangerous operations with gases in this country It was further submitted that there was evidence on record that sufficient care and attention had not been given to safe guard against the dangers of leakage and protection in case of leakage As in the instant adjudication this <ORG> is not concerned with the determination of the actual extent of liability we will proceed on the basis that the law enunciated by this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra is the decision upon the basis of which damages will be payable to the victims in this case But then the practical question arises what is the extent of actual damages payable and how would the quantum of damages be computed Indeed in this connection it may be appropriate to refer to the order passed by this <ORG> on rd May giving reasons why the settlement was arrived at at the figure indicated These problems were highlighted by <ORG> in England in <NAME> <NAME> AC which indicate the difference between aggravated and exemplary damages There are views which are against exemplary damages on the ground that these infringe in principle the object of law of torts namely compensation and not punish ment and these tend to impose something equivalent to fine in criminal law without the safeguards provided by the criminal law There are however serious difficulties in evolving such an actual concept of punitive damages in respect of a civil action which can be integrated and enforced by the judicial process It would have raised serious problems of pleading proof and discovery and interesting and challeng ing as the task might have been it is still very uncertain how far decision based on such a concept would have been a decision according to due process of law acceptable by international standards There were difficulties in that attempt The main question however canvassed by all learned counsel for the victims was that so far as the Act takes away the right of the victims to fight or establish their own rights it is a denial of access to justice and it was contended that such denial is so great a deprivation of both human dignity and right to equality that it cannot be justi fied because it would be affecting right to life which again cannot be deprived without a procedure established by law which is just fair and reasonable These give to <ORG> an exclusive right to act in place of the persons who are entitled to make claim or have already made claim In that view of the matter and in view of the language used and the purpose intended to be achieved we are unable to accept this aspect of the arguments advanced on behalf of the victims looming on the scene in our opinion there were sufficient grounds for such differentiation and different treatment It was asserted on behalf of the victims by learned counsel that the concept of parens patriae can never be invoked for the purpose of suits in domestic juris diction of any country But quite apart from that it has to be borne in mind that in this case the <ORG> is acting on the basis of the Statute itself <NAME> has argued and this argument has also been adopted by other learned counsel appearing for the victims that with the assumption by the <ORG> of the jurisdiction and power as a parent to fight for the victims in the situation there is an imcumbent obliga tion on the <ORG> in the words of Judge <NAME> as a matter of fundamental human decency to maintain the victims until the claims are established and realised from the foreign multinationals Indeed in the language of the Act there is support for this interpre tation Section of the Act gives power to <ORG> to pay interim relief as the Act deprives the victims of normal and immediate right of obtaining compensation from <ORG> In that background it is just and proper that this deprivation is only to be justified if the Act is read with the obligation of granting interim relief or maintenance by <ORG> until the full amount of the dues of the victims is realised from <ORG> after adjudication or settlement and then deducting therefrom the interim relief paid to the victims As submitted by learned Attorney General it is true that there is no actual expression used in the Act itself which expressly postulates or indicates such a duty or obligation under the Act It is on this promise or premise that the <ORG> would be justified in taking upon itself the right and obligation to proceed and prosecute the claim and deny access to the courts of law to the victims on their own It has to be borne in mind that the language of the Act does not militate against this construction but on the contrary Sections and the scheme of the Act suggest that the Act contains such an obligation <ORG> It was then contended that <ORG><ORG> was not competent to represent the victims<ORG> This argument has been canvassed on various grounds<ORG> It has been urged that <ORG><ORG> owns share in <ORG> and as such there is a conflict of interest between <ORG><ORG> and the victims and on that ground the former is disentitled to represent the latter in their battle against <ORG> and <ORG><ORG> A large number of authorities on this aspect were cited<ORG> However it is not necessary in the view we have taken to deal with these because factually <ORG><ORG> does not own any share in <ORG><ORG> These are the statutory independent organisations namely <ORG> and <ORG> who own to share in <ORG><ORG> The <ORG><ORG> has certain amount of say and control in <ORG> and <ORG><ORG> Hence it cannot be said in our opinion that there is any con flict of interest in the real sense of the matter in respect of the claims of Bhopal gas leak disaster between the Cen tral <ORG><ORG> and the victims<ORG> Secondly in a situation of this nature <ORG><ORG> is the only authority which can pursue and effectively represent the victims<ORG> There is no other organisation or Unit which can effectively represent the victims<ORG> Perhaps theoretically it might have been possible to constitute another independent statutory body by the <ORG><ORG> under its control and supervision in whom the claim of the victims might have been vested and substituted and that Body could have been entrusted with the task of agitating or establishing the same claims in the same manner as <ORG><ORG> has done under the Act<ORG> But the fact that that has not been done in our opinion does not in any way affect the position<ORG> Apart from that lastly in our opinion this concept that where there is a conflict of interest the person having the conflict should not be entrusted with the task of this nature does not apply in the instant situation<ORG> In the instant case no question of violation of the principle of natural justice arises and there is no scope for the application of the principle that no man should be a Judge in his own cause<ORG> The Central <ORG><ORG> was not judging any claim but was fighting and ad vancing the claims of the victims<ORG> In those circumstances it cannot be said that there was any violation of the prin ciples of natural justice and such entrustment to the Cen tral <ORG><ORG> of the right to ventilate for the victims was improper or bad<ORG> The adjudication would be done by the courts and therefore there is no scope of the violation of any principle of natural justice<ORG> Along with this submission the argument was that the power and the right given to <ORG> If there is any improper exercise or transgres sion of the power then the exercise of that power can be called in question and set aside but the Act cannot be said to be violative of the rights of the victims on that score it was urged that there is conflict of interest in respect of the claims arising out of the the gas leak disaster between the <ORG> Bhopal gas leak disaster or disaster has been defined in clause a of Section as the occurrence on the nd and rd days of December which involved the release of highly noxious and abnormally dangerous gas from a plant in Bhopal being a plant of the <ORG> a subsidiary of the <ORG> and which resulted in loss of life and damage to property on an extensive scale This interpretation of the Act is further strengthened by the fact that a claimant has been defined in clause of Section as a person who is entitled to make a claim and the expression person in Section includes the <ORG> Therefore the Act proceeded on the assumption that the <ORG> The question whether there is scope for <ORG> being responsible or liable as a joint tort feasor is a difficult and different question The doctrine has been elaborated in Hals bury Laws of England th Edition paragraph where it was reiterated that even if all the members of the <ORG> competent to determine a matter were subject to disqualification they might be authorised and obliged to hear that matter by virtue of the operation of the common law doctrine of necessity An adjudicator who is subject to disqualification on the ground of bias or interest in the matter which he has to decide may in certain circumstances be required to adjudicate if there is no other person who is competent or authorised to be adjudicator or if a quorum cannot be formed without him or if no other competent tribu nal can be constituted He referred to certain decisions There is however one other aspect of the matter which requires consideration Section provides that the provisions of the Act and of any Scheme flamed thereunder shall have effect not withstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than the Act or any instrument having effect by virtue of any enactment other than the Act Hence if anything is inconsistent with the Act for the time being it will not have force and the Act will override those provisions to the extent it does The Act has not specifi cally contemplated any procedure to be followed in the action to be taken pursuant to the powers conferred under section except to the extent indicated in section of the Act There is no question of <ORG> acting as a court in respect of the claims which it should enforce for or on behalf or instead of the victims of the Bhopal gas leak disaster In this connection it is necessary to note that it was submitted that the Act so far as it deals with the claims of the victims should be read in conformity with Civil Procedure Code and or with the principles of natural justice and unless the provisions of the Act are so read it would be violative of Articles and of the Constitution in the sense that there will be deprivation of rights to fife and liberty without following a procedure which is just fair and reasonable On the other hand on behalf of the Government the learned Attorney General has canvassed before us that there were sufficient safeguards consistent with the principles of natural justice within this Act and beyond what has been provided for in a situation for which the Act was enacted nothing more could be provided and further reading down the provisions of the Act in the manner suggested would defeat the purpose of the Act The aforesaid section provides for the substitu tion of <ORG> with the right to represent and act in place of whether within or outside India every person who has made or is entitled to make a claim in respect of the disaster The <ORG> has taken over the rights and claims of the victims in the exercise of sovereignty in order to discharge the constitutional obligations as the parent and guardian of the victims who in the situation as placed needed the umbrella of protection Thus the <ORG> has the power and jurisdiction and for this purpose unless the Act is otherwise unreasonable or violative of the con stitutional provisions no question of giving a hearing to the parties for taking over these fights by the <ORG> arises The next aspect is that section of the Act which according to the learned Attorney General gives limited rights to the victims in the sense that it obliges <ORG> to have due regard to any matters which such person may require to be urged with respect to his claim and shall if such person so desires permit at the expense of such person a legal practitioner of his choice to be associated in the conduct of any suit or other proceeding relating to his claim Therefore it obliges <ORG> to have due regard to any matters and it was urged on behalf of the victims that this should be read in order to make the provisions constitutionally valid as providing that the victims will have a say in the conduct of the proceedings and as such must have an opportunity of knowing what is happening either by instructing or giving Opinions to <ORG> and or providing for such directions as to settlement and other matters In other words it was contended on behalf of the victims that the victims should be given notice of the proceedings and there by an opportunity if they so wanted to advance their view and that to make the provisions of meaningful and effective unless notice was given to the victim disabled as he is the assumption upon which the Act has been enacted could not come and make suggestion in the proceedings According to him there was exclusion of vic tims from the process of adjudication but a limited partici pation was provided and beyond that participation no further participation was warranted and no further notice was just fied either by the provisions of the Act as read with the constitutional requirements or under the general principles of natural justice That was a decision which dealt with the question of taking over of the industries under the Industries Development and Regula tion Act It was held by the majority of Judges that in the facts of that case there had been non compliance with the implied require ment of the audi alteram partem rule of natural justice at the pre decisional stage The rules of natural justice can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made If the statute conferring the power is silent with regard to the giving of a pre decisional hearing to the person affected the administrative decision after post decisional hearing was good It has been canvassed on behalf of the victims that the Code of Civil Procedure is an instant example of what is a just fair and reasonable procedure at least the princi ples embodied therein and the Act would be unreasonable if there is exclusion of the victims to vindicate properly their views and rights In any case it has been suggested and in our opinion there is good deal of force in this contention that if a part of the claim for good reasons or bad is sought to be compromised or adjusted without at least con sidering the views of the victims that would be unreasonable deprivation of the rights of the victims After all it has to be borne in mind that injustice consists in the sense in the minds of the people affected by any act or inaction a feeling that their grievances At page of the report Justice <NAME> observed as under But that a law of natural justice exists in the sense that a party must be heard in <ORG> or at any rate be afforded an opportunity to appear and defend himself unless there is express provision to the contrary is we think beyond dispute in holding that One cardinal principle to be observed in trials by a <ORG> obviously is that a party has a right to appear and plead his cause on all occasions when that cause comes on for hearing and that It follows that a party should not be deprived of that right and in fact the <ORG> has no option to refuse that right unless the Code of Civil Procedure deprives him of it It has been reiterated that the principles of natural justice know of no exclusionary rule dependent on whether it would have made any difference if natural justice had been ob served In view of the principles settled by this Court and accepted all over the world we are of the opinion that in case of this magnitude and nature when the victims have been given some say by Section of the Act in order to make that opportunity contemplated by section of the Act meaningful and effective it should be so read that the victims have to be given an opportunity of making their representation before the court comes to any conclusion in respect of any settlement There are instances and some of these were also placed before us during the hearing of these matters indi cating how the courts regulate giving of the notice in respect of a mass action where large number of people views have to be ascertained It is not a case of one having common interest with others Learned Attorney General submitted that as the provisions of the Code stood before Amendment <ORG> had taken the view that hearing of the parties repre sented in the suit was not necessary before compromise As in this case there is no question in our opinion of abandonment as such of the suit or part of the suit the provisions of this Rule would also not strictly apply However Order XXIII Rule of the Code is an important and significant pointer and the principles behind the said provision would apply to this case In our opinion the constitutional requirements the language of the Section the purpose of the Act and the principles of natural justice lead us to this interpretation of Section of the Act that in case of a proposed or con templated settlement notice should be given to the victims who are affected or whose rights are to be affected to ascertain their views The question however is that the settlement had been arrived at after great deal of efforts to give immedi ate relief to the victims We have noticed the order dated th May passed by this <ORG> indicating the reasons which impelled the <ORG> to pass the orders on th February in terms and manner as it did It has been urged before us on behalf of some of the victims that jus tice has not been done to their views and claims in respect of the damages suffered by them It appears to us by reading the reasons given by this <ORG> on th May that jus tice perhaps has been done but the question is has justice appeared to have been done and more precisely the question before this <ORG> is does the Act envisage a procedure or contemplate a procedure which ensures not only that justice is done but justice appears to have been done The reasons that impelled this Court to pass the orders of th th February are significant and compelling If notice was given then what would have happened It has been suggested on behalf of the victims by counsel that if the victims had been given an opportunity to be heard then they would have perhaps pointed out inter alia that the amount agreed to be paid through the settlement was hope lessly inadequate It was submitted on behalf of the victims that if an opportunity had been given they would have perhaps pointed out that the suit against <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> could not have been settled by the compromise That opportunity the victims have got when these appli cations were heard and they were heard after utmost publici ty and they would have further opportunity when review application against the settlement would be heard On behalf of the victims it was suggested that the basis of damages in view of the observations made by this Court in <NAME> case supra against the victims of <ORG> or <ORG> would be much more than normal damages suffered in similar case against any other company or party which is financially not so solvent or capable And even if it is accepted there are numerous difficulties of getting that view accepted internationally as a just basis in accordance with law We are also conscious that justice is a psycho logical yearning in which men seek acceptance of their view point by having an opportunity of vindication of their view point before the forum or the authority enjoined or obliged to take a decision affecting their right Yet in the par ticular situations one has to bear in mind how an infrac tion of that should be sought to be removed is accordance with justice Learned Attor ney General has however submitted that for disbursement of the compensation contemplated under the Act or under the orders of this Court a notification would be issued under section of the Act authorising the Commissioner or other officers to exercise all or any of the powers which <ORG> may exercise under section to enable the victims to place before the Commissioner or Deputy Commissioner any additional evidence that they would like to adduce There were large number of submissions made on behalf of the victims about amending the scheme In entering upon the settlement in view of of the Act regard must be had to the views of the victims and for the purpose of giving regard to these appropriate notices before arriving at any settlement was necessary In some cases however post decisional notice might be sufficient but in the facts and the circumstances of this case no useful purpose would be served by giving a post decisional hearing having regard to the circumstances mentioned in the order of this Court dated th May and having regard to the fact that there are no further additional data and facts available with the victims which can be profitably and meaningfully presented to controvert the basis of the set tlement and further having regard to the fact that the victims had their say or on their behalf their views had been agitated in these proceed ings and will have further opportunity in the pending review proceedings The sections dealing with the payment of compensation and categorisation should be implemented in the manner indicated before For this purpose the <ORG> should have the matter examined by such body as it considers necessary and proper like <ORG> or other competent bodies I agree with the same but I consider it necessary to express my opinion on certain aspects The facts and circumstances which led to the settlement of the claims before this Court have already been stated in detail in the judgment of <NAME> CJI and therefore I need not refer to those facts and circumstances Long and de tailed arguments were advanced before us for a number of days and on an anxious consideration and having regard to the legal and constitutional aspects and especially the need for immediate help and relief to the victims of the gas disaster which is already delayed we have upheld the constitutional validity of the Act The need for industrial development has led to the establishment of a number of plants and factories by the domestic companies and under industries are engaged in hazardous or inherently dangerous activities which pose potential threat to life health and safety of persons working in the factory or residing in the surrounding areas there is no special legislation pro viding for compensation and damages to outsiders who may suffer on account of any industrial accident The Court held as under We are of the view that an enterprise which is engaged in a hazardous or inherently dan gerous industry which poses a potential threat to the health and safety of the persons working in the factory and residing in the surrounding areas owes an absolute and non delegiable duty to the community to ensure that no harm results to any one on account of hazardous or inherently dangerous nature of the activity which it has undertaken The enterprise must be held to be under an obliga tion to provide that the hazardous or inher ently dangerous activity in which it is en gaged must be conducted with the highest standards of safety and if any harm results on account of such activity the enterprise must be absolutely liable to compensate for such harm and it should be no answer to the enter prise to say that it had taken all reasonable care and that the harm occurred without any negligence on its part In the instant cases there is no dispute that <ORG> a subsidiary of <ORG> was carrying on activity of manufacturing pesticide and in that process it had stored MIC a highly toxic and dangerous gas which leaked causing vast damage not only to human life but also to the flora and fauna and ecology in and around Bhopal In view of this <ORG> deci sion in <NAME> case there is no scope for any doubt regarding the liability of the <ORG> for the damage caused to the human beings and nature in and around Bhopal It extensively deals with the political economic financial social and legal questions There is yet another aspect which needs consideration by the <ORG> and the <ORG> With these observations I agree with the order proposed by my learned brother <NAME> CJI The writ petitions before us have been filed challenging the constitutional validity of this statute on the ground that the divestiture of the claimants individual rights to legal remedy against the multinational for the consequences of carrying on dangerous and hazardous activities on our soil violates the fundamental rights guaranteed under article and of the Constitution In the principal suit filed in India by the <ORG> Civil Suit No orders were passed by the trial court in Bhopal directing the <ORG> to deposit Rs crores reduced to Rs crores by <ORG> as interim payment to the gas victims pending disposal of the suit There were appeals to this <ORG> in which the <ORG> contested the <ORG> jurisdiction to pass an order for an interim payment in a suit for money while the <ORG> pleaded that a much higher interim payment should have been granted When the matter was being argued in this <ORG> a settlement was arrived at between the <ORG> and the <ORG> under which a sum of Rs crores has been received by the <ORG> in full settlement of all the claims of all victims of the gas leak against the <ORG> It is unfortunate that though the writ petitions before us were pending in this <ORG> at that time neither their contents nor the need for considering first the issue of the validity of the Act before thinking of a settlement in pursuance of its provisions seem to have been effectively brought to the notice of the Bench which put an end to all the litigation on this topic in terms of the settlement When this was brought to the notice of the above Bench it di rected these writ petitions to be listed before a different Bench to avoid any possible feeling that the same Bench may be coloured in its views on the issue by reason of the approval it had given to the fait accompli viz Thirdly their grievance is that no publicity at all was given before this court passed its order to enable individual claimants or groups of them to put forward their suggestions or objections to the settlement proposed This Bench has been placed in somewhat of a predicament as it has to pronounce on the validity of the provisions of the Act in the context of an implementation of its provisions in a particular manner and though we cannot and do not express any views regarding the merits of the settlement we are asked to consider whether such settlement can be consistent with a correct and proper interpretation of the Act tested on the touchstone of the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution <NAME> has outlined the issues dealt elaborately with the contentions urged and given expression to his conclusions in a learned elaborate and detailed judgment which we have had the advantage of perus ing in draft The issue regarding the validity of the Act turns principally on the construction of sections and of the Act Every person who suffered as a consequence of the gas leak had a right to claim compensa tion from the persons who according to him were liable in law for the injury caused to him and also a fight to insti tute a suit or proceeding before any court or authority with a view to enforce his right to claim damages We may first consider how far the main provision in leaving out of account the proviso as well as section is compatible with the Constitution The first question that arises is whether the legisla ture is justified in depriving the claimants of the right and privilege of enforcing their claims and prosecuting them in such manner as they deem fit and in compulsorily inter posing or substituting the <ORG> in their place It is necessary to remember that having regard to the identity of the principal ground of claim of all the vic tims even if a single victim was not diligent in conducting his suit or entered into a compromise or submitted to a decree judging the issues purely from his individual point of view such a decision or decree could adversely affect the interests of the innumerable other victims as well The only grievance is that in the process their right to take legal proceedings should not have been completely taken away and that they should also have had the liberty of partici pating in the proceedings right through In fact as the learned Attorney General pointed out one of the groups of litigants did give great assistance to the trial judge at Bhopal While the provision contained in the main part of section may be sufficient to enable <ORG> to claim to represent the claimants and initiate and conduct suits or proceeding on their behalf the locus standi of <ORG> in suits filed by other claimants before the commencement of the Act out side India would naturally depend upon the discretion of the court enquiring into the matter Again section mandates that notwithstanding anything contained in section <ORG> in repre senting and acting in place of any person in relation to any claim shall have due regard to any matters which such person may require to be urged with respect to his claim In other words while seeming to deprive the claimants of their right to take legal action on their own it has preserved those rights to be exercised indirectly There is only a restriction of this right which in the circumstances is totally reasonable and justified The next angle from which the validity of the provision is attacked is that the provision enabling the <ORG> to enter into a compromise is bad It is common knowledge that any authority given to conduct a litigation cannot be effective unless it is accompanied by an authority to withdraw or settle the same if the circumstances call for it There were possibilities that the litiga tion may have to be fought out to the bitter finish There were possibilities that the <ORG> might be willing to ade quately compensate the victims either on their own or at the insistence of the <ORG> concerned There was also the possibility which had already been in evidence before Judge <NAME> that the proceedings might ultimately have to end in a negotiated settlement The legislation therefore cannot be considered to be unreasonable merely because in addition to the right to institute a suit or other proceedings it also empowers the <ORG> to with draw the proceedings or enter into a compromise From this point of view it is in the same position as the other victims and in the litigation with the <ORG> it has every interest in securing the maximum amount of compen sation possible for itself and the other victims as is pointed out later in this judgment and by <NAME> <NAME> the Act and Scheme thereunder have provided for an objective and quasi judicial determination of the amount of damages pay able to the victims of the tragedy There is no basis for the fear expressed during the hearing that the officers of the <ORG> may not be objective and may try to cut down the amounts of compensation so as not to exceed the amount received from the <ORG> If in the course of the proceedings there should arise any question of compromise or settlement it is open to the claimants to oppose the same and to urge <ORG> to have regard to specific aspects arriving at a settlement Save only that they cannot file a suit themselves their right to acquire redress has not really been abridged by the provisions of the Act Reference was made in this context to <NAME> case supra So we feel we should express no opinion here on this issue The argument is that the Act confers a discretionary and enabling power in the <ORG> to arrive at a settlement but lays down no guidelines or indications as to the stage at which or circumstances in which a settlement can be reached or the type of settlement that can be arrived at the power conferred should therefore be struck down as unguided arbitrary and uncanalised We therefore think it necessary to clarify for our part that we are not called upon to express any view on the observa tions in <NAME> case and should not be understood as having done so In point of fact also as pointed out by the learned Chief Justice the provisions of the Act and scheme thereunder envisage interim payments to the victims so there is nothing objectionable in this Act on this aspect We say this for two reasons That was indeed the main point on which the interim orders in this case were challenged before this Court and in the context of the events that took place remains undecided It may be men tioned here that no decided case was brought to our notice in which interim payment was ordered pending disposal of an action in tort in this country May be there is a strong case for ordering interim payments in such a case but in the absence of full and detailed consideration it cannot be assumed that left to themselves the victims would have been entitled to a normal and immediate right to such payment To say that the Act would be bad if it does not provide for payment of such compensa tion by the <ORG> irrespective of what may happen in the suit is to impose on the <ORG> an obligation higher than what flows from its being subrogated to the rights of the victims The next important aspect on which much debate took place before us was regarding the validity of the Act qua the procedure envisaged by it for a compromise or settle ment The difficulty in this case has arisen as we see it because of a fortuitous circumstance viz Though compromise talks had been in the air right from the beginning of this episode it is said that there was an element of surprise when they were put forward in <ORG> in February Perhaps the <ORG> could have given some more publicity to the proposed settlement in the newspapers radio and television and also permitted some time to lapse before approving it if only to see whether there were any other points of view likely to emerge It has been pointed out by <NAME> and we agree that the Act talks only of the civil liability of and the proceedings against the <ORG> or <ORG> or others for damages caused by the gas leak It has nothing to say about the criminal liability of any of the parties involved The validity of the Act cannot there fore be impugned on the ground that it permits and should not have permitted the withdrawal of criminal proceedings against the delinquents Whether in arriving at the settle ment this aspect could also have been taken into account and this term included in it is a question concerning the validity of the settlement This is a question outside the terms of reference to us and we therefore express no opinion in regard thereto The merits of the settlement as such are not in issue before us and nothing we say can or should fetter the hands of the Bench hearing a review petition which has already been filed from passing such orders thereon as it considers appropriate He has pointed out that the grievance of the petitioners that the order of this <ORG> did not give any basis for the settlement has since been sought to be met by the order passed on th May giving detailed reasons This shows that the <ORG> had applied its mind fully to the terms of the settlement in the light of the data as well as all the circumstances placed before it and had been satisfied that the settlement pro posed was a fair and reasonable one that could be approved In actions of this type the <ORG> approval is the true safety valve to prevent unfair settlements and the fact is that the highest <ORG> of the land has given thought to the matter and seen it fit to place its seal of approval to the settlement The <ORG> has already given an assurance in its order of May that it will only be too glad to consider any aspects that may have been overlooked in considering the terms of the settlement Can it be said in the circumstances that there has been a failure of justice which compels us to set aside the settlement as totally violative of fundamental rights <NAME> has pointed out that the answer to this question should be in the negative Though we are prima facie inclined to agree with him that there are good reasons why the settle ment should not be set aside on the ground that the princi ples of natural justice have been violated quite apart from the practical complications that may arise as the result of such an order we would not express any final opinion on the validity of the settlement but would leave it open to be agitated to the extent permissible in law in the review petition pending before this <ORG> There is one more aspect which we may perhaps usefully refer to in this context In the field of torts under the common law of England no action could be laid by the dependants or heirs of a person whose death was brought about by the tortious act of another on the maxim actio personalis moritur cum persona although a person injured by a similar act could claim damages for the wrong done to him We are therefore of the opinion that the old antiquated Act should be drastically amended or fresh legislation should be enacted which should inter alia contain appropriate provisions in regard to the fol lowing matters i The payment of a fixed minimum compensa tion on a no fault liability basis as under the Motor Vehicles Act pending final adjudi cation of the claims by a prescribed forum ii The creation of a special forum with specific power to grant interim relief in appropriate cases iii The evolution of a procedure to be followed by such forum which will be conducive to the expeditious determination of claims and avoid the high degree of formalism that at taches to proceedings in regular courts and iv A provision requiring industries and concerns engaged in hazardous activities to take out compulsory insurance against third party risks
