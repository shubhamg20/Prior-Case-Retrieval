In the <ORG> case it was held by this Court that such a levy was not valid There were Acts in several other States which suffered from the same infirmity and to meet the situation <ORG> passed the Sugarcane Cess Validation Act The Act made valid by all the assessments and collections made before its commencement under the various State Arts and laid down that all the provisions made under the State Act would be treated as part of further the said section was to be deemed to have existed at all material times when the cess was imposed assessed and collected under the State Act The appellant a sugar factory was asked to pay the cess for the years and appellant came to this Court with certificate The contentions urged on behalf of the appellant were What the validation of the Act had done was to attempt to cure the legislative incompetence of <ORG>s by validating State Act which were invalid on the ground of absence of legislative competence in the respective State Legislatures <ORG> had passed the Act in question not for the purpose of levying a cess of its own but for the purpose of enabling the respective states to retain the amounts which they had illegally collected The Act was therefore a colourable piece of legislation The Act had not been passed for the purposes of <ORG> and the recoveries of cesses which were retrospectively authorised by it were not likely to go into <ORG> The sugarcane crushing season was between October and June th Thus the legislative competence of <ORG> to levy a cess such as was imposed by of the Sugarcane Cess Validation Act Central Act of was not in doubt ii When an Act passed by a State Legislature is invalid on the ground that <ORG> did not have legislative competence to deal with the topics covered by it then even <ORG> cannot validate such an Act because the effect of such attempted validation in substance would be to confer legislative competence on the State legislature in regard to a field or topic which by the relevant provisions of the schedules to the Constitution is outside its jurisdiction Where a topic is not included within the relevant List dealing with the legislative competence of the Slate Legislatures <ORG> by making a law cannot attempt to confer such legislative competence on <ORG>s The plain meaning of is that the material and relevant provisions of the State Act as well as the provisions of notifications orders and rules issued or made thereunder are included in and shall be deemed to have been included at all material times in it iii Where a challenge to the validity of a legal enactment is made on the ground that it is a colourable piece of legislation what has to be proved to the satisfaction of the court is that though the Act ostensibly is within the legislative competence of the legislature in question in substance and in reality it covers field which is outside its legislative competence iv The validity of an Act must be judged in the light of the legislative competence of the legislature which passes the Act and may have to be examined in certain cases by reference to the question as to Whether fundamental right of citizens have been improperly contravened or to other considerations which may be relevant in that behalf But normally it would be inappropriate indeed illegitimate to hold an enquiry into the manner in which the funds raised by an Act would be dealt with when the court is considering the question about the validity of the Act itself If collections are made under statutory provisions which are invalid because they deal with a topic outside the legislative competence of <ORG> <ORG> can in exercise of its undoubted legislative competence pass a law retrospectively validating the said collections by converting their character from collections made tinder the State Statutes to that of collections made under its own statute operating retrospectively The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> The principal question of law which arises in this appeal is in regard to the validity of the Central Act <NAME> the Sugarcane Cess Validation Act No Rules to of the Madhya Pradesh Sugarcane Regulation of Supply Purchase Rules made under the said Act provide for the method of collection of cess proper meaning to be attached to the words local area in Entry of the Constitution when the area is a part of the <ORG> imposing the law is an area administered by a local body like a municipality a district board a local board a union board a <ORG> or the like IV of and it received the assent of the President the same day <ORG> however realized that there were several other State Act which suffered from the same infirmity and so on September the Act with which we are concerned in the present proceedings was passed It has also received the assent of the President the same day come into force in the respective States as from the dates which may be specified in that behalf by a notification issued by <ORG> and published in the Official Gazette The appellant challenged the validity of these demands and addressed respondent No in that behalf It was urged on their behalf that the impugned Act was valid and that the demands made by respondent No for the recovery of the cess and the commission were fully justified In regard to the demand for cane commission <ORG> was not impressed by the plea made by the appellant particularly in relation to the sugarcane season of and it hold that even though the <ORG> may not have come into existence a demand could be made with a view to provide for the constitution of the said <ORG> and thus enable it to afford service and assistance to the mills like the appellant That is how the principal question which arises for our decision is whether <ORG> was right in holding that the Act is constitutionally valid We have already referred to the decision of this Court in Diamond Sugar Mills and in view of the said decision it is obvious that the cess in question was outside the legislative competence of the States Article provides inter alia that subject to the provisions of this Constitution <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the relevant Entry relates to any other matter not enumerated in List or List III including any tax not mentioned in either of those Lists Article provides Parliament has exclusive power to make any law with respect to any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or State List Such power shall include the power of making any law imposing a tax not mentioned in either of those Lists Mr <NAME> for the appellant however contends that what the Act purports to do and in fact and in substance has done is to validate the invalid State Statutes the Act in other words does not represent provisions enacted by <ORG> as such but it represents an attempt made by <ORG> to validate laws which are invalid on the ground that the State Legislatures which enacted the said laws had no legislative competence to do so Section provides for the date from which the provisions of the Act shall come into force in different States and as we have already noticed the relevant dates for the respective States would be the dates which would be the notification issued by the Central Government and published in the Official Gazette Notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any Court all cesses imposed assessed or collected or purporting to have been imposed assessed or collected under any State Act before the commencement of this Act shall be deemed to have been validly imposed assessed or collected in accordance with law as if the provisions of the State Act and of all notifications orders and rules issued or made thereunder in so far as such provisions relate to the imposition assessment and collection of such cess had been included in and formed part of this section and this section had been in force at all material times when such cess was imposed assessed or collected and accordingly a no suit or other proceeding shall be maintained or continued in any Court for the refund of any cess paid under any State Act no Court shall enforce a decree or order directing the refund of any cess paid under any State Act and any cess imposed or assessed under any State Act before the commencement of this Act but not collected before such commencement may be recovered after assessment of the cess where necessary in the manner provided under that Act Section provides that nothing in this Act shall be construed as validating section of the Bombay Sugarcane Cess Act Bombay Act No of and accordingly the said section shall be omitted But where an impugned Act passed by a State <ORG> is invalid on the ground that the State <ORG> did not have legislative competence to deal with the topic covered by it then even <ORG> cannot validate such an Act because the effect of such attempted validation in substance would be to confer legislative competence on the State <ORG> in regard to a field or topic which by the relevant provisions of the Schedules in the Constitution is outside its jurisdiction Where a topic is not included within the relevant List dealing with the legislative competence of the State <ORG>s <ORG> by making a law cannot attempt to confer such legislative competence on the State <ORG>s There is a radical difference between the two positions The plain meaning of is that the material and relevant provisions of the State Act as well as the provisions of notifications orders and rules issued or made thereunder are included in and shall be deemed to have been included at all material times in it His case is that when <ORG> realised that as a result of the invalidity of different State Statutes the respective States were faced with the problem of refunding very large amounts to the persons from whom the cesses were recovered it has passed the present Act not for the purpose of levying a cess of its own but for the purpose of enabling the respective States to retain the amounts which they have illegally collected Where a challenge is made on this round what has to be proved to the satisfaction of the <ORG> is that though the Act ostensibly is within the legislative competence of the <ORG> in question in substance and in reality it covers a field which is outside its legislative competence It would be noticed that as soon as this aspect of the matter is borne in mind the argument that the Act is a colourable piece of legislation takes us back again to the true scope and effect of the provisions of Therefore we do not think there is any substance in the argument that the Act is invalid on the ground that it is a colourable piece of legislation Mr <NAME> has raised another contention against the validity of the Act He argues that the Act has not been passed for the purposes of the Union of India and the recoveries of cesses which are retrospectively authorised by it are not likely to go in <ORG> In support of this argument Mr <NAME> has referred to the general scheme of the devolution of revenues between the Union and the States which is provided for by the relevant Articles contained in Part XII of the Constitution and he has relied more particularly on the provisions of Act All other public moneys received by or on behalf of <ORG> or the Government of a <ORG> shall be credited to the public account of India or the public account of the <ORG> as the case may be The validity of the Act must be judged in the light of the legislative competence of the <ORG> which passes the Act and may have to be examined in certain cases by reference to the question as to whether fundamental rights of citizens have been improperly contravened or other considerations which may be relevant in that behalf it would be inappropriate and indeed illegitimate to hold an enquiry into the manner in which the funds raised by an Act would be dealt with when the Court is considering the question about the validity of the Act itself As we have just indicated if the taxes of cesses recovered under an Act are not dealt with in the manner prescribed by the Constitution what remedy a citizen may have and how it can be enforced are questions on which we express no opinion in this appeal All we are consider ing at this stage is whether even on the assumption made by Mr <NAME> it would be permissible for him to contend that the Act which is otherwise valid is rendered invalid because the funds in question will not go into <ORG> In truth this argument again proceeds on the basis that <ORG> has passed the Act not for the purpose of treating the recoveries made as those under its provisions retrospectively enacted but for the purpose of validating the said recoveries as made under the invalid State Act and we have already pointed out that completely negatives such an assumption the crucial question is if collections are made under statutory provisions which are invalid because they deal with a topic outside the legislative competence of the State Legislatures can <ORG> in exercise of its undoubted legislative competence pass a law retrospectively validating the said collections by covering their character from collections made under the State Statutes to that of the collections made under its own Statute operating retros pectively In our opinion the answer to this question has to be in the affirmative because to hold otherwise would be to cut down the width and amplitude of the legislative competence conferred on <ORG> by Art There is however one subsidiary question which still remains to be considered and that has relation to the demand for cess commission for the year Section of the Madhya Pradesh Act provides for the payment of commission on purchase of cane and Rules to prescribe the manner in which the said payment has to be made It is well settled that the imposition of a fee is generally supported on the basis of quid pro quo and so it is urged that the impugned recovery for the year is plainly without any quid pro quo and as such cannot be enforced XIX of was invalid <NAME> who spoke for the Court observed A levy in the nature of a fee does not cease to be of that character merely because there is an element of compulsion or coerciveness present in it nor is it a postulate of a fee that it must have direct relation to the actual services rendered by the authority to individual who obtains the benefit of the service If with a view to provide a specific service levy is imposed by law and expenses for maintaining the service are met out of the amounts collected there being a reasonable relation between the levy and the expenses incurred for rendering the service the levy would be in the nature of a fee and not in the nature of a tax <ORG> thought that these observations justified the view that a fee could be validly recovered from the appellant by way of commission to be paid to <ORG> even though the <ORG> may not have come into existence during the whole of the period in question Having regard to these provisions it seems to us very difficult to accept the view that the commission which had to be paid to the <ORG> fell to be paid even though the <ORG> was not in existence at all throughout the sugar crushing season in question Appeal dismissed and Order modified
