After bringing these provisions into operation the appellant made demands on the respondent on August for payment of the fees due for the period July to March Thereafter the appellant made an application to <ORG> to review its judgment on the ground that even if the Orissa Act of was superseded by Central Act of the liabilities which had accrued to the <ORG> prior to June could not be deemed to be wiped out because the Central Act was not retrospective It was urged on behalf of the <ORG> Inter alia that the supersession of the Orissa Act by the Central Act was neither more nor less than a repeal that the test of two legislations containing contradictory provisions is not however the only criterion of repugnancy for if a competent legislature with a superior efficacy expressly or impliedly evinces by its legislation an intention to cover the whole field the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after would be overborne on the ground of repugnance Where such is the position the inconsistency is demonstrated not by a detailed comparison of provisions of the two statutes but by the mere existence of the two pieces of legislation that if by reason of the declaration by <ORG> the entire subject matter of conservation and development of minerals has been taken over for being dealt with by <ORG> thus depriving the <ORG> of the power within it theretofore possessed it would follow that the matter in the <ORG> List is to the extent of the declaration subtracted from the scope and ambit of entry of the <ORG> List They raise for consideration the question regarding the continued operation of the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act Orissa Act of and the continued exigibility of the fees leviable from mine owners under the said enactment The facts giving rise to these petitions were briefly these There is not any material difference between the facts of the two cases and so it would be sufficient if we refer only to those in Civil Appeal of The necessary steps for bringing these provisions into operation were taken by the State Government who thereafter made demands on the respondent on August for the payment of the said fees When a demand was made for the sum the respondent filed petition of before <ORG> impugning the legality of the demand and claimed the reliefs we have set out earlier As the grounds on which the said demand of the fees was impugned raised substantial questions touching the interpretation of the Constitution the appellants applied to the <ORG> for a certificate of fitness under Art We shall now proceed to set out briefly the grounds upon which the learned Judges of <ORG> allowed the petition of the respondents <ORG>d shortly the contention which the learned judges of <ORG> accepted was that the Orissa Act had been rended ineffective or superseded by a Central enactment The Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act Act of hereinafter called the Central Act which was brought into force as and from June The Orissa Act had been enacted by virtue of the legislative power conferred by entry of the <ORG> Legislative List reading Regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with reference to regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> The legislative entry under which the later Central Act was enacted was item of the <ORG> List which ran Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest They held that for this reason the Orissa Act should be deemed to be non existent as and from June for every purpose with the consequence that there was lack of power to enforce and realise the demands for the payment of the fee at the time when the demands were issued and were sought to be enforced It is the correctness of this judgment that is challenged by the <ORG> in these appeals and <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the Union List and we are concerned in the present case with the State power in the State field The relevant clause in that context is cl of the Article which runs Subject to clauses and the <ORG> of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the State List Coming now to the Seventh Schedule Entry of the <ORG> List vests in <ORG> power to enact laws on the subject of regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> There is no controversy that the Central Act has been enacted by <ORG> in exercise of the legislative power contained in Entry or as regards the Central Act containing a declaration in terms of what is required by Entry for it enacts by It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided It does not need much argument to realise that to the extent to which <ORG> had taken under its control the regulation and development of minerals so much was withdrawn from the ambit of the power of <ORG> under Entry and legislation of the <ORG> which had rested on the existence of power under that entry would to the extent of that control be superseded or be rendered ineffective for here we have a case not of mere repugnancy between the provisions of the two enactments but of a denudation or deprivation of <ORG> legislative power by the declaration which <ORG> is empowered to make and has made The object of the Constitution of these mining areas was Inter alia the provision of amenities like communications water supply and electricity and the better development of areas wherein any mine was situated as well as to prove for the welfare of the residents or workers in any such area within which persons employed in a mine or group of mines reside or work Section makes provision for the constitution of <ORG> into which the cesses raised under and other moneys received in that behalf might be paid and the section also specifies the purposes for which the Fund may be utilised Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provisions the fund may be utilised to defray a the cost of measures for the benefit of labour and other persons residing or working in the mining areas directed towards the improvement of public health and sanitation the prevention of disease and the provision and improvement of medical facilities ii the provision and improvement of water supplies and facilities for washing iii the provision and improvement of educational facilities iv the improvement of standards of living including housing and nutrition the amelioration of social conditions and the provision of recreational facilities and the provision of roads tramways and railways and such other communications the grant to any educational <ORG> providing technical education in mining and such other allied subjects the grant to <ORG> a local authority or the owner agent or manager of a mine in aid of any scheme approved by <ORG> for any of the purposes of the Fund the cost of administering the Fund including the allowances if any of members of <ORG> constituted under section and the salaries provident funds pensions gratuity and allowances if any of officers appointed under section and any other expenditure which the State Government may direct to be defrayed from the Fund Section contains definitions of terms used in the Act and thus may be omitted to dealing with the procedure for obtaining prospecting licences or mining leases in respect of land in which minerals vest in the <ORG> Sections to are grouped under a caption which reads Rules for regulating the grant of Prospecting Licences and Mining Leases Section with which this group starts empowers <ORG> by notification to make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minerals and for purposes connected therewith Head runs the construction maintenance and use of roads power transmission lines tramways railways aerial ropeways pipelines and the making of passages for water for mining purposes on any land comprised in a mining lease Up to this point the Act was dealing with the first purpose viz the Regulation of mines It shall be the duty of <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals in India and for that purpose <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette make such rules as it thinks fit In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such rules may provide for all or any of the following matters namely a the development of mineral resources in any area Section provides for the recovery of any rent royalty tax or other sum due to the <ORG> under this Act or the rules made thereunder and these are to be recovered in the same manner as an arrear of land revenue Learned Counsel for the appellant raised points that the object and purposes of the Orissa Act and its provisions were quite distinct and different from the object and purposes of the <ORG> Act with the result that the two enactments could validly co exist since they do not cover the same field The object to be attained by the two enactments being so dissimilar there was no common area covered by the two enactments and the extent of control which the <ORG> assumed by its law was therefore entirely outside the field occupied by the <ORG> Act and there being thus no encroachment the <ORG> Act continued to operate in full force Even if the <ORG> Act might cover the same field in the sense that it would be competent to the <ORG> Government to make rules under the <ORG> Act for the same purposes as the Orissa Act and the rules when made would overlap the provisions of the Orissa Act still there was no repugnance between the <ORG> Act and the Orissa Act until such rules were made for until then there is no effective and operative <ORG> legislation covering the field occupied by the Orissa Act The power to enact legislation to levy fees was an independent head of Legislative power under the Constitution under item in the <ORG> list and item in the <ORG> List and therefore there was no question of the supersession of the <ORG> power under item of the <ORG> List by a <ORG> enactment whose source of legislative power is entry of List I and there fore the demand for the fee competently enacted by the <ORG> was not superseded by <ORG> legislation even though the latter was covered by Entry of the <ORG> List On the other hand Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the respondent urged that the <ORG> Act covered the entire field of mineral development that being the extent to which <ORG> had declared by law that it was expedient that the <ORG> should assume control In this connection he relied most strongly on the terms of which laid a duty upon the <ORG> Government to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals in India and for that purpose the <ORG> Government may by notification make such rules as it deems fit If the entire field of mineral development was taken over that would include the provision of amenities to workmen employed in the mines which was necessary in order to stimulate or maintain the working of mines The test which he suggested was whether if under the power conferred by of the <ORG> Act the <ORG> Government had made rules providing for the amenities for which provision was made by the Orissa Act and if the <ORG> Government had imposed a fee to defray the expenses of the provision of these amenities would such rules be held to be ultra vires of the <ORG> Government and this particularly when taken in conjunction with the matters for which rules could be made under to which reference has already been made We consider there is considerable force in this submission of learned Counsel for the respondent and this would require very detailed and careful scrutiny The appellants then before this Court challenged on various grounds the constitutional validity of the Orissa Act and the rules made thereunder which empowered the <ORG> to levy the cess Section of that Act contained a declaration as we have in of the present <ORG> Act of and this read It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and oil fields and the development of mines to the extent hereinafter provided It is a very short enactment consisting only of sections of which it is only necessary to mention which is headed Power to make Rules as respects mineral deve By amendments effected in Central Act of by the later Act of the provisions which related to mines and minerals and their development and the references to mines and minerals in provisions common to them and to oil fields were excised so that thereafter while the earlier Act of was limited to the development of oil fields the entire range of the law relating to mines and mineral development was taken over and covered by Central Act of Dealing with this ground of challenge <NAME> <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed Its validity the demand of the fee under the Orissa Act is still open to challenge because the legislative competence of <ORG> under Entry is subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regu lation and development under the control of the <ORG> and that takes us to Entry In other words if a Central Act has been passed which contains a declaration by <ORG> as required by Entry and if the said declaration covers the field occupied by the impugned Act the impugned Act would be ultra wires not because of any repugnance between the two statutes but because <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass the law Section of the Act contains a declaration as to the expediency and control by <ORG> It reads thus Section of the Act provides that no mining lease shall be granted after the commencement of this Act otherwise than in accordance with the rules made under this Act Section empowers <ORG> to make rules by notification for regulating the grant of mining leases or for prohibiting the grant of such leases in respect of any mineral or in any area Section of the Act however empowers <ORG> to make rules by notification in the official gazette for the conservation and development of minerals Section lays down several matters in respect of which rules can be framed by <ORG> It is true that no rules have in fact been framed by <ORG> in regard to the levy and collection of any fees but in our opinion that would not make any difference If it is held that this Act contains the declaration referred to in Entry there would be no difficulty in holding that the declaration covers the field of conservation and development of minerals and the said field is indistinguishable from the field covered by the impugned Act What Entry provides is that the legislative competence of <ORG> is subject to the provisions of List I with respect to regulation and develop ment under the control of the <ORG> and Entry in List I requires a declaration by <ORG> by law that regulation and development of mines should be under the control of the <ORG> in public interest Therefore if a Central Act has been passed for the purpose of providing for the conservation and development of minerals and if it contains the requisite declaration then it would not be com petent to <ORG> to pass an Act in respect of the subject matter covered by the said declaration In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or enforced all that this required is a declaration by <ORG> that it is expedient in the public interest to take the regulation and development of mines under the control of the <ORG> In such a case the test must be whether the Legislative declaration covers the field or not Since the Central Act of contains the requisite declaration by the Union <ORG> under Entry and that Act covers the same field as the Act of in regard to mines and mineral development we consider that the decision of this Court concludes this matter unless there were any material difference between the scope and ambit of Central Act of and that of the Act of Learned Counsel for the appellant was not able to point to any matter of substance in which there is any difference between the two enactments It was suggested that whereas of the Act of empowered rules to be made for taxes being levied there was no specific power to impose taxes under that of It is not necessary to discuss the materiality of this point because what we are concerned with is the power to levy a fee and there is express provision therefore in of the Central Act of apart from the implication arising from thereof which runs Any rent royalty tax fee or other sum due to the Government under this Act or the rules made thereunder or under the terms and conditions of any pros pecting licence or mining lease may on a certificate of such officer as may be specified by <ORG> in this behalf by general or special order be recovered in the same manner as an arrear of land revenue We ought to add that besides we see considerable force in Mr <NAME> submission that sub ss of of the Central Act of are wider in scope and amplitude and confer larger powers on <ORG> than the corresponding provisions of the Act of The second point urged by the appellant is based on the fact that of the Central Act merely lays a duty on <ORG> to take steps for ensuring the conservation and development of the mineral resources of the country and in that sense is not self acting The submission is that even assuming that under the powers conferred thereunder read in conjunction with and the other provisions in the Act it would be competent for <ORG> to frame rules on the lines of the Orissa Act i for the development at mining areas and for that purpose to provide for the imposition of fees and for the constitution of a fund made up of these monies still no such rules had been framed and until such rules were made or such steps taken the Central Act would not cover the field so that the Orissa Act would continue to operate in full force In support of this submission reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Ch <NAME> Ors and in particular on a passage at reading Even assuming that sugarcane was an article or class of articles relatable to the sugar industry within the meaning of section of Act LXV of it is to be noted that no order was issued by <ORG> in exercise of the powers vested in it under that section and no question of repugnancy could ever arise because as has been noted above repugnancy must exist in fact and not depend merely on a possibility where this Court said In order that the declaration should be effective it is not necessary that rules should be made or enforced all that this required is a declaration by <ORG> that it was expedient in the public interest to take the regulation of development of mines under the control of the <ORG> In such a case the test must be whether the legislative declaration covers the field or not Repugnancy arises when two enactments both within the competence of the two <ORG>s collide and when the Constitution expressly or by necessary implication provides that the enactment of one <ORG> has superiority over the other then to the extent of the repugnancy the one supersedes the other The test of two legislations containing contradictory provisions is not however the only criterion of repugnancy for if a competent legislature with a superior efficacy expressly or impliedly evinces by its legislation an intention to cover the whole field the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after would be overborne on the ground of repugnance Where such is the position the inconsistency is demonstrated not by a detailed comparison of provisions of the two statutes but by the mere existence of the two pieces of legislation In the present case having regard to the terms of it appears clear to us that the intention of <ORG> was to cover the entire field and thus to leave no scope for the argument that until rules were framed there was no inconsistency and no super session of the State Act It was next urged that under the scheme of the legislative entries under the Constitution as previously under the Government of India Act the power to levy a fee was an independent head of legislative power under It is no doubt true that technically speaking the power to levy a fee is under the entries in the three lists treated as a subject matter of an Independent grant of legislative power but whether it is an incidental power related to a legislative head or an independent legislative power it is beyond dispute that in order that a fee may validly be imposed the subject matter or the main head of legislation in connection with which the fee is imposed is within legislative power If by reason of the declaration by <ORG> the entire subject matter of conservation and development of minerals has been taken over for being dealt with by <ORG> thus depriving the <ORG> of the power which it theretofore possessed it would follow that the matter in the <ORG> List is to the extent of the declaration subtracted from the scope and ambit of Entry of the <ORG> List Lastly it was urged that the fees recovery of which was being sought by the <ORG> were those which had accrued prior to June and as the Central Act was not retrospective it could not have operation so as to invalidate the demands for the payment of the fee made on the respondents Pausing here it is necessary to mention that after the judgment was delivered by <ORG> in the two petitions which are the subject of these two appeals before us setting aside even the notice of demand applications were made by the <ORG> Government to <ORG> to review its judgment <NAME> stated this in <NAME> Goodwin I take the effect of repealing a statute to be to obliterate it as completely from the records of the <ORG> as if it had never been passed and it must be considered as a law that never existed except for the purpose of those actions which were commenced prosecuted and concluded whilst it was an existing law This laid down the law as it was prior to the Inter pretation Act which by made provision for a saving of the type we now have in of the Indian General Clauses Act which we have extracted earlier Here we have a case not of an express repeal but of the supersession of a <ORG> enactment by a law having bythe Constitution superior efficacy The offence had been committed before the Constitution came into force and a prosecution launched earlier was pending after January as being inconsistent with one of the Fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution would not affect the validity of proceedings commenced under pre Constitution laws which were valid up to the date of the Constitution coming into force for to hold that the validity of these proceedings were affected would in effect be treating the Constitution as retrospective They therefore considered that there was no legal objection to the prosecution continuing The learned Attorney General had to concede that it was doubtful whether section of that Act is applicable where there is a repeal by implication and there can be no doubt that the law as to the effect of the expiry of a temporary statute still remains as stated in the books because section of the General Clauses Act and section of the Interpretation Act have no application except where an Act is repealed We must at the outset point out that there is a difference in principle between the effect of an expiry of a temporary statute and a repeal by a later enactment and the discussion now is confined to cases of the repeal of a statute which until the date of the repeal continues in force There is however no express decision either in England or so far as we have been able to ascertain in the United States on this point It is manifest that the principle underlying it is that every later enactment which supersedes an earlier one or puts an end to an earlier state of the law is presumed to intend the continuance of rights accrued and liabilities incurred under the superseded enactment unless there were sufficient indications express or implied in the later enactment designed to completely obliterate the earlier state of the law The entire theory underlying implied repeals is that there is no need for the later enactment to state in express terms that an earlier enactment has been repealed by using any particular set of words or form of drafting but that if the legislative intent to supersede the earlier law is manifested by the enactment of provisions as to effect such supersession then there is in law a repeal notwithstanding the absence of the word repeal in the later statute So far as statutory construction is concerned it is one of the cardinal principles of the law that there is no distinction or difference between an express provision and a provision which is necessarily implied for it is only the form that differs in the two cases and there is no difference in in tention or in Substance As the appellants have failed in their main submissions we make no order as to costs
