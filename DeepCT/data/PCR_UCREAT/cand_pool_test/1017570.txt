Vs RESPONDENT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX KERALA STATE DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH Syed Shah Mohammed Quadri JUDGMENT <NAME> The unsuccessful assessee is the appellant in this appeal by special leave which arises from the Judgment and Order of the Division Bench of <ORG> in I No of passed on October By the impugned order <ORG> answered the following two questions referred to it at the instance of the appellant in the affirmative that is against the appellant and in favour of the Revenue Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case that <ORG> was justified in holding that there was evidence before the Commissioner of Income tax that the assessment order was erroneous and prejudicial to revenue Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was justified in holding that Rs was a taxable receipt for the assessment year The facts giving rise to these questions may be noticed here It entered into an agreement for sale of the estate of rubber plantation measuring acres of land for consideration of Rs lakhs with After the appellant filed its reply the Commissioner by order dated February concluded that the said amount was unconnected with any agricultural operation activity and was liable to be taxed under the head income from other sources Dissatisfied with the Order of the Commissioner the appellant filed an appeal before <ORG> which was dismissed on August Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant urged the very same two contentions which were argued before <ORG> namely i that the exercise of jurisdiction by the Commissioner under Section of the Act was not only unwarranted but also illegal he contended that mere loss of tax could not be treated as prejudicial to the interests of the revenue and that only when the order of the Assessing Officer would affect the administration of the revenue that it could be treated as prejudicial to the revenue ii that the amount of Rs was in reality agricultural income and therefore ought not to have been brought to tax Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel for the respondent asserted that the Income tax Officer passed the order without application of mind and inasmuch as it resulted in loss of tax it was also prejudicial to the interests of the revenue therefore the exercise of jurisdiction under Section of the Act by the Commissioner was justified and legal Revision of orders prejudicial to revenue The Commissioner may call for and examine the record of any proceeding under this Act and if he considers that any order passed therein by the Assessing Officer is erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue he may after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard and after making or causing to be made such inquiry as he deems necessary pass such order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the assessment and directing a fresh assessment If one of them is absent if the order of the Income tax Officer is erroneous but is not prejudicial to the revenue or if it is not erroneous but is prejudicial to the revenue recourse cannot be had to Section of the Act An incorrect assumption of facts or an incorrect application of law will satisfy the requirement of the order being erroneous If due to an erroneous order of the Income tax Officer the revenue is losing tax lawfully payable by a person it will certainly be prejudicial to the interests of the revenue Every loss of revenue as a consequence of an order of Assessing Officer cannot be treated as prejudicial to the interests of the revenue for example when an Income tax Officer adopted one of the courses permissible in law and it has resulted in loss of revenue or where two views are possible and the Income tax Officer has taken one view with which the Commissioner does not agree it cannot be treated as an erroneous order prejudicial to the interests of the revenue unless the view taken by the Income tax Officer is unsustainable in law It has been held by this Court that where a sum not earned by a person is assessed as income in his hands on his so offering the order passed by the Assessing Officer accepting the same as such will be erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the revenue Thus there was no material to support the claim of the appellant that the said amount represented compensation for loss of agricultural income We find no merit in the appeal and dismiss the same with costs
