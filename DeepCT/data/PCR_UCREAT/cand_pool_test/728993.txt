Being resisted by the respondents when attempting to take delivery he applies under Order XXI Rule of the Civil Procedure Code The District Judge has dismissed the application holding that the said rule has no application But we are unable to uphold it as regards the first defendant and <NAME> who is alleged to have purchased the property subsequent to the attachment and while the save was pending The purchaser of the attached property is the representative of the judgment debtor within the meaning of Section of the new Code of Civil Procedure corresponding to Section of the old Code Under Rule of Order XXI the <ORG> is authorized to order delivery to a purchaser against a person claiming under a title created by the judgment debtor subsequenty to the attachment of the property There is nothing in Rule which militates against this view No inference can be drawn against the applicability of Section from the omission in Rule of a person claiming title by purchase from the judgment debtor after attachment Assuming that there is any doubt in the matter on the language of Rule itself we should be quite prepared to hold that under Section Judge was bound to deal with the application under Rule A decision in one proceeding that no appeal lay has not the force of res judicata so as to preclude an appeal in another proceeding We set aside the order of the District Judge except as regards the seventh defendant and remand the case for the disposal according to law
