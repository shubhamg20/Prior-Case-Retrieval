HEADNOTE Article of the Constitution confers on <ORG> power to issue appropriate writs to any person or authority within their territorial jurisdiction in terms absolute and unqualified and Election <ORG> functioning within the territorial jurisdiction of the <ORG> would fall within the sweep of that power The writ of certiorari for quashing the offending order or proceeding is directed against a record and as a record can be brought up only through human agency it is ordinarily issued to the person or authority whose decision is to be reviewed If it is the record of the decision that has to be removed by certiorari then the fact that the tribunal has become funtus officio subsequent to the decision could have no effect on the jurisdiction of <ORG> to remove the record The writ of certiorari being in reality directed against the record there is no reason why it should not be issued to whosoever has the custody thereof of the Constitution is firstly that it confers on the <ORG> power to issue writs and directions and secondly it defines the limits of that power This latter it does by enacting that it could be exercised over any person or authority within the territories in relation to which it exercises its jurisdiction The emphasis is on the words within the territory and their significance is that the jurisdiction to issue writs is coextensive with the territorial jurisdiction of the court There is one fundamental distinction between a writ of prohibition and a writ of certiorari If a writ of prohibition could be issued only if there are proceedings pending in a court it must follow that it is incapable of being granted when the court has ceased to exist because there could be then no proceeding on which it could operate What is an error apparent on the face of the record cannot be defined precisely or exhaustively there being an element of indefiniteness inherent in its very nature and it must be left to be determined judicially on the facts of each case There are well known rules for determining when a statute should be construed as mandatory and when directory All of them are only aids for ascertaining the true intention of the legislature which is the determining factor and that must ultimately depend on the context The appellant then filed Election Petition No of for setting aside the election on the ground inter alia that out of the votes counted in favour of the first respondent were liable to be rejected under Rule of Act No XLIII of on the ground that the ballot papers did not have the distinguishing marks prescribed under Rule and that by reason of their improper reception the result of the election had been materially affected What happened in this case was that voters for <ORG> in polling stations Nos and in Sobhapur were given ballot papers with brown bar intended for <ORG> instead of ballot papers with green bar which had to be used for <ORG> In his election petition the appellant contended that in accordance with this provision the ballot papers received at the Sobhapur polling stations not having the requisite mark should have been excluded and that if that had been done the first respondent would have lost the lead of votes and that he himself would have secured the largest number of votes He accordingly prayed that he might be declared duly The first respondent contested the petition The petition was heard by a Bench consisting of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> JJ <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> held that no writ could be issued under article firstly because the effect of article was to take away that power and secondly because <ORG> had become functus officio after the pronouncement of the decision and that thereafter there was no <ORG> to which directions could be issued under that article As regards article while <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> held that it had no application to Election <ORG>s <NAME> was of the view that they were also within the purview of that article but that in view of article no relief could be granted either setting aside the election of the first respondent or declaring the appellant elected and that the only order that could be made was to set aside the decision of the <ORG> But <NAME> held that as in arriving at that decision the <ORG> had taken into consideration irrelevant matters such as the mistake of the polling officer in issuing wrong ballot papers and its effect on the result of the election it had acted in excess of its jurisdiction The first question that arises for decision in this appeal is whether <ORG> have jurisdiction under article to issue writs against decisions of Election Tribunals That article confers on <ORG> power to issue appropriate writs to any person or authority within their territorial jurisdiction in terms absolute and unqualified and Election Tribunals functioning within the territorial jurisdiction of the <ORG> would fall within the sweep of that power The contention of Mr <NAME> for the first respondent is that such a limitation has been imposed on that power by article which is as follows Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution no election to either <ORG> of Parliament or to the <ORG> or either <ORG> of the <ORG> of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate <ORG> Now the question is whether a writ is a proceeding in which an election can properly be said to be called in question within the meaning of article These are instances of original proceedings calling in question an election and would be within the prohibition enacted in article We cannot accept a construction which leads to results so anomalous In overruling this contention <NAME> observed The non obstante clause with which article of the Constitution begins and upon which the respondent counsel lays so much stress debars us as it debars any other court in the land to entertain a suit or a proceeding calling in question any election to the <ORG> or <ORG> By parity of reasoning it must be held that the power of <ORG> under article to issue writ of certiorari against decisions of Election Tribunals remains equally unaffected by article <NAME> tion in <ORG> under article to issue certiorari against a decision of <ORG> it is incapable of exercise for the reason that under the scheme of Act No XLIII of the <ORG> is an ad hoc body set up for determination of a particular election petition that it becomes functus officio when it pronounces its decision and that thereafter there is no authority in existence to which the writ could be issued The question thus raised is of considerable importance on which there is little by way of direct authority and it has to be answered primarily on a consideration of the nature of a writ of certiorari to quash It is issued to remove actions and indictment pending in an inferior court for trial to <ORG> to transfer orders of civil courts and sentences of criminal courts for execution to the superior court to bring up depositions on an application for bail when the prisoner has been committed to <ORG> for trial and to remove the record of an inferior court when it is required for evidence in <ORG> As we are concerned in this appeal with certiorari to quash a decision it is necessary only to examine whether having regard to its nature such a writ for quashing can be issued to review the decision of a <ORG> which has ceased to exist It demolishes the order which it considers to be without jurisdiction or palpably erroneous but does not substitute its own view for those of the inferior tribunal through human agency it is issued to the person or authority whose decision is to be reviewed If it is the record of the decision that has to be removed by certiorari then the fact that the tribunal has become functus officio subsequent to the decision could have no effect on the jurisdiction of the court to remove the record If it is a question of issuing directions it is conceivable that there should be in existence a person or authority to whom they could be issued and when a certiorari other than one to quash the decision is proposed to be issued the fact that the tribunal has ceased to exist might operate as a bar to its issue Learned counsel for the first respondent invites our attention to the form of the order nisi in a writ of certiorari and contends that as it requires the court or tribunal whose proceedings are to be reviewed to transmit the records to the superior court there is if the tribunal has ceased to exist none to whom the writ could be issued and none who could be compelled to produce the record But then if the writ is in reality directed against the record there is no reason why it should not be issued to whosoever has the custody thereof Under section of Act No XLIII of the <ORG> is directed to send the records of the case after the order is pronounced either to the relative District Judge or to the Chief Judge of <ORG> and there is no legal impediment to a writ being issued to those officers to transmit the record to <ORG> We think that the power to issue a writ under article to a person as distinct from an authority is sufficiently comprehensive to take in any person who has the custody of the record and the officers mentioned in section of Act No XLIII of would be persons who would be amenable to the jurisdiction of <ORG> under the article It is argued that the wording of article that <ORG> shall have power to issue writs or directions to any person or authority within its territorial jurisdiction posits that there exists a person or authority to whom it could be issued and that in consequence they cannot be issued where no such authority exists The scope of article is firstly that it confers on <ORG>s power to issue writs and directions and secondly it defines the limits of that power This latter it does by enacting that it could be exercised over any person or authority within the territories in relation to which it exercises its jurisdiction The emphasis is on the words within the territory and their significance is that the jurisdiction to issue writ is co extensive with the territorial jurisdiction of the court The respondent contended that on the same reasoning certiorari against the decision of an Election <ORG> which bad become functus officio should also be refused and he further relied on the observations of <ORG> in Rex Electricity Com missioners London Electricity Joint Committee Co What is stated there is that both writs of prohibition and certiorari have for their object the restraining of inferior courts from exceeding their jurisdiction and they could be issued not merely to courts but to all authorities exercising judicial or quasi judicial functions But there is one fundamental distinction between the two writs and that is what is material for the present purpose They are issued at different stages of the proceedings When an inferior court takes up for hearing a matter over which it has no jurisdiction the person against whom the proceedings are taken can move the superior court for a writ of prohibition and on that an order will issue forbidding the inferior court from continuing the proceedings On the other band if the court hears that cause or matter and gives a decision the party aggrieved would have to move the superior court for a writ of certiorari and on that an order will be made quashing the decision on the ground of want of jurisdiction It might happen that in a proceeding before the inferior court a decision might have been passed which does not completely dispose of the matter in which case it might be necessary to apply both for certiorari and prohibition certiorari for quashing what had been decided and prohibition for arresting the further continuance of the proceeding Authorities have gone to this extent that in such cases when an application is made for a writ of prohibition and there is no prayer for certiorari it would be open to the <ORG> to stop further proceedings which are consequential on the decision Broadly speaking and apart from the cases of the kind referred to above a writ of prohibition will lie when the proceedings are to any extent pending and a writ of certiorari for quashing after they have terminated in a final decision Now if a writ of prohibition could be issued only if there are proceedings pending in a court it must follow that it is incapable of being granted when the court has ceased to exist because there could be then no proceeding on which it could operate In appeal to this Court against this judgment it was contended for the appellant that on a proper construction of section of the Industrial Disputes Act the <ORG> must be deemed to be not an ad hoc body established for adjudication of a particular dispute but a permanent <ORG> continuing in a sort of suspended animation and functioning intermittently This Court agreeing with <ORG> rejected this contention We can make an order or issue a writ in the nature of certiorari in all appropriate cases and in appropriate manner so long as we keep to the broad and fundamental principles that regulate the exercise of jurisdiction in the matter of granting such writs in English law It will be in consonance with these principles to hold that <ORG> have power under article to issue writs of certiorari for quashing the decisions of Election Tribunals notwithstanding that they become functus officio after pronouncing the decisions Then the question is whether there are proper grounds for the issue of certiorari in the present case There was considerable argument before us as to the character and scope of the writ of certiorari and the conditions under which it could be issued This is on the principle that a <ORG> which has jurisdiction over a subject matter has jurisdiction to de cide wrong as well as right and when the <ORG> does not choose to confer a right of appeal against that decision it would be defeating its purpose and policy if a superior <ORG> were to re hear the case on the evidence and substitute its own findings in certiorari This question came up for consideration in <NAME> Northumberland Compensation Appeal <ORG> Ex parte Shaw and it was held that when a <ORG> made a speaking order and the reasons given in that order in support of the decision In <ORG> <ORG> Lord <NAME> observed as follows If there was upon the face of the order of the court of quarter sessions anything which showed that order was erroneous <ORG> might be asked to have the order brought into it and to look at the order and view it upon the face of it and if the court found error upon the face of it to put an end to its existence by quashing it <NAME> who stated the power in broad and general terms observed It will have been seen that throughout all the cases there is one governing rule certiorari is only available to quash a decision for error of law if the error appears on the face of the record The fact is that what is an error apparent on the face of the record cannot be defined precisely or exhaustively there being an element of indefiniteness inherent in its very nature and it must be left to be determined judicially on the facts of each case It bad also held under section of Act No XLIII of that the result of the election had not been materially affected by the failure of the Returning Officer to comply with Rule Now the contention of Mr <NAME> for the appellant is that in reaching this conclusion the <ORG> had taken into account matters which are wholly extraneous to an enquiry under section such as the mistake of the polling officer in issuing wrong ballot papers and its possible effect on the result of the voting and that accordingly the decision was liable to be quashed by certiorari both on the ground of error of jurisdiction and error in the construction of section apparent on the face of the record On the question whether Rule is mandatory the argument of Mr <NAME> is that notwithstanding that the rule provides that the Returning Officer shall reject the ballot papers its real meaning is that he has the power to reject them and that on that construction his discretion in the matter of accepting them is not liable to be questioned They are well known and there is no need to repeat them But they are all of them only aids for ascertaining the true intention of the legislature which is the determining factor and that must ultimately depend on the context Rule a relates to a ballot paper which bears any mark or writing by which the elector can be identified That section had also a provision corresponding to Rule and it was held in that case that a breach of that section would render the vote void There is another reason which clinches the matter against the first respondent It is contended by Mr <NAME> that the power of <ORG> to prescribe a distinguishing mark includes the power to change a mark already prescribed and substitute a fresh one in its stead and that when <ORG> approved of the interchange of ballot papers at Hoshangabad it had in effect approved of the distinguishing mark which those ballot papers bore and that they were therefore rightly counted as valid by the Returning Officer There is no dispute that <ORG> which has the power to prescribe a distinguishing mark for the ballot papers has also the power to change it There is another difficulty in the way of accepting the contention of the first respondent That section requires that before an order setting aside an election could be made two conditions must be satisfied It must firstly be shown that there had been improper reception or refusal of a vote or reception of any vote which is void or noncompliance with the provisions of the Constitution or of the Act No XLIII of or any rules or orders made under that Act or of any other Act or rules re lating to the election or any mistake in the use of the prescribed form In reply Mr <NAME> contends that this argument though it might have proved decisive if no other factor had intervened could not prevail in view of the other facts found in this case in judging whether the result of the election had been affected these were matters relevant to be taken into consideration The object of the election be contended was to enable the majority of the voters to send a representative of their choice and for that purpose it was necessary to ascertain the intention of the voters from the ballot papers irrespective of the question whether they were formally defective or not that it was accordingly open to the <ORG> to look behind the barriers created by Rules and discover the mind of the voters and if that was truly reflected in the result of the election as declared under Rule dismiss the petition under section Mr <NAME> disputes this position and contends that the enquiry under that section must be limited to the matters raised in the election petition and that as there was no complaint about the breach of Rule in that petition it was outside the scope of the enquiry The <ORG> has gone into that question and has held that there was a violation of that rule and its conclusion is not open to attack in these proceedings and has not in fact been challenged The expression the result of the election in section must unless there is something in the context compelling a different interpretation be construed in the same sense as in section and there it clearly means the result on the basis of the valid votes If the Returning Officer had no power under Rule to accept a vote which had not the distinguishing mark prescribed by Rule on the ground that it was due to the mistake of the presiding officer in delivering the wrong ballot paper it is not contended that he has any such power and clearly he has not the <ORG> reviewing this decision under Rule can have no such power It is argued with great insistence that as the object of the Election Rules is to discover the intention of the majority of the voters in the choice of a representative if an elector has shown a clear intention to vote for a particular candidate that must be taken into account under section even though the vote might be bad for non compliance with the formalities But when the law prescribes that the intention should be expressed in a particular manner it can be taken into account only if it is so expressed The decision in <NAME> Sarsons was cited in support of the contention that for deciding whether the result of the election had been affected it was permissible to take into account votes which bad been rendered invalid by the mistake of the polling officer What happened in that case was that all the ballot papers issued at polling station No had been marked by the polling officer and bad become invalid under section of the Act Under the circumstances the proper order to pass is to quash the decision of the <ORG> and remove it out of the way by certiorari under article and to set aside the election of the first respondent in exercise of the powers conferred by article The parties will bear their own costs throughout
