It was requested that the letter alongwith the new items be treated as a writ petition under public interest litigation category Considering the importance of the issue raised in the letter being concerned by frequent complaints regarding custodial violence and deaths in police lock up the letter was treated as a writ petition and notice was issued on to the respondents That letter was also treated as a writ petition and was directed to be listed alongwith the writ petition filed by Shri <NAME> On this Court made the following order In almost every states there are allegations and these allegations are now increasing in frequency of deaths in custody described generally by newspapers as lock up deaths In response to the notice affidavits have been filed on behalf of the States of West Bengal Orissa Assam Himachal Pradesh Madhya Pradesh Harayana Tamil Nadu Meghalaya Maharashtra and Manipur Affidavits have also been filed on behalf of <ORG> and <ORG> Custodial violence including torture and death in the lock ups strikes a blow at the Rule of Law which demands that the powers of the executive should not only be derived from law but also that the same should be limited by law It is aggravated by the fact that it is committed by persons who are supposed to be the protectors of the citizens It is committed under the shield of uniform and authority in the four walls of a police station or lock up the victim being totally helpless Torture is a wound in the soul so painful that sometimes you can almost touch it but it is also so intangible that there is not way to heal it In England torture was once regarded as a normal practice to ger information regarding the crime the accomplices and the case property or to extract confessions but with the development of common law and more radical ideas imbibing human though and approach such inhuman practices were initially discouraged and eventually almost done away with certain aberrations here and there notwithstanding In regard to the power of arrest the Report recommended that the power to arrest without a warrant must be related to and limited by the object to be served by the arrest namely to prevent the suspect from destroying evidence or interfering with witnesses or warning accomplices who have not yet been arrested or where there is a good reason to suspect the repetition of the offence and not to every case irrespective of the object sought to be achieved Fundamental rights occupy a place of pride in the India Constitution Article provides no person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty expect according to procedure established by law The expression life of personal liberty has been held to include the right to live with human dignity and thus it would also include within itself a guarantee against torture and assault by the <ORG> or its functionaries Article guarantees protection against arrest and detention in certain cases and declares that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed of the grounds of such arrest and the shall not be denied the right to consult and defend himself by a legal practitioner of his choice Clause of Article directs that the person arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest Magistrate within a period of hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the court of the Magistrate Article of the Constitution lays down that a person accused of an offence shall not be compelled to be a witness against himself confers powers on any police officer to arrest a person under the circumstances specified therein without any order or a warrant of arrest from a Magistrate Section enjoins every police officer arresting any person without warrant to communicate to him the full particulars of the offence for which he is arrested and the grounds for such arrest Section contains a mandatory provision requiring the police officer making an arrest without warrant to produce the arrested person before a Magistrate without unnecessary delay and Section echoes Clause of Article of the Constituion of India There are some other provisions also like Section and which are aimed at affording procedural safeguards to a person arrested by the police Any form of torture of cruel inhuman or degrading treatment would fall within the inhibition of Article of the Constitution whether it occurs during investigation interrogation or otherwise If the functionaries of the <ORG> become law breakers it is bound to breed contempt for law and would encourage lawlessness and every man would have the tendency to become law unto himself thereby leading to anarchanism Does a citizen shed off his fundamental right to life the moment a policeman arrests him Can the right to life of a citizen be put in abeyance on his arrest These questions touch the spinal court of human rights jurisprudence The precious right guaranteed by Article of the Constitution of India cannot be denied to convicted undertrials detenues and other prisoners in custody except according to the procedure established by law by placing such reasonable restrictions as are permitted by law In <NAME> Vs State of Orissa SCC to which <ORG> was a party this Court pointed out that prisoners and detenues are not denuded of their fundamental rights under Article and it is only such restrictions as are permitted by law which can be imposed on the enjoyment of the fundamental rights of the arrestees and detenues It was observed It is axiomatic that convicts prisoners or undertrials are not denuded of their fundamental rights under Article and its is only such restrictions as are permitted by law which can be imposed on the enjoyment of the fundamental right by such persons It is an obligation of the State to ensure that there is no infringement of the indefeasible rights of a citizen life except in accordance with law while the citizen is in its custody The precious right guaranteed by Article of the constitution of India cannot be denied to convicts undertrials or other prisoners in custody expect according to procedure established by law There is a great responsibility on the police or prison authorities to ensure that the citizen in its custody is not deprived of his right to life His liberty is in the very nature of things circumscribed by the very fact of his confinement and therefore his interest in the limited liberty left to him is rather precious The duty of care on the part of the State is responsible if the person in custody of the police is deprived of his life except according to the procedure established by law The torture and injury caused on the body of the arrestee has sometime resulted into his death was recorded at the police station Rampura at the instance of Ramesh respondent No to the effect that he had found one unknown person near a tree by the side of the tank riggling with pain in his chest and that as a soon as respondent No reached near him the said person died The First Additional Sessions Judge acquitted all the respondents of all the charges holding that there was no direct evidence to connect the respondents with the crime This Court found that the following circumstances have been established by the prosecution beyond every reasonable doubt and coupled with the direct evidence of PWs and those circumstances were consistent only with the hypothesis of the quilt of the respondents and were inconsistent with their innocence a that the deceased had been brought alive to the police station ad was last seen alive there on That the dead body of the deceased was taken out of the police station on at about for being removed to the hospital that SI Trivedi respondent No <NAME> Respondent and <NAME> respondent No were present at the police station and had all joined hands to dispose of the dead body of Nathu Banjara That SI <NAME> respondent No created false evidence and fabricated false clues in the shape of documentary evidence with a view to screen the offence and for that matter the offender SI Trivedi respondent in connivance with some of his subordinates respondents herein had taken steps to cremate the dead body in haste describing the deceased as a lavaris though the identity of the deceased when they had interrogated for a sufficient long time was well known to them One of us namely <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> went on to observe The trial court and <ORG> if we may say so with respect exhibited a total lack of sensitivity and a could not careless attitude in appreciating the evidence on the record and thereby condoning the barbarous there degree methods which are still being used at some police stations despite being illegal In the ultimate analysis the society suffers and a criminal gets encouraged Tortures in police custody which of late are on the increase receive encouragement by this type of an unrealistic approach of the <ORG> because it reinforces the belief in the mind of the police that no harm would come to them if an odd prisoner dies in the lock up because there would hardly be and evidence available to the prosecution to directly implicate them with the torture The <ORG> must not loose sight of the fact that death in police custody is perhaps on of the worst kind of crime in a a civilised society governed by the rule of law and poses a serious thereat to an orderly civilised society The respondents were convicted for various offences including the offence under Section Part II IPC and sentenced to various terms of imprisonment and fine ranging from Rs <ORG> recommended in its th Report that in prosecution of a police officer for an alleged offence of having caused bodily injury to a person if there was evidence that the injury was caused during the period when the person was in the custody of the police the Court may presume that the injury was caused by the police officer having the custody of the person during that period The <ORG> further recommended that the court while considering the question of presumption should have regard to all relevant circumstances including the period of custody statement made by the victim medical evidence and the evidence with the Magistrate may have recorded Police is no doubt under a legal duty and has legitimate right to arrest a criminal and to interrogate him during the investigation of a an offence but it must be remembered that the law does not permit use of third degree methods or torture of accused in custody during interrogation and investigation with that view to solve the crime End cannot justify the means By torturing a person and using their degree methods the police would be accomplishing behind the closed doors what the demands of our legal order forbid No society can permit it Apart from the police there are several other governmental authorities also like <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> Intelligence Agencies like <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> which have the power to detain a person and to interrogated him in connection with the investigation of economic offences offences under the Essential Commodities Act Excise and Customs Act There are instances of torture and death in custody of these authorities as well In re Death of <NAME> Supp SCC to which <NAME> was a party this Court took suo moto notice of the death of <NAME> during his custody with the <ORG> After getting an enquiry conducted by the additional District Judge which disclosed a prima facie case for investigation and prosecution this Court directed the <ORG> to lodge a FIR and initiate criminal proceeding against all persons named in the report of the Additional District Judge and proceed against them There is one other aspect also which needs out consideration We are conscious of the fact that the police in India have to perform a difficult and delicate task particularly in view of the deteriorating law and order situation communal riots political turmoil student unrest terrorist activities and among others the increasing number of underworld and armed gangs and criminals Many hard core criminals like extremist the terrorists drug peddlers smugglers who have organised gangs have taken strong roots in the society It is being said in certain quarters that with more and more liberalisation and enforcement of fundamental rights it would lead to difficulties in the detection of crimes committed by such categories of hardened criminals by soft peddling interrogation It is felt in those quarters that if we lay to much of emphasis on protection of their fundamental rights and human rights such criminals may go scot free without exposing any element or iota or criminality with the result the crime would go unpunished and in the ultimate analysis the society would suffer This all the more so in view of the expectation of the society that police must deal with the criminals in an efficient and effective manner and bring to book those who are involved in the crime The right to interrogate the detenues culprits or arrestees in the interest of the nation must take precedence over an individual right to personal liberty In addition to the statutory and constitutional requirements to which we have made a reference we are of the view that it would be useful and effective to structure appropriate machinery for contemporaneous recording and notification of all cases of arrest and detention to bring in transparency and accountability We therefore consider it appropriate to issue the following requirements to be followed in all cases of arrest or detention till legal provisions are made in that behalf as preventive measures The police personnel carrying out the arrest and handling the interrogation of the arrestee should bear accurate visible and clear identification and name togs with their designations A person who has been arrested or detained and is being held in custody in a police station or interrogation centre or other lock up shall be entitled to have one friend or relative or other person known to him or having interest in his welfare being informed as soon as practicable that he has been arrested and is being detained at the particular place unless the attesting witness of the memo of arrest is himself such a friend or a relative of the arrestee The person arrested must be made aware of this right to have someone informed of his arrest or detention as soon he is put under arrest or is detained Copies of all the documents including the memo of arrest referred to above should be sent to the illaga Magistrate for his record Failure to comply with the requirements hereinabove mentioned shall apart from rendering the concerned official liable for departmental action also render his liable to be punished for contempt of court and the proceedings for contempt of court may be instituted in any <ORG> of the country having territorial jurisdiction over the matter These requirements are in addition to the constitutional and statutory safeguards and do not detract from various other directions given by the courts from time to time in connection with the safeguarding of the rights and dignity of the arrestee The law will that in every case where man is wronged and undamaged he must have a remedy There is indeed no express provision in the Constitution of India for grant of compensation for violation of a fundamental right to life nonetheless this Court has judicially evolved a right compensation in cases of established unconstitutional deprivation of person liberty or life For the violation of the fundamental right to life or the basic human rights however this Court has taken the view that the defence of sovereign immunity is not available to the <ORG> for the tortious act of the public servants and for the established violation of the rights guaranteed by Article of the Constitution of India In <NAME> Vs <ORG> supra the decision of this Court in <NAME> Vs <ORG> of SCR wherein the plea of sovereign immunity had been upheld in a case of vicarious liability of the <ORG> for the tort committed by its employees was explained thus In this Context it is sufficient to say that the decision of this <ORG> in Kasturilal upholding the State plea of sovereign immunity for tortious acts of its servants is confined to the sphere of liability in tort which is distinct from the State liability for contravention of fundamental rights to which the doctrine of sovereign immunity has no application in the constitutional remedy under Articles and of the Constitution which enables award of compensation for contravention of fundamental rights when the only practicable mode of enforcement of the fundamental rights can be the award of compensation The decisions of this court in Rudul Sah and others in that line relate to award of compensation for contravention of fundamental rights in the constitutional remedy upon Articles and of the Constitution On the other hand Kasturilal related to the value of goods seized and not returned to the owner due to the fault of government Servants the claim being of damages of the tort of conversion under the ordinary process and not a claim for compensation for violation of fundamental rights The claim in public law for compensation for unconstitutional deprivation of fundamental right to life and liberty the protection of which is guaranteed under the Constitution is a claim based on strict liability and is in addition to the claim available in private law for damages of tortious acts of the public servants Public law proceedings serve a different purpose than the private law proceedings Award of compensation for established infringement of the indefeasible rights guaranteed under Article of the Constitutions is remedy available in public law since the purpose of public law is not only to civilise public power but also to assure the citizens that they live under a legal system wherein their rights and interests shall be protected and preserved Grant of compensation in proceedings under Article or of the Constitution of India for the established violation or the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article is an exercise of the <ORG> under the public law jurisdiction for penalising the wrong door and fixing the liability for the public wrong on the <ORG> which failed in the discharge of its public duty to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen The old doctrine of only relegating the aggrieved to the remedies available in civil law limits the role of the courts too much as the protector and custodian of the indefeasible rights of the citizens The courts have the obligation to satisfy the social aspirations of the citizens because the court and the law are for the people and expected to respond to their aspirations In <NAME> case supra it was held Adverting to the grant of relief to the heirs of a victim of custodial death for the infraction or invasion of his rights guaranteed under Article of the Constitution of India it is not always enough to relegate him to the ordinary remedy of a civil suit to claim damages for the tortious act of the State as that remedy in private law indeed is available to the aggrieved party The citizen complaining of the infringement of the indefeasible right under Article of the constitution cannot be told that for the established violation of the fundamental right to life he cannot get any relief under the public law by the courts exercising Writ jurisdiction The primary source of the public law proceedings stems from the prerogative writs and the courts have therefore to evolve new tools to give relief in public law by moulding it according to the situation with a view to preserve and protect the Rule of Law But if and when wrongs are thereby suffered by any of us what is the remedy Our procedure for securing our personal freedom is efficient out procedure for preventing the abuse of power is not They must be replaced by new and up to date machinery by declarations injunctions and actions for negligence This is not the task of <ORG> the courts must do this Properly exercised the new powers of the executive lead to the welfare state but abused they lead to a totalitarian state None such must ever be allowed in this country A similar approach of redressing the wrong by award of monetary compensation against the <ORG> for its failure to protect the fundamental rights of the citizen has been adopted by <ORG> which has a written constitution guaranteeing fundamental rights but which also like the Indian Constitution contains no provision of remedy for the infringement of those rights Lord <NAME> speaking for the majority said It was argued on behalf of the Attorney General that Section does not permit of an order for monetary compensation despite the fact that this kind of redress was ordered in <NAME> Attorney General of Guyana Reliance was placed on the reference in the sub section to enforcing or securing the enforcement of any of the provisions of the said foregoing sections as the purpose for which orders etc An order for payment of compensation it was submitted did not amount to the enforcement of the rights that had been contravened In their Lordships view of order for payment of compensation when a right protected under Section has been contravened is clearly a form of redress which a person is entitled to claim under Section and may well be any only practicable form of redress as by now it is in the instant case The jurisdiction to make such an order is conferred on <ORG> by para a of Section viz jurisdiction to here and determine any application made by any person in pursuance of sub section of this section The very wide power to make orders issue writs and give directions are ancillary to this Lord <NAME> then went on to observe at page Finally their Lordships would say something about the measure of monetary compensation recoverable under Section where the contravention of the claimant constitutional rights consists of deprivation of liberty otherwise that by due process of law I see no reason to think that this should depend on the terms of a written constitution the reasoning that has led <ORG> and the <ORG> of Ireland and India to the conclusions reached in the cases to which I have referred and they are but a sample is in my opinion equally valid to the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act if it is to have life and meaning The Court held that its power of enforcement imposed a duty to forge new tools of which compensation was an appropriate on where that was the only mode of redress available This Was not a remedy in tort but one in public law based on strict liability for the contravention of fundamental rights to which the principle of sovereign immunity does not apply The old doctrine of only relegating the aggrieved to the remedies available in civil law limits the role of the courts too much as protector and guarantor of the indefeasible rights of the citizens The courts have the obligation to satisfy the social aspirations of the citizens because the courts and the law are for the people and expected to respond to their aspirations The purpose of public law is not only to civilize public that they live under a legal system which aims to protect their interest and preserve their rights Each the five members of <ORG> in <NAME> case supra delivered a separate judgment but there was unanimity of opinion regarding the grant of pecuniary compensation to the victim for the contravention of his rights guaranteed under the Bill of Rights Act notwithstanding the absence of an express provision in that behalf in the Bill of Rights Act The amount of compensation as awarded by the <ORG> and paid by the <ORG> to redress The wrong done may in a given case be adjusted against any amount which may be awarded to the claimant by way of damages in a civil suit
