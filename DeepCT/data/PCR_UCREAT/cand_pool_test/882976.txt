This appeal arises out of a suit filed by the respondents in <ORG> of Vizianagaram for a declaration that the Madras General Sales Tax Act and the Turnover and Assessment rules framed thereunder are ultra vires <ORG> a permanent injunction restraining <ORG> from collecting any tax from the respondents on the sales by them of groundnut oil and groundnut cake and an order directing the refund of Rs the amount which the respondents alleged they had been unlawfully compelled to pay in respect of sales of groundnut oil and groundnut cake during the month of October The Government of India Act vests in <ORG> the power of imposing duties of excise on goods manufactured or produced in India subject to certain exceptions which do not include the goods dealt in by the respondents The power of imposing taxation on the sale of goods is given to <ORG>s When the respondents first came into Court their case was that a tax on the sale of goods is in all cases an excise duty and therefore <ORG> had exceeded its power in enacting the General Sales Tax Act where it was held that an Act of a Provincial Legislature levying a tax on retail sales of motor spirit and lubricants was not ultra vires <ORG> it was impossible for the respondents to maintain that the Madras General Sales Tax Act was invalid in its entirety but the question whether a tax on the first sale of goods manufactured or produced within the Province constituted an excise duty remained open to them The respondents also raised the question whether the assessing authority was entitled to impose i he tax both on their purchases of groundnuts and their sales of groundnut oil and groundnut cake relying here on a proviso to Section of the Act to the effect that in respect of the same transaction the buyer and the seller shall not both be taxed but only one of them and that when the amount for which goods are bought by a dealer has been included in his turnover the amount of the sale price shall be excluded The appellant contentions may be summarised as follows An excise duty implies only a tax on the manufacture or production of goods before they leave the hands of the manufacturer or producer and as such a tax can be imposed before any sale takes place there is no conflict of power <ORG> has free scope to impose an excise duty before a sale takes place leaving <ORG> the power to impose a tax when a sale in fact takes place If a tax on the first sale of goods manufactured or produced within the Province is an excise duty then the Act is ultra vires to this extent and there is a corresponding defect in the rules framed under the Act which means that the respondents cannot lawfully be taxed on their sales of groundnut oil and groundnut cake and the third and fourth questions will not arise The entry in the Federal List relating to duties of excise is Entry No which reads as follows Duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except a alcoholic liquors for human consumption opium Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics non narcotic drugs medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub paragraph of this entry The power of imposing excise duties on the excepted goods is given to <ORG> by Entry No of the Provincial List If such goods are manufactured or produced in the Province <ORG> may levy duties of excise on them if manufactured or produced elsewhere in India it may impose countervailing duties at the same or lower rates Broadly speaking an excise is a duty imposed on goods manufactured or produced in the country as opposed to a customs duty which is levied on goods imported from other countries but this broad distinction will not suffice here Therefore a tax on the sale of goods manufactured or produced within the United Kingdom would undoubtedly fall within the definition of excise but it is to be remembered that in the United Kingdom there is no division of legislative powers although <NAME> <NAME> maintained that the primary and fundamental meaning in English of an excise duty is still that of a tax on articles produced or manufactured in the taxing country and intended for home consumption and that the Government of India Act did not intend to give the words duties of excise an extended meaning The learned Chief Justice of India observed page In my opinion the power to make laws with respect to duties of excise given by the Constitution Act to <ORG> is to be construed as a power to impose duties of excise upon the manufacturer or producer of the excisable articles or at least at the stage of or in connexion with manufacture or production and extends no further He did not however proceed to discuss the problem whether a tax on the first sale that is the sale by the manufacturer or producer is a duty imposed in connection with the manufacture or production because the question did not arise in that case <NAME> was also of the opinion that the wider meaning given by commentators and economists and accepted in England may be inapplicable to the Indian Constitution and in the course of his judgment said page The essence of a tax on goods manufactured or produced is that the right to levy it accrues by virtue of their manufacture or production If a duty is imposed on the goods manufactured or produced when they issue from the manufactory then the duty becomes leviable independently of the purpose for which they leave it and irrespective of what happens to them later Thus a duty on goods manufactured or produced is distinct and separate from and independent of a duty on their sale and except probably at the stage of the first sale there seems to be no good reason why the two may not co exist without overlapping In the opinion of <NAME> a tax on the sale of goods manufactured or produced in a country is an excise duty but he considered that by the insertion of Entry No in the Provincial List <ORG> meant to reserve to <ORG> the power of imposing a tax on sales for the purposes of consumption and the only question in The Central Provinces Case Supp was whether a tax levied by <ORG> on the sale to the consumer was lawful The learned Judge considered that there was no escape from the conclusion that the definition of excise in Entry No of the Devolution Rules and the expression duties of excise in Entry No of the Provincial List in the present Act bear a wide signification and include all duties levied on the consumption of the excisable commodity in the Province at any stage from production to sale That save as aforesaid all duties of excise on those goods whether levied and collected at the stage of manufacture production or any subsequent stage upto consumption exclusive of sale in the Province as stated above should remain exclusively within the competence of the <ORG> The constitution of the Australian Commonwealth has been built on different lines from those of the Indian constitution and in interpreting the Government of India Act the <ORG> can only have regard to the provisions contained therein but this does not mean that the <ORG> is precluded from examining the judgment in <ORG> <ORG> South Australia Com in order to see whether they throw light on the meaning to be attached to the words excise duties used in the Government of India Act and we consider that these judgments do render great assistance in solving the first of the problems with which this <ORG> is now confronted The Act of the South Australian Parliament imposed a tax of three pence on every gallon of motor spirit sold within the State excluding spirits sold for delivery in or transportation to any place outside the State and the vendor was authorised to add the amount of the tax to the price agreed to be paid Six of the seven judges who constituted the <ORG> were of the opinion that the Act was ultra vires because it violated the power of <ORG> to impose duties of excise In citing this case and in an endeavour to find support for his argument that even a tax on the first sale is not an excise duty the learned Advocate General laid great stress on this passage in the judgment of <NAME> page Licences to sell liquor or other articles may well come within an excise duty law if they are so connected with the production of the articles sold or are otherwise so imposed as in effect to be a method of taxing the production of the article I agree with the reasoning in <NAME> <NAME> Com This is made clear by the following passage in the judgment of <NAME> page The first sale of motor spirit after its production either by primary or later processes is naturally and in the ordinary course of business a sale by the producer and a sale by him is certainly included We hold that <ORG> in India has no power to tax a sale by the manufacturer or producer as for the reasons given this would mean the imposition of an excise duty and the assumption of power vested only in the <ORG> Entry No in the Federal List and Entry No in the Provincial List can be reconciled by reading into Entry No of the Provincial List a power to tax all sales subsequent to the sale by the manufacturer or producer that is when the property in the goods has passed beyond the manufacturer or producer and the goods have become part of the general stock of the Province It has been said that there is nothing to prevent the manufacturer or producer opening a shop to sell his goods retail to the effect that the only power given to <ORG> by Entry No is a power to impose a tax on turnover The contention of <ORG> was that the Central Provinces and Berar Sales of Motor Spirit and Lubricants Taxation Act constituted an infringement of the power of <ORG> and the argument of the learned Advocate General of India was advanced in support of this contention Turnover is defined by Section as meaning the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought by or sold by a dealer whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise is excluded from his turnover By an amending Act which received the assent of the Governor on the th March the tax is now Rs of the turnover if it exceeds Rs Moreover it is to be remembered that a <ORG> cannot do indirectly that which it has no power to do directly that <ORG> merely intended to give to the Provinces the power to impose a tax on turnover and not a power to tax individual transactions but in doing so he overlooked the fact that the decision in The Central Provinces Case Supp Notwithstanding that the tax imposed by the Madras General Sales Tax Act is based on turnover we hold that it is in fact a tax on sales and that in so far as it imposes a tax on the first sales of goods manufactured or produced within the Province it is ultra vires the Provincial <ORG> Consequently the appeal will be dismissed with costs and a certificate for two counsel granted A memorandum of cross objections has been filed by the respondents but they have not pressed it and it will also be dismissed in this case without costs
