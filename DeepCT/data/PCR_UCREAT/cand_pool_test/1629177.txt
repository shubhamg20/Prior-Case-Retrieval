Vs RESPONDENT THE STATE OF BIHAR DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> <NAME> BENCH <NAME> <NAME> AIYYAR VENKATARAMA <NAME> SARKAR A BOSE VIVIAN CITATION AIR SCR ACT Sales Tax Provincial legislation imposing tax in certain circumstances Validity Power of Provincial Legislature Retrospective levy legality of Theory of territorial nexus if applicable Bihar Sales Tax Act No In the railway receipt the company itself figured as the consignee it paid the freight and the receipt was sent either to its branch offices or bankers to be handed over to the purchaser when he paid the price From the amounts shown as gross turn over in the two returns for the two periods the company claimed deduction of certain amounts being the valuable consideration for the goods manufactured in Bihar but sold delivered and consumed outside on the ground that in none of the transactions in respect of the said sums did property in the goods pass to the purchasers in Bihar The other questions decided by <ORG> against the appellant related to the vires of the Act and the validity of retrospective levy of sales tax under of the Act The appellant contentions in the appeals were that the tax levied under read with second proviso cl II of the Act was not a sales tax within the meaning of Entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Govern ment of India Act but was in the nature of excise duty which a provincial legislature had no power to impose that the theory of territorial nexus was inapplicable to sales tax and in any case there was no real or sufficient nexus in the present cases and that retrospective levy of the sales tax under Of the Act destroyed the indirect nature of the tax thus making it a direct tax on the dealer which could not be passed on to the consumer Held per <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> dissenting that the contentions raised on behalf of the appellant must be negatived Under cl ii of the second proviso to of the Act the producer or manufacturer became liable to pay the tax not because he produced or manufactured the goods but because he sold them As in a sale of goods the goods must necessarily play an important part the circumstances mentioned in the proviso to of the Act namely the presence of the goods in Bihar at the date of the agreement of sale or their production or manufacture there must be held to constitute a sufficient nexus between the taxing province and the sale wherever that might take place A <ORG> can tax a sale of goods that takes place within its boundary It has no power to tax extra territorially and since a completed sale can have only one situs no <ORG> Legislature can be allowed to break up a sale into its component parts which are separate and distinct from the sale itself and by an application of the theory of nexus claim that he sale wholly took place within it The nexus can only be in respect of the entire sale wherever it may take place and not of its several parts DAS <NAME> These two appeals which have been filed with the special leave granted by an order made by this Court on April and which have been consolidated together by the same order are dire led against the judgment pronounced by the Patna high Court on October in Miscellaneous Judicial Case No of deciding certain questions refer The said references arose out of two orders passed by <ORG> in revision of two sales tax assessment orders made against the appellant company It carries on business as manufacturer of iron and steel and is a registered dealer under the Act the registration No being being the amount of valuable consideration for the goods manufactured at Jamshedpur in the State of Bihar but sold delivered and consumed outside that State on the ground that in none of the transactions in respect of the said sum did the property in the goods pass to the purchasers in the State of Bihar being the amount of valuable consideration for goods manufactured at Jamshedpur in the State of Bihar but sold delivered and consumed outside that State on the same ground as hereinbefore mentioned Against these two assessment orders the appellant company preferred two appeals under of the Act to the Commissioner of Sales Tax of Chota Nagpur who on April dismissed both the appeals By a common order dated October made in the said two references <ORG> referred the following questions of law to <ORG> for its decision Is the Bihar Sales Tax Act as amended in ultra vires <ORG> in view of the extended meaning of the expression taxes on sale of goods given in the Act in the light of the provisions of the Government of India Act Are the provisions of section of the Act ultra vires <ORG> <NAME> Is it legal to include sales tax in the taxable turnover of an assessee like the petitioner Was the Bihar Sales Tax Amendment Act of legally extended to Chotanagpur Were the levy and collection of sales taxes for periods prior to the th January under the Sales Tax Act then in force rendered illegal by the provisions of the Constitution Was the Commissioner who passed orders in appeal after the Constitution came into force bound to decide the appeal according to the provisions of the Constitution in respect of taxes levied or sought to be levied for periods prior to the th January when the Constitution came into force Out of these six questions question No was decided in favour of the appellant company and the respondent <ORG> has not preferred any appeal against that decision or questioned its correctness Questions Nos and were decided against the appellant company and the two consolidated appeals are directed against <ORG> decision on these questions The following points as formulated by the learned Attorney General appearing for the appellant company have been urged before us in support of these appeals The tax levied under read with second proviso cl ii is not a tax on sale within the meaning of Entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act Section of that Act provided that subject to the two preceding sub sections <ORG> had and <ORG> had not power to make laws for any Province or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List of the Seventh Schedule to that Act It is in exercise of this legislative power that <ORG> of Bihar passed the Act which received the assent of the Governor General on June and came into force on July by virtue of a notification made in the official gazette under of the said Act The relevant portion of of the Act which was the charging section was prior to its amendment hereinafter mentioned expressed in the following terms Subject to the provisions of sections and and with effect from such date as the Provincial Government may by notification in the official gazette appoint being not earlier than days after the date of the said notification every dealer whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the commencement of this Act on sales which had taken place both in and outside Bihar exceeded Rs shall be liable to pay tax under this Act on sales which have taken place in Bihar after the date was notified It should be noted that although the Act came into force on July by virtue of a notification published in the official gazette under thereof the charging section quoted above did not come into operation because by its own terms it required a further notification in the official gazette to bring it into effect Section as amended read as follows Subject to the provisions of sections and and with effect from the commencement of this Act every dealer whose turnover during the year immediately preceding the date of such commencement on sales which have taken place both in and outside Bihar exceeded Rs shall be liable to pay tax under this Act on sales which have taken place in Bihar on and from the date of such commencement Two things should be noted namely that the person sought to be charged was every dealer whose gross turnover during the specified period on sales which had taken place both in and outside Bihar exceeded Rs and that the liability to pay tax was on sales which had taken place in Bihar on and from the date of such commencement This takes us back to which defines sale The material part of the definition of sale previous to the amendment made by the amending Act read as follows Sale means with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions any transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration including a transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of contract but does not include a mortgage hypothecation charge or pledge Provided The material part of thus amended read as follows Sale means with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions any transfer of property in goods for cash or deferred payment or other valuable consideration including a transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of contract but does not include a mortgage hypothecation charge or pledge Provided Provided further that notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indian Sale of Goods Act the sale of any goods i which are actually in Bihar at the time when in respect thereof the contract of sale as defined in section of that Act is made or ii which are produced or manufactured in Bihar by the producer or manufacturer thereof shall wherever the delivery or contract of sale is made be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have taken place in Bihar The amending Act by substituted for the old sub of of the Act the following sub section namely Subject to the provisions of sections and and with effect from the commencement of this Act every dealer whose gross turnover during the year immediately preceding the date of such commencement on sales which have taken place both in and outside Bihar exceeded Rs shall be liable to pay tax under this Act on sales which have taken place in Bihar on and from the date of such com mencement Provided that the tax shall not be payable on sales involved in the execution of a contract which is shown to the satisfaction of the Commissioner to have been entered into by the dealer concerned on or before the st day of October Although the amending Act received the assent of the Governor General on March it came into force on October as provided in thereof Therefore the definition of sale as it stood prior to the amendment was applicable to all sales made by the appellant throughout the first period hereinbefore mentioned i the period from July to March and also to those made during the period from April to October which was only a portion of the second period hereinbefore mentioned and the amended definition applied to all sales made by the appellant during the remaining portion of the second period i from October to March In India the matter was originally governed by the provisions of Chapter VII of the Indian Contract Act Our attention has been drawn to of the Indian Sale of Goods Act which clearly makes a distinction between a sale and an agreement for sale It is pointed out that that section groups sales and agreements to sell under the single generic name of contract of sale following in this respect the scheme of English Sale of Goods Act and that it treats sales and agreements to sell as two separate categories the vital point of distinction between them being that whereas in a sale there is a transfer of property in goods from the seller to the buyer there is none in an agreement to sell <NAME> that there having thus existed at the time of the enactment of the Government of India Act a well defined and well established distinction between a sale and an agreement to sell it would be proper to interpret the expression sale of goods in Entry in the sense in which it was used in legislation both in England and in India and to hold that it authorised an imposition of a tax only when there was a completed sale involving the transfer of title in the goods sold The argument is that <ORG> could only make a law imposing a tax on the sale of goods that is to say on a concluded sale involving the transfer of property in the goods sold from the seller to the buyer as contemplated by the Sale of Goods Act It will be noticed that imposed on the dealer the liability to pay a tax on sale as defined in No tax liability actually accrued until there was a concluded sale in the sense of transfer of title It was only when the property passed and the sale took place that the liability for paying sales tax under the Act arose There was no enlargement of the meaning of sale but the proviso only raised a fiction on the strength of the facts mentioned therein and deemed the sale to have taken place in Bihar It is urged that according to this clause tax was not imposed on all sales of goods produced or manufactured in Bihar but was imposed only on those goods produced or manufactured in Bihar which were sold by the producer or manufacturer It is pointed out as and by way of an illustration that if the goods produced or manufactured in Bihar were taken out of the Province of Bihar and then gifted away by the producer or manufacturer to a person outside Bihar and that person sold the goods he would not be liable under the proviso This argument however overlooks the fact that under cl ii the producer or manufacturer became liable to pay the tax not because he produced or manufactured the goods but because he sold the goods In other words the tax was laid on the producer or manufacturer only qua seller and not qua manufacturer or producer as pointed out in <NAME> If the goods produced or manufactured in Bihar were destroyed by fire before sale the manufacturer or producer would not have been liable to pay any tax under read with second proviso As <NAME> said in <NAME> <NAME> Case at page the manufacturer or producer would be liable if at all to a sales tax because he sells and not because he manufactures or produces and he would be free from liability if he chose to give away everything which came from his factory The conclusions reached by <ORG> in <ORG> case are formulated thus at page If some connection exists the legislature is not compelled to measure the taxation by the degree of benefit received in particular cases by the taxpayer firm which carried on business in British India but that connection was held to be sufficient nexus to bring to British Indian tax not only the income profits or gains made by the assessee as a partner in the firm but also its income profits or gains which accrued without British India in the previous year In <NAME> case also an income tax case it was held that a law imposing a tax cannot be impugned on the ground that it is extra territorial if there is a connection between a person who is subjected to a tax and the country which imposes that tax At page Chief Justice <NAME> observed Generally States can legislate effectively only for their own territories but for purposes of taxation and similar matters a State makes laws designed to operate beyond its territorial limits Whereas in the case of income tax legislation the tax is levied either on a person who is within the territory by exercising jurisdiction over him in personam or upon income which has accrued or arisen to him or is deemed to have or arisen to him or has been derived by him from sources within the territory and it is therefore germane to enquire whether any part of such income has accrued or arisen or has been derived from a source within the territory in the case of sales tax legislation it is the sale or purchase of goods which is the subject matter of taxation and it cannot be predicated that the sale or purchase takes place at one or more places where the necessary ingredients of sale happen to be located That explanation created a fiction locating the situs of a sale or purchase in the <ORG> in which the goods had actually been delivered as a result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that <NAME> <ORG> notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods had by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another <ORG> At page this <ORG> said The doctrine of territorial nexus is well established and there is no dispute as to the principles As enunciated by learned counsel for the petitioners if there is a territorial nexus between the person sought to be charged and the <ORG> seeking to tax him the Applying these principles to the facts of that case this Court came to the conclusion that they constituted sufficient territorial nexus which entitled the <ORG> of Bombay to impose a tax on the gambling that took place within its boundaries and that the law could not be struck down on the ground of extra territoriality It will be enough for disposing of the point now under consideration to say that this Court has found no apparent reason to confine its application to income tax legislation but has extended it to sales tax and to tax on gambling and that we see no cogent reason why the nexus theory should not be applied to sales tax legislation This argument overlooks the fact that the provisions of the sales tax legislation we are considering limit its charging section to sale In order to attract the charging section there must be a completed sale involving the transfer of property in the goods sold from the seller to the buyer It only indicates the circumstance in which a tax imposed by an act of the Legislature may be enforced in a particular case and unless eventually there is a concluded sale in the sense of passing of the property in the goods no tax liability attaches under the Act There is no force in this argument for Art In our opinion the arguments advanced by the learned Attorney General on this point cannot be accepted He relies on the observations of Chief Justice <NAME> in <NAME> case at page namely that a sale bad no necessary connection with manufacture or production That observation was made by the learned Chief Justice in order to emphasise the fact that the tax levied on the first sale by the manufacturer or producer was a tax imposed on him qua seller and not qua manufacturer or producer In our view the presence of the goods it the date of the agreement for sale in the taxing State or the production or manufacture in that State of goods the property wherein eventually passed as a result of the sale wherever that might have taken place constituted a sufficient nexus between the taxing State and the sale In the second case the goods wherein the title passes eventually outside the State are produced or manufactured in Bihar and the sale wherever that takes place is by the same person who produced or manufactured the same in Bihar The producer or manufacturer gets his sale price in respect of goods which were in Bihar at the date when the important event of agreement for sale was made or which were produced or manufactured in Bihar If the facts in <ORG> case were sufficient nexus there is no reason why the facts mentioned in the proviso should not also be sufficient This is further made clear by the fact that the registered dealer need not if he so pleases or chooses collect the tax from the purchaser and sometimes by reason of competition with other registered dealers he may find it profitable to sell his goods and to retain his old customers even at the sacrifice of the sales tax If that be the true view of sales tax then <ORG> acting within its own legislative field had the powers of a sovereign legislature and could make its law prospectively as well as retrospectively We do not think that there is any substance in this contention either The result therefore is that these appeals must be dismissed with costs It has no power to tax extra territorially therefore it can only tax sales that occur in the <ORG> itself Therefore unless the sale itself takes place in the <ORG> the <ORG> cannot tax One writ runs throughout the land and it has but one meaning and one voice When I say that you may only legislate for your own territory and that you may tax certain sales you must realise that the meaning that I give to I sale is the meaning that <ORG> shall give to it and that it cannot mean differing things in different areas and you must realise that the only sales that you may tax are the ones that lie in your own territory There is a nexus of sorts in both cases but the fallacy lies in You cannot tax that sale just because the vendor lives in Madras even if the motor car is brought there and even assuming there is no bar on international sales for the simple reason that what you are entitled to tax is the sale and neither the owner nor the car therefore unless the sale is situate in your territory there is no real nexus All I will do therefore is to say that the question of nexus has been referred to in the following cases and that none of them reaches a decision on this particular point I would allow the appeals In view of the opinion of the majority the appeals are dismissed with costs
