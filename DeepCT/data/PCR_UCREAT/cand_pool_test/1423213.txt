This is a reference under Section of the Indian income Tax Act which is in these terms If in the course of any assessment under this Act or any proceeding in connection therewith other than a proceeding under Chapter VII a question has arisen with reference to the interpretation of any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule there under <ORG> may either on its own motion or on reference from any Revenue Officer subordinate to it draw up a statement of the case and refer it with its own opinion thereon to <ORG> and shall so refer any such question on the application of the assesses unless it is satisfied that the application is frivolous or that a reference is unnecessary If <ORG> is not satisfied that the statements contained in the case are sufficient to enable it to determine the questions raised thereby the <ORG> may refer the case back to <ORG> by which it was stated to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the <ORG> may direction that behalf <ORG> upon the hearing of any such case shall decide the questions raised thereby and shall deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such decision is bounded and shall send to <ORG> by which the case was stated a copy of such judgment under the seal of the <ORG> and the signature of the Registrar and <ORG> shall dispose of the case accordingly or if the case arose on reference from any Revenue Officer subordinate to it shall forward a copy of such judgment to such officer who shall dispose of the case conformably to such judgment Where a reference is made to <ORG> on the application of an assessee costs shall be in the discretion of the Court The provisions of the Indian income Tax Act material for the determination of the question referred are contained in Section Sub section and Section Section gives a definition of the expression agricultural income The portion of the definition material for the determination of the question before us may be stated as follows In this Act unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context agricultural income means any income derived from The counter statement on behalf of the <ORG> is expressed in the following terms It is contended on behalf of <ORG> that the manufacturing processes carried out in a modern tea factory with scientific appliances and up to date machinery are different from those ordinarily employed by a cultivator to render the produce raised by him fit to be taken to market It is submitted on behalf of <ORG> that this process is different from the method described above by which the Chinese cultivator prepared his tea for market and which was the original method of tea making in India The present day method is a process of manufacture and not merely a process ordinarily employed by a cultivator to render the produce raised by him fit to be taken to market It appears to us to be clear from the respective cases just set out that the process in its entirety cannot be appropriately described as agriculture The earlier part of the operation when the tea bush is planted and the young green leaf is selected and plucked may well be deemed to be agriculture That clause in our opinion cannot be applied to the case before us The green leaf is not a marketable commodity for immediate use as an article of food but it is a marketable commodity to be manufactured by people who possess the requisite machinery into tea fit for human consumption We must further observe in view of the expression used in the definition that the manufacturing process cannot properly be said to be employed to render the tea leaves fit to be taken into the market In the case of <ORG> <NAME> the respondents who were <ORG> carrying on business as manufacturing chemists and growers of medicinal and other herbs owned a factory where the manufacture and distillation of herbs were carried on and they also occupied a farm on which they grow herbs for treatment in the factory that there was no reason why a corporation any less than an individual should not be engaged in more than one trade or business at the same time The <ORG> had obviously this class of cases in view as is clear from the provincials of Section Sub section which embodies the following rule Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power that is power to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act and for the ascertainment and determination of any class of income such rules may when income is derived in part from agriculture and in part from business prescribe the manner whether with reference to a class or in particular cases by which the taxable income shall be arrived at Great stress has naturally been laid by Sir <NAME> who appeared on behalf of the Company on the important fast that no attempt was ever made to assess the Company to income tax under the corresponding provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act which have been so far as the present question is concerned reproduced with no substantial variation in the Indian Income Tax Act This is no doubt a circumstance to be taken into consideration for an interpretation which has long been acted on will not be disregarded be <ORG> <ORG> Mayor etc I do not suggest for a moment that such interpretation has by any means a controlling effect upon the <ORG> such interpretation may if occasion arises have to be disregarded for cogent and persuasive reasons and is a clear case of error a <ORG> would without hesitation refuse to follow such construction Now there is no room for controversy that the <ORG> seeking to recover the tax must bring the subject within the letter of the law otherwise the subject is free however much within the spirit of the law the case might appear to be As the contentions of both sides have succeeded only in part we make no order as to costs of this reference under Section Sub section Lot a copy of this judgment be transmitted to <ORG> under Section Sub section
