But there was no corresponding amendment in the definition of of the Taxation Act It was contended in this Court that under the definition of motor vehicle as it existed prior to amendment or subsequent thereto dumpers rockers and tractors were not motor vehicles because they were not adapted to use on the road and the definition of motor vehicle in of the Taxation Act is not a definition by incorporation but only a definition by reference and as such the meaning of motor vehicle for the purpose of of the Taxation Act would be the same as defined from time to time under ss to of the Motor Vehicles Act A motor vehicle which is not adapted for use upon roads to which public have no right of access is not a motor vehicle within the meaning of of the Act The meaning of the word adopted in of the Act is itself indicated in entry of List If of the th Schedule to the Constitution which confers powers on the <ORG> to tax vehicles whether propelled mechanically or not and uses the words suitable in relation to its use on the roads In the instant case there is evidence to show that the dumpers rockers and tractairs are exclusively used on the premises of the owners There is evidence to show that the public are not allowed to go inside without prior permission there are gates and a check on ingress and egress is kept by guards who also ensure that no unauthorised persons have access to the mining area The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals raise a common question as to whether Dumpers Rockers and Tractors are motor vehicles within the meaning of the relevant State Motor Vehicles Taxation Act and are accordingly taxable thereunder Apart from these appeals <ORG> Appellant in Civil Appeal No of has filed a writ petition challenging the constitutional validity of the Bihar and Orissa Motor Vehicles Taxation Act The question raised in the writ petition will only arise for determination if the judgment of <ORG> is held to be valid otherwise the question of the constitutional validity of the Bihar and Orissa Motor Vehicles Taxation Act hereinafter referred to as the Taxation Act does not fall for determination as that would be purely academic The two Civil Appeals Nos of and of arise out of two suits One filed by <ORG> and the other by <ORG> respectively for a declaration that the machineries in their possession which were described in the respective Schedules to the plaints were not liable for registration under of the Indian Motor Vehicles Act hereinafter referred to as the Act and cannot therefore be taxed under of the Taxation Act It held that these three types as well as the Motor Grader in item already held by <ORG> not to be a motor vehicle were not liable for registration under of the Act nor would they be subject to payment of tax under the Taxation Act The reasons for bringing such vehicles and the tractors within the purview of of the Act were discussed at some length and accordingly it was held in both the suits that the vehicle indicated in the respective suit were liable for registration under of the Act and for payment of the requisite tax under the Taxation Act The appellants in this appeal filed a petition under Art It was in this context that <ORG> laid down that if a Motor Vehicle is used as a transport vehicle the owner who so uses it or permits it to be so used is required to obtain the necessary permit Section of the Act was however amended by Act of but there was no corresponding amendment in the definition of of the Taxation Act It is therefore contended that the amended definition is inapplicable Lo the Taxation Act but it is only the definition of a motor vehicle as it existed under the Act prior to the amendment that has to be read in of the Taxation Act inasmuch as the purpose and intendment of the <ORG> was only to incorporate the definition as it existed at the time when the Taxation Act was amended in Before we deal with this question it is necessary to note the preliminary objection raised by the learned Advocate for the State of Orissa that the appellants should not be permitted to raise this question as it was not pleaded or urged either before <ORG> or before <ORG> nor is there any evidence to determine the question whether the vehicles on which the levy of the impugned tax is held to be valid are used solely upon the premises of the owners It is submitted that the contention is contrary to what is stated in the plaint and that it is also not covered by any of the issues under which the question as to whether the premises in which the plaintiffs operate are the exclusive premises of the plaintiffs nor is there any evidence as to whether the area where the vehicles operate is the exclusive area of the plaintiffs It is categori cally stated in para that the various types of machines enumerated in para of the plaint being mechanically propelled vehicles come within the definition of motor vehicles as contained in section of the Act since they do not come under the exceptions provided therein But after the amendment though a motor vehicle may be adapted for use upon roads nonetheless in order to be taken out of the category of the definition it had to be further adapted namely it should be a vehicle of a special type adapted for use only in a factory or in any other enclosed premises We have seen the Mysore Motor Vehicles Taxation Act which though does not define motor vehicle as such nonetheless under states that words and expressions used but not defined in the Act shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Motor Vehicles Act In the Andhra Pradesh Andhra Area Motor Vehicles Taxation Act i states that the expressions mentioned in clauses a to of which clause refers to motor vehicle shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Motor Vehicles Act The Bombay Motor Vehicles Tax Act follows the same pattern as the Mysore Act and though it does not define a motor vehicle yet by it provides that other words and expressions used but not defined in the Act shall have the meanings respectively assigned to them in the Motor Vehicles Act The Bengal Motor Vehicles Tax Act also is similar as that of the Bombay Act inasmuch as thereof states that words and expressions used but not defined in the Act shall have the same meaning as in the Motor Vehicles Act CI concerned as to Whether dumpers rockers and tractors are motor vehicles at all within the meaning of the first part of the definition of motor vehicle in of the Act which is the same before and after the amendment it is contended that these vehicles are not suitably adapted for use upon roads which according to the learned Advocates mean the public roads or roads to which the public has a right of access The Motor Vehicles Taxation Act are enacted in exercise of the powers conferred on the State <ORG> under entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution while the Motor Vehicles Act is enacted by the <ORG> in exercise of the concurrent legislative power in entry of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution It has no power to deal with vehicles which are not mechanically propelled though under the Taxation Act these non mechanically propelled vehicles which are suitable for use on roads can also be taxed even without their being registered under the Act whether the vehicles in question are adapted for use upon roads which it is submitted are public roads or roads to which public have a right of access The judgment of <ORG> is assailed on the ground that while formulating the test to determine whether a vehicle is adapted for use on the roads it has evidently equated compatibility with suitability because at certain places it has laid down the test in terms of compatibility and at other places in terms of suitability In the instant case it is said that the tractor cannot ply in a public place nor does it ply in any other place for carrying passengers or goods He has also referred to the English cases on this question and submitted that no vehicle cam be taxed unless it possesses the attribute of being suitable for use on roads He has referred us to ss and and of the Act in support of his proposition that having regard to the general object purpose and the policy underlying the Act the expression roads must mean public roads and not private roads We have been referred to certain English decisions which deal with the meaning of the word adapted in the English Road Traffic Act In <NAME> and others <NAME> <ORG> took the view that as there was no evidence sufficient to show that the dumpers were intended or adapted for use on roads within the meaning of of the Road and Rail Traffic Act The ratio of that decision was applied to the <NAME> case where <NAME> observed at In my judgment the true effect of <ORG> decision was that the very limited use of the dumpers on the road in that case did not establish that they were intended or adapted for use on the road within the meaning of those words in the Road traffic Act Lord <NAME> though agreeing reserved his opinion by emphasising that it must not be taken as the result of this decision that dumpers of the type used in this case were not motor vehicles intended or adapted for use on the road He indicated that he had agreed with <NAME> merely because there was no proof in that case that the dumpers used were motor vehicles constructed must mean a physical alteration and as it seems to me other cases where the word adapted alone is used and where it must be given the adjectival meaning of be fit and apt for the purpose In <NAME> Currell also Lord <NAME> delivered the judgment He referred to the decision in <NAME> <NAME> supra observed at thus But to define exactly the meaning of the words intended or adapted is by no means easy <NAME> pointed out that it may be merely a difference of wording but he preferred to make the test whether a reasonable person looking at the vehicle would say that one of its users would be a road user and then he dealt with the meaning of the word adapted and observed at So far as the other word adapted is concerned as was pointed out in <NAME> <NAME> the word adapted is used throughout the Road Traffic Act in a number of different contexts Sometimes It is used as an alternative to constructed constructed or adapted and it seems clear and indeed it has been so held for a very long time that adapted there means altered It appears to us that where two words of different import are used which in the context of the scheme of the Act and its purpose play an important part to ask us to take the meaning given of one of the words and import it as the meaning for the purposes of the Act even when the same word is used is perhaps to place us in a similar predicament as that of the gentleman who when asked to expound on Chinese metaphysics not knowing how to begin looked up the article on China in <ORG> and also on metaphysics and combined the two into Chinese metaphysics As usual references have been made to the Dictionaries but quite often it is not possible to hold a dictionary in one hand and the statute to be interpreted in the other for ascertaining the import and intent of the word or expression used by the <ORG> The meaning of the word adapted in of the Act is itself indicated in entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which confers a power on the <ORG> to tax vehicles whether propelled mechanically or not and uses the word suitable in relation to its use on the roads It is contended that the dumpers or rockers are very heavy and though they can move on roads they would damage the roads and therefore they are not suitable for use on roads It is also averred in the plaint in the suit filed by the appellant <ORG> that Euclid Dumpers are used for transporting ore from the mining faces to the crushing and screening plant or from head mine stockpile to near railway siding In so far as the Act is concerned we must bear in mind that it is essentially an Act to regulate transport The statement of objects and reasons given for the Act in so far as it is relevant for our purpose states thus It has been recognised now for some years past that the Indian Motor Vehicles Act which was framed to suit conditions at an early stage of development of motor transport is no longer adequate to deal with conditions brought about by the rapid growth of motor transport in the past two decades For instance of the Act provides No person shall drive any motor vehicle and no owner of a motor vehicle shall cause or permit the vehicle to be driven in any public place or in any other place for the purpose of carrying passengers or goods unless the vehicle is registered Similarly under of the Act No person shall drive a motor vehicle in any public place unless he holds an effective driving licence issued to himself authorizing him to drive the vehicle and no person shall be drive a motor vehicle as a paid employee or shall so drive a transport vehicle unless his driving licence specifically entitles him so to do The word public place has been defined in as meaning a road street way or other place whether a thoroughfare or not to which the public have a right of access If the public have no right of access to any place which is not a road street way or thoroughfare it will not be a public place A motor vehicle which is not adapted for use upon roads to which the public have no right of access is not a motor vehicle within the meaning of of the Act But where a vehicle is adapted for use on a road which is neither more nor less than that it is made suitable or fit for use upon road i public roads it is a motor vehicle and if such a motor vehicle is a goods vehicle under which means a vehicle which is not only suitable or fit for use upon roads but is constructed or adapted for use for the carriage of goods or where it is not so constructed or adapted when used for the carriage of goods solely or in addition to passengers car is a public service vehicle within the meaning of of the Act namely an motor vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward it has to be registered under and can only be driven by a person who holds a licence under of the Act The tractair though it may be a motor vehicle within the definition of that term is neither a goods vehicle nor a vehicle which carries passengers nor is it being driven in a place to which public have as a right access As it does not perform any of the aforesaid functions or uses it is not a vehicle which has to be registered nor has it to be driven only by a person who holds a licence In ascertaining the intention of the <ORG> in adopting the method of merely referring to the definition of motor vehicle under the Act for the purpose of the Taxation Act we have to keep in mind its purpose and intendment as also that of the Motor Vehicles Act The Taxation Act is a regulatory measure imposing compensatory taxes for the purpose of raising revenue to meet the expenditure for making roads maintaining them and for facilitating the movement and regulation of traffic there is a rule of construction that where a statute is incorporated by reference into a second statute the repeal of the first statute by a third statute does not affect the second In Secretary of <ORG> for India in <ORG> <ORG> the Privy <ORG> was considering a case where the incorporation effected in the statute viz The Local Act in dealing with the acquisition of land for the purposes designated by it made provision for the acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act and the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act were subjected to numerous modifications which were It was in the context of these and several other provisions which pointed to the absorption of certain of the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act into the Local Act with vital modifications that Privy <ORG> observed at But their Lordships think that there are other and perhaps more cogent objections to this contention of the Secretary of <ORG> and their Lordships are not prepared to hold that the sub section in question which was not enacted till can be regarded as incorporated in the Local Act of Nor again does Act XIX of contain any provision that the amendments enacted by it are to be treated as in any way retrospective or are to be regarded as affecting any other enactment than the Land Acquisition Act itself <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed at As a matter of construction it must be held that all works machinery tramways and sidings whether above or below ground in nor adjacent to a coal mine will come within the scope and ambit of the definition only when they belong to the coal mine It is however contended by the learned Solicitor General that both in <NAME> case supra as well as <ORG> case this Court was considering the effects of the two Acts which were made by <ORG> by central legislation and it is therefore not strictly a case of incorporation because <ORG> is deemed to have while making the latter enactment kept in view the provisions of the former Act But we do not think that there is any justification for this submission Section of the General Clauses Act specifically refers to that Act or any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of the General Clauses Act and states that if these Acts repeal any enactment hitherto made or hereafter to be made then unless a different intention appears the repeal shall not affect the matters specified in clauses a to of that section That Act has to be interpreted in the light of the Orissa General Clauses Act and since there is no question of any amendment or any repeal of any of the Orissa Acts affecting the Taxation Act of the Orissa General Clauses Act has also no relevance On this aspect there can be no doubt because there is evidence to show that dumpers rockers and tractaires tractors with air compressed attachment are exclusively used on the premises of the owners In Civil Appeal No of Assistant Superintendent of Mines <ORG> stated that there is no public road within their leasehold premises The members of the public have no right to enter into it Similarly in Civil Appeal No of in the case of <ORG> it has been stated in the reply affidavit in paragraph that a trench is dug alround the mining area so as to prevent free ingress and egress to the mining area In reply to paragraph it has been stated by the respondent that the allegations of the deponent in paragraph of his affidavit except the allegation that the mining area is a well defined and enclosed area are substantially correct There is evidence to show that the public arc not allowed to go inside without prior permission there are gates and a check on ingress and egress is kept by guards who also ensure that no unauthorised persons have access to the mining area all of which indicate that the respective mining areas are enclosed premises within the meaning of the exceptions under of the Taxation Act In the result Civil Appeal is dismissed with cost and other appeal are partly allowed and it is held that dumpers and rockers though registrable under the Act are not taxable under the Taxation Act as long as they are working solely within the premises of the respective owners The appellants will get proportionate costs
