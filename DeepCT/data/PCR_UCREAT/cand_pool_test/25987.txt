The question raised on the appeal is as to the competency of the <ORG> to try the appellants for those offences The facts may be stated as follows At the end of March and during the first days of April there was serious unrest in certain parts of the province of the Punjab and this unrest culminated on the th April in the outbreak of open rebellion at Amritsar in that province and elsewhere and the offences of which the appellants have been found guilty were committed at Amritsar on that date There was no reason why those institutions should have been singled out by the mob or their leaders except that us the evidence shows they were out to destroy the visible manifestations of British connection with the country It was proved that the appellants with the possible exception of <NAME> wove members of the mob and took an active part in the attack on <ORG> and there was evidence that some of them took part in the actual murder of the manager and assistant manager It was provided that at least two members of every such <ORG> should be persons who had served as Sessions Judges or had such other legal qualification as therein mentioned It was also provided that a <ORG> should have the powers of a general Court Martial under the Indian Army Act and should follow so far as might be the procedure prescribed by that Act but power was reserved to <ORG> to direct that the <ORG> should follow the procedure of a summary general Court Martial Whereas an emergency has arisen which renders it necessary to provide that commissions appointed under the Martial Law Ordinance shall have power to try person and offences other than those specified in the said Ordinance Now therefore in exercise of the power conferred by Section of the Government of India Act the Governor General is pleased to make and promulgate the following Ordinance Ordinance No IV of Notwithstanding anything contained in the Martial Law Ordinance <ORG> may by general or special order direct that any commission appointed under the said Ordinance shall try any person charged with any offence committed on or after the th March and thereupon the provisions of the said Ordinance shall apply to such trials accordingly and a commission may pass in respect of any such offence any sentence authorised by law Before the hearing of the appeal it was suggested by counsel for the appellants that Ordinance No IV of was capable of being construed as intended only to extend the operation of Ordinance No I to offences committed before the th April but not earlier than the th March and accordingly that this Ordinance like Ordinance No I applied only to persons taken in the act of committing one of the offences specified in Regulation of It is introduced by a recital that an emergency has arisen which renders it necessary to provide that <ORG> appointed under the earlier Ordinance shall have power to try persons and offences other than those specified in that Ordinance and it empowers a <ORG> to try any person charged with any offence committed after the specified date and to pass in respect of such offence any sentence authorised by law It was contended that the Ordinance under consideration by Cepriving British subjects in India of the right to be tried in the ordinary course by the established Courts of Law affected the unwritten laws or constitution whereon the allegiance of His Majesty subjects in India depends and was accordingly invalidated by the sub section last referred to and reference was made to <NAME> case Rep It refers only to laws which directly affect the allegiance of the subject to the <ORG> as by a transfer or qualification of the allegiance or a modification of the obligations thereby imposed The answer to this contention is to be found in Section of the Government of India Amendment Act which provides that there shall be inserted at the end of Section of the Act of the following words A law made by any authority in British India and repugnant to any provision of this or any other Act of <ORG> shall to the extent of that repugnancy but not otherwise be void It appears to their Lordships that if the Ordinance in question in this cast contravenes Section of the Act of it may properly be described as repugnant to that section so far as British born subjects are concerned and if so it is void to the extent of that repugnancy but not otherwise For the above reasons their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that this appeal fails and should be dismissed
