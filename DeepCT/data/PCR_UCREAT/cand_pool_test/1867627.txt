At her request <ORG> extraordinary leave was granted to her by <ORG> with effect from for a period of two years by the Order made on Sometime in the st Respondent filed a Writ Petition bearing No CWP No of before <ORG> challenging the selection and appointment of Petitioner herein as Professor of Haematology in <ORG> The main Prayer of the st Respondent before <ORG> in CWP No of is to issue a writ of mandamus directing the respondents to permit the petitioner to rejoin her duties immediately Therefore she submitted that she was not given an opportunity to explain or defend herself and consequently there is violation of the principles of natural justice In this context quashing the Order of discharge this Court held that A removal is removal and if it is punishment for overstaying one leave an opportunity must be given to the person against whom such an order is proposed no matter how the Regulation describes it It was imperatively necessary to give the servant an opportunity to show cause against the proposed action This is a case in which a Civil servant was removed from service and this Court ruled that since an opportunity of hearing was not given before passing the Order the same was held to be violative of Article Relying on the ratio in the aforementioned decisions <ORG> allowed the Petition filed by the st Respondent herein by observing that the request of the petitioner for joining duty ought not to have been declined without giving her an opportunity of hearing to put forward her case and without an opportunity to the petitioner for showing cause as to why the provisions of Regulation ought not to have been applied to her case Only persons who are holding civil posts can claim the protection provided under Article Here it was held that There is no formal definition of post and civil post A person holding a post under a <ORG> is a person serving or employed under the <ORG> There is a relationship of master and servant between the <ORG> and a person holding a post under it There is also no master and servant relationship between the <ORG> and an employee of <ORG> which is a separate legal entity in itself Therefore the employees of <ORG> cannot avail the protection of Article since the same can be claimed only by the members of a civil service of the <ORG> or of <ORG> or of a civil service of a <ORG> or by persons who hold a civil post under the <ORG> or a <ORG> Here this Court allowing the appeal in favor of the appellant bank and holds that This undue reliance on the principles of natural justice by the <ORG> and even by <ORG> has certainly led to a miscarriage of justice as far as the bank is concerned Now the only question that remains for consideration is the correctness of <ORG> stand that the st Respondent deemed to have permanently left the institute due to her non joining after the expiry of granted leave period Rejecting his request the <ORG> informed him that in case of overstay he would be deemed to have vacated his post and cease to be in <ORG> service We have noticed that when the extension is sought for three years the <ORG> has given extension only for one year as he had already availed years extraordinary leave by that time On the above facts the absence of a notice to show cause does not make any difference for the employee has been told that if his further overstay is for continuing in the job in Libya it is bound to be refused Emphasis supplied Recently in another case of a very similar nature Dr <NAME> PGIMER JT SC this Court held A person who gets an advantage namely of a sanction to go abroad on service on the condition that he will come back within two years and if does not come back his lien will automatically be regarded as being terminated he cannot turn around and challenge the said condition on the basis of which sanction to go abroad was granted but where the facts are not in dispute the inquiry would be an empty formality In any case principle of estoppel would clearly apply and <ORG> was right in dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant wherein he had challenged his termination In the face of law such a stay ought not to have been granted by <ORG> since the prayer in that <ORG> cannot have any bearing upon the <ORG> leave obtained by or on its subsequent extensions or on the out come of disciplinary action
