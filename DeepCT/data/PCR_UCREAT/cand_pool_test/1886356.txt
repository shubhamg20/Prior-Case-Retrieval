Subsequently on July <ORG> allowed the appeal and held that interest on arrears of rent payable in respect of agricultural land was not agricultural income as it was neither rent nor revenue derived from land As a result of this decision the Income tax Officer took proceedings under Of the Indian Income tax Act as amended and revised the assessment order by adding the aforesaid amount on the footing that the subsequent decision of <ORG> was information within the meaning of of the Act and that the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that a part Of the assessee income had escaped assessment It was contended for the appellant that was not applicable to the case because the information referred to in the section means information as to facts and cannot include the decision of <ORG> on a point of law and where income has been duly returned for assessment and an assessment order has been passed by the Income tax Officer it cannot be said that any income has escaped assessment within The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal with the certificate issued by <ORG> at Patna under A of the Income tax Act hereinafter called the Act and it raises a short question of the construction of of the Act This question arises in this way Against this order the assessee preferred an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income tax Patna On May the appellate authority held that <ORG> was bound to follow the decision in the case of <NAME> supra and so he set aside the order under appeal in regard to the amount of Rs Subsequently on July the appeal preferred by the department to <ORG> against the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case was allowed and it was held that interest on arrears of rent payable in respect of agricultural land is not agricultural income for it is neither rent nor revenue derived from land As a result of this decision the Income tax Officer issued a notice to the assessee under of the Act on September This notice called upon the assessee to file a fresh return as the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that a part of the assessee income assessable to income tax for the year ending March had escaped assessment It appears that this notice was found to be defective and so under the provisions of as amended a fresh notice was issued by the officer to the assessee on March a and of and that the Income tax Officer bad reason to believe that a part of the assessee income had escaped assessment the tribunal confirmed the order passed by the appellate authority and dismissed the assessee appeal It was held that the provisions of a as amended in applied to the case and that the decision of <ORG> brought it within the purview of sub of He then filed an application under of the Act requiring the tribunal to refer the question of law raised in the case to <ORG> for its opinion In compliance with the requisition of <ORG> the tribunal by its order passed on July submitted a statement of the case and referred to <ORG> for its opinion the question of law raised by the appellant The question thus raised is Whether in the circumstances of the case the assessment order under of the Act of the interest on arrears of rent is legal On April this reference was heard by <NAME> and <NAME> of <ORG> and the question was answered by them in favour of the department It is conceded by Mr <NAME> for the appellant that the present case is governed by the section as it was amended in Clause a covers cases where income has escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to make a return of his income under Clause of provides inter alia that notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in cl a on the part of the assessee if the Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment for any year or have been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made the subject of excessive relief under the Act or that excessive loss or depreciation allowance have been computed he may at any time within four years of the end of that year serve on the assessee a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub of and may proceed to assess or reassess such income profits or gains or recompute the loss or depreciation allowance and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section He must have information in his possession which in the context means that the relevant information must have come into his possession subsequent to the making of the assessment order in question and this information must lead to his belief that income chargeable to income tax has escaped assessment for any year or that it has been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or has been made the subject of excessive relief under the Act He contends that the relevant information means information as to facts and cannot include the decision of <ORG> on a point of law and he argues that where income has been duly returned for assessment and an assessment order has been passed by the Income tax Officer it cannot be said that any income has escaped assessment within Thus the appellant case is that both the conditions required by have not been satisfied and so the order of revised assessment passed against the appellant is illegal It is then contended that ss and confer ample powers on the specified authorities to revise Income tax Officer orders and to rectify mistakes respectively and so it would be legitimate to construe the word information in strictly and to confine it to information in regard to facts or particulars Besides the application of these two sections is subject to the limi tations prescribed by them and so the fact that the said sections confer powers for revision or rectification would not be relevant and material in construing It is true that under the explanation production before the Income tax Officer of account books or other evidence from which material facts could with due diligence have been discovered by the Income tax Officer would not necessarily amount to disclosures within the meaning of the said section but we do not see how this can have any bearing oil the construction of cl in On the other hand one of the cases specifically mentioned in necessarily postulates that the word information must have reference to information as to law Where in consequence of information in his possession the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that income has been assessed at too low a rate he is empowered to revise the assessment and there can be no doubt that the belief of the Income tax Officer that any given income has been assessed at too low a rate may in many cases be due to information about the true legal position in the matter of the relevant rates If the word information in reference to this class of cases must necessarily include information as to law it is impossible to accept the argument that in regard to the other cases falling under the same provision the same word should have a narrower and a more limited meaning When can income be said to have escaped assessment Mr <NAME> argued that the word assessment does not mean only the order of assessment but it includes all steps taken for the purpose of levying the tax and during the process of taxation That no doubt is true but the wide denotation of the word assessment does not really assist the appellant it only shows that along with the order of assessment which is an important act in the process of taxation other acts and steps adopted in the course of taxation are also included in the word but it is with this most critical act in the process of taxation with which we are concerned in the present appeal to elude the notice of a person and the contention is that it is only where income has not been returned for assessment that it can be reasonably said that income has escaped assessment Even if the assessee has submitted a return of his income cases may well occur where the whole of the income has not been assessed and such part of the income as has not been assessed can well be regarded as having escaped assessment In the present case interest on arrears of rent received by the assessee from his agricultural lands were brought to the notice of the Income tax Officer the question as to whether the said amount can be assessed in law was considered and it was ultimately held that the relevant decision of <ORG> which was binding on the department justified the assessee claim that the said income was not liable to be assessed to tax There is no doubt that a part of the assessee income had not been assessed and in that sense it has clearly escaped assessment Can it be said that because the matter was considered and decided on the merits in the light of the binding authority of the decision of <ORG> no income has escaped assessment when the said <ORG> decision has been subsequently reversed by <ORG> We see no justification for holding that cases of income escaping assessment must always be cases where income has not been assessed owing to inadvertence or oversight or owing to the fact that no return has been submitted In our opinion even in a case where a return has been submitted if the Income tax Officer erroneously fails to tax a part of assessable income it is a case where the said part of the income has escaped assessment He relies more particularly on the observation made in the judgment in this case that the fact that requires a notice to be served calling for a return of income which has escaped assessment strongly suggests that income which has already been duly returned for assessment cannot be said to have escaped assessment within the statutory meaning In April the Income tax Officer of District I issued a notice to <ORG> under calling for a return of their total income for the year ending March with a view to assessing them for the year In consequence of this decision the assessment made on <ORG> was amended by the elimination therefrom of the income returned by <ORG> and in November an assessment was made on <ORG> on their income as returned by them in Janu ary It was in this connection that their Lordships approved of the observation made by <NAME> in Re <NAME> that I income has not escaped assessment if there are pending at the time proceedings for the assessment of the assessee income which have not yet terminated in a final assessment thereof In other words the conclusion of <ORG> was that so long as assessment proceedings are pending against an assessee and no final order has been passed thereon it would be premature to suggest that any income of the assessee has escaped assessment It is only after the final order levying the tax has been passed by the Income tax Officer that it would be possible to predicate that any part of the assessee income has escaped assessment In the result their Lordships held that since proceedings pursuant to the notice issued against the appellants under had been pending and no order had been passed against the appellants in the said proceedings it would not be possible to accept their argument that the Income tax Officer should have taken action against them in respect of the income for the relevant year under of the Act To say that so long as the assessment proceedings are pending it is impossible to assume that any income has escaped assessment is very much different from saying that income cannot be said to have escaped assessment wherever assessment proceedings have been taken and a final order has been passed on them While dealing with the assessees argument that the order of assessment was invalid Since it had been passed more than one year after the expiry of the relevant financial year and that the Income tax Officer might have acted under <NAME> stated that income cannot be said to have escaped assessment except in the case where an assessment has been made which does not include the income On February the Income tax Officer passed an order in pursuance of which proceedings were taken against the assessee under the provisions of and they resulted in the assessment of the assessee to income tax The contention which was raised by the assessee in his appeal to this <ORG> was that the notice issued against him under was invalid He however relies on the observations made by <NAME> that the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that the escapement from assessment is not to be equated to non assessment simpliciter is not without force and he points out that the reason given by the learned judge in support of the final decision was that though earlier assessment proceedings had been taken they had failed to result in a valid assessment owing to some lacuna other than that attributable to the assessing authorities notwithstanding the chargeability of income to the tax Mr <NAME> says that it is only in cases where income can be shown to have escaped assessment owing to some lacuna other than that attributable to the assessing authorities that can be invoked The observations on which reliance is placed by Mr <NAME> have naturally been made in reference to the facts with which the <ORG> was dealing and they must obviously be read in the context of those facts It would be unreasonable to suggest that these observations were intended to confine the application of only to cases where income escapes assessment owing to reasons other than those attributable to the assessing authorities It appears that the construction of has led to a divergence of judicial opinion in the <ORG> of this country and so it would be necessary to refer briefly to the decisions to which our attention was invited in this appeal It applied also to cases where an item of income is included in the return made by the assessee but is left unassessed by the Income tax Officer or if assessed in the first in stance the assessment is cancelled by any appellate or revisional authority <NAME> who delivered a concurring judgment was inclined to hold that the word information in the section must be confined only to information as to facts or particulars and cannot include information as to law <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the court agreed with the construction which had been put on the expression definite information by <ORG> on the ground that it is very desirable to avoid conflict on such a question They held that where a certain income has been included in his return by the assessee but was not assessed on the ground that it was not assessable it cannot be treated as income which has escaped assessment and reassessed under of the Assam Agricultural Income tax Act In his judgment the learned Chief Justice has mentioned that the earlier decisions of <ORG> were no doubt against the contentions of the appellant but he took the view that the question was really concluded by the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case supra The <ORG> decision was read by the learned Chief Justice as supporting the view that would be inapplicable to cases where income has been returned assessment proceedings have been taken and a final order of assessment has been passed by the Income tax Officer against the assessee We have already pointed out that the decision of <ORG> does not support this view occasion to decide whether it would be open to the Income tax Officer to take action under on the ground that he thinks that his original decision in making the order of assessment was wrong without any fresh information from an external source or whether the successor of the Income tax Officer can act under on the ground that the order of assessment passed by his predecessor was erroneous and divergent views have been expressed on this point Mr <NAME> for the respondent suggested that under the provisions of as amended in it would be open to the Income tax Officer to act under the said section even if he merely changed his mind without any information from an external source and came to the conclusion that in a particular case he had erroneously allowed an assessee income to escape assessment We do not propose to express any opinion on this point in the present appeal In the result we hold that <ORG> was right in coming to the conclusion that the decision of <ORG> was information within the meaning of and that the said decision justified the belief of the Income tax Officer that part of the appellant income had escaped assessment for the relevant year
