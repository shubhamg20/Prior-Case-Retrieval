The grievance of the plaintiff is that the defendant <ORG> Hathroi Fort Jaipur has recently introduced in the market washing soap under a wrapper in respect of their washing soap whose adoption and the use of the lay out colour combination and artistic representation exactly resembles that of the plaintiff and that such a user by the defendant is with the deliberate intention to deceive and cause confusion to earn profits in illegal manner knowing fully well that the plaintiff washing soap marketed under Ok wrapper has acquired a high reputation because of the excellant quality and marketting potentialities offered by the plaintiff and that their defendant quality of product is inferior Along with the suit the plaintiff has filed the present application under Order Rules I and read with section of the Code of Civil Procedure re iterating its averments made in the plaint has prayed that during the pendency of the suit the defendant its servants agents dealers representatives and workmen be restrained from manufacturing selling and or offering for sale directly or indirectly dealing in washing soap under wrapper which is a colourable imitation of the plaintiff wrapper and from giving an impression that the defendant washing soap is that of the plaintiff or is connected with the plaintiff in any manner whatsover amounting to passing off and from infringing the registered copyright pertaining to Ok washing soap wrapper belonging to the plaintiff The defendant in its written statement controverting the allegations of the plaintiff resists the suit among other on the grounds that this Court has no jurisdiction to try the suit that the suit Is not properly valued for the purposes of court fee and jurisdiction in that the value for the purpose of jurisdiction under section of the Suits Valuation Act has to be the same as the value adopted by the plaintiff for the purposes of court fee that the wrapper of the plaintiff is not distinctive as alleged or that the colour scheme adopted by the plaintiff is distinctive and or that the plaintiff has any right thereof independently of the rest of the wrapper and that the alleged offending wrapper is neither identical nor deceptively similar to that of plaintiff The defendants deny that they had represented in then wrappers the layout and or colour combination and or artistic representation of the plaintiff wrapper or that the defendant wrapper had been deliberately made and or caused to be made to appear as that of the plaintiff and or that the defendant was motivated by any intention to deceive and or cause confusion and or to earn profits in an illegal manner For the purpose of sub section a district court having jurisdiction shall notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure or any other law for the time being in force include <ORG> within the local limits of whose jurisdiction at the time of the institution of the suit or other proceeding the person instituting the suit or other proceeding or where there are more than one such person any of them actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain The question therefore is what is meant by the said expression Now under sub section of section of the Delhi High Court Act notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force <ORG> in respect of the Union Territory of Delhi has the ordinary original civil jurisdiction in every suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees as amended by section of the Delhi High Court Amendment Act It would therefore be seen that after the coming into force of Delhi High Court Act as amended <ORG> has become the principal civil Court of original jurisdiction with respect to every suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees Under section of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act the expression <ORG> has the meaning assigned to it in the Code of Civil Procedure In appeal before <ORG> the defendants contended that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain the action instituted by the plaintiffs and had no powers to make an order issuing a temporary injunction as the action as framed could properly be instituted in <ORG> Rejecting the contention it was observed that the expression <ORG> has by virtue of section of the Trade Mark and Merchandise Act the meaning assigned to that expression in the Code of Civil Procedure Section of the Code defines a District as meaning the local limits of the jurisdiction of a principal civil court called <ORG> and includes the local limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of <ORG> <ORG> having ordinary original civil jurisdiction in respect of the Union territory of Delhi in every suit the value of which exceeds fifty thousand rupees is competent to entertain and try the present suit There is no merit in this submission The plaintiff has invoked the territorial jurisdiction of this <ORG> on the allegation that it is marketing its washing soap under Ok wrapper through its office at Asaf Ali Road New Delhi where it carries on its business and works for gain besides averring that the washing soap under the infringing wrapper is available at Delhi and elsewhere and so even under Common Law this <ORG> has jurisdiction to entertain the suit Sub section of section of the Copyright Act noted above carves out an exception to the provision of section of the Code of Civil Procedure and enables a plaintiff seeking remedy for infringement of Copyright to file the suit in the <ORG> within the local limits of whose jurisdiction at the time of the institution of the suit or other proceeding the person instituting the suit or other proceeding or where there are more than one such persons any of them actually and voluntarily resides or carries on There being no traverse to the plaintiff averment that it is marketing its washing soap under the Ok wrapper through its office at Asaf Ali Road New Delhi where it carries on its business and works for gain it has to be held that this <ORG> has jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit The rival contentions of the parties at best may be said to necessitate an enquiry being made in the matter by the framing of an issue but on a prima facie view of the matter it cannot be said for the present that this <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain and try the suit in respect of the allegation regarding passing off Support for this argument was sought to be drawn from <NAME> <NAME> Klt wherein it was observed that the mere fact that the plaintiff asks an account or brings his suit on account or that accounts have to be gone into in order to determine the account if any The observations in the above noted case were made in a wholly different context The argument sought to be urged has to be repelled in view of the provisions of section of the Copyright Act which prescribes civil remedies that are available to the owner of the copyright for infringement of this copyright <ORG> at Lahore in with the previous sanction of the State Government under the powers conferred by section of the Suits Valuation Act of and all other powers in that behalf made rules regarding the manner of determining the value of suits for purposes of jurisdiction specified in section of Suits Valuation Act WHILERule reads as under I Suits in which the plaintiff in the plaint seeks to recover the amount which may be found to the plaintiff on taking unsettled accounts between him and defendant II Suits of either of the kinds described in Order Xx rule of the Code of Civil Procedure VALUEfor the purposes of jurisdiction for the purpose of the Suits Valuation Act and the Punjab Courts Act as valued by the plaintiff in the plaint subject to determination by the Court at any stage of the trial The learned counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the rules framed by <ORG> at Lahore and since followed in the said <ORG> the East Punjab <ORG> the Punjab <ORG> and the Courts in Delhi even after the constitution of the Delhi <ORG> pertain to the practice and procedure followed by the said Courts with regard to the manner and determination of the value of certain types of suits for the purposes of court fees and jurisdiction and that the said practice and procedure with the necessary modifications apply in relation to the <ORG> of Delhi by virtue of section of the Delhi <ORG> Act By virtue of sub section of section of the Delhi High Court Act notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force <ORG> has in respect of the Union Territory of Delhi ordinary original civil jurisdiction in money suit the value of which exceeds twenty five thousand rupees since raised to fifty thousand rupees by section of the Delhi High Court Amendment Act Act No of Section of the Delhi High Court Act deals with the practice and procedure to be followed in <ORG> The said section reads as under SUBJECTto the provisions of this Act the law in force immediately before the appointed day with respect to practice and procedure in <ORG> shall with the necessary modifications apply in relation to <ORG> and accordingly <ORG> shall have all such powers to make rules and orders with respect to practice and procedure as are immediately before the appointed day exercisable by <ORG> and shall also have powers to make rules and orders with respect to practice and procedure for the exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction The question accordingly is whether the rules made by <ORG> are rules pertaining to practice and procedure with regard to the manner and determination of the value of certain types of suits for the purposes of court fees and jurisdiction as was sought to be contended by the learned counsel for the plaintiff The learned counsel for the defendant contended that a matter of practice and procedure generally speaking arises in the course of am action and that practice in its larger sense denotes the mode of proceeding by which a legal right is enforced as distinguishable from the law which gives the right JOWITT Dictionary of English Law Second Edition page describes practice as the form and manner of conducting and carrying on suits actions or prosecutions at law or in equity civil or criminal through their various stages from the commencement to final judgment and execution according to principles and rules laid down by the several courts The rules framed under section of the Suits Valuation Act by <ORG> of Judicature at Lahore provide a mode for valuing the suits for the purposes of jurisdiction in suits which do not admit of being satisfactorily valued The said rules provide a mode by which a plaintiff is to proceed for the enforcement of his legal rights Therein Lush observed that practice in its larger sense denotes the mode of proceeding by which a legal right is enforced as distinguished from the law which gives or defines the right and which by means of the proceeding the <ORG> is to administer It may bear mention here that <NAME> case supra was considered in A <NAME> but therein <NAME> observed that practice means the same thing as procedure and denotes rules that make or guide cursus curise and regulate the proceedings in a case within the walls or limits of the <ORG> itself Their Lordships approving the observations of <ORG> that practice and procedure denotes rules that make or guide the cursus curise and regulate the proceedings in a case within the walls or limits of the <ORG> itself observed that these proceedings include all steps which might be taken in the prosecution or defense thereof including an application for amendment But it has to be borne in mind that the observations of their Lordships were made in a wholly different context regarding the applicability of the provisions of Order Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure to a proceeding before <ORG> It was in that context that it was observed that apart from the implication inherent in the term procedure appearing in section the power to prescribe by rules any matter falling within the ambit of the term must be the procedure to be followed in proceedings before such <ORG> The Full Bench further observed that if there are rules made by <ORG> under section of the Suits Valuation Act and the same are applicable the valuation for the purposes of court fees under section iv of the Court fees Act will have to be according to such rules The learned Single Judge on the matter being remitted to him observed that these rules were made in the year by the <ORG> at Lahore under section of the Suits Valuation Act and have since been followed in the said <ORG> and in the successor <ORG>s the East Punjab <ORG> the Punjab <ORG> and in Courts in Delhi even after the constitution of the Delhi <ORG> In support of his i submission he drew my attention to the subsequent observation of the learned Single Judge in his judgment It is no doubt true that the learned Judge in a subsequent part of his judgment has observed that in relation to the reliefs of accounts injunction and recovery of money court fee has to be paid and valorem under the appropriate sub clauses of clause iv of section of the court fees Act and that neither of the two suit under consideration could be said to belong to the category of suits which were exempt from the operation of section and that the value of the suits for purposes of jurisdiction in relation to these reliefs has to be the same as has been determined for the purposes of court fees unless there was anything in the Rules of the Lahore High Court if applicable which provide to the contrary Even on the assumption that rules made by <ORG> at Lahore under section of the Suits Valuation Act are substantive law the same remain operative in the Union Territory of Delhi as held by the Division Bench in the above said case It may be noted here that the rules as framed by <ORG> at Lahore in respect of the manner of determining the value of suits for purposes specified in section of the Suits Valuation Act It was then contended that clause of the Letters Patent of the <ORG> of Judicature at Lahore empowered the said <ORG> to frame rules for practice and procedure and that the <ORG> of East Punjab inherited this power for framing rules under clause of the <ORG>s Punjab Order The submission was that by virtue of the said clause subject to the provisions of the said Order the law in force immediately before the appointed day with respect to practice and procedure in the <ORG> at Lahore shall with the necessary modifications apply in relations to the <ORG> of East Punjab and accordingly that <ORG> shall have all such powers to make rules and orders with respect to practice and procedure as were immediately before the appointed day exercisable by the <ORG> at Lahore with a proviso that any rules or orders which were in force immediately before the appointed day with respect to practice and procedure in the <ORG> at Lahore shall untill varied or revoked by rules or orders made by the <ORG> of East Punjab apply with any necessary modifications in relation to practice and procedure in the <ORG> of East Punjab as if made by that Court It was accordingly contended that only such rules as had been framed in the exercise of the power under clause of the Letters Patent by <ORG> at Lahore and preserved under clause of the High Courts Punjab Order have been made applicable to <ORG> under section of <ORG> Act The rules in question it was submitted were framed under section of the Suits Valuation Act and therefore are not attracted by section of <ORG> Act Rules framed under section of the Suits Valuation Act were rules in force immediately before the appointed day with regard to practice and procedure in Another contention sought to be urged was that the rules in question were applicable only to <ORG>s which enjoyed ordinary original civil jurisdiction and that there was no question of these rules being applicable to <ORG> at Lahore <ORG> and <ORG> as these <ORG>s were not exercising ordinary original civil jurisdiction The plaintiff has been given the liberty to value his claim for the purposes of <ORG> fees in a suit where it is difficult to value the claim with any precision or definiteness with I further liberty to put such value as he may think proper for the purposes of jurisdiction subject to determination by the <ORG> at any stage of the trial There is a fallacy in this submission which is wholly misconceived This brings me to the merits of the case The case of the plaintiff as already noted above is that the defendants are committing infringement in respect of its wrapper registered against No A Apart from it the defendants are alleged to be passing off their washing soap as that of the plaintiff by giving an impression that the washing soap packed under the impugned wrapper is that of the plaintiff or in any manner connected with the plaintiff and its business The former is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods In other words if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant the fact that the get up packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets in which the defendant offers his goods for sale show marked differences or indicate clearly a trade origin different from that of the registered proprietor of the mark would be immaterial whereas in the case of passing off the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff Accordingly it would be an infringement only if the defendant makes an unlawful use of the form in which the thought or information is expressed Their Lordships observed that in a passing off action the issue is Is the defendant selling goods so marked as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the plaintiffs goods while in an infringement action the issue is Is the defendant using a mark which is colourable imitation of the plaintiffs registered trade mark It was further observed that the action for infringement is a statutory right It is enough that the get up of goods has become distinctive of them and that there is a probability of confusion between them and the goods of A They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other Let us examine the Ok washing soap wrapper of the plaintiff and the impugned wrapper of the defendants in the light of the principles enunciated in the above noted cases The side panels consist of two blue coloured diamond devices containing the expression Ok appearing in vernacular languages The colour scheme of the plaintiff wrappers consists of red and blue colours against white background A perusal of the defendants impugned wrapper shows that it bears close resemblance to the plaintiff wrapper being partically of the same side its colour scheme and design are almost the same as that of the plaintiff wrapper The essential features of the impugned wrapper are that the upper portion shows A Hansa Product in white colour arranged in blue diamond devices appearing on either side with the numeral in red colour arranged in a shield device This is exactly the pattern of the plaintiff design except that for the words A Tata Product in white colour arranged in blue diamond devices appearing on either side the defendants have words A Hansa Product in white colour Further for the words OK in red colour arranged in a shield device the defendants have the numeral in red colour arranged in a shield device The side panels again in the impugned wrapper comprise numeral in vernacular and device of a swan instead of the word OK arranged in blue diamond devices like that of the plaintiffs On an overall view of the impugned label there can be no doubt that it has been so designed in its get up and in its colours that there is a likelihood of confusion being created in the mind of a purchaser The wrapper of the defendants is calculated to lead purchasers to believe that the soap of the defendants is the plaintiff soap The similarity between the plaintiff and defendants wrapper is so close that on a visual comparison of the two it has to be held that the wrapper of the defendants is an imitation of the plaintiff wrapper in that essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendants The defendants however by indicating on their wrapper that the washing soap sold in the said wrapper is made by <ORG> Jaipur seek to escape their liability in respect of passing off submitting that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish their goods from those of the plaintiff but is the added matter enough to reject the other grievance of the plaintiff The plaintiff other grievance is in respect of infringement of its copyright pertaining to the design of its wrapper The plaintiff claims to be the holder of the registration No A granted to it under the Indian Copyright Act besides registration nos an A The defendants subsequent to their filing the written statement and the reply to the present application by an application LA No of dated th August have apprised this Court that their wrapper in question has also been registered under the Copyright Act by the copyright office as No A There is no material on the record contrary to this assertion It being not necessary that the goods should have acquired a reputation for quality under that mark except that they have become a vendable article the evidence on the record consisting of the supporting affidavits of the parties is not enough to clinch the issue in favor of one or the other party However with a view to protect the interest of the plaintiff it would be appropriate that the defendants be directed to file the accounts of their sales in the Court with a copy to the plaintiff The defendants are accordingly directed to file the accounts of their sales from the date of filing of the suit to st October within six weeks of this order besides filing regularly the monthly accounts The parties to bear their respective costs
