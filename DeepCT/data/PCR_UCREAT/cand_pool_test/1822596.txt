The plaintiff brought this suit praying for an injunction against the defendants to restrain them from fishing in certain bhils set out in the schedule to the plaint and for a declaration that they had no right of fishing in the aforesaid bhils The grounds of action stated in the plaint are that the bhils in question appertain to the zamindari of Pergunnah Batasone of which the plaintiff is the patnidar that the plaintiff is in possession of the fishery right in the said bhils that out of these bhils bhils Kendra and others named in the second paragraph of the plaint were let out in ijara to Kholie Mahomed and <NAME> for three years from to to that during the term of this ijara lease the defendants in the months of Falgoon and Cheyt February and March without the permission of the ijaradars having caught and taken away fish from these bhils the said ijaradars brought a suit for damages against them that in that suit it was held by the Courts that the defendants in common with the inhabitants of the villages mentioned above had a prescriptive right to catch fish in these bhils using for the purpose certain specified fish traps that the defendants are still continuing to fish in these bhils in the manner stated above that they have no right of fishing in these bhils the julkur right in which is owned and held by the plaintiff Upon these allegations the lower Courts substantially raised the following issues st Is the suit barred by limitation nd Has the plaintiff any right in the disputed julkur rd Have the defendants in common with the tenantry of pergunnahs Batasone Koondi etc The lower <ORG> have dismissed the plaintiff suit In order to determine whether the plaintiff claim is barred by limitation or not we must see what the finding of the lower <ORG> upon this point is Unless it can be shown that the acts of misappropriation of the fish were done by a person or defined number of persons the acts of misappropriation even if they have the effect of depriving the owner of a property wholly of its profits would not constitute dispossession of the owner but in that case the defendants were ascertained persons who under a claim of right continuously exercised the right of taking fish from a bhil and it was held that they were in possession for more than twelve years of an interest in land must be shown to have been peaceably and openly enjoyed by any person claiming title thereto etc For the reasons given above it cannot be said that in this case that right was exercised by any person or persons We fail to see any tangible ground for this assumption For instance it may be that such a grant may be presumed in favour of a village community if such community be shown to possess all the essentials of a corporate body but we do not see any reason suggested by any evidence on the record which can support the conclusion that the tenants of the different pergunnahs in whose favour the right in question is claimed form anything like a corporate body There remains to consider whether the right set up by the defendants can have for its basis a valid existing custom According to the custom set up there is no limitation to the number of persons entitled to enjoy it Upon these questions of custom and prescriptive right there is the case of Lord Rivers Adams Ex It is true that we are not absolutely bound by the authority of this ease but if the grounds upon which the decision is based be founded upon natural justice we would be fully justified in following it On an examination of the reasons given by the <ORG> in that case it will appear that they are not peculiar to any country or any particular state of society but they are in conformity with the dictates of natural justice
