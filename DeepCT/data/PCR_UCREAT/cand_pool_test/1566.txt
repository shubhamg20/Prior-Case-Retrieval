Bihar Service Code Automatic termination without opportunity to show cause If violates Art He filed a suit challenging the two orders On August the <NAME> passed an order restraining the respondent from enforcing the order dated March On April the suit was decreed and the respondent was prohibited from enforcing the order dated March This decree was set aside in appeal by the Subordinate Judge on June and the petitioner second appeal was dismissed by <ORG> on February The petitioner filed the present writ petition under Art HELD No relief could be granted in respect of the orders dated September and March as a they were already covered by the decision of <ORG> in second appeal During that period that is from April to June the petitioner wrote several letters requesting the respondent to permit him to join duty in the senior grade but the respondent did not permit him to do so Therefore there was no question of the petitioner being continuously absent from service for over years during the period referred to when he was willing but the respondent did not allow him to serve and hence of the Service Code was not applicable The respondent did not give an opportunity to the petitioner to show cause against the order proposed Hence there was violation of Art It is only for the purpose of quantifying the amount having regard to the service and other allied matters that it may be necessary for the authorities to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive pension flows to an officer not because of any such order but by virtue of the rules The bar against <ORG> entertaining any suit relating to the matters under the Pension Act does not stand in the way of a writ of mandamus being issued to the <ORG> to properly consider the claim of the petitioner for payment of pension according to law of the Constitution the petitioner prays for the issue of a writ to the respondents in the nature of Certiorari or any other appropriate writ direction or order quashing four orders dated September March August and June He further prays for issue of a writ in the nature of a Writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to treat him as having retired at the age of and to pay him the pension that he is entitled to Though four orders are cought to be quashed as we will show in due course the grievance of the petitioner regarding the orders dated September and March We will refer briefly to the circumstances leading up to the passing of the orders referred to above in order to appreciate the circumstances under which the last two orders in particular came to be made as well as the ground of attack levelled against these orders There was a charge sheet issued to the petitioner on March and he was found guilty In consequence the order of suspension was cancelled but immediately thereafter a fresh inquiry was conducted in which he was again found guilty as per the report of the Inquiry Officer dated September But it may be necessary for us to refer to certain proceedings connected with the title suit when we deal with the attack of the petitioner against the legality of the orders dated August and June The order dated March was received by him at Patna on March when he was ill We will refer to this rule at the appropriate stage but it is enough to take note of the fact that under the said rule no pension may be granted to a government servant dismissed or removed for misconduct insolvency or inefficiency According to the petitioner there is a further infirmity in the order as the respondents are inconsistent in their pleas regarding the date from which the period of continuous absence has to be calculated This plea is based upon the different dates given in the order dated August and the dates given in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents According to the respondent the orders of censure passed on September and of reversion dated March are valid and legal and in passing those orders no violation of any rules has been made Regarding the order dated August it is admitted by the respondents that the petitioner was on duty till March It is further averred that the order dated March reverting the petitioner came into effect immediately and the petitioner was also informed of the same of the Constitution when the order dated August was passed on the basis of of the Bihar Service Code hereinafter to be referred as the Service Code It is to be noted at this stage that there is a variation regarding the dates of continuous absence for over five years mentioned in the order and in the counter affidavit It is further admitted by the respondents that even after the injunction order was passed by the <NAME> the <ORG> was always insisting on the petitioner to join in the lower grade to which post he had been reverted and that the petitioner never joined that post Dealing with the order dated June in and by which the petitioner was informed that the <ORG> was unable under of the Pension Rules to grant him pension the respondents state that the order is valid and fails squarely under the said rule There is also an averment to the effect that there is no question of any fundamental right of the petitioner being affected by the orders under attack and hence the writ petition is not maintainable The petitioner has filed a rejoinder wherein he has pointed out the inconsistent dates given in the order dated August and in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents by the Assistant Director of Education According to the petitioner the respondents do not deny his right to get pension but on the other hand plead that as he has been removed from service by the order dated August he is not entitled to pension by virtue of of the Pension Rules The questions that arise for consideration are whether the orders dated August and June are legal and valid the petitioner will have to establish that either the order dated August or June or both of them affect his fundamental rights guaranteed to him That the said order is one removing the petitioner from service is also admitted by the respondents in paragraph of the counter affidavit filed on their behalf by the Assistant Director of Education There is only a bald averment in the counter affidavit that there is no question of any fundamental right and therefore this petition is not maintainable Even according to the respondents the order dated June has no independent existence and that order has been passed on the basis of the earlier order dated August We are referring to this aspect because it is the case of the petitioner that he availed himself of leave with effect from March and he left the headquarters after obtaining the necessary sanction from his superior officers But the more serious attack against this order is that there is no question of the petitioner not being on his duties continuously for more than five years In this connection on behalf of the petitioner Mr <NAME> learned counsel has referred us to the details regarding the institution of the title suit No of by the petitioner as well as to certain orders passed by that court He has also drawn our attention to the letters written by the petitioner to the authorities offering to work and the respondents not sending any reply and ultimately asking the petitioner to join duty in the reverted post though the order of reversion has been declared illegal by the <ORG> Patna We have already referred to the averments in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents Therefore it follows that even according to the respondents the petitioner was absent from duty con tinuously for more than five years only from March and he ceased to be in government employ on March There is a slight shift in the stand taken by the respondents in the counter affidavit We will now proceed on the basis that the order dated August should be read in such a manner that the petitioner was not on his duty continuously for more than five years from March till August On August the <ORG> passed an order restraining the present respondents from operating the punishment order passed on March by the Director of Public Instruction on the petitioner till the disposal of the suit It is now admitted by the respondents that the petitioner was on duty till March and that he was absent only from March That there was an order of temporary injunction passed by the court restraining the respondents from giving effect to the order of March is not challenged in the counter affidavit That he was prepared to join duty and work is clear from the letters written by the petitioner to the Director of Public Instruction on October October and November On April the title suit No of instituted by the petitioner was decreed and the respondents were prohibited from enforcing the order dated March reverting the petitioner from the senior grade to the lower grade of <ORG> Admittedly there was a decree passed by the <ORG> in title suit No of on April restraining the respondents from giving effect to the order dated March reverting the petitioner from the post of Deputy Inspector of Schools to <ORG> Admittedly the respondents were parties to the said decree and they had not obtained any order of <ORG> staying the operation of the decree in the suit The petitioner sent a further letter dated December in reply to the letter of the Director of Public Instruction dated November He further made a request that he should be allowed to join duty in the original post in the senior grade and also made a further request for payment of arrears of his salary the decree of the <ORG> in favour of the petitioner restraining the respondents from enforcing the order dated March was set aside on appeal by the Subordinate Judge on June in title appeal No of We have already referred to the fact that the petitioner sent letters dated October October October and November expressing his readiness and willingness to work in the senior post During the period April June the petitioner wrote several letters and to which we have made a reference earlier requesting the respondents to permit him to join duty in the senior grade Hence it will be seen that the claim made by the respondents in the counter affidavit that the petitioner since March till August was continuously not in service for over five years is fallacious There is no question of the petitioner not being in continuous service for over five years during the period referred to above According to the respondents there is no violation of Art It was contended on behalf of the State of Rajasthan that the above regulation operated automatically and there was no question of removal from service because the officer ceased to be in the service after the period mentioned in the regulation This Court rejected the said contention and held that an opportunity must be given to a person against whom such an order was proposed to be passed no matter how the regulation described it It is admitted by the respondents that no opportunity was given to the petitioner to show cause against the order proposed Hence there is a clear violation of Art Therefore it follows even on this ground the order has to be quashed The petitioner wrote a letter dated July requesting the Director of Public Instructions to arrange for payment of his pension as he had attained the age of superannuation The respondents have admitted in their counter affidavit that the order dated August There is no controversy that the petitioner is an officer in <ORG> of the Bihar <ORG> Rule provides for the payment of superannuation pension to a <ORG> servant entitled or compelled by the rules to retire at a particular age We have only referred to some of the important rules to show that the payment of pension does not depend upon the discretion of the <ORG> but on the other hand payment of pension is governed by the Rules and a <ORG> servant coming Within the Rules is entitled to claim pension The order dated June has to be quashed in view of the fact that the foundation for the said order is the one based on the order dated August which has been quashed by us There is only a bald averment in the counter affidavit that no question of any fundamental right arises for consideration We understood the learned counsel to urge that if the <ORG> had passed an order granting pension and later on resiles from that order the latter order may be considered to affect the petitioner right regarding property so as to attract Arts By a reference to the material provisions in the Pension Rules we have already indicated that the grant of pension does not depend upon an order being passed by the authorities to that effect It may be that for the purposes of quantifying the amount having regard to the period of service and other allied matters it may be necessary for the authorities to pass an order to that effect but the right to receive pension flows to an officer not because of the said order but by virtue of the Rules It was held that such a right constitutes property and any interference will be a breach of Art It was further held that the character of pension as property cannot possibly undergo such mutation at the whim of a particular person or authority The majority quoted with approval the principles laid down in the two earlier decisions of the same <ORG> referred to above and held that the pension is not to be treated as a bounty payable on the sweet will and pleasure of the <ORG> and that the right to superannuation pension including its amount is a valuable right vesting in a <ORG> servant It was further held by the majority that even though an opportunity had already been afforded to the officer on an earlier occasion for showing cause against the imposition of penalty for lapse or misconduct on his part and he has been found guilty nevertheless when a cut is sought to be imposed in the quantum of pension payable to an officer on the basis of misconduct already proved against him a further opportunity to show cause in that regard must be given to the officer This view regarding the giving of further opportunity was expressed by the learned Judges on the basis of the relevant Punjab Civil Service Rules But the learned Chief Justice in his dissenting judgment was not prepared to agree with the majority that under such circumstances a further opportunity should be given to an officer when a reduction in the amount of pension payable is made by the <ORG> It is not necessary for us in the case on hand to consider the question whether A Punjab Hence we express no opinion regarding the views expressed by the majority and the minority Judges in the above Punjab <ORG> decision on this aspect But we agree with the view of the majority when it has approved its earlier decision that pension is not a bounty payable on the sweet will and pleasure of the <ORG> and that on the other hand the right to pension is a valuable right vesting in a government servant It may be that under the Pension Act Act of there is a bar against a civil court entertaining any suit relating to the matters mentioned therein To conclude No relief can be granted in respect of the orders dated September and March as they are already covered by the decision of <ORG> dated May in Second Appeal No of Further there is no infringement of any fundamental right of the petitioner by that order The order dated June stating that under of the Pension Rules the <ORG> is unable to grant the petitioner pension is also set aside and quashed As the petitioner himself claims that he has been retired from service on superannuation a writ of mandamus will be issued to the respondents directing them to consider the claim of the petitioner for payment of pension according to law The petitioner is entitled to his costs from the first respondent the State of Bihar
