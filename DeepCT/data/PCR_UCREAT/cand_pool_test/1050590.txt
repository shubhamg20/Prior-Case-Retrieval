The petitioner herein unsuccessfully contended before the District <NAME> in A No of on the file of his Court that the decree for ejectment passed against him in the above suit was inoperative inexecutable and null and void Consequent on the dismissal of the petition the petitioner has approached this Court for reliefs The facts lie within a narrow compass The petitioner preferred an appeal in A No of on the file of <ORG> Tiruchirapalli One of the main defences taken by the petitioner in the appeal was that the tenancy had not been properly terminated by issue of a valid notice under Section of the Transfer of Property Act <NAME> who heard the second appeal rejected the contentions of the petitioner and dismissed the second appeal but nevertheless gave the petitioner time for one year to vacate the premises The principal contention of the petitioner is that consequent on the introduction of the Act to the area where the building is situate the decree passed earlier has become inexecutable and therefore notwithstanding the expiry of the time limit granted to him in A No of be is entitled to be in occupation of the building as a statutory tenant until a valid order of eviction is passed against him under Section of the Act Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the petitioner submits that Section of the Act is clear in its terms and it expressly forbids the eviction of the petitioner who is a tenant in any other manner except in accordance with the provisions of that section or Sections to of the Act and the section further provides that a tenant cannot be evicted even in execution of a decree obtained by the landlord Section of the Act defines a tenant as follows tenant means any person by whom or on whose account rent is payable for a building and includes the surviving spouse or any son or daughter or the legal representative of a deceased tenant who i in the case of a residential building had been living with the tenant in the building as a member of the tenant family upto the death of the tenant and ii in the case of a non residential building had been in continuous association with the tenant for the purpose of carrying on the business of the tenant upto the death of the tenant and continues to carry on such business thereafter and a person continuing in possession after the termination of the tenancy in his favour but does not include a person placed in occupation of a building by its tenant or a person to whom the collection of rents or fees in a public market cart stand or slaughter house or of rents for shops has been farmed out or leased by <ORG> or <ORG> or <ORG> or <ORG> Section of the Act deals with the eviction of tenants and Sub section of Section reads as follows A tenant shall not be evicted whether in execution of a decree or otherwise except in accordance with the provisions of this section and Sections to Provided that nothing contained in the said section shall apply to a tenant whose landlord is the <ORG> Provided further that where the tenant denies the title of the landlord or claims a right of permanent tenancy the Controller shall decide whether the denial or claim is bona fide and if he records a finding to that effect the landlord shall be entitled to sue for eviction of the tenant in a civil Court and the Court may pass a decree for eviction on any of the grounds mentioned in the said sections notwithstanding that the Court finds that such denial does not involve forfeiture of the lease or that the claim is unfounded Sub section of Section states that a landlord seeking eviction of his tenant should apply to the Controller for a direction in that behalf and if the Controller after giving the tenant a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the application is satisfied he may make an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the building All that Section says is that during the period the Act is in force a tenant shall not be evicted from the premises occupied by him in execution of a decree for ejectment passed against him This position is now well settled and I need refer only to a few cases on this aspect A Bench of this <ORG> held that the eviction of a tenant can only be in accordance with the provisions of clause that there is nothing in the clause or in any of the other clauses of the Order expressly prohibiting the institution of a suit for possession or prohibiting a civil <ORG> from passing a decree for possession though a decree for possession that may be passed by the civil <ORG> will not be capable of execution by the civil <ORG> But the decree cannot be executed so long as the Act remains in force In support of his contention Mr <NAME> places reliance on the following cases He first relies on the decision in <NAME> <NAME> wherein it has been held that it is open to the landlord to give up his rights under Temporary Control of Rent and Eviction Act III of and enter into a binding contractual agreement with the tenant This decision cannot apply to the facts of this case because there is no agreement between the petitioner and his landlord whereunder the petitioner has agreed to waive his rights under the Act The argument cannot be countenanced because the petitioner had nowhere stated that he was giving up his rights under the Act Therefore there is no inconsistency between the stand taken by him in the suit and the stand taken in the present proceedings Lastly Mr <NAME> cited <NAME> <NAME> to argue that the petitioner had elected to seek enforcement of his rights under the Transfer of Property Act in the suit and therefore he has lost his rights under the Act to claim the status of a statutory tenant This is also a fallacious contention because the rights of the petitioner under the Act are not lost to him merely because he contested the civil suit filed by the respondent for recovery of possession For that question Section of the Act provides an answer in unmistakable terms However it is made clear that the decree passed against the petitioner is not a null and void one It is also made clear that notwithstanding the decree for possession already obtained by the respondent it is open to him to seek eviction of the petitioner by instituting appropriate proceedings under Section of the Act if there are grounds for the same
