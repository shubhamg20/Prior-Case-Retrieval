CASE NO Appeal civil of PETITIONER CHAMELI SINGH RESPONDENT STATE OF DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH RAMASWAMY FAIZAN UDDIN KIRPAL JUDGMENT JUDGMENT Supp SCR The Judgment was delivered by RAMASWAMY <NAME> Leave granted CA No of SLP No of This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment and order dated by <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Petition No of The appellants challenged the validity of the notification under Section and the exercise of the power given under Section read with Section dispensing with the inquiry under Section A Secondly it was contended that dispensing with the inquiry under Section A is not justifiable as there is no urgency to take possession even though the land was acquired for providing houses to Scheduled Castes for short Dalits He contended that in all the acquisitions for housing purpose conducting inquiry under Section A should be the rule and dispensing with such inquiry should be exceptional and only in rare cases like those covered by Section It is found as a fact that the houses put up by the appellants do not form part of the agricultural lands Section A as amended by <ORG> provides power to take possession under sub section which may also be exercised in the case lands other than waste or arable lands where the land is acquired for or in connection with sanitary improvements of any kind or planned development When the Government forms an opinion that it is necessary to require immediate possession of the land for building houses for the Dalits it forms the opinion of urgency to take immediate possession for the said purpose Article of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights laid down that <ORG> parties to the Covenant recognise the right to everyone to an adequate standard of living for himself and his family including food clothing housing and to the continuous improvement of living conditions The <ORG> parties will take appropriate steps to ensure realisation of this right It was therefore held that right to residence and settlement is a fundamental right under Article and it is a facet of inseparable meaningful right to life under Article For an animal it is the bare protection of the body for a human being it has to be a suitable accommodation which would allow him to grow in every aspect physical mental and intellectual SCC considering the right to dwell on pavements or in slums by the indigent was accepted as a part of right to life enshrined under Article their ejectment from the place nearer to their work would be deprivation of their right to livelihood The deprivation therefore must be consistent with the procedure established by law Writing and expressing oneself in diverse forms free movement and commingling with fellow human beings are part of the right to live with human dignity and they are components of the right to life It is home where he has opportunities to grow physically mentally intellectually and spiritually The right to shelter therefore does not mean a mere right to a roof over one head but right to all the infrastructure necessary to enable them to live and develop as a human being The question therefore is whether invocation of urgency cause under Section dispensing with inquiry under Section A is arbitrary or is unwarranted for providing housing construction for the poor The pre notification and post notification delay caused by the officer concerned does not create a cause to hold that there is no urgency In the at case a three Judge Bench of this <ORG> had upheld the notification issued under Section even though lapse of time of years had occurred due to inter departmental discussions before receiving the notification It was further held that delay on the part of the lethargic officials to take further action in the matter of acquisition was not sufficient to nullify the urgency which existed at the time of the issuance of the notification and to hold that there was never any urgency Conclusion of the <ORG> that there was urgency though not conclusive is entitled to create weight In <NAME> case SCC SCR this <ORG> had that very often person interested in the land reposed to be acquired may make representations to the authorities concerned against the proposed writ petition that is bound to result in multiplicity of enquiries communications and discussions leading invariably to delay in the execution of even urgent projects It was emphasised that <ORG> para The mind of the officer or authority concerned has to be applied to the question whether there is an urgency of such a nature that even the summary proceedings under Section A of the Act should be eliminated It is not just the existence of an urgency but the need to dispense with an inquiry under Section A which has to be considered Very often the officials due to apathy in implementation of the policy and programmes of the <ORG> themselves adopt dilatory tactics to create cause for the owner of the land to challenge the validity or legality of the exercise of the power to defeat the urgency existing on the date of taking decision under Section to dispense with Section A inquiry It is true that there was pre notification and post notification delay on the part of the officers to finalise and publish the notification Section provides compensation for the acquired land at the prices prevailing as on the date of publishing Section notification to be quantified at later stages of proceedings
