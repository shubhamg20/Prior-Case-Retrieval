that the law applicable to the plaintiff suit for eviction was the House Rent Control Order as it stood in its unamended form at the time of the institution of the suit in April It cannot be said that these words are wide enough to deprive the civil <ORG> of their jurisdiction to pass decrees all that the rule contemplates is the control of the relief of eviction Mr <NAME> contended that what the plaintiff should have done after validly instituting the suit and finding that the position had been changed by the amendment of July was to withdraw his suit and then apply to the Collector for an order of eviction but although the plaintiff might have done this there was in my view nothing to prevent him from proceeding to a decree if he chose to do so in the hope that he would be able to execute it when the ban imposed by the Control Order had been lifted It may be that the plaintiff could see that under the amended order he would have little or no chance of succeeding in evicting his quondam tenant but the section does not prevent him from obtaining the decree in the hope that he may be able to execute it later on In the result the appeal is accepted the decision of the lower appellate <ORG> is set aside and the decree for eviction passed by the trial <ORG> is restored with costs throughout
