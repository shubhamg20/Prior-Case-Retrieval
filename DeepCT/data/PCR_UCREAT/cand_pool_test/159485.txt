It was also provided in the deed that notwithstanding the main clause the trustees would if so desired by the company take out instead a different kind of policy for the benefit of both <NAME> and his wife with a further provision for <NAME>is wife should <NAME> die before he attained the age Of For the assessment years and the appellant claimed a deduction of these sums from its profits or gains under XV of the Indian Income tax Act but the Income tax authorities disallowed the claim on the ground that the sums claimed did not amount to expenditure within the meaning of the section <NAME>eld that expenditure which is deductible for the purposes of income tax under xv of the Indian Income tax Act is one which must be towards a liability actually existing at the time but the putting aside of money which may become expenditure on the happening of an event is not expenditure The question was answered in the negative There was it appears an agreement by which the <ORG> was under an obligation to provide a pension to <NAME> after his retirement On September the <ORG> executed a Trust Deed in favour of three trustees to whom the <ORG> paid a sum of pound Rs It was also provided in the deed that notwithstanding the main clause the trustees would if so desired by the assessee <ORG> take out instead a deferred longest life policy with the said Insurance <ORG> in their names but in favour of <NAME> and Mrs <NAME> for an annuity of pound per annum payable during their joint lives from the date of <NAME> superannuation and during the lifetime of the survivor provided further that if <NAME> died before he attained the age of years the annuity payable to Mrs <NAME> would be pound during her life In the assessment years and it claimed a deduction of these sums from its profits or gains under xv of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter called the Act which provides Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely any expenditure not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee paid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of such business profession or vocation The reason why the <ORG> held this way may be stated in its own words Clauses and II do not contain any provision having a material bearing upon Clause Therefore if it happens that both Mr and Mrs <NAME> die before th September all the payments till made through the Trustees to <ORG> will come back to the Trustees and as there is not the slightest trace of any indication anywhere that the Trustees should have any beneficient interest in these moneys there would be a resultant trust in favour of the <ORG> in respect of the moneys thus far paid out Such a provision can hardly be treated as payment to an employee whether of remuneration or pension or gratuity and cannot be a proper deduction against the incoming of the business of the <ORG> for the purpose of computing its taxable profits <ORG> noticed the limited scope of the question and pointed out that the <ORG> had stated at the end of the Statement of the Case In the event of <ORG> holding that there was an expenditure in this case it would still be necessary for the <ORG> whether the money was laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the assesses business and if so whether the expenditure was in the nature of capital or revenue expenditure It decided the question as framed It is the <ORG> which referred the question in this form keeping to itself the right to decide about the other ingredients of the clause later But if such a clear cut proposition cannot be laid down then obviously there is considerable difficulty in deciding what is I expenditure within the clause without reference to the rest of its provisions Of course to find the meaning of the word I expenditure a dictionary is ill that is needed but to go further and to decide whether the outlay in this case was I expenditure the context in which the word is used in the clause cannot successfully be left out Mr <NAME> who appeared on behalf of the assessee objected to the scope of the question being so enlarged and he referred to the appellate order of the <ORG> which had proceeded on a single ground We cannot help saying that though the <ORG> may be at liberty to decide a case as appears best to it there is considerable hardship to the tax payers if questions of law are decided piecemeal and repeated references to <ORG> are necessary the arrangement could only be taken as a provision for a gratuity more so as there was a provision in the deed of trust for payment of an annuity to Mrs <NAME> in the event of <NAME> demise According to him there were so many alternative arrangements for the disbursement of the money laid out that it was impossible to say what shape the annuity would ultimately take and till certain events happened the I expenditure was not effective He was thus of the opinion that the case fell within the rule laid down in <NAME> case <ORG> then observed in addition that there was no instant necessity for the expenditure nor was the money laid out for a business purpose of an instant character nor did it bring in a present asset which would always remain an asset in that form the money having gone for ever <ORG> pointed out that there was always a possibility of a resulting trust in favour of the <ORG> and the money could not therefore be held to have been ex pended The conclusion of <ORG> therefore was that the assessee <ORG> must be held to have set apart I tentatively a sum of money in order that it might be available for the payment of a I gratuity to <NAME> and Mrs <NAME> but there being I no provision for the application of the money in the event of those contingencies not occurring and no annuity being payable to any one there was no I expenditure in any real and practical sense of the term The main points urged on behalf of the assessee <ORG> are that payment of pension is an expenditure of a revenue character and so also the payment of a lump sum to get rid of a recurring liability to pay such pension It is also submitted that in so far as payment by the assessee <ORG> was concerned it was in point of fact made and this was I expenditure within the dictionary meaning of the word We shall now consider the arguments in detail and refer to those authorities which are relevant come tax law it must always be borne in mind that the scheme of legislation there is not the same as in our country It has been ruled under the English statute that sums paid to an employee as pension or gratuity are deductible as money laid out and expended for the purpose of trade profession or vocation In that case the taxpayer was under a liability to pay a pension to a retired actuary and pension had in fact been paid for some years There is nothing like a resulting trust in favour of the company although there is that provision which I have already called attention to in the trust deed that one of the things which might be done would be to abrogate altogether the trust or the provisions of the deed and to substitute other rules and provisions But it seems to me that cannot be said to be a resulting trust in favour of the company having regard to the other objects which are pointed out as those to which the scheme was directed Similarly a sum of money paid to the trustees to form a nucleus of a pension fund for the benefit of some of its employees by a company was also not held to be an admissible deduction in <NAME> case The Lord Chancellor observed however that when an expenditure is made not only once and for all but with a view to bringing into existence an asset or an advantage for the enduring benefit of a trade I think that there is very good reason in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion for treating such an expenditure as properly attributable not to revenue but to capital There the company operated a scheme for payment of pensions to retired or incapacitated employees reserving to itself the uncontrolled discretion to vary or cease payment of pensions The learned Judge continued at It is true they have got an asset which would give them in all probability nothing on balance because they use it to pay these pensions but they have got an asset they had not any pension fund to pay these pensions with and now they have got an insurance company which will in the future not extinguish the liability but countervail it and they have got the command of this policy to the extent that they are entitled to get their capital money say capital money without prejudice back from the insurance company on surrendering the policies From these cases there are deducible certain principles of a fundamental character Thirdly if there is a lump sum payment but there is no possibility of a recurrence it is probably of a capital nature though this is by no means a decisive test liability to make repeated and periodic payments in the future it may generally be regarded as a payment of a revenue character <ORG> <NAME> and lastly if the ownership of the money whether in point of fact or by a resulting trust be still in the tax payer then there is acquisition of a capital asset and not an expenditure of a revenue character Side by side with these principles there are others which are also fundamental Expenditure in this sense is equal to disbursement which to use a homely phrase means something which comes out of the trader pocket Thus in finding out what profits there be the normal accountancy Practice may be to allow as expense any sum in respect of liabilities which have accrued over the accounting period and to deduct such sums from profits We may here refer to two other cases There were however certain exceptions under which the compensation was not payable It was held by majority that though the company was entitled to charge against one year receipts the cost of making provision for the retirement payments which would ultimately be payable as it had the benefit of the employees services during that year provided the present value of the future payments could be fairly estimated since the factor of discount was ignored in making the deduction the claim could not be entertained In these several cases emphasis was sometimes laid on the words wholly and exclusively sometimes on laid out or expended and sometimes on for the purposes of the trade It was the nature of the liability or the time of payment or the value of the payment or all of them which determined whether the amount should be deducted or not Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely xv any expenditure not being an allowance of the nature described in any of the clauses i to xiv inclusive and not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of such business profession or vocation This section though it enacts affirmatively what is stated in the negative form in the English statute is substantially in pari materia with the English enactment and would have justified our considering the English authorities as aids to the interpretation thereof But there is no case directly on what is I expenditure and if the authorities under the English statute were to be of real assistance the whole of the matter should have been before us If this condition be not fulfilled and there is a possibility of there being a resulting trust in favour of the <ORG> then the money has not been spent i paid out or away but the amount must be treated as set apart to meet a contingency There is a distinction between a contingent liability and a payment depending upon a contingency We are not concerned with the provisions of this Chapter because the allowance does not fall within any of the provisions and we have only to decide the question whether the amounts paid to purchase the policy involved an expenditure in the accounting years Next learned counsel relied upon <NAME> Law Integrity Insurance <ORG> Limited Prudential Insurance <ORG> <ORG> and In re <ORG> to show that there was no contingent liability but a liability depending on a contingency namely the duration of life the probabilities of which were estimated on actuarial calculations In the first of these cases it was held that the kind of policies which were issued were policies of insurance on human lives and that the company was carrying on the business of life insurance contrary to its memorandum of association and the policies were ultra vires the company In the last case the question arose under of the Assurance Companies Act and it was decided that a certificate holder held a policy on human life because money was payable not only at the expiration of a certain number of years but all premiums were repayable in the event of death to the legal representative Expenditure which is deductible for income tax purposes is one which is towards a liability actually existing at the time but the putting aside of money which may become expenditure on the happening of an event is not expenditure We therefore dismiss the appeal with costs
