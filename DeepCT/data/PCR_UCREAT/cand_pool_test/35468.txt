Second Appeal No and Second Appeal No of are plaintiff appeals arising out of a suit for sale on the basis of a mortgage deed dated the th of November executed by the father of the present defendants in favour of the plaintiff The defendants did not put in an appearance in the Court of first instance and no written statement was filed on their behalf The learned Subordinate Judge relying on a clause in the mortgage deed which entitled the mortgagee to sue for the whole amount of principal and interest on default of payment of annual interest held that the claim to enforce the charge was barred by time under Article of the Limitation Act but he was however of opinion that the personal remedy was not barred The plaintiff appealed to this <ORG> from the lower Appellate <ORG> decrees and his appeals came up for hearing before <ORG> of this <ORG> which in view of some apparent conflict of opinion has referred these cases to a Fall Bench There are only two points which arise for our determination Whether the plaintiff claim to enforce the charge by sale of the mortgaged property is barred by time Whether in any case he is entitled to a simple money decree In case of non payment of interest from year to year the creditor has the option to add the interest to the principal and to charge interest thereon at the aforesaid rate or to recover through <ORG> principal and interest from me and hypothecated property and also from my other moveable or immoveable property and from my person within the stipulated period In case of non payment within the stipulated period the creditor shall have the power to recover the money principal and interest together with compound interest from me mortgaged property or other moveable or immoveable property of mine If however a default were made in payment of the annual interest it would be open to the mortgagee if he so desired to sue for the whole amount of principal and interest and it is clear that in that case the mortgagor could not succeed on the plea that the claim was premature On the other hand there is nothing in the deed which makes it obligatory on the mortgagee to sue as soon as a default is made This view has been accepted by the <ORG> and the wording of Article has remained unaltered and a special period of grace provided for in Section of the new Act It being beyond question that Article applies we have to look So the words in the third column of that Article in order to determine the point of time from which limitation begins to run We have therefore to answer the simple question when did the money become due in the present case Obviously money becomes due as soon as it becomes payable by the mortgagor to the mortgagee that is to say as soon as it can be legally recovered by the mortgagee Examining the terms of the mortgage deed in this light it is obvious that as soon as the first default was made a right accrued to the mortgagee to sue for the whole sum with interest it was remarked If he those to wait till all the instalments became due no doubt he might do so but that which was optional on the part of the plaintiff would not affect the right of the defendant who might well consider the action as accruing from the time that the plaintiff had a right to maintain it It was held in that case that a claim brought more than six years after the first default was barred by time inasmuch as the cause of action arose on the first default and that the time began to run from the earliest time at which the plaintiff could have brought her action It has been very strongly urged before us that the effect of holding that time begins to run from the first default would be to strike out an important clause under which the mortgagee is given the option to wait and this would be going against the express intention of the parties But it is not quite easy to see what is really meant by saying that the mortgagee has the option of suing or not suing But as a matter of fact there is in the deed no covenant that limitation will not begin to run and the option after all might not mean anything more than that a forbearance to sue would not disentitle the mortgagee from claiming interest but that interest would continue torun though no suit is brought for some time <ORG> which would cover the point arising in this case Although it is conceded that the point before us did not directly arise in that case and the remark relied upon by the learned <NAME> for the appellant was a mare obiter dictum nevertheless any observation of their Lordships is entitled to the greatest weight and should be a guide to us It is therefore necessary for us to consider that case carefully There was a mortgage deed executed on the st of Jane which was subsequently registered and under which it was stipulated that the money would be re paid in June but that in the event of the lands being sold in execution of a decree obtained by a third party the mortgages would be at liberty at once to sue for the recovery of the debt On the th May the lands mortgaged were actually sold in execution of a simple money decree Now it is to be noted that in the old Limitation Act of there was no clause which in any way corresponded to Article of the present Limitation Act and their Lordships felt constrained to apply the general article far recovery of immoveable property corresponding to the present Article No one contends that that Article applies in the present case In fact there is a uniform course of decisions in all the <ORG> that Article of the Limitation Act would be applicable to a mere money claim based on a registered bond and not the general Article We simply content ourselves with mentioning a few cases holding the two opposite views tend to apart the view that time begins to run from the date of the first default In that case the majority of the learned Judges held that money becomes due within the meaning of Article and time begins to run from the date of the first default The learned Chief Justice remarked It seems to me that the money is due when it can be legally demanded and it is admitted in the present case that the money secured by this mortgage could have been legally demanded and recovered after the first default and had a suit been brought for its recovery by sale of the mortgaged property the defendants could not have pleaded that such a suit was premature We entirely agree with this view and consider that it lays down the right teat to apply in such cases We are however distinctly of opinion that the question whether the mortgagee is bound to sue or not and whether he does at once sue or not is wholly irrelevant to the issue We have therefore no hesitation in saying that the view taken by the majority of the learned Judges in the <ORG> case referred to above was correct Neither the re port nor the judgment however shows that the previous <ORG> case was brought to the notice of the learned Judges We shall have to revert to this case in connection with the second point raised in these appeals A the mortgage deed had provided that in the event of non payment of interest for two consecutive half years the mortgagees would have the power either to benefit themselves by charging compound interest or to sue without waiting for the period fixed for the whole of the principal and interest or to sue for the interest alone The learned Judges were of opinion that when three options were given to the mortgagees and they did not choose to exercise the option of suing for the whole amount on default of the payment of two consecutive instalments of interest by the debtor it cannot be said that the time began to run from such abstention The previous <ORG> case was distinguished on the ground that in that case no option be far as we can Bee from the recital of the terms of the bond given therein was given to the creditor A a point was made that in the deed in question no option whatsoever was given to the mortgagee in the matter Both on principle and the balance of authority therefore we are of opinion that the view taken by the <ORG> is correct and that the first default having occurred more than twelve years before the suit money sued for became due then and the present claim for the enforcement of the charge is barred by time under Article of the Limitation Act There remains the second question whether even if the mortgagee cannot get a decree for sale he is nevertheless entitled to a simple money decree Although the relief for recovery of money otherwise than by enforcing the charge would be governed by another Article with a different period fixed yet it would be a startling thing to end that the time for recovery of the amount due by sale of the property has begun to run while that for recovering it as a simple debt has not yet started There is one case in which it has been actually held that although defaults were made yet the mortgagee was not bound to sue for the whole money as soon as there was failure in payment and that time did not begin to run till after the date originally fixed The mortgagee has a right to sue for the whole money if a default is made and his suit can not be thrown out on the ground that it is premature He has a perfectly good cause of action to sue if he so chooses yet the limitation does not begin till the date originally fixed arrives The result is that the mortgagee can sue long before the period of limitation for his suit begins to run The learned Judges have not quoted the Article which in their opinion was applicable bat from the remark that the mortgagee had the option to wait till the period fixed We take it that they intended to apply Article read with Article of the Limitation Act In the last mentioned case <NAME> while referring to the two earlier cases remarked whether these decisions are right or wrong we can see no reason whatsoever in the present case at any rate for expressing any opinion to the contrary One of us was a party to one of these decisions and until these decisions are set aside by a larger Bench we can see no reason why we should not follow them A was in assuming that it was Article read with Article which governed the case The expression single bond used in Article is clearly borrowed from the English Law In our opinion the case falls under Article which governs a bond not herein expressly provided for in which case the time begins to run from the date when the bond becomes payable there was no clause similar to Article of the new Act which could take the case out of the general clause The other learned Judge however took a different view
