On the first point taken we agree with the lower <ORG> that the <ORG> jurisdiction to refer to arbitration is confined to matters in difference in the suit itself and does not extend to all matters in dispute between the parties Though the wording of paragraph Clause of the Second Schedule Civil Procedure Code is not free from ambiguity when taken by itself the matter is made clear by a reference to forms Nos and of the Schedule particularly the latter We think no change in the law was intended by the change in the wording of the rule in the new Code but it was only a verbal change Furthermore on principle it is difficult to hold that the <ORG> intended that a <ORG> which has no jurisdiction over the subject matter in dispute should have power to refer it to arbitration Such a result would follow if we give to the words any matter in difference between them in paragraph Schedule II Civil Procedure Code an extended meaning to include all matters in dispute between the parties and not included in the suit It is nest urged that the award should have been accepted as a lawful agreement or compromise of the suit claim under Order XXIII Rule Civil Procedure Code and a decree passed in accordance with it so far as it related to the suit
