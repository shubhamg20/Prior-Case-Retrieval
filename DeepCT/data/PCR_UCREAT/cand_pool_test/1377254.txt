The respondent filed a petition under Art HELD i Restrictions or impediments which directly and immediately impede or hamper the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse whether <ORG> or intra <ORG> fall within the prohibition imposed by Art ii Tax under the Central Sales Tax Act on <ORG> sales is in its essence a tax which encumbers movement of trade and commerce since by the definition in of the Act a sale or purchase of the goods is deemed to take place in the course of <ORG> trade if it a occasions the movement of goods from one <ORG> to another is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during the movement from one <ORG> to another There is also no doubt that exercise of the power to tax may normally be presumed to be in the public interest An Act which is merely enacted for the purpose of imposing tax which is to be collected and to be retained by the <ORG> does not amount to law giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one <ORG> over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one <ORG> and another merely because of varying rates of tax between different <ORG>s iv Article a had no application to the present case because there was no imposition of rates of tax on imported goods different from rates of tax on goods manufactured or produced in the <ORG> Therefore in calculating the turnover of <ORG> transactions excise duty would be excluded as provided in the Rules made under the Madras Act although there was no such provision in the Central Act Per <NAME> partly dissenting i It cannot be said that tax under the Central Sales Tax Act on <ORG> sales as defined in of the Act is in its essence a tax hampering movement of trade or commerce within the meaning of Art it is certainly a law made by <ORG> in the public interest and is saved by Art There is nothing in its provisions which offends Art But before a taxing statute is held to be violative of that article it must be shown that it has a direct or immediate impact on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse within the country ii The power conferred on <ORG> by Art In addition there is the presumption of the constitutionality of a statute of the Constitution seeking a writ of certiorari quashing the order of assessment on the grounds that the provisions of the Central Sales Tax Act which permitted levy of tax at varying rates in different States were invalid and that the transactions brought to tax were not in truth inter State transactions The Government of India Act by List II entry of the Seventh Schedule conferred power exclusively upon the Provinces to legislate on the subject of tax on the sale of goods and on advertisement held that under the Bombay Sales Tax Act of sales effected in Bombay in respect of goods exported from the State were not taxable by the State of Bombay but the importing State was competent to levy tax on transactions of sale in the course of inter State trade or commerce on persons who were resident outside its territory provided that the goods were delivered in the importing State for the purpose of consumption therein The Court held that the sales or purchases made by an assessee which actually took place in the course of inter State trade or commerce could not be taxed by any State until by law it was otherwise provided by <ORG> sales immune from taxation the difficulties till then experienced by the trading community but the importing States which had imposed tax on <ORG> sales by non resident dealers relying on them principle of the judgment in <ORG> case were faced with innumerable claims for restitution of the tax realized By that amendment entry A was added in <ORG> in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution conferring power upon the <ORG> to legislate in respect of taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of <ORG> trade or commerce and for entry in the State List the following entry was substituted Taxes on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers subject to the provisions of entry A of List I Explanation to cl of Art were substituted by fresh clauses by the newly enacted cl the <ORG> was authorised by law to formulate principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in any of the ways mentioned in cl and by cl it was enacted that any law of a State shall in so far as it imposes or authorises the imposition of a tax on the sale or purchase of goods declared by <ORG> by law to be of special importance in inter State trade or commerce be subject to such restrictions and conditions in regard to the system of levy rates and other incidents of the tax as <ORG> may by law specify clause was added authorising <ORG> to collect tax on the sale or purchase of goods other than newspapers where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce and making it obligatory upon <ORG> to assign the tax to the States in the manner provided in cl By cl it was enacted that <ORG> may by law formulate principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in the course of inter State trade or commerce <NAME> December the Central Sales Tax Act with a view to formulate principles a for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes place in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce or outside a <ORG> or in the course of import into or export from India providing for the levy collection and distribution of taxes on sales of goods in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce declaring certain goods to be of special importance in inter <ORG> trade or commerce and specifying the restrictions and conditions to which <ORG> laws imposing taxes on the sale or purchase of such goods of special importance shall be subject By conditions in which a sale or purchase of goods was to be deemed to have taken place outside a <ORG> were specified Section imposed a charge on all sales effected by a dealer in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce during any year The tax payable by any dealer on his turnover in so far as the turnover or any part thereof relates to the sale of goods in the course of inter State trade or commerce not falling within sub section a in the case of declared goods shall be calculated at the rate applicable to the sale or purchase of such goods inside the appropriate State and in the case of goods other than declared goods shall be calculated at the rate of seven per cent or at the rate applicable to the sale or purchase of such goods inside the appropriate State whichever is higher and for the purpose of making any such calculation any such dealer shall be deemed to be a dealer liable to pay tax under the sales tax law of the appropriate State notwithstanding that he in fact may not be so liable under that law Notwithstanding anything contained in this section <ORG> may if it is satisfied that it is necessary so to do in the public interest by notification in the Official Gazette direct that in respect of such goods or classes of goods as may be mentioned in the notification and subject to such conditions as it may think fit to impose no tax under this Act shall be payable by any dealer having his place of business in the <ORG> in respect of the sale by him from any such place of business of any such goods in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce or that the tax on such sales shall be calculated at such lower rates than those specified in sub section or sub section as may be mentioned in the notification Insofar as it is material it provided The tax payable by any dealer under this Act on sales of goods effected by him in the course of interState trade or commerce whether such sales fall within clause a or clause of section shall be levied and collected by <ORG> in the manner provided in sub section in the State from which the movement of the goods commenced Provided The authorities for the time being empowered to assess collect and enforce payment of any tax under the general sales tax law of the appropriate State shall on behalf of <ORG> and subject to any rules made under this Act assess collect and enforce payment of any tax including any penalty payable by a dealer under this Act in the same manner as the tax on the sale or purchase of goods under the general sales tax law of the State is assessed paid and collected and for this purpose they may exercise all or any of the powers they have under the general sales tax law of the State and the provisions of such law including provisions relating to returns appeals reviews revisions references penalties and compounding of offences shall apply accordingly Provided The proceeds in any financial year of any tax including any penalty levied and collected under this Act in any State other than a <ORG> territory on behalf of <ORG> shall be assigned to that State and shall be retained by it and the proceeds attributable to <ORG> territories shall form part of <ORG> of the sale or purchase price thereof and such tax shall not be levied at more than one stage where a tax has been levied under that law in respect of the sale or purchase inside the State of any declared goods and such goods are sold in the course of inter State trade or commerce the tax so levied shall not exceed two per cent of the sale or purchase subject to such conditions as may be provided in any law in force in that State There is a slight inconsistency between and A But that has no bearing on the question under discussion He contends and his contention has found favour with <ORG> that the liability to pay tax on interState transactions depending upon the rate of tax prevailing in the exporting State hampers trade and commerce by giving or authorising the giving of preference to one State over another or by making or authorising the making of discrimination between one State and another and thereby violates the guarantee of freedom of trade commerce and intercourse declared by Part XIII of the Constitution This Article is couched in terms of the widest amplitude trade commerce and intercourse are thereby declared free and unhampered throughout the territory of India would be such restrictions as directly and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or movement of trade In <ORG> The State of Rajasthan and others the view expressed by <NAME> in <ORG> case was accepted by the majority of the Constitution of India referred to the right of free movement of trade without any obstructions by way of barriers inter State or intra State or other impediments operating as such barriers It must be taken as settled law that the restrictions or impediments which directly and immediately impede or hamper the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse fall within the prohibition imposed by Art In <ORG> case <NAME> observed Taxes may and do amount to restrictions but it is only such taxes as directly and immediately restrict trade that would fall within the purview of Art The argument that all taxes should be governed by Art Tax under the Central Sales Tax Act on inter State sales it must be noticed is in its essence a tax which encumbers movement of trade or commerce since by the definition in of the Act a sale or purchase of goods is deemed to take place in the course of inter State trade or commerce if it a occasions the movement of goods from one State to another is effected by a transfer of documents of title to the goods during their movement from one State to another The question which then falls to be determined is whether the tax imposed in the present case is saved by the operation of the other provisions of Part XIII expressly provides that on the freedom of trade restrictions may be imposed not only as between one State and another but also within any part of the territory of India and there is nothing in the language or the context for restricting the power of the <ORG> which it otherwise possesses in the public interest to impose restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse operative only as between one State and another as two entities Article provides by the first clause Notwithstanding anything in article neither <ORG> nor the <ORG> of a State shall have power to make any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one State over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of an entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule power upon the <ORG> to impose restrictions upon freedom of trade commerce or intercourse the Constitution proceeds to impose certain restrictions upon the power so conferred creates a complication which we are not called upon in the present case to resolve It is expressly declared that the <ORG> shall not have the power to make any law giving preference to one State over another authorising the giving of any preference to one State over another making any discrimination between one State and another and authorising the making of any discrimination between one State and another in exercise of or by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule It was contended on behalf of the State that the power under Art could only be exercised so as to restrict the authority of the <ORG> which arises by virtue of an entry relating to trade and commerce in the legislative lists and it was urged that an entry with respect to the levy of tax on trade and commerce and is not an entry relating to trade and commerce and therefore there is no prohibition against the <ORG> exercising power or authorising the giving of any preference to one State over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one State and another by the exercise of taxing power It was also urged that the expression an entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule was restricted to the entries which expressly deal with the power to legislate in respect of trade and commerce i entries of List I entries of List II and entry of List III in the Seventh Schedule and The question whether entries relating to trade and commerce in the Lists in the Seventh Schedule are restricted to entries of List I entries of List II and entry of List III or relate to all general entries which affect trade and commerce is academic in the present case entries relating to tax on sale or purchase of goods i entry A of List I and entry of List II are entries relating to trade and commerce for in our opinion an Act which is merely enacted for the purpose of imposing tax which is to be collected and to be retained by the <ORG> does not amount to law giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one <ORG> over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one <ORG> and another merely because of varying rates of tax prevail in different <ORG>s According to <ORG> such a scheme was obviously quite discriminatory and considerably affected the freedom of trade commerce and inter Course the differential rates or exemptions in various <ORG> imposing an unequal burden on the same or similar goods which affected their free movement or flow in inter <ORG> trade and commerce and that a higher rate of tax in a <ORG> worked as a barrier to the free movement of similar goods to another <ORG> where there was no tax or a lower rate of tax and for trade in particular goods declared or undeclared to be free throughout the territory of India the rate of tax or exemption as the case may be must be uniform It does not include a differentiation based on other considerations which are dependent on natural or business circumstances and may operate with more or less force in different localities and there is nothing in my opinion to prevent <ORG> charged with the welfare of the people as a whole from doing what every State in the Commonwealth has power to do for its own citi zens that is to say from basing its taxation measures on considerations of fairness and justice always observing the constitutional injunction not to prefer States or parts of States It also appears from the provisions of the Australian Constitution that by virtue of of the Constitution there is to be a uniform imposition of customs duties But the observations made by <NAME> in King Barger and approved by <ORG> are useful in the determination of the true principle applicable in the present case that it is where differentiation is based on consideration not dependent upon natural or business factors which operate with more or less force in different localities that the <ORG> is prohibited from making a discrimination Attention must also be directed to sub of which authorises the <ORG> Government notwithstanding anything contained in in the public interest to waive tax or impose tax on sales at a lower rate on inter <ORG> trade or commerce But since the power of taxation could be exercised in a manner prejudicial to the larger public interests by the States it was found necessary to restrict the power of taxation in respect of transactions which had an inter State content In Firm A Mehtab Majid Co case this Court struck down the levy of tax on sales of tanned hides and skins imported from outside the <ORG> of Madras at a rate higher than the rate of tax on sales of hides and skins tanned and sold within the <ORG> of Madras as infringing Art By framed under of the Madras General Sales Tax Act it was provided that in the case of untanned hides and skins the tax under of the Madras General Sales Tax Act shall be levied from the dealer who is the last purchaser in the <ORG> not exempt from tax under on the amount for which they are brought by him By it was provided that i in the case of hides or skins which had been tanned outside the <ORG> the tax under shall be levied from the dealer who in the <ORG> is the first dealer in such hides or skins not exempt from tax under on the amount for which they are sold by him and ii in the case of tanned hides or skins which had been tanned within the <ORG> the tax under shall be levied from a person who is the first dealer in such hides of skins not exempt from tax under on the amount for which they are sold by him The taxpayer contended in Firm A Mehtab Majid case that the tanned hides and skins imported from outside and sold inside the <ORG> were under of the Madras General Sales Tax Rules subjected to a higher rate of tax than the rate imposed on hides and skins tanned and sold within the <ORG> and this discriminatory system of taxation offended Art a of the Constitution This Court accepted the contention and held that discriminated against imported hides or skins which had been purchased or Supp tanned outside and therefore it contravened Art They were assessed to sales tax in accordance with the provisions of the Madras General Sales Tax Turnover and Assessment Rules on the turnover of hides and skins purchased in the untanned condition outside the State and tanned within the State with respect to the assessment years and In petitions filed by the assessees in this Court under Art a of the Constitution which authorises the <ORG> of a <ORG> notwithstanding anything in Arts and by law to Impose on goods imported from other <ORG>s or the <ORG> territories any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that <ORG> are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced Imposition of differential rates of tax by the same <ORG> on goods manufactured or produced in the <ORG> and similar goods imported in the <ORG> is prohibited by that clause But where the taxing <ORG> is not imposing rates of taxon imported goods different from rates of tax on goods manufactured or produced Art Article prohibits the making of law which gives or authorises the giving of any preference to one <ORG> over another or makes or authorises the making of and discrimination between one <ORG> and another The Court rejected the contention that to the extent the excise duty is not deductible from taxable turnover under the Central Act unlike under the Madras General Sales Tax Act there is discrimination between one State and another It is not deductible from the turnover of the inter State sales and this rule is uniformly applied to all <ORG> sales There is therefore no question of inequality or discrimination forbidden by Art and there is no question of contravention of Art If under the Madras General Sales Tax Act in computing the turnover the excise duty is not liable to be included and by virtue of of the Central Sales Tax Act has to be levied in the same manner as the Madras General Sales Tax Act the excise duty will not be liable to be included in the turnover and the observations made in the last paragraph of the judgment under appeal that because no express provision was made for exclusion of the excise duty in the computation of turnover from inter State sales or purchases there was discrimination cannot be accepted as correct Against orders passed in favour of the other assessees the State has not preferred appeals We therefore direct that there will be no order as to costs in this <ORG> and in <ORG> guaranteed by Article a rational and workable test to apply would be Does the impugned restriction operate directly or immediately on trade or its movement It is the free movement of the transport of goods from one part of the country to the other that is intended to be saved and if any Act imposes any direct restrictions on the very movement of such goods it attracts the provi sions of Article and its validity can be sustained only if it satisfies the requirements of Art this Court rejected the contention that sec This Court distinguished the case of Firm <NAME> State of Madras which decided that a sales tax which discriminated against goods imported from other States might affect the free flow of trade and would then be invalid unless protected by Article a It appears to me again with great respect that there is no warrant for treating such a tax as in any way contrary either to the letter or the spirit of the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse provided under Article It seems to me that the Central Sales Tax Act is no exception to this rule it is certainly a law made by <ORG> in the public interest and is saved by Art I agree to the order proposed by <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> Though I agree with the conclusions reached by my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> namely sections A and of the Central Sales Tax Act No of hereinafter referred to as the Act are intra vires the Constitution my reasons for coming to that conclusion are not the same as his But before a taxing statute is held to be violative of that Article it must be shown that it has a direct or immediate impact on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse within the country Article empowers <ORG> by law to impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse between one <ORG> and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest In addition there is the presumption of the constitutionality of a statute But once it is shown that a measure prima facie gives preference to the residents of one <ORG> over another <ORG> or it makes discrimination between the residents of a <ORG> and that of another because of the adoption of different rates of tax in different <ORG>s then the matter assumes a different complexion in view of Art It must have had good reasons for enacting those provisions The question of giving preference or making discrimination depends on various facts and circumstances the tax rate being only one of them We shall now examine the purposes behind of the Act which fixes rates of tax on sales in the course of inter State trade commerce and intercourse Good many sales in the course of interState sales are made to Governments All that the registered dealer has to do is to get included in his certificate of registration goods of the class or classes which he proposes to purchase as being intended for resale by him or for use by him in the manufacture or processing goods for sale or in the mining or is the generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power This takes us to the remaining sales in the course of inter <ORG> trade or commerce By and large these sales are made to unregistered dealers Here the law at the relevant time was that the tax shall be calculated at the rate of seven percentum of the turnover or at the rate applicable to sale or purchase of such goods inside the appropriate <ORG> whichever is higher Sub section of provides for giving individual exemptions in public interest It must be remembered that under the present conditions the power to tax is not merely used for the purpose of collecting revenue it is a powerful social instrument in particular an instrument which can be effectively used for correcting economic maladjustments While the legislature must provide in the law for all reasonably foreseeable contingencies still some discretionary power has to be given to the executive to meet unexpected situations If we bear in mind the fact that sales tax on <ORG> sales is levied for the benefit of the <ORG>s and the further fact that each one of the <ORG> Governments in its own interest is bound to create the best possible condition for the growth of industry and commerce in that <ORG> it is reasonable to assume that they will not be blind to economic forces Reasonably sufficient safeguards against the free flow of trade into a <ORG> have been provided by the provisions of the Act firstly by providing for the levy of sales tax in the <ORG> in which the goods are produced and secondly by placing various restrictions on the power of the <ORG>s in fixing the rates
