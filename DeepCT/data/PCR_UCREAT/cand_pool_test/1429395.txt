The assessee claimed in its returns for those years that the amounts paid as commission to the selling agent were expenses incurred to earn profit and could therefore be deducted under lO xv lncome Tax Act but the Income Tax officer disallowed the claim Clause ii provides that the plant should be overhauled before tho commencement and the termination of the agreement in sharing half of the net profits is not consistent with payments made to agents for services rendered A Cl In cl there is also provision for the selling agent sharing the loss incurred by the assessee by deducting of the loss from its remuneration and for a lump sum deduction of Rs While the contract was to be carried on in accordance with the policy settled between the assessee and the trust in that case it did not give any veto power to the trust to torpedo the contract In the present case the agreement gave to the selling agents controlling power at every stage in the programme of manufacture and even at the stage of the sale of the products by requiring the consent of the selling agent Not only was there no provision in <NAME> case under which the trust was to share the loss but there was an express provision to the contrary Therefore the payment of interest at the rate of per cent on the loan advanced to the assessee by the trust and a percentage in the profits in that case is quite consistent with a remuneration in lieu of services lent and would amount to an expenditure incurred by the assessee wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business which was conducted by the assessee The facts found by the <ORG> and those mentioned in its Statement of the case to the <ORG> lead to the inescapable conclusion that the agreement is nothing but a joint venture to divide the profits after they are ascertained and hence the payments to the selling agent cannot in any sense be deemed to be expenses incurred by the assessee for the purpose of its business or for earning profits Appeals by special leave from the judgment and order dated the of <ORG> at Chandigarh in I Reference No of Before expiry of this agreement another agreement was entered into by the assessee <ORG> with the agents on October under which the agents were to get interest on all the advances made by them commission on net sales and commission on net sales of the worsted plant What is more was that the agents agreed to a deduction of of the loss incurred by the assessee <ORG> from their remuneration There were a number of other conditions with which we shall deal later The case of the assessee was that the two amounts mentioned above being in the nature of commission paid to the selling agents would be deemed expenses incurred by the <ORG> in order to earn profits and would therefore fall within the ambit of xv of the Income tax Act hereafter referred to as the Act The Income tax officer however disallowed the deduction and held that the deduction claimed was actually a division of profits after the profits had come into existence and had been ascertained and therefore could not he claimed as a valid deduction under the provisions of the Act The assessee <ORG> went up in appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who accepted the plea of the assessee <ORG> and held that the payment was a permissible deduction as it was incurred for the purpose of the assessee trade in order to facilitate the business of the assessee Thereafter the appellant moved <ORG> for grant of leave to appeal to <ORG> which having been rejected the appellant filed a petition for special leave <ORG> in reversing the order of the <ORG> mainly relied on what it described as the surrounding circumstances under which the alleged payments were made to the selling agents by the assessee <ORG> as spelt out from the agreement entered into by the assessee <ORG> with the selling agents The main point which was argued before the <ORG> as also before <ORG> was that the cumulative effect of the interpretation of the various clauses of the agreement dated October unmistakably revealed that in the garb of an agency the parties entered into a joint venture for distributing the net profits after being ascertained between themselves and that is why there was an express provision in the agreement by which the agents agreed to share the losses to the extent of which were to be deducted from the remuneration payable to the agents The <ORG> held that the agreement amounted to a joint venture resulting in division of net profits and therefore the amount paid to the agents could not be claimed by the assessee <ORG> as a deduction under xv of the Act as it was not incurred for the purpose of the business or for earning profits <ORG> held that the mere fact that the agents agreed to share the profits and the losses would not take the case of the assessee beyond the ambit of xv of the Act in order to show that the payments made to the agents were not expenses incurred for the purpose of the business In support of the appeal Mr <NAME> the learned standing counsel for the <ORG> submitted the following two points before us In the first place it was submitted that there being an express provision in the agreement dated October by which the agents agreed to share losses which was a provision peculiar to the present transaction and was not at all covered by any authority cited before the <ORG> or <ORG> that itself was proof positive of the fact that the transaction amounted to a joint venture with a view to division of profits and It was argued that <ORG> had exceeded its jurisdiction in travelling beyond the agreed statement of the case framed by the <ORG> and had relied on certain materials which were not at all found by the <ORG> in its order nor were those materials mentioned in the statement of the case A number of other cases have also been cited at the <ORG> and we shall refer to the same after marshalling the facts found in the present case that in order to determine the question of reason ableness of the expenditure the test of commercial expediency would have to be adjudged from the point of view of the businessman and not of the Income tax Depart I ment With this preface we now proceed to deal with the facts of the present case on the basis of which the questions of law referred to <ORG> and answered in favour of the assessee <ORG> arise It was perhaps for this reason that the assessee <ORG> entered into an agreement with the new selling agents Saligram Premnath who were prepared to The main question to be determined is as to whether or not the agreement dated October read as a whole amounts to a joint venture for the purpose of division of profits In order to decide this question it may be necessary to refer to some important portions of the second agreement which alone is relevant for the purpose of deciding this point The conduct of the agents in sharing half of the net profits does not appear to us to be consistent with the payments made to the agents for services rendered We might further mention here that the provision in the agreement regarding sharing of the loss is absolutely peculiar to this particular agreement and there is not a single authority which has in spite of such a provision held that the transaction does not amount to a joint venture or a division of profits In these circumstances therefore if we construe the agreement as a sort of a joint venture or a transaction like a partnership which has been given the form and appearance of a contract of agency the law must have its course That it seems to me would be a real agreement for division of profits because there would be one profit fund only It is true that in the aforesaid case on the facts found the Court held that the transaction did not amount to a joint venture but it was clearly pointed out in the judgment that there is a very thin line of distinction between a contract for payment of a share of profits simpliciter and a payment of remuneration which is deductible in truth from the profits divisible We therefore find ourselves in complete agreement with the observations made by <ORG> which aptly apply to the facts of the present case on the basis of the various clauses of the agreement dated October What had happened in <NAME> case was that the assessee was an employee of the firm earning a particular salary Finally not only there was no provision in <NAME> case under which the trust was to share the losses but there was an ex press provision to the contrary namely that the trust was not liable for any loss On the loan advanced to the assessee and a percentage in the profits of the business would be quite consistent with a remuneration in lieu of services lent and would certainly amount to an expenditure incurred by the assessee wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business which was conducted by the assessee The same however cannot be said of the present case It was on the peculiar facts of the <NAME> case that this <ORG> observed as follows on the facts proved in the present case the trust agreed to finance the business of the appellant on the terms set out in the agreement and there is nothing to show that he could have made any better arrangements or would not have last the contract if he had failed to enter into the agreement i the agreement to pay the amounts in dispute There fore in a commercial sense the payments were an expenditure wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the business Great stress was laid by counsel for the assessee <ORG> on the fact that this <ORG> could not go behind the commercial expediency which had to be determined from the point of view of a businessman In our opinion neither the High Court nor <ORG> has applied the proper legal test in this case ITR AIR SC in applying the test of commercial expediency for determining whether an expenditure was wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the business reasonableness of the expenditure has to be adjudged from the point of view of the businessman and not of <ORG> The <ORG> had interpreted the agreement keeping into account the tests of commercial expediency and we find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by the <ORG> While the standing counsel for the <ORG> has admitted that the Company was running at some loss there was no evidence that the Company was in such a bad shape that it had to get rid of the first selling agents because the selling agents were causing embarrassment to it <ORG> further found that the promoter of the assessee Company Mr <NAME> had a stature which enabled him to borrow loans from the Banks on personal security and as he died in an air crash the credit of the Company went down and it was not abl to raise money from the Banks There is absolutely no warrant for these facts referred to by <ORG> which are neither mentioned in the agreed statement of the case submitted by the <ORG> to <ORG> nor in the order of the <ORG> It is for the <ORG> to find facts and it is for <ORG> and this <ORG> to lay down the law applicable to the facts found When the question referred to <ORG> speaks of on the facts and circumstances of the case it means on the facts and circumstances found by the <ORG> and not on the facts and circumstances as may be found by <ORG> This case however was decided on its own facts and has no application to the facts in the instant case It has to he emphasised that unless there is a limitation put by the law on the amount of expenditure a lesser amount than the amount expended cannot be allowed merely because the assessing authority thinks that the assessee could have managed by paying a < lesser amount as a prudent businessman Here also the observations were confined only to the question that the test of prudence was to be determined from the point of view of the businessman Some other decisions were cited at the <ORG> but they have no bearing on the issue and it is not necessary for us to refer to them What is therefore important to us is that no decision has been cited before us which takes the view that even though under the contract of agency the selling agents who agreed to make substantial investments in the assessee <ORG> and got interest on the loans apart from the commission they also shared profit to the extent of as also loss to that extent and had complete controlling power in the manufacturing programme or the sale of the products and yet the transaction would be one of agency simpliciter and not a joint Venture This is therefore nothing but a joint venture to divide the profits after the same are ascertained and cannot in any sense be deemed to be expenses incurred by the assessee <ORG> for the purpose of its business or for that matter for earning profits It is claimed for the company that when it makes over to <ORG> their half of the net profits it is making an expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of earning its own profits For the reasons given above the appeals are allowed and the judgment of <ORG> is set aside and that of the <ORG> is restored and the two questions referred to <ORG> are answer ed against the assessee <ORG> and in favour of the <ORG>
