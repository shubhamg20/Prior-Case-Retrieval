No decree in favour of the deceased respondent was passed in this case by the lower Court If any decree will be passed here in favour of the plaintiff that will alone be binding against the defendants respondents on record here and will in no way affect the heirs of deceased respondents and There was a decree in favour of the plaintiff both for possession and certain amount of mesne profits Both the cases are distinguishable from the facts of the present case where no decree fixing any liability on any of the defendants has been passed and therefore there is no chance of any conflict in the decrees if the appeal as decided on merit in favour of the appellant The question that really arises for consideration can be framed as follows According to the allegation of the plaintiff there was a large number of joint tort feasors That is not the same as the plaintiff choosing some of the joint tort feasors out of those whom he brought on record The judgment delivered by the late Sir <NAME> in that case is a short one where it was held that in the suit which was framed as a suit for damages for tort against all wrong doers it would not be open to the plaintiff appellant to contend that he could proceed against some of them at his choice in appeal That principle completely applies to the present case No reason of course has been given in that judgment but it appears to be quite obvious In my view once the plaintiff chooses to bring on record a number of defendants as wrong doers for a claim of damages against them he will have to proceed against all of them until the matter is adjudicated finally one way or the other The effect of the decree passed by the trial court against the plaintiff was that the plaintiff was not a raiyat and whatever interest there was in the defendants in regard to their alleged settlement was not affected in any way There one of the defendants had died without substitution of his heirs and the suit itself was dismissed on that ground as it was held to have abated I would therefore hold that in view of the order of abatement passed by this court on the nd December as against the respondents and the whole appeal in the circumstan ces of the case will be treated to have abated and cannot be proceeded with
