Whether prisoner has fundamental right Validity of live wire mechanism atop jail wall Posting Police out side jail Validity of The petitioners have filed the present writ petitions for the reliefs that the armed Police Guards posted around the Jail should be removed and that live wire electrical mechanism fixed on top of jail wall should be dismantled It was contended by the petitioners that under section of the Prisons Act prison includes all lands and buildings appurtenant thereto Naxalite prisoners were segregated and inhuman treatment was meted out to them as if they were inmates of a fascist concentration camp It was contended by the respondent that the usual watch and ward staff of the Jail having been found to be inadequate services of the <ORG> force had to be requisitioned to guard the jail from outside The wire has no direct contact with the wall and there is no possibility of the electrical current leaking through the wall A prisoner is deprived of fundamental rights like the right to move freely throughout the territory of India or the right to practice a profession But other freedoms like the right to acquire hold or dispose of property are available to the prisoner that he shall not be deprived of his life or the personal liberty except according to the procedure established bylaw Therefore There are subtle forms of punishment to whichconvicts and under trial prisoners are sometimes subjected but it must be realize that these barbarous relics of a bygone era offend against the letter andspirit of our Constitution if it violates the fundamental rights it cannot be justified on the ground of its being reasonable There is no possibility that the petitioners will come into contact with the electrical device in the normal pursuit of their daily chores There is also no possibility that any other person in discharge of his lawful functions will come into contact with the same <NAME> the petitioner in Writ Petition No of is undergoing the sentences of years and year awarded to him in two sessions cases Mr <NAME> who appears on behalf of the petitioners contends that even the discipline of the prison must have the authority of law and that there should be a sort of Iron curtain between the prisoners and the police so that convicts and under trial prisoners may be truly free from the influence and tyranny of the police A compulsion under the authority of law following upon a conviction to live in a prison house entails to by its own force the deprivation of fundamental freedoms like the right to move freely throughout the territory of India or the right to practice a profession A man of profession would thus stand stripped of his right to hold consultations while serving out his sentence But the Constitution guarantees other freedoms like the right to acquire hold and dispose of property for the exercise of which incarceration can be no impediment Likewise even a convict is entitled to the precious right guaranteed by Article of the Constitution that he shall not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The request having been rejected the detenu filed a writ peti tion in <ORG> which allowed the petition In an appeal filed in this <ORG> by <ORG> it was held that though the conditions of detention under rule of the Defence of India Rules were the same as under the Bombay Conditions of Detention Order which laid down conditions regulating the restrictions on the liberty of a detenu it could not be said that the order of conferred only certain privileges on the detenu the detenu could be starved to death if there was no condition providing for giving food to the detenu Counsel for the petitioners complained bitterly against the segregation of Naxalite prisoners in a quarantine and the inhuman treatment meted out to them as if they were inmates of a fascist concentration camp No person not even a prisoner can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The American Constitution by the th and th Amendments provides inter alia that no person shall be deprived of life liberty or property without the due process of law Explaining the scope of this provision <NAME> observed in <NAME> Illinois and that the term life means something more than mere animal existence and the inhibition against its deprivation extends to all those limits and faculties by which life is enjoyed But on a perusal of the affidavit of the rd respondent we are not satisfied that the allegations made by the petitioners are true though we do not think that the rosy picture drawn by the rd Respondent of life in the Visakhapatnam Central Jail can too readily be accepted We are also not prepared to dismiss as wholly untrue the reply of the petitioners to the rd Respondent counter affidavit that there is difficulty even in getting a packet of powder for a rickety carrom board that the radio net work consists of a silent museum piece that the supply of musical instruments consists of an abandoned non speaking harmonium and a set of dilapidated drums and that all the music that is there is provided by an army of mobile mosquitoes These however are matters of reform and though they ought to receive priority in our Constitutional scheme there denial may not necessarily constitute an encroachment on the right guaranteed by Article of the Constitution We cannot do better than say that the directive principle contained in Article of the Constitution that The State shall make provision for securing just and humane conditions of work may benevolently be extended to living conditions in jails There are subtle forms of punishment to which convicts and under trial prisoners are sometimes subjected out it must be realized that these barbarous relics of a bygone era offend against the letter and spirit of our Constitution For want of Satisfactory proof we hesitate to accept the contention of the petitioners that the treatment meted out to them is in violation of their right to life and personal liberty Such instructions are neither law within the meaning of Article a nor are they procedure established by law within the meaning of Article of the Constitution are right in their contention that the mechanism constitutes an infringement of any of the funda mental rights available to them they would be entitled to the relief sought by them that the mechanism to be dismantled The wire has no direct contact with the wall and there is no possibility of the electrical current leaking through the wall There is thus no possibility that the petitioners will come into contact with the electrical device in the normal pursuit of their daily chores There is also no possibility that any other person in the discharge of his lawful functions or pursuits will come into contact with the same Sub section of section authorises the person making the arrest to use all means necessary to effect the arrest while sub section provides that Nothing in this section gives a right to cause the death of a person who is not accused of an offence punishable with death or with imprisonment for life Section deals with the power on escape to pursue and retake the prisoner Apart from this the installation of the high voltage wire does not offend against the command of section even on the assumption that the sub section covers the rearrest of a prisoner who has escaped from lawful custody
