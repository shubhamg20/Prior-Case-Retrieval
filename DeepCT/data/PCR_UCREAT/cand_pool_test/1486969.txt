The Article mandates that no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law Life or personal liberty includes a right to live with human dignity There is an inbuilt guarantee against torture or assault by the <ORG> or its functionaries Articles and of the Constitution further manifest the constitutional protection extended to every citizen and the guarantees held out for making life meaningful and not a mere animal existence The concern which was shown in <NAME> case supra more than two decades back seems to have fallen to leaf ears and the situation does not seem to be showing any noticeable change The exaggerated adherence to and insistence upon the establishment of proof beyond every reasonable doubt by the prosecution at times even when the prosecuting agencies are themselves fixed in the dock ignoring the ground realities the fact situation and the peculiar circumstances of a given case as in the present case often results in miscarriage of justice and makes the justice delivery system suspect and vulnerable In the ultimate analysis the society suffers and a criminal gets encouraged Tortures in police custody which of late are on the increase receive encouragement by this type of an unrealistic approach at times of the courts as well because it reinforces the belief in the mind of the police that no harm would come to them if one prisoner dies in the lock up because there would hardly be any evidence available to the prosecution to directly implicate them with the torture The courts must not lose sight of the fact that death in police custody is perhaps one of the worst kind of crimes in a civilized society governed by the rule of law and poses a serious threat to an orderly civilized society Disturbed by this situation <ORG> in its th Report recommended amendments to the Indian Evidence Act in short the Evidence Act so as to provide that in the prosecution of a police officer for an alleged offence of having caused bodily injuries to a person while in police custody if there is evidence that the injury was caused during the period when the person was in the police custody the court may presume that the injury was caused by the police officer having the custody of that person during that period unless the police officer proves to the contrary But at the same time there seems to be disturbing trend of increase in cases where false accusations of custodial torture are made trying to take advantage of the serious concern shown and the stern attitude reflected by the courts while dealing with custodial violence It needs to be carefully examined whether the allegations of custodial violence are genuine or are sham attempts to gain undeserved benefit masquerading as victims of custodial violence The evidence of PWs and when read together improbabilises the stand that they had seen the beatings alleged to have been given by the accused to the deceased In the first report there was no mention about the assaults on The doctor who had examined the deceased had noted the medical history of the accused but the name of the accused was not specifically indicated though the accused and the deceased were known to each other intimately In support of the appeal Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel submitted that the case involved police officials and the evidence brought on record by the complainant should not have been lightly brushed aside by conclusions which are not supportable in law In response to the stands taken by the complainant Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the accused respondent No submitted that the complainant has not come to the <ORG> with clean hands Accused and the deceased were friends and there is no reason as to why he would assault the deceased and instead he would have tried to protect him in the connected case where the deceased was an accused In the complaint petition there is one significant statement about one <NAME> witnessing the assaults on Though his name is indicated in the list of witnesses strangely his evidence has not been tendered by examining him as a witness Though a writ petition was filed by the complainant before <ORG> in that there was no allegation of the torture If the witnesses knew that it was the accused who had assaulted the deceased there was no necessity of asking the deceased as to how he came to be injured It needs no reiteration that if it is brought to the notice of the police that somebody had beaten the deceased the FIR was to be registered This witness also stated that he had also made enquiries from the accused and other police officials and tried to obtain their version The witness stated that he had personally questioned the accused and two other PSI and he perused the papers medical certificate and station diary etc It is a fairly well settled position in law that even at the time of taking cognizance the <ORG> is not required to find out which particular person is the offender and the cognizance is taken of offence If there was inaction to deal with information lodged with the police in October there was no reason for the complainant to wait for more than one year to approach the <ORG> by making a private complaint In the complaint petition itself it has been stated that legal advise was sought in the matter immediately after the occurrence and the legal notices were sent by advocates Therefore it has to be appraised in each case as to what extent the evidence is worthy of acceptance and merely because in some respects the <ORG> considers the same to be insufficient for placing reliance on the testimony of a witness it does not necessarily follow as a matter of law that it must be disregarded in all respects as well There is a requirement under Section of the Code which deals with a right of an arrested person to bring to the notice of the <ORG> about torture or assault The provision provides for an examination of an arrested person by medical practitioner at the request of the arrested person and it is a right conferred on the arrested person We need not go into this aspect in detail because <ORG> itself has permitted the accused to lead rebuttal evidence A close reading of the decision shows that it was referred in a different factual context and on the facts of the case it was held that the production of the original post mortem report and the examination of the doctor was necessary As rightly submitted by learned counsel for the accused <NAME> has not been examined and there is no material to otherwise link the accused with the alleged beatings on The oral dying declaration also is unbelievable if the PWs and had really seen the assaults they would not have asked the deceased as to how he sustained injuries If none of these injuries was sustained by the deceased in police custody there was no necessity of bringing the deceased to the hospital on at a CW has admitted that he had taken the deceased for examination by DW The Court is not merely to act as a tape recorder recording evidence overlooking the object of trial i to get at the truth and oblivious to the active role to be played for which there is not only ample scope but sufficient powers conferred under the Code It is as much the duty of the prosecutor as of the <ORG> to ensure that full and material facts are brought on record so that there might not be miscarriage of justice If on further enquiry and on the basis of materials collected it appears that the accused who is being acquitted had a role to play it shall be open to the authorities to initiate proceedings for action and the same shall be taken notwithstanding the order of acquittal passed by the High <ORG> and affirmed by us This is so because on the materials now placed on record the acquittal was justified
