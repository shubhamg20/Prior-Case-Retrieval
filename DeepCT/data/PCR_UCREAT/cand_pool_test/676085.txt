This is a second appeal filed by the plaintiff decree holder against the order passed on his No of in No of on the file of the Deputy Collector of Bandar There is no appearance for the respondent judgment debtor in this appeal The facts are briefly as follows No of was filed for the recovery of arrears of rent under Section of the Madras Estates Land Act of and a decree was passed in plaintiff favour on th September I am in entire agreement with that view for there was no justification for the dismissal of the execution petition for the non filing of a fresh petition for the appointment of a guardian when the petition filed for that purpose was still pending and no orders had been passed on it It seems to me that the learned District Judge has misconstrued Sections and of the Estates Land Act Section provides that <ORG> and not <ORG> has jurisdiction to try and hear all suits and applications of the nature specified in Parts A and of the Schedule and the decrees and orders passed in such suits and applications shall be subject to appeals as provided in the sixth column Section enacts that subject to the other provisions of this Act and subject to the modifications and additions mentioned in that section itself the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code shall apply to all suits appeals and other proceedings under this Act It is not an application of the nature specified in Part of the Schedule and therefore an order passed on it is not subject to an appeal as provided in the sixth column of Part of the Schedule There is no provision in the Act either expressly or impliedly prohibiting an appeal against an order on an execution application passed by <ORG> Section of the new Code which corresponds to Section of the old Code of is not one of the sections mentioned in Sub clause a of Section of the Act There is no doubt that the order dismissing No of which was filed under Order Rule of the Civil Procedure Code is an order falling under Section of the Code Such an order could be a decree as defined in Clause of Section of the Code and therefore an appeal lies under Section as also a second appeal under Section of the Code Consequently by virtue of Section of the Code the appeal lies to <ORG> against an order passed in execution of that decree As I have pointed out above that section does not cover the present case at all and therefore there would be no violation of the provisions of that section if an appeal is allowed in the present case By virtue of Section of the Estates Land Act the provisions of Sections and of the Civil Procedure Code apply to a petition filed for the execution of a decree given by <ORG> in a suit filed under Section of the Estates Land Act The costs of the first and second appeals will abide the final result of the petition
