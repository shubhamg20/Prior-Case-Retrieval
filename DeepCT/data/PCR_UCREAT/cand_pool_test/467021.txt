Civil Writ Jurisdiction Case No of has been filed by the petitioners for quashing an order of <ORG> dated the nd October enhancing the rate of royalty payable by the petitioners in respect of the right granted to them for collection and exploitation of Sal seeds from the forest area belonging to <ORG> The petitioners approached <ORG> for grant of a lease in favour of the petitioner for collection and exploitation of Sal seeds a forest produce The other clauses of the deed make provision for other conditions which had to be performed and fulfilled by the petitioner Clause which is the last clause of the agreement lays down that it had been mutually agreed between the parties to the said agreement that in the event of any dispute or question arising whether during the continuance or after the termination hereof with regard to the terms of these presents or the construction or meaning hereof or of any part of provision hereof or as to the performance of any act hereby required to be done or as to any other matter or thing in connection herewith the decision of the Chief Conservator of Forest Bihar upon the matter of such dispute or question shall be final and binding on the parties hereto In pursuance of the said notice the representative of the petitioner appeared before the said Committee and pointed out that the rate of Royalty which the petitioner was paying was much higher than the rate prevalent in the neighbouring States and as such there was no occasion for revision of the rate of royalty Further case of the petitioner is that a notice dated the th November Annexure to the writ application was issued to the petitioner asking it to show cause as to why the lease in question be not terminated for violation of the terms of the said lease Counter affidavits have been filed on behalf of <ORG> and the Chief Conservator of Forests justifying their action that is the revision of the rate of royalty and later the termination of the lease in question Different breaches of the terms of the agreement have also been pointed out in the said counter affidavits and it has been stated that the petitioner was given ample opportunity to show cause in respect of the said breaches and its explanation having been found to be not satisfactory the lease itself was terminated after a careful consideration of the matter by <ORG> Regarding the grievance of the petitioner fixing the enhanced rate of royalty retrospectively it was pointed out on behalf of the respondent that the first cycle of three years came to an end on the st December and according to the terms of the agreement the rate could have been revised at any time after that date Dr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the petitioner first submitted that in view of the proclamation of Emergency in accordance with Article of the Constitution and issuance of the Presidential Order Under Article the right to move any <ORG> for the enforcement of rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution and all proceedings pending in any <ORG> for enforcement of the rights so mentioned are to remain suspended for the period during which the proclamation has to remain in force Learned counsel submitted that the result is that the two writ applications filed on behalf of the petitioners in which the said rights are involved will be deemed to have been suspended for the period during which the proclamation remains in force and as such this court has no jurisdiction to hear or pass any orders in respect of these writ applications at present When the learned counsel was called upon by the <ORG> to take a clear stand on the point as to whether the writ applications are only for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution or on other grounds learned counsel said that the case of the petitioners has been put forward on alternative grounds Firstly the petitioners seek the enforcement of the rights guaranteed to them under Article of the Constitution and in the alternative they are questioning the validity of the impugned orders and decision bereft of the rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution According to learned counsel because of the Presidential Order when all such proceedings pending in any <ORG> for enforcement of the rights so mentioned are to remain suspended it will not mean suspension of the effect of the orders of stay passed by this court at the time of admission and it will be in force On this plea being taken on behalf of the petitioners applications have been filed on behalf of the respondent State making a prayer that this court should either hold that in view of the aforesaid provision under Article of the Constitution the orders of stay passed by this court in these two writ applications are also under suspension and of no effect or if this court is of the view that they are in force then in view of the changed circumstances under which the writ applications cannot be heard and disposed of this Court should vacate the orders of stay passed at the time of admission Relevant portion of Article of the Constitution reads as follows Where a Proclamation of Emergency is in force the President may by order declare that the right to move any Court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the order and all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned shall remain suspended for the period during which the proclamation is in force or for such shorter period as may be specified in the order Since the object of Article is to suspend the rights of the citizens to move any court the consequence of the Presidential Order may be that any proceeding which may be pending at the date of the order remains suspended during the time that the order is in operation and may be revived when the said Order ceases to be operative and fresh proceedings cannot be taken by a citizen after the order has been issued because the Order takes away the right to move any court and during the operation of the Order the said right cannot be exercised by instituting a fresh proceeding contrary to the Order To me it appears that this argument on the basis of the Presidential Orders has been raised on behalf of the petitioners to avail of the orders of stay passed by this Court which authorise them to collect and exploit sal seeds during the pendency of the writ application in spite of their lease having been terminated by the <ORG> In that view of the matter it is difficult to hold that during this period when the proceedings themselves are suspended the orders of stay passed in the said proceedings will be deemed to be in force But in the instant case the rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the terms of the agreement as incorporated in the deed of lease An nexure On behalf of the <ORG> it has been asserted that the actions covered by the terms of the agreement and before revising the rate of royalty and before terminating the lease the petitioner was given notices to show cause The representative of the petitioner even appeared before <ORG> to place his own view points on the subject and as such in my opinion there is no question of violation of the principles of natural justice The impugned action can be held to be invalid if a court comes to the conclusion that the actions are not sanctioned by the terms of the agreement Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners submitted that en the facts and in the circumstances of the case there has been no contravention of the terms of the agreement by the petitioner and as such the order of ter mination of the lease is void According to the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners the impugned actions are in exercise of executive powers by the <ORG> under Article of the Constitution which are amenable to the jurisdiction of this court Such disputes can be put under three groups for the purpose of answering the question i Where a petitioner makes a grievance of breach of promise on the part of the <ORG> in cases wherein assurance or promise made by the <ORG> he has acted to his prejudice and predicament but the agreement is short of a contract within the meaning of Article of the Constitution ii Where the contract entered into between the person aggrieved and the <ORG> is in exercise of a power under certain Act or Rules framed thereunder and the petitioner alleges a breach on the part of the <ORG> and iii Where the contract entered into between the <ORG> and the person aggrieved is non statutory and purely contractual and the rights and liabilities of the parties are governed by the terms of the contract and the petitioner complains about breach of such contract by the <ORG> On the other hand in case falling under category iii where there is no question of exercise of any statutory power and the rights of the parties flow from mere terms of the contract entered into by the authorities of the <ORG> a party to such agreement should not be allowed to invoke the writ jurisdiction of this <ORG> for the purpose of finding out as to whether there has been a breach of contract on the part of the <ORG> or on the part of such person There is no question of infraction of any rules or statutes Learned counsel for the petitioner could not urge that the lease for collection and exploitation of Sal seeds had been granted to the petitioner in exercise of any statutory power it was a contract pure and simple Clause of the contract under consideration made a provision for determination of the agreement by the <ORG> at any time by a notice In writing to the petitioner if there had been any breach of any of the terms and conditions of the lease per se there was a right to terminate the lease under certain conditions being not fulfilled Clause made a provision similar to arbitration clause where the decision of the chief conservator of <ORG>s over any dispute in connection with the said agreement was to be final It was held by <ORG> that this order of black listing had the effect of depriving the person of equality of opportunity in matter of public contract and in such cases when the <ORG> acts to the prejudice of a person it has to be supported by legality In that case there was no question of breach of the terms of a contract In my opinion <ORG> never purported to lay down that breaches of contracts irrespective of their nature will be amenable to the jurisdiction of this court merely because one of the parties to such contracts is the <ORG> In my opinion there is no merit in these two writ applications No case was brought to our notice either of <ORG> or any of <ORG> in India which has taken the view that before exercising the right or option to terminate an agreement or lease in terms thereof contracting party must be given an opportunity to have his say in the matter Giving the opinion of the <ORG> Lord <NAME> said In their Lordships opinion there are three matters which must always be borne in mind when considering whether the principle should be applied or not In my view unless the <ORG> is of the opinion that the occa sion or circumstances for the exercise of power is such that it would be unfair or unjust to the party affected by action taken to be visited by the consequences thereof unless it had been given an opportunity to have his say in the matter the principles of natural justice are not attracted There is nothing unjust or unfair in a party terminating a contract even without giving the other party an opportunity to have his say in the matter on the basis of the express right conferred by the contract itself Further it is to be observed that when a right to terminate a lease on the ground of the existence of conditions which give a right of termination has been exercised it is open to the party exercising the option to justify the action taken if properly challenged not only on the grounds which were under contemplation when the action was taken but also on other grounds which are available in law to the contracting party in terms of the agreement Even if it be accepted that in cases of pure contract there is power to interfere in the exercise of writ jurisdiction the power in my view must be confined to cases where the action under challenge is mala fide or so arbitrary as to shock the conscience of the <ORG>
