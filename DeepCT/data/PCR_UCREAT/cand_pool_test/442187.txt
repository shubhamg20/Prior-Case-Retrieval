This appeal by special leave has been preferred by the State of Uttar Pradesh against the judgment and order of <ORG> dated October i in Confirmation Reference No of and Criminal Appeal No of acquitting respondents to in respect of the offences said to have been committed by them under Sections and read with of the I The prosecution case as revealed toy the evidence led at the trial may briefly be stated as follows The deceased <NAME> and his father <NAME> as also all the five respondent accused have been the residents of village Karmar Oral It appears that there was professional rivalry between <NAME> and <NAME> on the one hand and <NAME> A on the other and for quite some time prior to the incident in question which took place on July the villagers of Karmer had stopped engaging the services of <NAME> A for purohiti work and entrusted the same to decease <NAME> and his father <NAME> and therefore <NAME> A started bearing grudge and ill will to wards <NAME> and <NAME> It appears that prior to the occurrence on July there were proceedings under Section Criminal between the two parties of <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> A had on December lodged a complaint under Section I On that day deceased <NAME> and his father <NAME> had gone to one <NAME> for reciting <NAME> at his place <NAME> carried <NAME> home on the quilt but on the way he breathed his last He first went to his son <NAME> place and dictated the report of incident to <NAME> and after going to the Oral Police Station he lodged that written report I Exhibit After holding inquiry <NAME> A committed the respondents accused to <ORG> on to stand their trial for offences under Sections read with and I At the trial in support of its case the prosecution examined in all witnesses out of whom six were material witnesses being eye witnesses to the occurrence namely <NAME> the complainant and the father of the deceased <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Since no weapon of offence fire arms was recovered there was no occasion to examine any ballistic expert The various steps taken during the investigation were deposed to by Inspector <NAME> Out of six eye witnesses <NAME> was declared hostile by the prosecution itself the names of <NAME> and <NAME> were not mentioned as witnesses in the First Information Report while <NAME> was found to have scant respect for truth and therefore the learned trial Judge discarded the testimony of these four witnesses He therefore convicted <NAME> A <NAME> A and <NAME> A under Section for the murder of <NAME> and sentenced each to death each of them was also convicted for rioting under Section and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for two years He convicted <NAME> A and <NAME> A under Section read with Section and sentenced them to life imprisonment each of them was also convicted under Section and sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for one year each one of them was also convicted under Section for having removed the rifle and belt of cartridges respectively from <NAME> and sentenced to further rigorous imprisonment for two years each the substantive sentences being directed to run concurrently In allowing the appeal and rejecting the Confirmation Reference <ORG> came to the conclusion that the prosecution had failed to establish its case against the accused principally on three grounds that there was some delay in lodging the First Information Report that the two eye witnesses namely <NAME> and <NAME> on whom the learned trial Judge had relied were partisan witnesses and that the version given by the eye witnesses did not tally with the medical evidence The State of has come up in appeal to this <ORG> by special leave that was granted by this <ORG> on August Secondly he contended that none of the three reasons given by <ORG> tor discarding the evidence of the two eye witnesses <NAME> and <NAME> is warranted or substantiated by the material on the record He also urged that <ORG> erred in doubting the presence of <NAME> at the time of the occurrence on flimsy grounds and erroneously regarded <NAME> as a partisan witness and assuming that he was a partisan witness his evidence should have been scrutinised with great caution bearing in mind his partisan character but that by itself could not be regarded as sufficient reason to discard his evidence He therefore urged that there was no justification for <ORG> to interfere with the appreciation of the prosecution evidence done by the learned <NAME> Judge as well as his conclusions and therefore the convictions as recorded by the learned <NAME> Judge against all the respondent accused should be restored and the acquittal directed by <ORG> be set aside It is true that this Court will normally be slow in interfering with an acquittal recorded by <ORG> but as we will point out presently we find considerable force and sub stance in the above contentions urged by Mr <NAME> before us in support of this appeal Working under a pall of fear it would be natural for him to have his father <NAME> with him whenever he had occasions to go out for recitation of Katha or rendering any other Purohiti service It is based on the fact that <NAME> A had lodged a complaint at the Police Station Orai in December against <NAME> <NAME> and others under Section I but nothing had been brought on record to show as to what transpired after the lodging of such complaint whether <NAME> or <NAME> had been sent for by the police in connection with that complaint or had been warned by the police or not for ought one knows being a non cognizable complaint no action might have been taken by the Police and the complainant might have been referred to Court In the absence of proper material bringing home the knowledge of such a complaint to the witness having been brought on record it would be difficult to come to the conclusion that <NAME> knew that <NAME> was antagonistic to him or that <NAME> belonged to the opposite party and had come to give false evidence against the accused particularly <NAME> In other words there was no clinching material on the record on the basis of which witness <NAME> could be classified as partisan witness At the place where <NAME> had fallen he had received injuries there and blood had fallen on the ground He further stated that a quilt was brought from the Baithak of Raghubar on which <NAME> was laid and they all carried him to his house but on way he died On examining his evidence from this angle we do not find any grave infirmity which would go to discredit him Mr <NAME> counsel for the respondents accused leveled two or three criticisms against the testimony of this witness It was urged that this witness knew Tooti Phooti Hindi had not passed any Sanskrit examination and was not versed in the recitation of Katha and hence would not have accompanied his son on that day and therefore not a natural witness to the occurrence secondly there was delay in lodging the I which was done at when the incident had occurred at on and he could have covered the distance of seven miles from Karmer to Orai within much lesser time thirdly there is one omission if his evidence is compared to what he stated to the police or deposed in <ORG> Having regard to the explanation given by the witness it is impossible to agree with the criticism made by the defence and which found favour with <ORG> that there was delay in lodging the First Information Report It was also suggested to him that the I was lodged after consultation or confabulation but he denied it and no material is brought on record to render it reasonably probable As regards the third criticism it may be stated that while deposing in <ORG> he had omitted to state that a quilt was brought to the scene of incident from <NAME> place and that they carried <NAME> home after putting him on that quilt He was also questioned with regard to the actual assault on <NAME> and he gave certain details in his cross examination which do not find place in his First Information Report As regards the first criticism we have discussed in the earlier part of this judgment as to why this witness cannot be regarded as a partisan witness for want of clinching material being brought on record but even if it were assumed that the witness is to be regarded as a partisan one there is no material elicited in his cross examination which would go to show that he is an untruthful witness It appears that in his evidence the witness claimed to be a resident of Karmer whereas in his police statement he has stated that he was originally a resident of Orai and that during the last harvesting season he had gone to Karmer and had since then been doing labour work at the place of <NAME> That he had stated so to the police has been proved by Inspector <NAME> but the witness when confronted by it stated that he could not say why such a wrong statement came to be recorded However in view of the facts that the witness had purchased a house at Karmer from one <NAME> some four or five years prior to his giving evidence that he was actually staying in that house that his name had been included as a voter in the <ORG> of that village and that he had actually voted from that village at the general elections that were held in it does appear that the witness has been a resident of Karmar from the time he purchased the house in that village and in fact it is quite possible that before purchasing a house in Karmer and going to live there he might be originally a resident of Orai In other words there is really no contradiction as such between his statement to the police and his evidence at the trial In our view the testimony of the aforesaid two eye witnesses inspires confidence since both of them were natural witnesses to the occurrence and had deposed to what they had actually seen Besides the above injuries the Medical Officer also noticed that there was a communited fracture on the right humerus as also a communited fracture on the hip bone under injury Nos and Even so the High Court has taken the view that the prosecution version as given by these two witnesses does not fit in with the injuries as noted in the post mortem report If the aforesaid reasoning is carefully scrutinised it will appear clear that quite a few assumptions have been made by <ORG> and the reasoning also fails to lake into account the alternate possibilities that were elicited by the defence itself in the cross examination of the Medical Officer and it is by adopting such process of reasoning that <ORG> has come to the conclusion that the prosecution version does not fit in with the medical evidence After all the incident of firing upon the deceased had taken place in broad day light at about during the course of which the three assailants had used fire arms namely two guns and one pistol and such an incident had been witnessed by the two prosecution witnesses namely <NAME> and <NAME> from the close quarters and their evidence substantially tallies with the medical evidence on record especially in the light of the alternate possibilities elicited from the medical officer in his cross examination by the defence it self Having regard to the above discussion it will appear clear that none of the reasons given by <ORG> for rejecting the prosecution case and acquitting the accused is substantiated by material on record In the first place there is no delay in lodging the I as has been suggested by <ORG> Mr <NAME> appearing for the respondents accused faintly argued that the prosecution ought to have examined <NAME> to prove that both the father and the son had gone to his place for reciting the Katha especially when the defence had suggested in the cross examination of <NAME> that neither the father nor the son had gone for reciting the Katha at <NAME> place but it did not and therefore an adverse inference should be drawn against the prosecution on that account We have already stated that on account of the fear or apprehension of ganger to his life <NAME> was always carrying a rifle and a belt of cartridges with him whenever he went out and it was natural for his father to be with him and in our view such a contention which was raised before the learned Sessions Judge had been rightly rejected by him In the first place he has pointed out that the writ petition to support which the affidavit was said to have been sworn was presented before <ORG> on July which was again withdrawn or taken back from <ORG> on July itself and there was no such urgency as to have the affidavit sworn by the accused No before the Oath Commissioner Shri <NAME> in the office of <NAME> Advocate long after the office hours at on July Kha which was to be sworn was first prepared in the name of <NAME> the uncle of accused No and not in the name of accused No but later on it appears that the name of <NAME> was struck out and the name of accused No <NAME> was inserted Thirdly the actual time when the affidavit was sworn in as mentioned in the affidavit itself shows some alteration made therein it appears that at first was written in the affidavit but later on the figure was changed to figure in a clever manner which alteration becomes clear if the figure is viewed with the help of a magnifying glass Shri <NAME> then stated that in the absence of the above register he made an entry pertaining to the affidavit in question on loose papers and that even those loose papers had been misplaced all other convictions recorded against all the respondents accused under various counts as well as the sentences imposed upon them by the learned Sessions Judge on those counts are restored
