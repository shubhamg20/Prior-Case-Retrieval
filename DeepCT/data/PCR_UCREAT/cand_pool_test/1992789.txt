There were various claims to her estate but this appeal is concerned only with the claim of the first respondent <NAME> on the one hand and two brothers <NAME> and <NAME> through whom the appellants claim on the other There was an appeal to <ORG> and the decision of the Subordinate Judge was affirmed Letters of administration were granted to the first respondent and he obtained possession of the property After their deaths their heirs seem to have sold their alleged shares in the property to the present appellants who in November on the eve of limitation instituted the somewhat speculative suit out of which this appeal has arisen They prayed for a declaration that <NAME> the first respondent was not the sister son of <NAME> husband and the establishment of their title through <NAME> and <NAME> with possession and mesne profits this is made clear especially in these words of Sir <NAME> at The binding force of such a judgment in such a case as the present depends not upon It appears to their Lordships worth while to repeat what was said by Sir <NAME> in delivering the judgment of the <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> I A Bom in view of the arguments addressed to them their Lordships desire to emphasize that the rule of res judicata while founded on ancient precedent is dictated by a wisdom which is for all time It has been well said declared Lord <NAME> interest reipublicae ut sit finis litium otherwise great oppression might be done under colour and pretence of law <NAME> a Though the rule of the Code may be traced to an English source it embodies a doctrine in no way opposed to the spirit of the law as expounded by the Hindu commentators <NAME> and <NAME> include the plea of a former judgment among those allowed by law each citing for this purpose the text of <NAME> who describes the plea thus If a person though defeated at law sue again he should be answer ad You were defeated formerly This is called the plea of former judgment See the Mitakshara Vyavahava bk And so the ipplicafcion of the rule by the <ORG> in India should be influenced by no technical considerations of form but by mutter of substance within the limits allowed by law It has been suggested however that even if the suit is barred against the appellants claiming through <NAME> there is no similar bar against those who claim through <NAME> inasmuch as so it is said he was not a party to the original title
