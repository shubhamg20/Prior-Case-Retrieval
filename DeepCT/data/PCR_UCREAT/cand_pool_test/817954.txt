Penultimate provision which would come up for consideration in later part of the judgment would be Article by which powers of transfer has been conferred in President of India Power of superintendence on subordinate <ORG> or tribunals functioning within its territorial jurisdiction has been conferred on <ORG> by Article It is further expected from the recommending and appointing authorities that they would take care of the factors like integrity and character reputation in legal fraternity and society his antecedents his suitability for the office of a Judge apart from other considerations like need of the <ORG> for a Judge of particular expertise and maintaining the conventional ratio between appointments from the <ORG> and serving Judges But every fact does not lead to logical inference and it will not be prudent to draw generalisations regarding independence of Judges as a community from isolated individual instances There is no quarrel with the concept that in order to inspire confidence reputation regarding integrity is as important as a person actual capacity of being above board We find support in our observations from Maharshi Avadheshv State AIR All wherein it was observed We can only notice the argument of the petitioner but in view of the constitutional status given to a Judge of <ORG> we cannot do anything more There is no gainsaying dimensions and the society at large has a stake in impartial even handed justice This one has to see from the point of view of an ordinary prudent person and not from the point of view of extremely suspicious person or the one who for reasons best known to him assumed that but for him none else is honest and capable to uphold the inden pendence of judiciary Cover attempt to malign the judiciary is implicit in the averments made in the petition Society as a whole and lawyers in particular have to inculcate implicit faith in the presumption of judicial rectilude in every soul that wears robes though it cannot be denied that it has to be earned by the members of judicial fraternity by their act and conduct express and implicit No doubt the power of transferring Judges of a <ORG> to another vests with the President but it has to be exercised objectively after consideration of all relevant facts and no en masse transfers can be ordered as is sought by the petitioner Interest of an individual has to give way to the interest of society We may venture to state that in view of the averments made we cannot even remotely assume any basis for the assumptions made by the petitioner nor there is any public interest involved We find no reason that because some one holds different views on a subject he must brand the others as the one yielding to extraneous considerations especially when the present judiciary is their successor in whose appointments they were the major participants We find no cogent reason for persons preceding the present judiciary stilling their successors and making an attempt to scandalise them We are afraid that we cannot on the basis of the suggestions made in the writ petition even assuming them lo be true though we have no doubt that these are unfounded interfere in exercise of writ jurisdiction
