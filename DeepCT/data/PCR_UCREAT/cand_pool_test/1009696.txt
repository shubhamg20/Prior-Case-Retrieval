For the years and they were assessed to sales tax on the sale turnover of the packing material Why and how are the packing materials used Are they used only to pack the dried tobacco to keep it intact and to prevent pollution and exposure or do they form an integral part of the drying process itself Turkish cigarette tobaccos are fermented chiefly in bales and there is a moderate rise in temperature in the course of the process We shall first consider the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioners in support of his contention I do not mean to say the price might not be recovered as goods sold and delivered if the work were completed and sent home <NAME> said There are three matters of charge well known in the law for labour simply for work and materials and another for goods sold and delivered <NAME> said When the contract is such that a chattel is ultimately to be delivered by the plaintiff to the defendant when it has been set then the cause of action is goods sold and delivered In an action by the plaintiff for the agreed price of the portrait it was held that the contract was a contract of work and labour and not for the sale of goods as the substance of the contract was that skill and labour should be exercised upon the production of the portrait and that it was only ancillary to that contract that there would pass from the artist to his customer some materials namely the paint and the canvas in addition to the skill and labour involved in the production of the portrait There are three matters of charge well known to the law viz for labour simply for labour and materials and for goods sold and delivered Here there is no sale of any finished product for the assessee has no property in the tobacco and has undertaken only to perform the drying process for consideration One of the questions raised in that case was whether a building contract involved the sale of the materials used in the building separately The learned Judges held that unless there was an intention in the contract specifically to pass the property in the materials as and when they are brought to the site the property in the materials passes only when they are fixed to the building At page <NAME> observed This leads us to the consideration of the question whether the contracts of the assessees which are mostly building contracts constitute contracts of sale of goods and contain any element of the nature of the sale of goods to justify the imposition of the tax upon them Hidayatullah as he then was observed at page thus We are here concerned with a taxing measure and the power to levy the tax can only be determined by a fair consideration of the ambit of the entry by which the power is conferred If a building contract was not split up into its component parts that is to say material and labour in legislative practice relating to the ordinary regulation of sale of goods there is no warrant for holding that it could not be so split up even for purposes of taxation It was contended on his behalf that as the article was capable of being sold without being packed in gunny bags the gunny bags must be exempted from sales tax as salt was exempted on the ground of necessity The Division Bench held that the assessee in that case was carrying on the business of buying and selling gunny bags in addition to the business of buying and selling salt When exemption was claimed from sales tax in regard to the packing material <NAME> who delivered the judgment on behalf of the Bench rejecting the claim observed as follows The sum of Rs No doubt in that case it was held that the assessee was not entitled to the benefit of Rule ii of the Turnover and Assessment Rules as he charged an inclusive price for both the tobacco and the packing materials when he sold the goods to the purchasers If they are supplied by the owner of cotton then there is no transfer of ownership of hessian and iron hoops from the petitioner to its client But if this material which is indispensable for turning out a pressed cotton bale is supplied by the petitioner a question may well arise whether there is any sale of this material The only distinction that can possibly be attempted to be made between the aforesaid cases and that on hand is that in the former the exempted goods were also sold along with the material while in the latter there was no sale of the exempted goods It was argued that as the sale of the exempted goods along with the packing material was admitted in those cases the <ORG> have held that there was a sale of the materials If in the first case the material cannot be part of the drying process we do not see how in the second case it becomes part of the drying process Section says that subject to the provisions of this Act every dealer shall pay for each year a tax on his total turnover for such year Dealer is defined to mean any person who carries on the business of buying or selling goods Vide Section Section defines sale thus Sale with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means every transfer of the property in goods by one person to another in the course of trade or business for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration and includes also a transfer of property in goods involved in the execution of a works contract but does not include a mortgage hypothecation charge or pledge Section i defines turnover thus Turnover means the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought by or sold by a dealer whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise shall be excluded from his turnover A combined reading of the provisions relevant to the question raised may be stated thus Every person who carries on the business of transferring property in any kind of movable property including materials commodities and articles in the fitting out improvement or repair of movable property to another for valuable consideration would be liable to tax on the turnover It cannot also be disputed that he transferred the property in the goods to his customer for consideration Unless we can hold that the materials after being packed have been transformed into some other commodity not covered by the definition of goods it is not possible to hold that there was no sale of that material When the provisions of the Sales Tax Act clearly apply there is really no scope for exempting them on some hypothetical considerations Unlike the cases cited by the learned counsel for the petitioners this case arose under a taxing statute Having regard to the language of the first proviso and to the general scope of the enactment their Lordships entertain no doubt that these contracts were contracts of sales and deliveries by Canadian manufacturers or producers within the meaning of the taxing statute and that the payments made under them constituted the sale price of goods produced or manufactured in Canada We have cited this decision only to show that in the case of a taxing statute we should be guided by the general scope of the enactment and the express provisions of the statute and not by considerations that might weigh in a case arising under the Statute of Frauds or similar statutes For the aforesaid reasons we hold that the packing materials were goods and that there was a sale in regard to them within the meaning of the Act
