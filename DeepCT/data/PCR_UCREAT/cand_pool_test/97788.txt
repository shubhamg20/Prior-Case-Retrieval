<NAME> These two appeals are filed by the Commissioner Appeals Calicut against two separate orders of the same date passed by the <ORG> Cochin Bench in ITA Nos Coch in respect of the assessment year and in ITA Nos Coch in respect of the assessment year in the case of the very same assessee who is the respondent in both these cases Since common questions of law are involved in both these cases they are disposed of by this common judgment Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and on an interpretation of section read with Explanation to clause va of section the assessee is entitled to claim deduction of the contribution to the ESI fund for the assessment year on actual payment basis if the payment was not made before the due date as defined in the Explanation to section va which the assessee as employer has to remit to the respective account However essentially the questions of law raised in both these appeals are with regard to the claim for deduction of a provision towards the contribution to an approved gratuity fund However in ITA No of there is one more question with regard to the claim for deduction of the contribution to the ESI fund Here it must be noted that both section A and section have used the expression notwithstanding Therefore the question to be decided in this case is as to which of these two provisions has got an overriding effect If section A is subject to section the deduction of the provision towards the contribution to the approved gratuity fund cannot be allowed unless there is actual payment that too within the due date provided there is a due date for such payment However essentially the questions of law raised in both these appeals are with regard to the claim for deduction of a provision towards the contribution to an approved gratuity fund However in ITA No of there is one more question with regard to the claim for deduction of the contribution to the ESI fund Here it must be noted that both section A and section have used the expression notwithstanding Therefore the question to be decided in this case is as to which of these two provisions has got an overriding effect If section A is subject to section the deduction of the provision towards the contribution to the approved gratuity fund cannot be allowed unless there is actual payment that too within the due date provided there is a due date for such payment Since the detailed reasons so far as the questions involved in both these cases are dealt with in the orders for the assessment year which is the subject matter of ITA No of the facts of the said appeal is mentioned first Accordingly to the assessing officer since the said amounts were not paid on the due date provided under section read with section va Explanation the same is not to be allowed as deduction Since the detailed reasons so far as the questions involved in both these cases are dealt with in the orders for the assessment year which is the subject matter of ITA No of

same is not to be allowed as deduction The assessee being aggrieved by the assessment orders for the years and filed appeals before the Commissioner Appeals Calicut According to the first appellate authority no due date has been prescribed under section as contrasted with section va read with section xxiv and section In appeal filed by the department against the said order the <ORG> considered the question as to whether the assessee had paid the premium within the due date prescribed under Explanation below clause va of sub section of section with reference to the policy under the group gratuity scheme produced by the assessee The <ORG> then considered the question whether in such a case the non payment of the premium within the accounting year can be a ground for disallowance by invoking section The <ORG> accordingly upheld the order of the Commissioner deleting the disallowance for the reason that section could not be applied in a case of deduction claimed under section A The assessee being aggrieved by the assessment orders for the years and filed appeals before the Commissioner Appeals Calicut According to the first appellate authority no due date has been prescribed under section as contrasted with section va read with section xxiv and section In appeal filed by the department against the said order the <ORG> considered the question as to whether the assessee had

the order of the Commissioner deleting the disallowance for the reason that section could not be applied in a case of deduction claimed under section A under section in respect of ESI contribution it was noted that the said sum was paid during the relevant previous year on and the contribution was claimed as a deduction in the year in which it was paid The <ORG> noted that the assessee had paid the said amount on during the relevant previous year but the assessing officer was of the view that the payment was not made before the due date as defined in the Explanation below section va and so

in computing the income referred to in section of that previous year in which such sum is actually paid by him Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply in relation to any sum referred in clause a or clause or clause which is actually paid by the assessee on or before the due date applicable in his case for furnishing the return of income under sub section of section in respect of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred as aforesaid and the evidence of such payment is furnished by the assessee along with such return Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply in relation to any sum referred in clause a or clause or clause which is actually paid by the assessee on or before the due date applicable in his case for furnishing the return of income under sub section of section in respect of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred as aforesaid and the evidence of such payment is furnished by the assessee along with such return For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that where a deduction in respect of any sum referred to in clause a or clause of this section is allowed in computing the income referred to in section of the previous year being a previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on the or any earlier assessment year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee the assessee shall not be entitled to any deduction under this section in respect of such sum in computing the income of the previous year in which the sum is actually paid by him For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that where a deduction in respect of any sum referred to in clause a or clause of this section is allowed in computing the income referred to in section of the previous year being a previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on the or any earlier assessment year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee the assessee shall not be entitled to any deduction under this section in respect of such sum in computing the income of the previous year in which the sum is actually paid by him Section A says that the provisions of this section shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provision of this Act relating to the computation of income under the head profits and gains of business or profession Section A says that the provisions of this section shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provision of this Act relating to the computation of income under the head profits and gains of business or profession If the marginal note or heading is any indication and it certainly is a relevant factor to be taken into consideration in construing the ambit of the section then these payments mentioned therein are not deductible according to the statute in certain circumstances This is abundantly made clear by the non obstante expression used in sub section of section A As noted before the provisions of section A shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provision of the Act Read with the marginal notes of section A the non obstante clause of sub section of section A has an overriding effect over the provisions of any other section by providing that the provisions of the section will have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provision relating to the computation of income under the head Profits and gains of business or profession In order to remove uncertainty in the matter it is proposed to specifically provide in the law that no deduction will be allowed in the computation of profits and gains of a business or profession in respect of any reserve created or provision made for the payment of gratuity to the employees on retirement or on termination of employment for any reason This restriction will however not apply in relation to a provision made for the purpose of payment of a sum by way of contribution towards an approved gratuity fund that has become payable during the relevant year or for the purpose of meeting actual liability in respect of payment of gratuity to the employees that has arisen during such year The provision of clause a was made subject to clause Clause i excludes from the operation of clause a contribution to an approved gratuity fund and amount provided for or set apart for payment of gratuity which would be payable during the year of account Clause ii deals with a situation where the assessee might provide by the spread over method and provides that such provision would be excluded from the operation of clause a provided the three conditions laid down by the sub clauses are satisfied Now it would appear that there is conflict between the provisions of section A and section insofar as both the provisions used the non obstante clause It is significant to mention here that section A was there in the Act when section was inserted and even prior to from which date section is given effect to ITR Cal took the view that the provisions of section have got the overriding effect over the provisions of section A According to <ORG> after the insertion of section the provisions of section A have no application and that unless the conditions of section are satisfied the deduction cannot be allowed Now it would appear that there is conflict between the provisions of section A and section insofar as both the provisions used the non obstante clause It is significant to mention here that section A was there in the Act when section was inserted and even prior to from which date section is given effect to ITR Cal took the view that the provisions of section have got the overriding effect over the provisions of section A According to <ORG> after the insertion of section the provisions of section A have no application and that unless the conditions of section are satisfied the deduction cannot be allowed The first proviso deals with payments covered by clauses a or clause with respect to which it is said that if the said amounts are actually paid by the assessee on or before the due date applicable in his case for furnishing the return of income under sub section of section in respect of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred as aforesaid and evidence of such payment is furnished by the assessee along with such return The first proviso deals with payments covered by clauses a or clause with respect to which it is said that if the said amounts are actually paid by the assessee on or before the due date applicable in his case for furnishing the return of income under sub section of section in respect of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred as aforesaid and evidence of such payment is furnished by the assessee along with such return The present case is covered by clause of section The present case is covered by clause of section The proviso to section lays down that the payment should be made before the due date as defined in the Explanation below clause va of sub section of section It is also observed that the legislature in its wisdom has incorporated the proviso and it cannot be said to be without a purpose The proviso to section lays down that the payment should be made before the due date as defined in the Explanation below clause va of sub section of section It is also observed that the legislature in its wisdom has incorporated the proviso and it cannot be said to be without a purpose Now from the above discussion the following aspects are clear section A would have effect notwithstanding anything contained in sections to The deduction cannot be allowed on general principles or under any other section of the Act because sub section of section A makes it clear that the provisions of the section shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provision of the Act relating to the computation of income under the head Profits and gains of business or profession Section A says that no deduction is to be allowed in the computation of the profits and gains of a business or profession in respect of any provision made for the payment of gratuity to the employees on retirement or on termination of employment Thus but for the provisions of section enacted the assessee would have been entitled to deduction of the provision for gratuity by virtue of section A i of the Act subject to fulfilment of the conditions specified therein This provision it would appear has the effect of taking away the provisions of section A i also Now from the above discussion the following aspects are clear section A would have effect notwithstanding anything contained in sections to The deduction cannot be allowed on general principles or under any other section of the Act because sub section of section A makes it clear that the provisions of the section shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other provision of the Act relating to the computation of income under the head Profits and gains of business or profession Section A says that no deduction is to be allowed in the computation of the profits and gains of a business or profession in respect of any provision made for the payment of gratuity to the employees on retirement or on termination of employment Thus but for the provisions of section enacted the assessee would have been entitled to deduction of the provision for gratuity by virtue of section A i of the Act subject to fulfilment of the conditions specified therein This provision it would appear has the effect of taking away the provisions of section A i also If the second proviso to section which deals with a situation covered by clause of the said section is applicable then by virtue of the Explanation to section va of the Act the payment should be made on or before the due date for payment of the contribution to the approved gratuity fund fixed in the contract of insurance If the second proviso to section which deals with a situation covered by clause of the said section is applicable then by virtue of the Explanation to section va of the Act the payment should be made on or before the due date for payment of the contribution to the approved gratuity fund fixed in the contract of insurance Therefore it cannot be said that payment made beyond the due date also qualifies for deduction in view of the prescription in the main provision itself Had that been the legislative intent there was no necessity to enact the proviso There is nothing repugnant between the main provision and the proviso Another Division Bench to which one of us <NAME> was a party in the judgment dated in ITA No of considered the contention on behalf of the assessee that the aforesaid decision does not apply to the case of payment of employers contribution as the Explanation to section va i read with section of the Act refers to the employees contribution to the employees account in the relevant fund and not to the employers contribution In the light of the above two decisions it is clear that the second proviso to section read with the Explanation to section va applies to a claim for deduction of gratuity premium also In the instant case the assessee admittedly did not make payment to the approved gratuity fund either during the previous year relevant to the assessment years concerned as also within the due date fixed for payment of the gratuity premium by the <ORG> Thus if section of the Act is held to be applicable to the instant case by virtue of the provisions of section read with the second proviso thereto and Explanation to section va the petitioner will not be entitled to get the benefit of deduction of the provision made for payment to the approved gratuity fund in the aforesaid two years Let us see whether there is any exception to this rule Another Division Bench to which one of us <NAME> was a party in the judgment dated in ITA No of considered the contention on behalf of the assessee that the aforesaid decision does not apply to the case of payment of employers contribution as the Explanation to section va i read with section of the Act refers to the employees contribution to the employees account in the relevant fund and not to the employers contribution In the light of the above two decisions it is clear that the second proviso to section read with the Explanation to section va applies to a claim for deduction of gratuity premium also In the instant case the assessee admittedly did not make payment to the approved gratuity fund either during the previous year relevant to the assessment years concerned as also within the due date fixed for payment of the gratuity premium by the <ORG> Thus if section of the Act is held to be applicable to the instant case by virtue of the provisions of section read with the second proviso thereto and Explanation to section va the petitioner will not be entitled to get the benefit of deduction of the provision made for payment to the approved gratuity fund in the aforesaid two years Let us see whether there is any exception to this rule it was observed that when two or more laws operate in the same field and each contains a non obstante clause stating that its provisions will override those of any other law stimulating and incisive problems of interpretation arise it was observed that when two or more laws operate in the same field and each contains a non obstante clause stating that its provisions will override those of any other law stimulating and incisive problems of interpretation arise On the said principle it was held that the amendment cannot be justified because there is a non obstante clause in rule it cannot be interpreted that the said amendment to the general rules though later in point of time would abrogate the special rule the scope of which is very clear and which co exist particularly when no patent conflict or inconsistency can be spelt out On the said principle it was held that the amendment cannot be justified because there is a non obstante clause in rule it cannot be interpreted that the said amendment to the general rules though later in point of time would abrogate the special rule the scope of which is very clear and which co exist particularly when no patent conflict or inconsistency can be spelt out Public Premises Act and the Rent Control Act enacted by the same legislature where the question as to whether the provisions of Public Premises Act override the provisions of the Rent Control Act where it was observed that the question as to whether the provisions of the Public Premises Act override the provisions of the Rent Control Act will have to be considered in the light of the principles of statutory interpretation applicable to laws made by the same legislature Public Premises Act and the Rent Control Act enacted by the same legislature where the question as to whether the provisions of Public Premises Act override the provisions of the Rent Control Act where it was observed that the question as to whether the provisions of the Public Premises Act override the provisions of the Rent Control Act will have to be considered in the light of the principles of statutory interpretation applicable to laws made by the same legislature Thereafter it was observed in para of the judgment as follows One such principle of statutory interpretation which is applied is contained in the latin maxim leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant later laws abrogate earlier contrary laws We have already noted the provisions of section A which provides that in cases covered by provisions of clause a no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any provision whether called as such or by any other name made by the assessee for the payment of gratuity to his employees on their retirement or on termination of their employment for any reason Section on the other hand is a positive provision which says that deduction towards gratuity fund can be allowed only in computing the income referred to in section of that previous year in which a sum is actually paid by him We have already noted the provisions of section A which provides that in cases covered by provisions of clause a no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any provision whether called as such or by any other name made by the assessee for the payment of gratuity to his employees on their retirement or on termination of their employment for any reason Section on the other hand is a positive provision which says that deduction towards gratuity fund can be allowed only in computing the income referred to in section of that previous year in which a sum is actually paid by him As already noted section A clause particularly sub clause i thereof is a special provision in regard to a claim for deduction based on a provision made for payment towards an approved gratuity fund Going by the principles laid down by <ORG> in the decisions discussed above we are of the view that there is no clear inconsistency between the two provisions viz It cannot be interpreted that the later provision in section by introducing the non obstante clause would abrogate the special provision with regard to provision made for payment to an approved gratuity fund contained in section A i As already noted section A clause particularly sub clause i thereof is a special provision in regard to a claim for deduction based on a provision made for payment towards an approved gratuity fund Going by the principles laid down by <ORG> in the decisions discussed above we are of the view that there is no clear inconsistency between the two provisions viz It cannot be interpreted that the later provision in section by introducing the non obstante clause would abrogate the special provision with regard to provision made for payment to an approved gratuity fund contained in section A i Now coming to the question of deduction regarding contribution towards <ORG> fund the <ORG> has held that the provisions of the proviso to section and the Explanation to section via of the Act has no application since the Explanation refers to the due date for payment of the employees contribution only and that in the instant case what is paid to the <ORG> is the employers contribution Now coming to the question of deduction regarding contribution towards <ORG> fund the <ORG> has held that the provisions of the proviso to section and the Explanation to section via of the Act has no application since the Explanation refers to the due date for payment of the employees contribution only and that in the instant case what is paid to the <ORG> is the employers contribution In the above circumstances we answer questions to in both the appeals in the affirmative i in favour of the assessee and against the revenue In the above circumstances we answer questions to in both the appeals in the affirmative i in favour of the assessee and against the revenue
