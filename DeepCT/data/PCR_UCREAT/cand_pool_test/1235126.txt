Later when she tried to enter the matrimonial home she found that the main entrance was locked and so she was unable to enter her matrimonial home This led the Petitioner to file Suit No of for a mandatory injunction directing the Respondents and their son in law and her husband <NAME> to open the main entrance to enable her to reside in the matrimonial home that is the second floor of property bearing No Ashok Vihar Phase I Delhi and for a permanent injunction restraining the Respondents from breaking open the locks of her matrimonial home and removing her goods there from It was further contended by the Respondents that their son <NAME> had purchased some property in Ghaziabad and had shifted there It was submitted that in law the user of the second floor of the property by the Petitioner was merely permissive in as much as the entire property was owned by the Respondents and the Petitioner really had no right to reside in their property except with their permission On these broad facts the learned Trial Judge decided on th March both the applications for ad interim injunction filed by the parties He held that the Petitioner was admittedly in possession of the second floor of the said property and that it would be in the fitness of things if both the parties did not interfere in each others possession and each others right to have access to the common passage It was also held that the Petitioner had no right over property belonging to persons other than her husband and therefore the application for an ad interim injunction filed by the Petitioner deserved dismissal I proceed on the basis that the Petitioner is presently not residing in the second floor of property bearing No Ashok Vihar Phase I Delhi I also proceed on the basis that the Petitioner husband is now residing at a place other than the second floor property If the answer is in the affirmative then she has a right to reside there subject to the objections of the Respondents otherwise not I am of the view that in the context of Indian society a pragmatic view has to be taken while attempting to understand what is meant by the matrimonial home of a married couple because there is no statute in this respect unlike in England where the Matrimonial Homes Act would govern the situation It appears that in England an innocent spouse who is in occupation of the matrimonial home as a joint owner has a right not to be evicted from there except by an order of a <ORG> and if that spouse is not in occupation he or she has a right to obtain a <ORG> order to enter and occupy such a matrimonial home A spouse who has no proprietary interest in the matrimonial home but is in occupation thereof has a right to remain in occupation of the matrimonial home as against the spouse who has left that matrimonial home Of course now there are may instances where the couple reside separately since the joint family system is breaking up but as in the present case residence is usually along with the parents of the husband A woman therefore would have the right to remain in that matrimonial home as long as she is married and if she is obliged to leave that matrimonial home I think she would be entitled to obtain an injunction from an appropriate Court protecting her right and preventing her from being thrown out Consequently going by the generally accepted practice in most parts of India if not in the entire country it can be said that the ground floor of property bearing No Ashok Vihar Phase I Delhi was the matrimonial home of the Petitioner and her husband <NAME> even though the entire property belonged to the parents of <NAME> There can be no doubt that there is a legal obligation on <NAME> to provide a residence to the Petitioner and their son It is one thing for <NAME> and the Respondents to say that since <NAME> is now staying in Ghaziabad that would be the matrimonial home and he is prepared to have the Petitioner reside with him there which clearly holds that there is a legal obligation on the husband to provide a residence for his wife and that the wife also needs access to her matrimonial home This is precisely what has happened in the present case namely that <NAME> shifted out of the second floor of the said property to set up what he and his parents call a new matrimonial home in Ghaziabad In view of the factual context given above it can safely be said that the second floor of the Ashok Vihar property continues to be the Petitioner matrimonial home being the place where she and <NAME> last resided together as husband and wife and where they voluntarily shifted from the ground floor A mere change of residence by <NAME> for whatever reason would not shift the matrimonial home away from Ashok Vihar more particularly on the facts of the present case when <NAME> had applied for a divorce from the Petitioner It was contended by learned counsel for the Respondents that his clients who own the Ashok Vihar property had only permitted the Petitioner to reside on the second floor of the said property This permissive user according to him did not give her any right to continue to reside in that property and she had no proprietary interest in the property I have already held that the second floor of the said property was the matrimonial home of the Petitioner and therefore she has a right to stay there as against <NAME> which should be paid by the Respondents within a period of six weeks from today and in any case before th March
