HEADNOTE The Government of India by a notification dated April exempted tyres from a certain percentage of Excise Duty to the extent that the manufacturers had not availed themselves of the exemption granted under certain other earlier notifications The <ORG> held that a prima facie case had been made out in favour of the company and by an interim order allowed the benefit of the exemption to the tune of about Rs There was no question of any balance of convenience being in favour of the respondent Company it was certainly in favour of the Government of India The <ORG> must also have good and sufficient reason to by pass the alternative remedy provided by statute There are cases which demand that interim orders should be made in the interests of justice we had occasion to condemn and prohibit this practice of entertaining oral applications under Art We reiterate the following observations made therein We are constrained to make the observations which follows as we do feel dismayed at the tendency on the part of some of <ORG> to grant interlocutory orders for the mere asking So also there is no warrant for presuming the levy to be bad at the very threshold of the proceedings On the other hand the <ORG> cannot be unmindful of the need to protect the authority levying the tax for at that stage the <ORG> has to proceed on the hypothesis that the challenge may or may not succeed held that where the statute itself provided the petitioners with an efficacious alternative remedy by way of an appeal to <ORG> a second appeal to the <ORG> and there after to have the case stated to the High <ORG> it was not for the High <ORG> to exercise its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Art But then the <ORG> must have good and sufficient reason to by pass the alternative remedy provided by statute We can also take judicial notice of the fact that the vast majority of the petitions under Art we had occasion to consider an interim order passed by <ORG> in regard to a matter no part of the cause of action relating to which appeared to arise within the jurisdiction of <ORG> The principal prayer in the writ petition is the challenge to the order made or proposed to be made under Clause of the Import Control order The interim order in terms of prayers and has the effect of practically allowing the writ petition at the stage of admission without hearing the opposite parties While we do not wish to say that a drastic interim order may never be passed without hearing the opposite parties even if the circumstances justify it we are very firmly of the opinion that a statutory order such as the one made in the present case under Clause of the Import Control order ought not to have been stayed without at least hearing those that made the order Where a plentitude of power is given under a statute designed to meet a dire situation it is no answer to say that the very nature of the power and the consequences which may ensue is itself a sufficient justification for the grant of a stay of that order unless of course there are sufficient circumstances to justify a strong Prima facie inference that the order was made in abuse of the power conferred by the statute A statutory order such as the one under Clause purports to be made in the public interest and unless there are even stronger grounds of public interest an expert interim order will not be justified The only appropriate order to make in such cases is to issue notice to the respondent and make it returnable within a short period It is notorious how if an interim order is once made by a court parties employ every device and tactic to ward off the final hearing of the application Regarding the practice of some clever litigants of resorting to filing writ petitions in the far away courts having doubtful jurisdiction we had this to observe But we do feel disturbed that such writ petitions are of ten deliberately filed in distant <ORG> as part of a manoeuvre in a A legal battle so as to render it difficult for the officials at Delhi to move applications to vacate stay where it becomes necessary to file such applications allowed an appeal against an interim order making the following observations After hearing learned counsel for the rival parties we are of the opinion that the interim order passed by <ORG> on November is not warranted since it virtually grants to the respondents a substantial part of the relief claimed by them in their writ petition Accordingly we set aside the said order We have come across cases where the collection of public revenue has been seriously jeopardised and budgets of Governments and <ORG> affirmatively prejudiced to the point of precariousness consequent upon interim orders made by courts We have come across cases where an entire Service is left in a stay of flutter and unrest because of interim orders passed by courts leaving the work they are supposed to do in a state of suspended animation There are of course cases which demand that interim orders should be made in the interests of justice There can be and there are no hard and fast rules There are several other vital considerations apart from the existence of a prima facia case There is the question of balance of convenience There is the question of irreparable injury There is the question of the public interest There are many such factors worthy of consideration We often wonder why in the case indirect taxation where the burden has already been passed on to the consumer any interim relief should at all be given to the manufacturer dealer and the like There is just one more thing that we wish to say On a previous occasion <ORG> had vacated an interim order passed by a learned single Judge on similar facts in a similar situation So also we mean no disrespect to <ORG> in stressing the need for self discipline on the part of <ORG> in passing interim orders without entering into the question of amplitude and width of the powers of <ORG> to grant interim relief It is inevitable in a hierarchical system of <ORG> that there are decisions of the <ORG> appellate tribunal which do not attract the unanimous approval of all members of the judiciary But the judicial system only works if someone is allowed to have the last word and that last word once spoken is loyally accepted By a notification dated April issued by <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> in exercise of the powers conferred by Rule of the <ORG> Rules types falling under item No of the First Schedule to the <ORG> and Salt Act were exempt from a certain percentage of excise duty to the extent that the manufacturers had not availed themselves of the exemption granted under certain other earlier notifications The <ORG> was of the view that the <ORG> was not entitled to the exemption as it had cleared the goods earlier without paying central excise duty but on furnishing Bank Guarantees under various interim orders of courts The learned single judge took the view that a prima facie case had been made out in favour of the <ORG> and by an interim order allowed the benefit of the exemption to the tune of Rs We gave two weeks time to the A respondent <ORG> to file a counter No counter has however been filed <NAME> learned counsel however appeared for the respondent Even assuming that the company had established a prima facie case about which we do not express any opinion we do not think that it was sufficient justification for granting the interim orders as was done by <ORG> There was no question of any balance of convenience being in favour of the respondent <ORG> The appeal is allowed with costs
