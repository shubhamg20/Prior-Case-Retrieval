The assessee claimed that the provisions of section a or were not attracted in this case The <ORG> however has held that these provisions are not attracted in the case of the assessee Hence the following question is referred to us under section of the Income tax Act Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was justified in holding that the trust did not violate the provisions of section a or section and in holding as a consequence that the question of considering whether section applies would not arise for the assessment year Section provides inter alia that income derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes shall not be included in the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt of the income if it satisfies the provisions set out therein Under section however section will not apply in certain cases It provides that the income or the property of the trust shall be deemed to be used or applied for the benefit of a person referred to in sub section and would therefore not qualify for exemption a if any part of the income or property of the trust or institution is or continues to be lent to any person referred to in sub section for any period during the previous year without either adequate security or adequate interest or both This clause clearly provides that the income or property of the trust should be lent to the person specified in sub section For the same reasons the provisions of section are also not attracted in the present case
