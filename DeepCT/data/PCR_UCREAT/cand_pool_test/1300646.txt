HEADNOTE The appellant a private limited company was assessed to income tax for the assessment years and by three separate orders dated January February and February under of the Indian Income Tax Act on returns filed by it with statements of account of the Constitution for writs restraining the Income tax Officer from initiating assessment proceedings on the basis of the said notices on the ground inter alia that he had no jurisdiction to issue the said notices a of the Indian Income tax Act two conditions precedent must co exist namely that he must have reason to believe i that income profits or gains had been under assessed and that such under assessment was due to non disclosure of material facts by the assessee The question whether by the sale of shares the assessee in the instant case intended to change the form of investment or to make a business profit was one of an inferential fact and the failure to disclose such intention could not by itself amount to a failure or omission to disclose a material fact within the meaning of a of the Act Where however the Income tax Officer has prima facie reasonable grounds for believing that there has been a non disclosure of a primary material fact that by itself gives him the jurisdiction to issue a notice under of the Act and the adequacy or otherwise of the grounds of such belief is not open to investigation by the <ORG> Since in the instant case there was no non disclosure of a primary material fact which the assessee was bound to disclose under a of the Act the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to issue the notices in question It is incorrect to say that the question of under assessment by reason of non disclosure of a material fact was relevant only for the purpose of applying either the longer or the shorter period of limitation prescribed by the section and not for jurisdiction and therefore not a proper matter for investigation under Art The High <ORG>s have ample powers under Art of the Constitution and are in duty bound thereunder to issue such appropriate orders or directions as are necessary in order to prevent persons from being subjected to lengthy proceedings and unnecessary harassments by an executive authority acting without jurisdiction Alternative remedies such as are provided by the Income tax Act cannot always be a sufficient reason for refusing quick relief in a fit and proper case Per <NAME> The Explanation to of the Indian Income tax Act clearly indicates that the duty of the assessee thereunder does not end by merely producing evidence or disclosing the primary facts but also extends to the disclosure of such other facts relating to status agency benami nature of the transaction the nature of the trading and the like which he knows but do not appear from the evidence and which may be necessary for interpreting the evidence Since in the present case an investment company dealing in stocks and shares not only knowingly suppressed that fact but contended otherwise there was non disclosure of a material fact necessary for its assessment and sufficient to attract a of the Act Per <NAME> The expression has reason to believe in a of the Indian Income tax Act does not mean a purely subjective satisfaction of the Income tax Officer but predicates the existence of reasons on which such belief has to be founded If there is disclosure of some facts but not all a tax payer cannot resist reassessment on the plea that such non disclosure was due to the negligence or inadvertence on the part of the Income tax Officer to scrutinise the materials before him It was assessed to income tax for the assessment years and by three separate orders dated January February and February respectively The first ground on which this prayer was based was mentioned in the petition in these terms The said pretended notice was issued without the existence of the necessary conditions precedent which confers jurisdiction under section aforementioned whether before or after the amendment in Accordingly he made an order prohibiting the Income tax Officer from continuing the assessment proceedings on the basis of the impugned notices The learned Judges who heard the appeal agreed with the Trial Judge that the first ground had not been made out The only point raised before us is that the courts below were wrong in holding that the first ground that the notices were issued without the existence of the necessary conditions precedent which confers jurisdiction under had not been made out As it is no longer disputed that as amended in applies to the present case we have to consider the section as it stood after the amendment in in deciding this question of jurisdiction If a the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his income under for any year or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income profits or gain chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment for that year or have been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made the subject of excessive relief under the Act or excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed or notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in clause a on the part of the assessee the Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment for any year or have been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made the subject of excessive relief under this Act or that excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed He may in cases falling under clause a at any time within eight years and in cases falling under clause at any time within four years of the end of that year serve on the assessee or if the assessee is a company on the principal officer thereof a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of section and may proceed to assess or reassess such income profits or gains or recompute the loss or depreciation allowance and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section Provided that i the Income tax Officer shall not issue a notice under this subsection unless he has recorded his reasons for doing so and the Commissioner is satisfied on such reasons recorded that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice ii the tax shall be chargeable at the rate at which it would have been charged had the income profits or gains not escaped assessment or full assessment as the case may be and iii where the assessment made or to be made is an assessment made or to be made on a person deemed to be the agent of a non resident person under section this sub section shall have effect as if for the periods of eight years and four years a period of one year was substituted The first is that the Income tax Officer must have reason to believe that income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have been under assessed The second is that he must have also reason to believe that such under assessment has occurred by reason of either i omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his income under or ii omission or failure on the part of an assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year Both these conditions are conditions precedent to be satisfied before the Income tax Officer could have jurisdiction to issue a notice for the assessment or re assessment beyond the period of four years but within the period of eight years from the end of the year in question No dispute appears to have been raised at any stage in this case as regards the first condition not having been satisfied and we proceed on the basis that the Income tax Officer had in fact reason to believe that there had been an under assessment in each of the assessment years and As admittedly the appellant had filed its return of income under the Income tax Officer could have no reason to believe that under assessment had resulted from the failure to make a return of income The only question is whether the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that there had been some omission or failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment for any of these years in consequence of which the under assessment took place Before we proceed to consider the materials on record to see whether the appellant has succeeded in showing that the Income tax Officer could have no reason on the materials before him to believe that there had been any omission to disclose material facts as mentioned in the section it is necessary to examine the precise scope of disclosure which the section demands The words used are omission or failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year It postulates a duty on every assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment In every assessment proceeding the assessing authority will for the purpose of computing or determining the proper tax due from an assessee require to know all the facts which help him in coming to the correct conclusion There can be no doubt that the duty of disclosing all the primary facts relevant to the decision of the question before the assessing authority lies on the assessee To meet a possible contention that when some account books or other evidence has been produced there is no duty on the assessee to disclose further facts which on due diligence the Income tax Officer might have discovered the <ORG> has put in the Explanation which has been set out above His omission to bring to the assessing authority attention these particular items in the account books or the particular portions of the documents which are relevant amount to omission to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment Indeed when it is remembered that people often differ as regards what inferences should be drawn from given facts it will be meaningless to demand that the assessee must disclose what inferences whether of facts or law he would draw from the primary facts If from primary facts more inferences than one could be drawn it would not be possible to say that the assessee should have drawn any particular inference and communicated it to the assessing authority We have therefore come to the Conclusion that while the duty of the assessee is to disclose fully and truly all primary relevant facts it does not extend beyond this The position therefore is that if there were in fact some reasonable grounds for thinking that there had been any non disclosure as regards any primary fact which could have a material bearing on the question of under assessments that would be sufficient to give jurisdiction to the Income tax Officer to issue the notice under Mr <NAME> contends that this is not an omission to disclose a material fact within the meaning of It is the duty of the assessee to disclose all the facts which have a bearing on the question but whether the assessee had the intention to make a business profit as distinguished from the intention to change the form of the investments is really an inference to be drawn by the assessing authority from the material facts taken in conjunction with the surrounding circumstances The question of the assessee intention is an inferential fact and so the assessee omission to state his true intentions behind the sale of shares cannot by itself be considered to be a failure or omission to disclose any material fact within the meaning of Dealing with this question the learned Chief Justice has said The expression that the Respondent had failed to disclose the true intention behind the sale of shares may lack directness but that deficiency of language is not sufficient to enable the Respondent to contend in view of the circumstances alleged that no failure to disclose facts was being complained of On the facts as stated by the Income tax Officer it is clear that there had been a failure to disclose the fact that the Respondent was a dealer in shares and what the Income tax Officer meant by the language used by him was that the Respondent had not disclosed that the sale of shares had been of the nature of a trading sale made in pursuance of an intention to make a business profit and not of the nature of a change of investment made in pursuance of an intention to put certain capital assets into another form The learned Chief Justice seems to have proceeded on the basis that when from certain facts inferences are to be drawn there is a duty on the assessee to state what the correct inference should be and if he has made a wrong statement as regards the inferences to be drawn that also is an omission or failure to disclose a material fact We have however on the record an affidavit sworn by the same Income tax Officer who started the proceedings It is reasonable to expect that in this affidavit which was his opportunity to tell the court what non disclosure he took into consideration he would state as clearly as possible the material facts in respect of which there had not been in his view a full and true disclosure The company filed appeals before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner which were rejected in September and the assessments were confirmed The company thereafter filed a second appeal before <ORG> which appeals are now pending I have reasons to believe that by reason of the omission or failure of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessments the income pro The said reports were made and notices issued in respect of all the three years mentioned in the petition and copies of the report and notice for one of such years are included in the schedule hereto annexed and marked A It appears from this that the statements made by or on behalf of the company which the assessing authority considered to amount to non disclosure of material facts were these i the company was not whole of its history the company bought no shares whatsoever It appears clear that the Income tax Officers who made the assessments for the years and proceeded on the basis that this was an investment company and considered the question whether in spite of its being an investment company certain sales of shares wherefrom the company made a profit were by way of trading in shares and not by way of changing the form of investment The fact that on behalf of the company Mr <NAME> of <ORG> stated that the company was not a dealer in shares and securities does not therefore amount to an omission to disclose fully and truly any material fact To ascertain whether the Income tax Officer could have had in mind any non disclosure as a ground for thinking that by reason of such non disclosure an under assessment had occurred apart from what was mentioned in the affidavit we enquired from respondent counsel whether he could suggest any other non disclosure that might have taken place This suggestion is against the record and we have no hesitation in repelling it If he had any reason to believe that these were not shown he would have certainly mentioned that fact It must therefore be held that the Income tax Officer who issued the notices had not before him any non disclosure of a material fact and so he could have no material before him for believing that there had been any material non disclosure by reason of which an under assessment had taken place We are therefore bound to hold that the conditions precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction under of the Income tax Act did not exist and the Income tax Officer had therefore no jurisdiction to issue the impugned notices under in respect of the years and after the expiry of four years Mr <NAME> argued that the question whether the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that under assessment had occurred by reason of nondisclosure of material facts should not be investigated by the courts in an application under Art Learned Counsel seems to suggest that as soon as the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that there has been under assessment in any year he has jurisdiction to start proceedings under by issuing a notice provided years have not elapsed from the end of the year in question but whether the notices should have been issued within a period of years or not is only a question of limitation which could and should properly be raised in assessment proceedings It is wholly incorrect however to suppose that this is a question of limitation only not touching the question of jurisdiction The scheme of the law clearly is that where the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that an under assessment has resulted from non disclosure he shall have jurisdiction to start proceedings for re assessment within a period of years and where he has reason to believe that an under assessment has resulted from other causes he shall have jurisdiction to start pro ceedings for re assessment within years Both the conditions i the Income tax Officer having reason to believe that there has been under assessment and ii his having reason to believe that such under assessment has resulted from nondisclosure of material facts must co exist before the Income tax Officer has jurisdiction to start proceedings after the expiry of years The argument that the Court ought not to investigate the existence of one of these conditions viz that the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that under assessment has resulted from non disclosure of material facts cannot therefore be accepted Mr <NAME> next pointed out that at the stage when the Income tax Officer issued the notices he was not acting judicially or quasi judicially and so a writ of certiorari or prohibition cannot issue It is well settled however that though the writ of prohibition or certiorary will not issue against an executive authority <ORG> have power to issue in a fit case an order prohibiting an executive authority from acting without jurisdiction Where such action of an executive authority acting without jurisdiction subjects or is likely to subject a person to lengthy proceedings and unnecessary harassment <ORG> it is well settled will issue appropriate orders or directions to prevent such consequences Mr <NAME> mentioned more than once the fact that the company would have sufficient opportunity to raise this question viz whether the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that under assessment had resulted from non disclosure of material facts before the Income tax Officer himself in the assessment proceedings and if unsuccessful there before the appellate officer or the appellate tribunal or in <ORG> under section of the Indian Income tax Act The existence of such alternative remedy is not however always a sufficient reason for refusing a party quick relief by a writ or order prohibiting an authority acting without jurisdiction from continuing such action There is nothing in its conduct which would justify the refusal of proper relief under Art When the Constitution confers on <ORG> the power to give relief it becomes the duty of the courts to give such relief in fit cases and the courts would be failing to perform their duty if relief is refused without adequate reasons In the present case we can find no reason for which relief should be refused We have therefore come to the conclusion that the company was entitled to an order directing the Income tax Officer not to take any action on the basis of the three impugned notices was pending on the distinct understanding that these orders would be without prejudice to the contentions of the parties on the several questions raised in the petition and without prejudice to the orders that may ultimately be passed by the <ORG> In the result we allow the appeal set aside the order made by the appellate Bench of the Calcutta High <ORG> and restore the order made by the Trial Judge <NAME> The assessment orders made in the proceedings started under of the Income Tax Act are also quashed The appellant will get its costs here and below <NAME> have had the advantage of reading the judgments prepared by my brethren <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> The point involved in the case is a very short one and the answer as it appears to me equally so The clause provided an extended period for sending a notice calling for a return for the purpose of assessing or reassessing income profits and gains which had escaped assessment or had been under assessed for any year within eight years if the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an assessee to make a return of his income under section for any year or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year the income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment etc The contention of the appellant <ORG> is that all the facts necessary to be disclosed were in fact disclosed that it was not required further to concede that it was trading in shares which was a matter of inference from the proved facts for the Income tax Officer to draw and that there was thus no question of any non disclosure This means quite clearly that the mere production of evidence is not enough and that there may be an omission or failure to make a full and true disclosure if some material fact necessary for the assessment lies embedded in that evidence which the assessee can uncover but does not If there is such a fact it is the duty of the assessee to disclose it But it is otherwise if a contention which is contrary to fact is raised and the Income tax Officer is set to discover the hidden truth for himself In the latter case there is suppression of material fact or in other words that lack of full and true disclosure which would entitle action under of the Act If the second is decided in favour of the assessee the question would arise if there was full and true disclosure The appellant Company might have placed the evidence before the income tax Officer but the Income tax Officer had reason to believe that the disclosure was neither full nor true because the fact that the Company was and shares was not disclosed He therefore felt that prima facie there was not only concealment of a fact but on the contrary maintaining of a falsehood and this was sufficient to bring this matter within the extended period But the question will be decided after taking into consideration the nature of the business of the <ORG> and till that is done the Income tax Officer believes that the contention raise before and persisted in is not a mere contention but maintenance of a falsehood about the nature of the transactions and the business of the <ORG> In my opinion <ORG> of <ORG> rightly refused a writ in the circumstances and I would dismiss this appeal with costs <NAME> regret inability to agree with the judgment delivered by my learned brother Mr Justice <NAME> The facts which give rise to this appeal have been fully set out by my learned brother and it is not necessary to reiterate the same Sub section of of the Indian Income Tax Act in so far it is material stood at the relevant date when the proceedings were commenced as follows If a the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of an for any year or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment for that year or have been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made the subject of excessive relief under the Act or excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed or notwithstanding that there has been no omission or failure as mentioned in cl a on the part of the assessee the Income tax Officer has in consequence of information in his possession reason to believe that income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment for any year or have been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made the subject of excessive relief under this Act or that excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed he may in cases falling under cl a at any time within eight years and in cases falling under cl at any time within four years of the end of that year serve on the assessee or if the assessee is a company on the principal officer thereof a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub of and may proceed to assess or re assess such income profits or gains or re compute the loss or depreciation allowance and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section Provided that i the Income tax Officer shall not issue a notice under this sub section unless he has recorded his reasons for doing so and the Commissioner is satisfied on such reasons recorded that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice ii the tax shall be chargeable at the rate at which it would have been charged had the income profits or gains not escaped assessment or full assessment as the case may be and iii where the assessment made or to be made is an assessment made or to be made on a person deemed to be the agent of a non resident person under this sub section shall have effect as if for the periods of eight years and four years a period of one year was substituted This section provides machinery for assessment or reassessment if it be found that income profits or gains have escaped assessment or have been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate or have been made subject to excessive relief under the Act or excessive loss or depreciation allowance has been computed which expression may for convenience of reference be compendiously referred to as are or have been under assessed Notice under a may be issued if the Income Tax Officer has reason to believe that income in any year has been under assessed by reason of the failure on the part of the assessee to make a return of his income or to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment for the year in question On an analysis of the relevant provisions the material conditions proscribed for the exercise of the power to commence proceedings for reassessment under a are these The Income Tax Officer has reason to believe a that income profits or gains have been underassessed that this under assessment is by reason of omission or failure to make a return under or by reason of failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment for any year that a notice containing all or any of the requirements of is served on the assessee within eight years from the end of the year of assessment that the Income Tax Officer has recorded his reasons for issuing the notice and the Commissioner is satisfied on such reasons recorded that it is a fit case for issue of such notice The notices issued by the Income Tax Officer in the case before us undoubtedly fulfil conditions and The dispute in the appeal relates merely to the fulfilment of the two branches of the first condition and that immediately raises the question about the true import of the expression has reason to believe in a It contemplates existence of reasons on which the belief is founded and not merely a belief in the existence of reasons inducing the belief in other words the Income Tax Officer must on information at his disposal believe that income has been underassessed by reason of failure fully and truly to disclose all material facts necessary for assessment There are on the record the reports of the Income Tax Officer in which the belief is expressly set out Had the Income Tax Officer reason to believe that by reason of failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment for the three years in question there had resulted underassessment The learned Trial judge after setting out the evidence held that the Income Tax Officer had materials before him showing that the company trading from year to year disclosed that it had been systematically carrying on a trade in the sale of shares and securities <ORG> observed that the use of the expression the true intention behind the sale of shares used in the report made by the Income Tax Officer under to the Commissioner may lack directness but that deficiency of language was not sufficient to enable the company to contend in view of the circumstances alleged that there was no failure to disclose facts being complained of <ORG> also observed On the facts as stated by the Income Tax Officer it is clear that there had been a failure to disclose the fact that the respondent was a dealer in shares and what the Income Tax Officer meant by the language used by him was that the respondent had not disclosed that the sale of shares had been of the nature of a trading sale made in pursuance of an intention to put certain capital assets into another form But it is contended on behalf of the company that the finding is based on no materials and to that plea I may advert The company in its petition for the issue of a writ contended by paragraph that the notices were ultra vires and illegal and that the Income Tax Officer was not invested with jurisdiction to proceed thereunder inter alia for the reason that the pretended notice was issued without the existence of the necessary conditions precedent which confers jurisdiction under aforementioned whether before or after amendment in The company filed appeals before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner which were rejected in September and the assessments were confirmed The company thereafter filed a second appeal before <ORG> which appeals are now pending I have reasons to believe that by reason of the omission or failure of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessments the income profits or and gains chargeable to income tax had been underassessed The said reports were made and notices issued in respect of all the three years mentioned in the petition and copies of the report and notice for one of such years are included in the schedule hereto annexed and marked A By these averments the Income Tax Officer asserted a that he had reasons to believe that by reason of the omission or failure of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment income chargeable to income tax has been underassessed and that he had recorded his reasons in that behalf in the three reports submitted by him to the Commissioner that in the course of the assessment proceeding for the year it was represented on behalf of the company that the sales of shares in that year were casual transactions and were in the nature of mere change in investments that in the orders of assessment for the years and passed in April profits earned by sale of shares held by the company were included in the total assessable income of the company it having been discovered that the company was in fact carrying on the business of selling shares contrary to its earlier representations and that by its Memorandum and Articles of Association the company was authorised to carry on the business of diverse kinds specified in sub cls Whereas by a mere bald assertion made by the company in its petition it was averred that the conditions precedent to the exercise of jurisdiction to re assess did not exist the Income Tax Officer stated in his rejoinder that he had reasons to believe that income bad been underassessed and he also set out the grounds on which that belief was founded The existence of the reasons to believe that income was underassessed has as already observed not been challenged nor is the court concerned with the question whether the materials may be regarded by a court before which a dispute is raised sufficient to sustain the belief entertained by the Income Tax Officer It is clear that the Income Tax Officer asserted on oath that when he issued the notice for reassessment he had reasons to believe that income of the company had been underassessed and he set out the reasons in support of the belief It was said that the Income Tax Officer knew that the company was an investment corporation that the shares held by the company were sold from time to time and that profits were earned by the sale of those shares and that on these materials the Income Tax Officer might have held that the company was a dealer in shares but if he did not draw that inference the under assessment if any was not by reason of failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts Counsel submitted that the condition of the exercise of jurisdiction under is failure to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment and not failure to instruct the Income Tax Officer about the legal inference to be drawn from the facts disclosed The duty imposed by the Act upon the tax payer is to make a full and true disclosure of all material facts necessary for the assessment he is not required to inform <ORG> as to what legal inference should be drawn from the facts disclosed by him nor to advise him on questions of law There is no evidence that the Memorandum and Articles of Association referred to in para of the affidavit were produced in the course of the assessment of the relevant years nor is there evidence to show that it was disclosed that the acquisition of shares was incidental to the business activities and out of the surplus assets of the company and that the same were sold at profit as opportunities arose There is also no ground for assuming that these facts must have been known to the Income Tax Officer There is no evidence on the record that the Memorandum and Articles of Association were ever produced before the Income Tax Officer in the course of proceedings for assessment There were materials before the Income Tax Officer on which he had reason to believe that by reason of the failure of the company to fully and truly disclose material facts its income was underassessed Whether on these facts a conclusion that in fact the company was carrying on the business of trading in shares could be founded is at this stage entirely immaterial If there was reason to believe the alleged inadequacy of the materials on which the belief could be founded is of no moment The Income Tax Officer has commenced proceedings for reassessment by issuing notices against the company and he has placed all the materials before the court on which it could be said that he had reason to believe that income of the company had been underassessed by reason of failure on the part of the company to disclose fully and truly all material facts relating to the assessment and if on those materials the Income Tax Officer could hold the belief which he says he did the court in seeking to hold an enquiry into the question whether the Income Tax Officer notwithstanding his affidavit and materials placed in support thereof had reason to hold the requisite belief would be arrogating to itself jurisdiction which it does not possess But if the existence of the conditions is asserted by the authority entrusted with the power and the materials on the record prima facie Support the existence of such conditions an enquiry whether the authority could not have reasonably held the belief which he says he had reason to hold and he did hold is in my judgment barred In that view the proper order to pass in this appeal would be one of dismissal with costs In view of the majority opinion the appeal is allowed with costs here and below
