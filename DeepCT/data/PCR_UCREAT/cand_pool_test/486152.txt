The plaintiffs are a partnership firm carrying on business under the name and style of The plaintiffs asked for a decree for permanent Injunction to restrain the defendants from using the mark Elora or any other similar mark which is an infringement of the plaintiffs registered trade mark and to prevent them from passing off their goods as the goods of the plaintiffs The defendants contested the suit He granted a permanent injunction in so far as infringement of the registered trade mark was concerned On one side there is in addition to these words a visual representation of a factoy with the words <ORG> written in small letters On the evidence produced by the plaintiffs the learned judge came to the conclusion that the infringement of the trade mark is established In the appeal and cross objections three questions arise for decision But there is a difference between statute law relating to trade marks and the passing off action for while registration of relevant mark itself gives title to the registered owner the onus in a passing off action lies upon the plaintiff to establish the existence of the business reputation which he seeks to protect As <NAME> puts it THEgist of the conception of passing off is that the goods are in effect telling a falsehood about themselves are saying something about themselves which is calculated to mislead As <NAME> said in <NAME> <ORG> All Iam satisfied that there is discoverable in all those cases in which the court has intervened the factor that there was a common field of activity in which however remotely And it is accepted that a reference to the plaintiff as a trade source may be inferred in some circumstances where he is not known by the name as for instance where it is his trade mark that is known There is risk of confusion because they occupy same areas of the trade in question watches as in this case But everybody is agreed that if the line of business is same or allied there is an immense potential for confusion deception and temporal harm It takes years sometimes generations of patient and self abnegating toil and investment to develop and gain the advantage of goodwill It was held that the traders engaged in a field of business activity had locus standi to obtain an injunction to restrain a competitive producer from making deceptive statements as to the place of origin or similar falsehood Counsel for the defendants argued that there was no confusion amongst the dealers in the market as the evidence shows and therefore no case of passing off is made out The defendants have no right to represent their business as the business of the plaintiffs Thus it includes not only property in the strict sense but also name per <ORG> trade reputation at per <ORG> Alternatively these last mentioned cases may be viewed as cases in which the plaintiff proprietory right to his name and trade reputation is invaded by conduct of the defendant which anticipates the plaintiff exercise of that right in a field of activity which is sufficiently close to the plaintiff present activities and which he may wish at some future time to enter here there are both a common field of activity and a real and tangible risk of damage In Farewell <NAME> said THEREmust be evidence either of damage already committed or the circumstances must be such as that the court can properly come to the conclusion that there is a serious risk a real tangible risk of damage in the future In the present case there is an untrue representation There is trustworthy evidence that the registered trade mark Elora of the plaintiffs is known to the trade and the word Elora lurks and lingers in the mind of the customers minded to obtain goods of clause There is a real and tangible risk of damage the field of activity being common The registered proprietor has the exclusive right to use the trade mark in relation the goods in respect of which it is registered The interest in the exclusive right and use of trade marks is recognised by the law on grounds that are in part akin to the prevention of fraud and in part the protection of property right They have confined themselves to clocks and wrist watches Fourthly there is no reasonable prospect that the inquiry would reach a positive result <NAME> says that account of profits is an equitable remedy and the court has a discretion whether or not to grant it I do not think there is any ground to allow the application as none of the conditions of rule Code of Civil Procedure is satisfied On the cross objections I make no order as to costs
