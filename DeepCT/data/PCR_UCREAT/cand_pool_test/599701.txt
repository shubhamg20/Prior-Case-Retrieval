The order was challenged by petitioners by a writ petition under Art The interests of weaker sections of society which are a first charge on the <ORG>s and the <ORG> have to be adjusted with the interests of the community as a whole There are certain sections of Indian society such as Christians Jains Muslims etc The object of making a special provision for the advancement of castes or communities is to carry out the Directive Principle enshrined in Art The judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR Since <ORG> has been endeavouring to make a special provision for the advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens in the <ORG> of Mysore under Article of the Constitution and every time when an order is passed in that behalf its validity has been challenged by writ proceedings Four previous orders passed in that behalf were challenged by writ proceedings taken against the <ORG> under Art and in substance is a fraud on the power conferred by the said Article on the <ORG> These allegations are denied by the <ORG> and it is urged on its behalf that the classification made is both rational and intelligible and the reservation prescribed by the order is fully justified by Art On the th July the <ORG> issued an order that all the communities excepting the Brahmin community fell within the definition of educationally and socially Backward Classes and Scheduled Castes and Tribes and provided for the said communities and tribes reservation of of seats in educational institutions The order issued by the <ORG> on the th July was challenged before <ORG> and it appears that the <ORG> conceded before <ORG> that there was a drafting error in the Government Order and so it did not press its case that the said order was valid In the result the writ petitions filed to challenge the validity of the order succeeded and the impugned order was quashed <ORG> upheld the pleas raised by the petitioners and quashed the impugned A I Mysore It appears that on the whole <ORG> did not feel satisfied that the scheme of the special provision made by the impugned order was invalid but it thought that the allotment of seats under the provisions of the said order in favour of the other Backward Classes in excess of reserved for them otherwise than by open competition amounted to an unreasonable restraint on the fundamental right of other citizens and therefore was invalid This Order begins with the observation that <ORG> has come to the conclusion that in the present circumstances the only practicable method of classifying the Backward Classes in the <ORG> is on the basis of castes and communities and it has specified the criteria which should be adopted for determining the educational and social backwardness of the communities The order then examines the question as to the percentage which should be reserved and it rejects the <ORG> recommendation of reservation of all told on the ground that such a large percentage of reservation would not be in the larger interests of the <ORG> <NAME> The problem raised for our decision by the present petitions involves the consideration of sociological social and economic factors and so before dealing with the contentions raised by the parties before us it is necessary to set out briefly the material which has been adduced before us On January the President appointed <ORG> by virtue of the power conferred on him under Art The <ORG> was required to investigate the conditions of socially and educationally backward classes within the territory of India and the difficulties under which they labour and to make recommendations as to the steps that should be taken by the <ORG> or any <ORG> to remove such difficulties and to improve their condition It appears that having considered several criteria which may be relevant in determining which classes are backward the <ORG> ultimately decided to treat the status of caste as an important factor in that behalf and it is on that basis that it proceeded to make a list of Backward Communities which were specified in Volume of the Report In this communication it was observed that <ORG> had considered the said question and was of opinion that a uniform policy should be followed all over the country at least in <ORG> institutions This Report proceeds on the basis that higher social status has generally been accorded on the basis of caste for centuries and so it takes the view that the low social position of any community is therefore mainly due to the caste system According to the Report there are ample reasons to conclude that social backwardness is based mainly on racial tribal caste and denominational differences even though economic backwardness might have contributed to social backwardness Article provides that nothing in this Article or in clause of Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward Classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes This order was struck down by <ORG> and the decision of <ORG> was confirmed by this Court in appeal on the ground that the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles and were not controlled by any exception and that since there was no provision under Art Thus there is no doubt that Art define Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively but there is no clause defining socially and educationally backward classes of citizens and so in determining the question as to whether a particular provision has been validly made under Art It seems fairly clear that the back and classes of citizens for whom special provision is authorised to be made are by Art It was realised that in the Indian society there were other classes of citizens who were equally or may be somewhat less backward than the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and it was thought that some special provision ought to be made even for them It is not either social or educational but it is both social and educational and that takes us to the question as to how social and educational backwardness has to be determined Let us take the question of social backwardness first The <ORG> has no doubt incidentally referred to the general economic condition of the community as a contributory factor but the manner in which it has enumerated the backward any more backward classes leaves no room for doubt that the predominant if not the sole test that weighed in their minds was the test of caste In its preamble the order of July clearly and unambiguously states that the <ORG> had come to the conclusion that in the present circumstances the only practicable method of classifying the Backward Classes in the <ORG> is on the basis of castes and communities and the <ORG> Government accepts this test It is true that in support of the inclusion of the Lingayats amongst the Backward Classes the order refers to some other factors but neither the Report of <ORG>s nor the orders passed by the <ORG> Government on July and July afford any indication as to how any test other than that of the caste was applied in deciding the question If the <ORG> average is per thousand a community which satisfies the said test or is just below the said test cannot be regarded as backward The <ORG> has decided otherwise and in doing so the <ORG> has taken the view that the figures arrived at by the <ORG> should be corrected to the nearest integer as in the nature of things says the order of July it is not possible to attain absolute mathematical precision in making such assessments This conclusion is stated merely as a conclusion and no data or reasons are cited in support of it That takes us to the question about the extent of the special provision which it would be competent to the <ORG> to make under Art which contains a directive principle provides that the <ORG> shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and in particular of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes and shall protect them from social injustice and all form of exploitation There can be no doubt that the object of making a special provision for the advancement of the castes or communities there specified is to carry out the directive principle enshrined in Art authorises the <ORG> to take adequate steps to achieve the object which it has in view The teamed Advocate General however suggests that the absence of any limitation on the <ORG> power to make an adequate special provision indicates that if the problem of backward classes of citizens and Schedule a Caste and Tribes in any given <ORG> is of such a magnitude that it requires the reservation of all seats in higher educational institutions it would be open to the <ORG> to take that course While it is necessary that the demand for higher education which is thus increasing from year to year must be adequately met and properly channelised we cannot overlook the fact that in meeting that demand standards of higher education in <ORG> must not be lowered Therefore in considering the question about the propriety of the reservation made by the impugned order we cannot lose sight of the fact that the reservation is made in respect of higher university education In this connection it would be relevant to mention that <ORG> which considered the problem of the assistance to backward communities has observed that the percentage of reservation shall not exceed a third of the total number of seats and it has added that the principle of reservation may be adopted for a period often years The learned Advocate General has suggested that reservation of a large number of seats for the weaker sections of the society should not affect either the depth or efficiency of scholarship at all and in support of this argument he has relied on the observations made by <ORG> that it found no complaint in the States of Madras Andhra Travancore Cochin and Mysore where the system of recruiting candidates from other Backward Classes to the reserve quota has been in vogue for several decades The interests of weaker sections of society which are a first charge on the states and the <ORG> have to be adjusted with the interests of the community as a whole When it is said about an executive action that it is a fraud on the Constitution it does not necessarily mean that the action is actuated by mala fides However we may observe that if any <ORG> adopts such a measure it may afford relief to and assist the advancement of the Backward Classes in the <ORG> because backwardness social and educational is ultimately and primarily due to poverty Whilst we are dealing with this question it would be relevant to add that the provisions of Art which fell to be considered in the case of <NAME> <ORG> <NAME> In the result we allow the writ petitions and direct that an appropriate writ or order or direction should be issued restraining the three respondents from giving effect to the impugned order in terms of the prayer made in clauses i and ii of paragraph of the petitions The petitioners would be entitled to their costs one set of hearing fees
