The opponents in their written statement in addition to objecting to the plaintiffs claim on its merits took the point that the suit should be stayed and the matters in dispute be referred to the arbitration of <ORG> as the parties were members of that <ORG> and the contracts in dispute contained a provision that they were executed according to the Rules of <ORG> by which each party was bound The applicants contend that this decision is wrong in law and ask us to interfere in revision <ORG> it may be mentioned decided that it had no jurisdiction to interfere where ha held that the word <ORG> in Section of the Indian Arbitration Act meant in Bombay this High <ORG> in view of the definition of the words the <ORG> in Clause a of Section of the Act and he relies upon this as establishing that a Judge of the Small Causes <ORG> has no power to stay the suit that was before him He pointed out that the definition of the <ORG> in Section a is subject to a proviso of repugnancy in the subject or context and he held that the provisions of Section and the decisions under the corresponding law in England clearly showed that the <ORG> contemplated in this section is the <ORG> before which a suit is pending provided that the suit is one to which the Act would apply under Section namely that it is a suit which could whether with leave or otherwise be instituted in a Presidency town in respect of its subject matter In regard to the words ins a submission to which this Act applies he held that those words are intended to provide for the case of a suit filed in an up country <ORG> in an area to which the Act has not been applied though part of the cause of action has arisen in a Presidency town We agree with the views of <ORG> and of <ORG> as just mentioned Therefore if Section of the Indian Arbitration Act is applicable to a suit in <ORG> at Bombay in our opinion the Judge before whom that suit is pending has jurisdiction to stay the suit under that section This is under the power conferred by Section of the Act just mentioned as amended by Act I of and the second proviso to Section of the Civil Procedure Code of enacts that All rules heretofore made by any of the said <ORG> under Section of the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act shall be deemed to have been validly made There is in the first place nothing contained in Section which is in substantial opposition to the provisions in paragraph of the Second Schedule There is a minor difference as to the stage when an application to stay the suit may be made namely that under Section it may be made at any time after appearance and before filing a written statement or taking any other steps in the proceedings whereas under paragraph it may be made at the earliest possible opportunity and in all cases where issues are settled at or before such settlement Furthermore it is to be noted that the first paragraph of Section of the Indian Arbitration Act which says that Sections to of the former Code of Civil Procedure shall not apply to any submission or arbitration to which the provisions of this Act for the time being apply does not cover this particular paragraph of the Second Schedule because there was no corresponding provision in the Code of and the paragraph was newly enacted in the Code of The next point is that the suit was in relation to cross eon tracts and the decision in <NAME> <NAME> Sind was cited that where cross contracts have been made for the purpose of fixing the liability of the earlier contract the rights and liabilities of the parties were determined and there is no matter in dispute in regard to those contracts which could be referred to arbitration The opponents in their written statement said that there were two additional contracts which were not cross contracts and the plaintiffs said that those were not included in the suit because no loss had been incurred in regard to those contracts The point has not been specifically gone into the judgment of the lower Court and as we can decide this application upon another ground I think that it is one on which we had better abstain from expressing any opinion The third point is that in fact there is no submission to arbitration by the contrasts suit it la pointed out by Mr <NAME> that the objects of the <ORG> are stated in the Rules of the Grain Merchants <ORG> This says The <ORG> does not take in hand matters relating to difference but if the parties wish to appoint arbitrators that can be done Reliance however is placed by Mr <NAME> for the opponent on a Resolution of <ORG> dated July which was communicated to members of the <ORG> by a circular Because the <ORG> has got the powers to arbitrate and the Rule says to members that the powers being there you have now to go to the <ORG> and it will exercise the powers it possesses Further more the Resolution in itself is very vague and it is certainly open to question whether it really has the meaning that is put upon it by the opponent If it was intended that in all cases a dispute about differences should be referred to arbitration by the <ORG> then that should have been clearly stated in a way FawcM that would leave no doubt about that being the meaning of the rule or resolution Furthermore there should in such a case obviously be some provision made as to the manner in which arbitrators should be appointed and so on because as stated in paragraph of the Second Schedule of the Code the manner of appointment of arbitrators is a matter to be settled by agreement between the parties and it is only when difficulties arise about appointment according to the agreement that a <ORG> exercises its power of appointment The view of the lower <ORG> that there was in fact a submission by the applicants to arbitration is in our opinion on the existing materials entirely unjustified and the case is one in which we think we should interfere under a Civil Procedure Code as in this view the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to pass the order it did Accordingly we set aside the order staying the suit and direct the Court concerned to dispose of the suit according to law The suit reached a hearing for the first time on September when it is stated in the notes of the learned Judge that defences were filed These defences were nine in number
