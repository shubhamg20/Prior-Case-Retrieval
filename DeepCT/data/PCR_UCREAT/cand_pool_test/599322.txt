HEADNOTE Under of the Central Excise Rules made under the Central Excise and Salt Act <ORG> issued a notification exempting cotton fabrics from excise duty Later the excise authorities thought the goods were not of the description exempted under the notification and on November two notices were issued calling upon the respon dents to make certain payments one under A and the other under of the Rules a The expression levy is not used in the Act or the Rules as meaning actual collection because of the Act use If the literal construction is accepted then in a case where an assessee in collusion manages to have a very petty amount of duty assessed he can if he paid the amount effectively plead limitation of three months but when no duty has been levied there would be no period of limitation a result which would be anomalous Therefore the proper interpretation to be placed on the expression paid is sought to have been paid Rule provides for the time and manner of payment of duty that is clandestinely and without assessment but in this case there is no such clandestine removal without assessment is a penal provision applicable where there is evasion of payment of duty since the party is also made liable to a penalty and confiscation Therefore the demands having been made long after the expiry of the period of three months referred to in the demands are not valid JUDGMENT CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by certificate is directed against the judgment and order of <ORG> of <ORG> dated July confirming the decision dated August of the learned Single Judge in Miscellaneous petition No of quashing the two notices of demand dated November issued by the second appellant as also the notice dated December issued by the first appellant for payment of the amount covered by the said two notices Under of the Central Excise and Salt Act hereinafter to be referred as the Act duty is Imposed on all excisable goods produced or manufactured in India at the rates set forth in the First Schedule to the Act Section of the Act provides that excise duty is to be collected in such manner as may be prescribed by rules made under the Act Rule gives power to <ORG> to exempt by notification subject to such conditions as may be specified therein any excisable goods from whole or any part of duty leviable on such goods The exemption granted in respect of this item and another item was withdrawn by <ORG> with effect from July by notification Ex Periodically they used to send to the factory such quan tities of grey cloth as were required after filling in the necessary forms prescribed by the rules and after obtaining the necessary permission in the manner prescribed by the rules from the Excise Inspector Incharge of the textile mill There is again no dispute that in each of these A I forms the company had shown and made a declara tion that the excise duty payable on the goods governed by the forms was nil There is no controversy that in each of the A forms filed by the respondents during the period July and July the Excise Inspector Incharge <ORG> has made an assessment in the appropriate portion of those forms showing the rate of duty and the amount of total duty payable as nil and has affixed his signature under such Assessment Memorandum The respondents were advised that if they are aggrieved with the decision they may go up in appeal to the Collector of <ORG> Bombay I contesting validity of the notices dated November and December They objected to the demand on the ground that the notices were illegal and neither rule nor rule A gave power to the authorities to issue such notices As there was no favourable response from the appellants they filed the writ petition out of which these proceedings arise in <ORG> to quash Exhibits and The respondents contended before <ORG> that neither rule nor rule A gave power to the appellants to issue the demand notices Their stand was that if at all it was rule that applied and as the demands have been made long after the period of three months prescribed in the said rule the notices were illegal and void On behalf of the appellants it was urged that rule has no application as that rule will apply only when duties and charges have been short levied We have already referred to the fact that the rules have been made by <ORG> under of the Act Time and manner of payment of duty No excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the Collector in this behalf whether for consumption export or manufacture of any other commodity in or outside such place until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed in these Rules or as the Collector may require and except on presentation of an application in the proper form and on obtaining the permission of the proper officer on the form Provided that such goods may be deposited without payment of duty in a store room or other place of storage approved by the Collector under rule or rule or in a warehouse appointed or licensed under rule or may be exported under bond as provided in rule Provided further that such goods may be removed on part payment of duty leviable thereon if the Central Government by notification in the Official Gazette allow the goods to be so removed under rule Provided also that the Collector may if he fit instead of requiring payment of duty in respect of each separate consignment of goods removed from the place or premises specified in this behalf or from a store room or warehouse duly approved appointed or licensed by him keep with any person dealing in such goods an account current of the duties payable thereon and such account shall be settled at internal not exceeding one month and the account holder shall periodically make deposit therein sufficient in the opinion of the Collector to cover the duty due on the goods intended to be removed from the place of production curing manufacture or storage If any excisable goods are in contravention of sub rule i deposited in or removed from any place specified therein the producer or manufacturer thereof shall pay the duty leviable on such goods upon written demand made by the proper officer whether such demand is delivered personally to him or is left at his dwelling house and shall also be liable to a penalty which may extend to two thousand rupees and such goods shall be liable to confiscation Recovery of duties or charges short levied or erroneously refunded When duties or charges have been short levied through inadvertence error collusion or mis construction on the part of an officer or through misstatement as to the quantity description or value of such goods on the part of the owner or when any such duty or charge after having been levied has been owing to any such cause erroneously refunded the person chargeable with the duty or charge so short levied or to whom such refund has been erroneously made shall pay the deficiency or pay the amount paid to him in excess as the case may be on written demand by the proper officer being made within three months from the date on which the duty or charge was paid or adjusted in the owners account current if any or from the date of making the refund Clearance on payment duty When the manufacturer desires to remove goods on payment of duty either from the place or a premise specified under rule or from a store room or other place of storage approved by the Collector under rule he shall make application in triplicate unless otherwise by rule or order required to the proper officer in the proper Form and shall deliver it to the officer at least twelve hours or such other period as may be elsewhere prescribed or as the Collector may in any particular case require or allow before it is intended to remove the goods The officer shall thereupon assess the amount of duty due on the goods and on production of evidence that this sum has been paid into the <ORG> or paid in the account of the Collector in <ORG> or <ORG> or has been despatched to the <ORG> by money order shall allow the goods to be cleared Dr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellants urged that going by a plain reading of rule it is clear that the said rule will apply only to cases when an assessment has been made that same amount is due as duty and when the said amount so assessed has been paid by the party concerned In this case he pointed out there has been no doubt an order of assessment passed when the goods were cleared by the party but that order of assessment was not one making the party liable to pay any duty on the other hand it was an order of nil assessment under which the party was to pay no duty whatsoever In this connection he placed very great reliance on the concluding part of rule where a period of three months by way of limitation has been provided for calling upon the party to pay the deficiency and the period of three months is to be calculated from the date on which the duty or charge was paid He stressed that the use of the expression paid clearly indicates that some duty must have been actually paid by a party on a particular date and if that were not so it would be difficult to calculate the period of three months within which a party can be called upon to make good the deficiency power to issue such notices under rule So read it is pointed out that the proper interpretation to be placed on the word paid is that it has been used to denote the stage or time when the duty or charge ought to have been paid <ORG> counsel further pointed out that rule A will apply only to those cases where no specific provision for collection of duty or any deficiency in duty has been made by the rules and that will apply also to any other sum of On these grounds both the counsel urged that <ORG> was right in holding that rule applies and that the notices having been issued beyond the period of three months are illegal and invalid The charging provision section i specifically says There shall be levied and collected in such a manner as may be prescribed the duty of excise It is to be noted that sub section i uses both the expressions levied and collected and that clearly show that the expression levy has not been used in the Act or the Rules as meaning actual collection The assessees challenged the validity of the demand on the same ground as before This now takes us to the question of proper interpretation to be placed on the expression short levied and paid in rule What is the meaning of the word paid in rule It is contended on behalf of the appellants that it means actually paid whereas according to the respondents it means ought to have been paid If this literal interpretation is placed on the expression paid in rule it is needless to state that it will support in a large measure the contention of Dr <NAME> that rule contemplates a short levy in the sense that the amount which falls short of the correct amount has been assessed and actually paid If this is appreciated and the context is considered it is apparent that there is an ambiguity in the meaning of the word paid It must be remembered that rule deals with recovery of duties or charges short levied or erroneously refunded through error or misconstruction on the part of an officer as such a case is specifically provided by rule Therefore in our opinion the proper interpretation to be placed on the expression paid is ought to have been paid Sub section of A dealt with cases of a person who has not been assessed before and he was required to make his own estimate of the tax payable by him and pay accordingly lm where on making the regular assessment the Income tax Officer finds that no payment of tax has been made in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this section interest calculated in the manner laid down in sub section shall be added to the tax as determined on the basis of the regular assessment He also admitted that he never made an estimate nor did he pay any advance tax whatsoever According to the assessee there was no st day of January of a financial year in which the tax was paid and there was no question of a short fall between eighty per cent of the tax payable on regular assessment and the amount paid because he Now how is that best done As we have earlier said sub section deals with a case in which tax has been paid and therefore it says that interest would be calculated from the st day of January in the financial year in which the tax was paid Those who paid the tax but a smaller amount and those who did not pay tax at all would then be put in the same position substantially which is obviously fair and was clearly intended Applying the above principles to the case on hand the expression paid in rule can be reasonably read as ought to have been paid That provision will apply even to cases where there has been a nil assessment in which case the entire duty later on assessed must be considered to be the duty There is also no difficulty in calculating the period of three months We have considered those decisions We do not see any reason to distinguish the above two cases one from the other Sub rule of rule provides for the time and the manner of payment of duty In this case there is no controversy that whenever goods were cleared by the respondents necessary applications had been made to the officer concerned and the latter had passed orders of assessment to nil duty In this case there is no such clandestine removal without assessment Though on certain other aspects there was a difference of view amongst the learned Judges on this aspect the decision is unanimous There is absolutely no material placed before us by the appellants which would justify the issue of the notice under rule To conclude rule A does not apply as the specific provision for collection of duty to cases like the one before us is specifically provided by rule nor does rule apply to the case on hand The demands having admittedly been made long after the expiry of the period of three months referred to in the said rule it follows that the demands were not valid
