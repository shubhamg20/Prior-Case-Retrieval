The Court only examines whether the price determined was with due regard to considerations provided by the statute and whether extraneous matters have been excluded from determination There is no colourable exercise of power There was every justification for the sale by public auction The petitioner challenges the validity of the <ORG> Sugar Levy order Levy order We concern ourselves neither with the policy nor with the rates But we do not totally deny ourselves the jurisdiction to inquire into the question in appropriate proceedings whether relevant considerations have gone in and irrelevant considerations kept out of the determination of the price For example if the legislature has decreed the pricing policy and prescribed the factors which should guide the determination of the price we wilt if necessary inquire into the question whether the policy and the factors are present to the mind of the authorities specifying the price We will not deluge ourselves with more facts and figures The assembling of the raw materials and the mechanics of the price fixation are the concern of the executive and we leave it to them And we will not revaluate the considerations even if the prices are demonstrably injurious to some manufacturers or producers The <ORG> will of course examine if there is any hostile discrimination The <ORG> only examines whether the price determined was with due regard to considerations provided by the statute And whether extraneous matters have been excluded from determination If fair price is to be fixed leaving a reasonable margin of profit there is never any question of infringment of fundamental right to carry on business by imposing reasonable restrictions In determining the reasonableness of a restriction imposed by law in the field of industry trade or commerce it has to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those who are engaged in these are alleging loss after the imposition of law will not render the law unreasonable Since these two decisions have not been referred to in the <ORG> case we should refer this case to a larger bench for decision It is true that there is no express reference to <ORG> and <ORG> in the judgment in <ORG> We agree with this conclusion and see no reason for reconsideration As to the grievance of the petitioner that the <ORG> has made profit by the sale of Khandsari sugar at public auction we perused the counter affidavit of the <ORG> There was every justification for the sale by public auction We have no reason to doubt the explanation given by the <ORG> Government
