In the year a suit for partition was filed by the two daughters of <NAME> impleading the other sharers as defendants and <NAME> was impleaded as the sixth defendant There was a preliminary decree in that suit on the th August which was confirmed on appeal on the th April and a final decree was passed on the th January While these partition proceedings were going on <NAME> the mortgagee instituted the suit No of on foot of his mortgage to which he impleaded as parties the original mortgagor and also the heirs of <NAME> who were subsequently given up as they claimed the suit property by a title paramount There was a decree however against the mortgagor and ultimately after a final decree the property was sold and was purchased on the nd November by the decree holder the mortgagee and the property was duly delivered to him through <ORG> on the th October When this Execution Petition No of was filed and the petitioner went to obtain delivery of possession of the property there was obstruction by the present appellant to the delivery with the result the respondent filed an application in <ORG> for removing the obstruction and for delivery of possession of the property freed from the obstruction of the appellant On appeal the learned District Judge reversed the decision of the Subordinate Judge and allowed the petition The only question that has to be considered in this civil miscellaneous second appeal is whether the application of the respondent under Section Civil Procedure Code is maintainable or not It was contended on behalf of the respondent here and also in the courts below that the purchase by the appellant is affected by the doctrine of lis pendens and that therefore he is not entitled to resist the application of the respondent for delivery of possession This <ORG> has consistently taken the view that the doctrine of lis pendens should not be extended to cover an involuntary alienation in execution of a mortgage decree where the mortgage was prior to the suit relied on as operating to affect the rights of the parties under the provisions of Section of the Transfer of Property Act It seems to me however the argument has not much force In my opinion the view taken by the learned Subordinate Judge on this question is correct though he was not justified in dismissing the application altogether
