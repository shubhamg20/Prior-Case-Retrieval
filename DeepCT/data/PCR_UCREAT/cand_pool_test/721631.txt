JUDGMENT <NAME> The following question which is common to both the assessment years under reference namely and has been referred to this Court by <ORG> Delhi Bench A hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> under section of the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the New Act WHETHERon the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was legally justified in holding that it was a case of mere change of opinion on the same facts and the assessment could not be reopened under section of the Income tax Act The relevant facts may be briefly stated The assessed in the case is Her Highness Smt For these two assessments the income derived by the assessed by way of interest from bank deposits was treated as earned income and the Income tax Officer has also accepted the assessed claim of expenditure on the salary paid to her danghter in law the Revenue Audit staff working under the Comptroller and Auditor General of India while scrutinising these assessments brought to the notice of the <ORG> that the Income tax Officer had wrongly treated the interest income as business income and also that the Income tax Officer had wrongly allowed the assessed claim with regard to the salary paid to her da lighter in law The assessed objected to the reopening of the original assessments by the Income tax Officer and contended that all the relevant information was available to the Income tax Officer at the time of the original assessments and that the Income tax Officer after a consideration of the said material had come to a definite conclusion that the interest income constituted earned income and also that the salary paid by the assessed to her daughter in law was an allowable item of expenditure The Income tax Officer overruled the assessed objections on both these points and treated the interest income as unearned income and he also disallowed a major portion of the assessed claim regarding the salary paid to her daughter in law It was pointed out to the <ORG> that the scrutiny note of the <ORG> Audit staff and the letter written by the Inspecting Assisant Commissioner to the Income tax Officer were not brought to the notice of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and it was contended that these documents constituted information within the meaning of section of the New Act But at the latter instance the <ORG> has referred the question as already stated to this Court Before answering the question it would be necessary to state the scope of the question referred to us From the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner it would appear that the only contention which was urged before him on behalf of the assessed and which was in the nature of a preliminary objection was that the reopening of the original assessments under section of the New Act was illegal in view of the fact that the entire material relevant to the two assessments was before the Income tax Officer making the original assess ments that the latter had applied his mind to the material and duly considered that material and had come to certain conclusions which were incorporated in the assessment orders and that there was no new information which had come to his notice subsequently on the basis of which action under section of the New Act could be the salary paid to her daughter in law was allowable if so to what extent Although in the appeals before the <ORG> the assessed appears to have challenged the Income tax Officer finding in the re assesments on both these questions and although the <ORG> has also made some stray remarks while narrating the assessed contentions regarding the assessed claim the <ORG> has not decided the appeals on merit The <ORG> has decided the appeals entirely on the basis of the legal contention urged on behalf of the assessed namely that the scrutiny note of the <ORG> staff and the letter of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner did not constitute information within the meaning of section of the New Act Although the question framed by the <ORG> is in somewhat general terms the real question that arises for decision in this case is whether the scrutiny note of the <ORG> and the letter of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner constitute information within the meaning of section of the New Act Some more decisions have been brought to our notice by <NAME> learned counsel for the <ORG> which indicate that the divergence has not yet been reconciled interest income and salary paid to the assessed daughter in law were available before the Income tax Officer at the time of the original assessment and that it was only on a consideration of these facts that the Income tax Officer had come to the conclusion that the interest income was in the nature of earned income and also that the salary paid by the assessed to her daughter in law was in the nature of allow able expenditure But then the question arises what is the nature of the external source from which the Income tax Officer has derived instructions or knowledge concerning facts or particulars The <ORG> has taken the view that the external source should be the judgment of courts like <ORG> <ORG> or the <ORG> or of appellate bodies under the Income tax Act like <ORG> or the <ORG> and that the external source cannot be of the nature of the scrutiny note by the <ORG> Audit or a letter of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner There appears to be no decision directly on this point and there fore this question is in the nature of res integra It is no doubt true that no case has come to our notice in which proceedings under section of the New Act were initiated on the basis of the information or finding of a body or authority other than <ORG> <ORG> the <ORG> or the appellate authorities under the Income tax Act On the basis of this scrutiny note by the <ORG> the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner who had the authority under the Income tax Act to supervise the work of the Income tax Officer including the assessments made by them brought these errors pointed out by the Revenue Staff to the notice of the Income tax Officer It was only on the basis of the scrutiny note and the letter of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner that the Income tax Officer came to the conclusion that the interest income had been wrongly treated as earned income and that the full claim of the assessed regarding the salary paid to her daughter in law had been wrongly allowed Although this might amount to a change of opinion by the Income tax Officer it was not a change of opinion on his own initiative and on his own re consideration of the available material but it was a change of opinion brought about as a result of information from an external source which came into his possession subsequent to the original assessments This information in our view satisfies the tests laid down by <ORG> in <ORG> case as well as the case of Nawab Sir <NAME> Before concluding we may refer to another finding of the <ORG> which has apparently weighed with the <ORG> in rejecting the <ORG> appeals The <ORG> has held that the change of opinion was indirectly forced upon the I by the <ORG> and that the I was asked to do within a period of four years what the Commissioner of Income tax could do under section of the New Act within the time limit of only two years In <NAME> case <ORG> has observed as follows IT is then contended that sections and confer ample powers on the specified authorities to revise the Income tax Officer orders and to rectify mistakes respectively and so it would be legitimate to construe the word information in section strictly and to confine it to information in regard to facts or particulars If the word information in its plain grammatical meaning includes information as to facts as well as information as to the state of the law it would be unreasonable to limit it to information as to the facts on the extraneous consideration that some cases of assessment which need to be revised or rectified on the ground of mistake of law may conceivably be covered by sections and Besides the application of these two sections is subject to the limitations prescribed by them and so the fact that the said sections confer powers for revision or rectification would not be relevant and material in construing section As a result of our discussion we answer the question referred to us in the negative i for the <ORG> and against the assessed
