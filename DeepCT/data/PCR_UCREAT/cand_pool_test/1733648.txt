This petition challenges a decision of the Chief Judge of <ORG> Bombay by which he held that the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act had no jurisdiction to entertain the application made by the petitioner and other against the Naval Dockyard for payment of part of their wages illegally deducted On rules were framed by the Governor General under Section Government of India Act and these rules were issued in a notification and under this the wage scale for the lorry drivers was fixed at Rs It appears that these lorry drivers were asked to elect as to whether they would accept this wage scale and also if they did accept the wage scale was to operate from and they were paid Rs He therefore dismissed the appeal Mr <NAME> contention before us is that the Chief Judge should have heard the appeal on merits and should not have dismissed it on the preliminary ground that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain this particular application In order to decide this question we have carefully to bear in mind the nature of the jurisdiction that the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act exercises Under these circumstances there is no dispute between the employer and the employee as to the contract which regulates the conditions of service of employment The dispute is as to what the employee is entitled under that contract In that case the question that arose was whether the <ORG> had the jurisdiction to deter mine whether the contract was terminated us alleged by the employer or the contract was still subsisting as alleged by the employee and we held that the <ORG> had no such jurisdiction The question that now arises is in a sense different from the Question that arose in <NAME> case In our opinion the jurisdiction of the <ORG> is limited to decide what is contract in the sense of construing the contract in order to determine the liability of the employer to pay wages But when the employer and the employee come before him and rely on different contracts it is not Within his jurisdiction to decide which of the two contracts holds the field which of them is subsisting and under which of them the employer is liable to pay wages It is only when there is no dispute as to the contract that subsists and regulates the rights and liabilities of the parties that the jurisdiction of the <ORG> arises to determine the quantum of wages But when the very basis of the relationship is in dispute and in controversy the legislature did not intend that a Court of summary jurisdiction should decide that important question Now in this case it is clear that the parties are not agreed as to the contract which regulates their rights or liabilities and under which the liability of the employer arises to pay wages According to the employer there was a new contract entered in to prior to August and under that contract the liability of the employer was to pay only Rs It would be noticed that there is no dispute as to the quantum of wages Therefore what the <ORG> is called upon to decide is not the quantum of wages under the contract nor the question of illegal deduction under the contract but what it is called upon to decide is which is the connect subsisting between the master and the servant under which the liability to pay wages arises and in respect of which he has to determine the quantum of wages It should also be borne in mind that in this case the employee challenges the factum of the subsequent contract He also challenges the validity of that contract assum ing that that contract was arrived at Our decision merely amounts to this that this particular summary remedy given to the workmen under the Payment of Wages Act is denied to them in view of the issue that arises for determination Mr <NAME> has drawn our attention to the fact that the question of limitation may arise and that may defeat the claim of the employees We are cure that the civil <ORG> to which the employees will go will take into consideration the fact that the employees have been bona fide prosecuting the claim for wages in a <ORG> which has now been held had no jurisdiction
