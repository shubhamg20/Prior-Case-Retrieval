It is also asserted that the cartons used by the defendants and the plaintiff are absolutely distinct and different and there is no similarity between the two In this case it is contended that the machine printed carton which are in question in which pencils are sold is covered by Section of the Copyright Act inasmuch as the carton is an original artistic work it is further contended that being a original artistic work copyright subsists therein and the plaintiff is entitled to sue for infringement of the copyright in the cartons A look at the carton of the defendant shows that in addition to the various colours printed thereon there are the following words printed on it <ORG> Hb Hexagonal Deluxe Pencils Product No It is clear that both the cartons are printed products produced by a printing machine Inasmuch as the only document which has been filed is the machine printed carton it must be taken that the document produced in <ORG> is the original and it has to be determined whether copyright can subsist therein under the Copyright Act In that case it was contended by counsel for the plaintiff company that the <NAME> label is an artistic work within the meaning of Section of the Copyright Act Justice <NAME> who decided the case said that the label was an artistic work it appears to me that there was an admission in that The Court came to the conclusion that two designs in question were almost exactly similar It became obvious to me and it is now A penis of the case indicates that the said passing off case was decided on the basis of concession made before the <ORG> In <ORG> case there was no consideration of the question whether a mechanically reproduced label is by itself a good subject matter of copyright or not It appears to have been assumed in that case that there was in existence an original copyrighted design executed by an artist where in this case we have to proceed on the basis that the printed carton placed before the <ORG> is the only original Further even on the pencils there is no indication of claim to copyright whether with respect to the pattern on its skin or otherwise The Court held It the mark is a drawing and Section i a expressly classifies drawings on proper subject matter of artistic copyright irrespective of artistic quality found not to give any support to the contention which has been raised in this case that a mechanically printed carton is good subject matter of copyright There is dear distinction between CAMLIN FLORA and NATIONAL ELORA There is no force in this contention as the judgment does not say so In <ORG> Supra there was no finding of fact that the matter ton the containers was a copyrightable artistic work and the case seems to have proceeded upon the copyright certificate only arid if that judgment can be said to say that what is printed on tins by a printing process Printing process essentially not involving any skill or labor of a natural person then I respectfully disagree from that judgment That case related to Trade and Merchandise Marks Act and the questions which were considered in that case related to assignment of copyright and vesting of copyright and the duration of copyrights The question decided in that case was not whether a mechanically reproduced printed paper carton can be said to be copyrightable It was next contended by the counsel for the plaintiff that the words FLORA and ELORA to be found on the respective cartons of the plaintiff and the defendants should be seen ant on an examination it would be seen that the attempt has been made to write the word ELORA in the same calligraphics style There is no doubt that the alphabet and alphabet in the plaintiff Flora as appearing on the carton of the plaintiff has been written in the same calligraphic style as the alphabet and in ELORA on the defendants carton it should be held that there is an attempt to pass off the goods I am of the view that the two cartons have different colour combinations and there are differences in the colour There are differences in the composition on the printed matter and therefore carton of the defendant cannot on the basis of similarity of colour combination be said to an attempt to pass off the defendants carton as cartons of the plaintiff No doubt it is so but this principle does not apply in this case as the difference in the cartons sufficiently distinguish the two cartons Mr <NAME> in reply said that the misspelling of the word Ellora as Ellora by the defendant and copying of the call graphical style of writing the alphabet and alphabet show an intention to deceive and to passing off I am of the view that there is no precedent binding on me to hold that a mechanically reproduced printed carton is capable of being subject matter of copyright As regards the contention of the plaintiff that defendants have attempted to pass of their cartons as cartons of the plaintiff I hold that taking into account the entirety of the carton its colour scheme the subject matter printed thereon and keeping view the similarities in the caligraphic style of the alphabets and and the apparent differences it can not be said that there is any likelihood of confusion between the cartons of the defendants and the cartons of the plaintiff as the differences mentioned earlier outweight the similarities IN view of what is stated herein above and in view of my finding that there is non copyrightable subject matter in mechanically produced printed cartons the only right being claimed in the suit being on the basis that the mechanically reproduced printed carton has copyrightable subject matter in it the instant suit for infringement of copyright is not maintainable
