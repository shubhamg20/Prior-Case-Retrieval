Preliminary objection Fundamen tal right of freedom of speech and expression Law imposing restrictions for securing public order and maintenance of public safety Validity Severability of Act Madras Mainte nance of Public Order Act XXIII of A Validity The facts are set out in the judgment The Judgment of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> delivered a separate judgment speech and expression conferred on him by article a of the Constitution and he challenges the validity of section A of the impugned Act as being void under article of the Constitution by reason of its being inconsistent with his fundamental right aforesaid The Advocate General of Madras appearing on be half of the respondents raised a preliminary objection not indeed to the jurisdiction of this <ORG> to entertain the application under article but to the petitioner resort ing to this <ORG> directly for such relief in the first instance He contended that as a matter of orderly proce dure the petitioner should first resort to <ORG> at Madras which under article of the Constitution has concurrent jurisdiction to deal with the matter He cited criminal revision petitions under section of the Crimi nal Procedure Code applications for bail and applications for transfer under section of the Civil Procedure Code as instances where concurrent jurisdiction having been given in certain matters to <ORG> and the <ORG> of a lower grade a rule of practice has been established that a party should proceed first to the latter <ORG> for relief before resorting to <ORG> <ORG> to issue certain writs for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III or for any other purpose as part of its general jurisdiction Turning now to the merits there can be no doubt that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of propa gation of ideas and that freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation with which we are not concerned in this case saves the operation of any existinglaw in so far as it relates to any matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> or the circulation sale or distribution in the Province of Madras or any part thereof of any document or class of documents is a law relating to any matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> The impugned Act was passed by <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred upon it by section of the Government of India Act read with Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to that Act which com prises among other matters public order It was said that an enactment which provided for drastic remedies like preventive detention and ban on newspapers must be taken to relate to matters affecting the security of the <ORG> rather than trivial offences like rash driving or an affray But whatever ends the impugned Act may have been intended to subserve and whatever aims its framers may have had in view its application and scope cannot in the ab sence of limiting words in the statute itself be restricted to those aggravated forms of prejudicial activity which are calculated to endanger the security of the <ORG> The Government of India Act nowhere used the expression security of the <ORG> though it made provision under section for dealing with crimes of violence intend ed to overthrow the Government As <NAME> in his Criminal Law of England observes Unlawful assemblies riots insurrections rebellions levying of war are offences which run into each other and are not capable of being marked off by perfectly defined boundaries All of them have in common one feature namely that the normal tranquillity of a civilised society is in each of the cases mentioned disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it Though all these offences thus involve disturbances of public tranquil lity and are in theory offences against public order the difference between them being only a difference of degree yet for the purpose of grading the punishment to be inflict ed in respect of them they may be classified into different minor categories as has been done by Vol Similarly the Constitution in formulating the varying criteria for permissible legislation imposing restrictions on the fundamental rights enumerated in article has placed in a distinct category those offences against public order which aim at undermining the security of the <ORG> or overthrowing it and made their prevention the sole justification for legislative abridge ment of freedom of speech and expression that is to say nothing less than endangering the foundations of the <ORG> or threatening its overthrow could justify curtailment of the rights to freedom of speech and expression while the right of peaceable assembly sub clause and the right of association sub clause may be restricted under clauses and of article in the interests of public order which in those clauses includes the security of the <ORG> The Constitution thus requires a line to be drawn in the field of public order or tranquillity marking off may be roughly the boundary between those serious and aggravated forms of public disorder which are calculated to endanger the security of the <ORG> and the relatively minor breaches of the peace of a purely local significance treating for this purpose differences in degree as if they were differ ences in kind It is also worthy of note that the word sedition which occurred in article of the Draft Constitution pre pared by <ORG> was deleted before the article was finally decision and emphatically reaffirmed the view expressed in <NAME> case to the effect that the offence consisted in exciting or attempting to excite in others certain bad feelings towards the Government and not in exciting or attempting to excite mutiny or rebellion or any sort of actual disturbance great or small King Emperor Sada shiv <NAME> Deletion of the word sedition from the draft article therefore shows that criticism of Government exciting disaffection or bad feel ings towards it is not to be regarded as a justifying ground for restricting the freedom of expression and of the press unless it is such as to undermine the security of or tend to overthrow the <ORG> The application is therefore allowed and the order of the respondents prohibiting the entry and circulation of the petitioner journal in the State of Madras is hereby quashed involves the same question as is involved in this case I hold that the reliefs sought by the petitioner cannot be granted In this view I would dismiss this petition but I should like to add a few observations to supplement what I have said in the other case It appears to me that in the ultimate analysis the real question to be decided in this case is whether disorders involving menace to the peace and tranquillity of the Prov ince and affecting public safety will be a matter which undermines the security of the <ORG> or not I have bor rowed the words quoted within inverted commas from the preamble of the Act which shows its scope and necessity and the question raised before us attacking the validity of the Act must be formulated in the manner I have suggested If the answer to the question is in the affirmative as I think it must be then the impugned law which prohibits entry into the <ORG> of Madras of any document or class of documents for securing public safety and maintenance of public order should satisfy the requirements laid down in article of the Constitution From the trend of the arguments addressed to us it would appear that if a docu ment is seditious its entry could be validly prohibited because sedition is a matter which undermines the security of the <ORG> but if on the other hand the document is calculated to disturb public tranquillity and affect public safety its entry cannot be prohibited because public disorder and disturbance of public tranquillity are not matters which undermine the security of the <ORG> If so how could sedi tion be a matter which would undermine the security of the <ORG> and public disorders and disturbance of public safety will not be such a matter It was argued that a small riot or an affray will not undermine the security of the <ORG> but to this line of argument there is a two fold answer The Act as its preamble shows is not intended for petty disorders but for disorders involving menace to the peace and tranquillity of the Province There are de grees of gravity in the offence of sedition also and an isolated piece of writing of mildly seditious character by one insignificant individual may not also from the layman point of view be a matter which undermines the security of the <ORG> but that would not affect the law which aims at checking sedition I shall not pursue the matter further as I have said enough on the subject in the connected case
