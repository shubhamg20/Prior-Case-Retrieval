We are asked in this civil petition presented by <ORG> Nippani in the district of Belgaum to quash an order made by the authority functioning under the Minimum wages Act under of that Act directing the municipal council to pay a sum of Rs In this civil petition it is contended by <NAME> appearing for the municipal council that there was no sufficient cause for the condonation of the delay and that in any event a delay exceeding a period of three years which is the period prescribed by Art The explanation offered by the employees for the delay in the presentation of the claim was that immediately after the decision on the earlier application was rendered by the authority there was a claim made for payment of overtime wages even for the subsequent period and that an assurance was given by the municipal council that their claim would be favourably considered It is clear from the order made by the authority that the explanation was completely accepted although in one part of its order the tribunal did as pointed out by Sri <NAME> observe that in support of the allegation made by the employees there no other documentary or oral evidence The finding in the case before us was that there was sufficient case for not making the claim within the prescribed by proviso to that finding is impervious to criticism is this <ORG> It is true that the period of limitation within which a claim could be made for the recovery of wages under the Minimum Wages Act is shorter than the period of limitation prescribed for a suit But that does not mean that the period which could be condoned in the exercise of the plenary power conferred by proviso to of the Act could be restricted on the basis of the period of limitation for a suit prescribed by the Limitation Act of the Limitation Act to which Sri <NAME> made an appeal prescribes only a period of limitation we are concerned with the question as to what is the period which could be condoned when there is a delay in the presentation of a claim under the Minimum wages Act Although there is an observation in the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> by proprietor <NAME> <ORG> and others I which does lend some support to the argument of <NAME> it seems to us if we may say so with great respect that we should dissent from the elucidation made in that case In our opinion the power created by the Minimum Wages Act for the condonation of delay is not controlled by the period of limitation prescribed by the Limitation Act for a suit and the authority functioning under the Minimum Wages Act has in its discretion plenary power to condone the delay in the presentation of a claim We therefore dismiss this civil petition with cost
