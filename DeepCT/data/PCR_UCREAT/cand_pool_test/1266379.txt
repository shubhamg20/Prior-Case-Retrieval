HEADNOTE Under the Madras Sales Tax Act as it stood before it was amended by the Madras Act XXV of the mere fact that the contract of sale was entered into within the Province of Madras did not make a transaction which was completed in another province where the property in the goods passed a sale within the Province of Madras and no tax could be legally levied upon such a transaction under the provisions of the Act Though <ORG> could not pass a taxation statute which would be binding on any other part of India it was quite competent for a province to enact a legislation imposing taxes on transactions concluded outside the province provided there was a sufficient and real territorial nexus between such transactions and the taxing province The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal which has come before us on a certificate granted by <ORG> under articles and of the Constitution is directed against an appellate judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> passed in Criminal Appeal No of by which the learned Judges affirmed an order of the Seventh Presidency Magistrate Madras dated February convicting the appellant of an offence punishable under section of the Madras General Sales Tax Act and sentencing him to pay a fine of Rs The appellant is a partner of a firm of merchants called <ORG> which has its head office in the city of Madras and carries on the business of selling and purchasing groundnut oil sago and kirana articles The sole point that requires consideration is whether in these circumstances the sale transactions were liable to be taxed under the General Sales Tax Act of Madras Before <ORG> both the parties seem to have accepted the position that if on the facts stated above which were not disputed by either side the sales could be hold to have taken place within the Province of Madras the tax could legitimately be levied on them but not otherwise be applied in determining whether the sales did take place within the Province of Madras or not As the company had its head office in the city of Madras its accounts were maintained there and the goods were delivered to the common carrier in that city the sale according to the respondent must be deemed to have taken place in Madras even though the property in the goods sold passed outside the province In the opinion of the learned Judges the word sale has both a legal and a popular meaning The further contention raised on behalf of the appellant that if this view was accepted the sales tax would have to be regarded as being extra territorial in its operation and as such ultra vires the Provincial <ORG> was repelled by <ORG> on the authority of the well known decision of <ORG> in Wallace Brothers etc It is the propriety of this decision that has been challenged before us and the contentions raised by Mr <NAME> who appeared in support of the appeal are of a two fold character The learned counsel has argued in the first place that the Provincial <ORG> functioning under the Government of India Act was constitutionally incompetent to enact a legislation of this character which according to the interpretation put upon it by <ORG> is capable of operating on sale transactions concluded outside the province Section of the Government of India I Act upon which Mr <NAME> relied and which corresponds to article of the Constitution runs as follows Subject to the two preceding sub sections <ORG> has and <ORG> has not power to make laws for a province or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Second Schedule The entry does not suggest that a legislation imposing tax on sale of goods can be made only in respect of sales taking place within the boundaries of the province and all that section provides is that a law could be passed by <ORG> for purposes of the province itself It admits of no dispute that <ORG> could not pass a taxation statute which would be binding on any other part of India outside the limits of the province but it would be quite competent to enact a legislation imposing taxes on transactions concluded outside the province provided that there was sufficient and a real territorial nexus between such transactions and the taxing province This leads us to the question of interpretation of the statute which is involved in the second point raised by Mr <NAME> The title and preamble of the Madras Sales Tax Act clearly show that its object is to impose taxes on sales that take place within the province though these words do not necessarily mean that the property in the goods sold must pass within the province Thus there are the elements of a bargain or contract of sale the payment or promise of payment of price the delivery of goods and the actual passing of title and each one of them is essential to a transaction of sale though the sale is not completed or concluded unless the purchaser becomes the owner of the property Section gives the definition of sale and it is defined as meaning every transfer of the property in goods by one person to another in the course of trade or business for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration but does not include a mortgage hypothecation charge or pledge It is to be noticed that there was no provision by way of explanation of this definition in operation at the material time to indicate in what cases a sale would be regarded as taking place within the Province of Madras although the property in the goods sold did pass outside the boundaries of the province Such explanations were added by the Madras Act XXV of and one of these explanations namely explanation provides as follows Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indian Sale of Goods Act the sale or purchase of any goods shall be deemed for the purposes of this Act to have taken place in this Province wherever the contract of sale or purchase might have been made a if the goods were actually in this Province at the time when the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was made or in case the contract was for the sale or purchase of future goods by description then if the goods are actually produced in this Province at any time after the contract of sale or purchase in respect thereof was made Section is the charging section in the Act and it provides for the levy of a tax on the total turnover of a dealer for a particular year A turnover is defined to be the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought or sold In our opinion the mere fact that the contract for sale was entered into within the Province of Madras does not make the transaction which was completed admittedly within another province where the property in the goods passed a sale within the Province of Madras according to the provisions of the Madras Sales Tax Act and no tax could be levied upon such a transaction under the provisions of the Act In our opinion the appeal should be allowed and the conviction and sentence passed by the courts below should be set aside The fine and sale tax if actually paid should be refunded to the appellant
