On th April the <ORG> laid down the principles for regulating the preparation and revision of select list of <NAME>s Tahsildars fit to be appointed as Deputy Collectors in posts to be filled by promotion The promotions as officiating deputy collectors were thus made for each division separately on the basis of its divisional select list in which the ranking changed periodically as a result of review and assessment Then deemed dates of continuous officiation were given to the officiating deputy collectors from each division with a view to ensure that their inter se ranking in the divisional select list was not affected by the fact that an officer lower in rank in the divisional select list might have been officiating as Deputy Collector for a longer period than another in higher rank On the basis of the deemed dates of continuous officiation given to the officiating Deputy Collector in each division a combined statewide seniority list of officiating Deputy Collectors was prepared and confirmation in the cadre of Deputy Collectors were made in accordance with the seniority in such combined statewise seniority list The petitioners filed a writ petition in this <ORG> challenging the procedure for promotion HELD The second proviso to rule of the Rules is void as being violative of Art Collectors and the readjustment should be made with retrospective effect and the petitioners should be given the benefit of seniority pay and other allowances from the respective dates on which they would have been promoted had the promotions been made on the correct basis The petitioners were not guilty of any laches or delay in filing the petition a The rule that the <ORG> may not inquire into belated and stale claims is not a rule of law but a rule of practice based on exercise of sound judicial discretion depending on the facts of each case Hence there is no question of rights which have accrued to others by reason of the delay in filing the petition being disturbed All those who are necessary parties are before the <ORG> and there is therefore no impediment in the way of the <ORG> dealing with the matter A right to be considered for promotion is a condition of service but mere chances of promotion are not There is nothing to show that the two groups are kept apart irrespective of the divisions to which they belonged could be prepared without any difficulty on the basis of the Rules for the allocate cl <NAME>s Tahsildars and for the subsequent appointees on the principle of continuous officiation up to th July and thereafter according to the rule laid down in the Resolution of th July and a common statewise list could also be made of the <NAME>s found fit for promotion as Deputy Collectors and promotion to the cadre of Deputy Collectors could be made on the basis of such <ORG>wise select list <ORG> did not follow this method Where promotion is made by selection on the basis of merit cum seniority every <NAME> should have equal opportunity With others for being considered for promotion The allotment of deemed dates of continuous officiation cannot help retrieve those who have had no opportunity to be promoted as officiating Deputy Collectors not on account of want of higher seniority or better merit but purely on account of lack of adequate number of vacancies in the post of Deputy Collector arising in their division But it cannot for that reason be contended that there is an intermediate cadre of officiating Deputy Col lectors between the cadre of <NAME>s and the cadre of Deputy Collectors from which promotion is made to the cadre of Deputy Collectors There is no legislative rule or executive order providing for the creation of any such intermediate cadre of officiating Deputy Collectors The Rules provided that the appointment to posts of the Deputy Collectors should be made by promotion of suitable <NAME>s that is promotion should be from the cadre of <NAME>s to the cadre of Deputy Co lectors The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The short question that arises for determination in this petition under Art of the Constitution lies in a very narrow compass but in order to arrive at its proper determination it is necessary to state the facts giving rise to the petition in some detail Prior to the reorganisation of the States which took place on st November by virtue of the provisions of the States Reorganisation Act the petitioners were confirmed Tehsildars in the quondam State of Hyderabad which was then a Part State The Rules of recruitment to the posts of Tehsildar which prevailed in the erstwhile State of Hyderabad provided that rd of the number of posts shall be filled by promotion from the lower ranks while the remaining rd shall be filled by direct recruitment on the basis of the result of competitive examination This notification provided that all the vacancies of the cadre of Deputy Collectors shall be filled only by promotion by selection from the cadre of Tehsildars concerned here only with the formation of the new State of Bombay and we will therefore confine our attention to that The Preamble to the Rules of stated that they were made by the Governor of Bombay in exercise of powers conferred by Art The Rules of provided inter alia for absorption of all persons allotted for Service to the <ORG> of Bombay and the determination of their inter se seniority in the cadre of absorption Rule dealt with the case of an allocated <ORG> servant belonging to a local cadre that is a cadre other than a <ORG> cadre in a former <ORG> but this rule had no application to Tehsildars of Ex Hyderabad <ORG> because they belonged to We have already referred to the rules contained in the Notification of the Rajpramukh of Hyderabad dated th September Then there were rules enacted by the <ORG> Resolution dated th July which prevailed in the former <ORG> of Bombay There were also similar rules in the other <ORG>s namely Madhya Pradesh Saurashtra and Kutch The allocated Mamlatdars Tehsildars coming from these different <ORG>s undoubtedly carried their respective conditions of service with them under sub of the <ORG>s Reorganisation Act and those conditions of service included the right to be considered for promotion as Deputy Collector but the different rules of recruitment which prevailed in the different regions as such became wholly inapposite and incongruous and ceased to be applicable in the new set up These rules we shall hereafter for the sake of convenience refer as the rules of th July Rule of these Rules is material and it may be reproduced as follows Appointment to the posts of Deputy Collector hall be made either by nomination or by promotion of suitable Mamlatdars Provided further that half the vacancies reserved for appointment by promotion shall be filled by directly recruited Mamlatdars who have put in at least seven years service in the posts including the period spent on probation But of that a little later when we deal with the arguments of the parties We may also at this stage refer to one other contention raised on behalf of the petitioners in regard to the Rules of th July These Rules which we shall for the sake of convenience refer as the Rules of th November came into force with effect from st January Rule of these rules is material and it provided that appointment to the posts of Mamlatdars shall be made by nomination on the result of competitive examination or by promo tion from amongst the members of subordinate revenue services provided that as nearly as may be one half of the vacancies in the cadre of Mamlatdars hall be reserved for direct recruits by nomination except in the case of Nagpur Division where a special provision was made that this ratio would not apply till all persons recruited as <ORG> Tehsildars were either promoted as Tehsildars or rejected as not fit to be so promoted Now according to the respondents the cadre of <ORG> was a divisional cadre and not a <ORG> cadre and the reorganised <ORG> of Bombay being divided into six divisions there was a separate cadre of <ORG> for each division This position was however disputed on behalf of the petitioners and their argument was that though it was true that <ORG> were allocated to different divisions that was only for the sake of administrative convenience and it did not have the effect of splitting up the <ORG> cadre of <ORG> into divisional cadres The procedure that the <ORG> Government followed for making appointment to the posts of Deputy Collector by promotion of suitable <ORG> Tehsildars from and after st November was that for each division a select list of <ORG> Tehsildars considered fit for promotion as Deputy Collector was prepared by a revising committee every year and from the divisional select list promotions were made as officiating Deputy Collector on a divisional basis and thereafter confirmations in the cadre of Deputy Collector which was admittedly a <ORG> cadre were made for the <ORG> as a whole after considering the claims of all officiating Deputy Collectors in the <ORG> as a whole Thisprocedure does not appear to have the warrant of any legislatively or administrative orders but there can be no doubt from the affidavit in reply filed on behalf of the <ORG> Government that it was in fact followed for making promotions to the posts of Deputy Collector On th April the Government issued a Resolution laying down the principles for regulating preparation and revision of select list of <ORG> Tehsildars fit to be appointed as Deputy Collectors in the posts to be filled by promotion It may be recapitulated here that under the Rules of th July the posts to be filled by promotion of suitable <ORG> Tehsildars were in case the second proviso to rule I were held to be valid and in case it was invalid The promotions as officiating Deputy Collectors were made divisible on the basis of the divisional select lists and confirmations in the cadre of Deputy Collector were made according to the combined seniority list of officiating Deputy Collectors We shall have occasion to refer to this procedure in detail when we examine the respective arguments of the parties and we need not therefore elaborate it at this stage Suffice it to point out that it was in accordance with the procedure that the petitioners were promoted as officiating Deputy Collectors in the Aurangabad Division on different dates The promotions to the posts of Deputy Collector should have been made on the basis of Statewide seniority of Mamlatdars Tehsildars by selection from amongst Mamlatdars Tehsildars throughout the State as a whole We shall proceed to examine these grounds in the order in which we have set them out but before we do so we must refer to some objections of a preliminary nature raised on behalf of the respondents The first preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents was that the petitioners were guilty of gross lashes and delay in filing the petition There was a delay of more than ten or twelve years in filing the petition since the accrual of the cause of complaint and this delay contended the respondents was sufficient to disentitle the petitioners to any relief in a petition under Art of the Constitution In the first place it must be remembered that the rule which says that the <ORG> may not inquire into related and stale claims is not a rule of law but a rule of practice based on sound and proper exercise of discretion and there is no inviolable rule that whenever there is delay the court must necessarily refuse to entertain the petition Each case must depend on its own facts There is no lower limit aid there is no upper limit were therefore justified in proceeding on the assumption that there were no unified rules of recruitment to the posts of Deputy Collector and the promotions that were being made by <ORG> were only provisional to be regularised when unified rules of recruitment were made It was only when the petition in <NAME> case was decided by <ORG> that the petitioners came to know that it was the case of <ORG> in that petition and that case was accepted by <ORG> that the Rules of th July were the unified rules of recruitment to the posts of Deputy Collector applicable throughout It may also be noted that the principle on which the <ORG> proceeds in refusing relief to the petitioner on ground of lashes ordeals is that the rights which have accrued to others by reasons of the delay in filing the petition should not be allowed to be disturbed unless there is reasonable explanation for the delay No rights have therefore accrued in favour of others by reason of the delay in filing the petition We were also told by the learned counsel for the petitioners and that was not controverted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the The petitioners had this alternative legal remedy of review available to them and there was no reason why instead of pursuing that remedy the petitioners should have filed the present petition under Art The petitioners had therefore no locus to apply for review of that judgment The third preliminary objection raised on behalf of the respondents was that it was not competent to the <ORG> to pronounce on the validity of the procedure for making promotions to the posts of Deputy Collector in the All those who are necessary parties are before the <ORG> and there is therefore no impediment in the way of the <ORG> proceeding to decide the questions raised for its determination Having rejected these preliminary objections we shall now turn to examine the grounds of challenge urged on behalf of the petitioners It is now well settled by the decision of the <ORG> in State of Mysore <NAME> that though a right to be considered for promotion is a condition of service mere chances of promo tion are not This contention was negatived and <NAME> as he then was speaking on behalf of this <ORG> observed It is said on behalf of the respondents that as their chances of promotion have been affected their conditions of service have been changed to their disadvantage We see no force in this argument because chances of promotion are not conditions of service They discharge the same functions There is nothing to show that the two groups are kept apart There is no doubt that in the former <ORG> of Hyderabad the cadre of <ORG> was a <ORG> cadre It is not possible to resolve this controversy on affidavits as it raised a disputed question of fact and we must therefore without finally deciding the question proceed on the basis that in the former <ORG> of Bombay the cadre of <ORG> was a divisional cadre as alleged by the respondents It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the constitution of <ORG> into divisional cadres was contrary to the Bombay Civil Services Classification and Recruitment Rules which were statutory rules made by the Governor under of the <ORG> of India Act There is nothing in the Rules which system that a <ORG> service may not consist of divisional cadres Did it ensure equality of opportunity for promotion to <ORG> belonging to the different divisional cadres While examining this question it is necessary to compare the procedure followed in regard to direct recruitment to the cadre of Deputy Collectors The direct recruitment was made on a <ORG>wide basis without any attempt to see that there was divisionwise representation Though a common seniority list of all the <NAME>s in the <ORG> irrespective of the divisions to which they belonged could be prepared without any difficulty on the basis of the Rules of for the allocated <NAME>s Tehsildars and for the subsequent appointees on the principle of continuous officiation upto th July and thereafter according to the rule laid down in Government Resolution dated th July and a common <ORG>wide select list could also be made of <NAME>s found fit for promotion as Deputy Collectors and promotion to the cadre of Deputy Collectors could be made on the basis of such <ORG>wide select list the <ORG> Government did not choose to follow this method and instead made promotions to the cadre of Deputy Collectors which was a <ORG> cadre on the basis of division select lists The promotions as officiating Deputy Collector were thus made for each division separately on the basis of its divisional select list in which the ranking kept on changing periodically as a result of review and assessment procedure followed for the purpose of preparing combined seniority list was as follows in the first place deemed dates of continuous officiation were given to the officiating Deputy Collectors from each division with a view to ensuring that their inter se ranking in the divisional select list was not affected by the fact that an officer lower in rank in the divisional select list might have been officiating as Deputy Collector for a longer period than another in higher rank Thus if A and were officiating Deputy Collectors in a division having st January st July and st January respectively as their dates of continuous officiation and in the divisional select list their ranking was first second and last A their deemed dates of continuous officiation would be st January for st July for and st January for A Then on the basis of the deemed dates of continuous officiation given to the officiating Deputy Collectors in each division a combined <ORG> wise seniority list of officiating Deputy Collectors was prepared and confirmations in the cadre of Deputy Collectors were made in accordance with the seniority in such combined <ORG> wise seniority list Now it is clear that this procedure suffers from a serious infirmity in that it provides for promotions to the <ORG> cadre of Deputy Collectors to be made on the basis of divisional select lists Where promotion is made by selection on the basis of merit cum seniority every <NAME> should be able to enter the lists he should have equal opportunity with others for being considered for promotion The allotment of deemed dates of continuous officiation cannot help retrive those who have had no opportunity to be promoted as officiating Deputy Collectors not on account of want of higher seniority or better merit but purely on account of lack of adequate number of vacancies in the post of Deputy Collector arising in their division The amalgamation of the livisional select lists is not made on a comparative assessment of the elative Merits of the <NAME>s in the divisional <ORG> lists as to produce a combined seniority list based on merit cum seniority but it proceeds on the basis of deemed dates of continuous officiation is Deputy Collectors given to <NAME>s in their respective divisional select lists Read superficially it might appear that this decision supports the contention of the respondents but if we scrutinise It closely it would be apparent that not only it does not render any assistance to the respondents but actually goes against them The cadre of constables was a district cadre The promotion from the cadre of constables to the next higher cadre of head constables was made within the district by the Superintendent of Police on the basis of district wise select list of approved constables The further promotion from the cadre of Head Constables to the cadre of Sub Inspectors was made within the range by the Deputy Inspector General of Police and for this purpose all the Head Constables in the range were considered as one group for promotion to the rank of Sub Inspectors and promotion was made on the basis of rangewise select list of approved Head Constables So far as the next higher cadre of Inspectors is concerned that was a <ORG> cadre and promotion to that cadre was made by the Inspector General of Police for the <ORG> as a whole on the basis of <ORG>wise select list of approved Sub Inspectors Now what happened in this case was that the petitioner who was promoted to the rank of Sub Inspector from the rank of Head Constable was reverted when a permanent Sub Inspector returned to the range as he was the junior most approved Head Constable officiating as The petitioner thereupon filed a petition under Art Apart from administrative difficulties which may arise if all promotion of members in the police force is concentrated in the hands of the Inspector General of Police which is what the petitioner is contending for it seems to us that there is a good deal of force in the contention of the <ORG> that the three tier system works for the efficiency of the police force of these ranks and is designed with that object It will be seen from this analysis of the reasoning of the decision in <NAME> case that far from negativing the contention of the petitioners it goes a long way towards supporting it In <NAME> case the cadre of Sub Inspectors was a range cadre and promotion to that cadre in each range was made on the basis of select But the basic feature underlying this mode of promotion was and that is vital to the understanding of the true ratio of this decision that in respect of promotion to the range cadre of Sub Inspectors all the Head Constables in the range were eligible for being considered and promotion to such range cadre was made on the basis of rangewise selection list prepared by taking into account the relative merits of all the Head Constables in the range The ratio of the decision in <NAME> case does not therefore support the contention that promotion to a <ORG> cadre can be made on the basis of divisional select lists The respondents faintly attempted to argue that in the present case there was an intermediate cadre of officiating Deputy Collectors between the cadre of <NAME>s and the cadre of Deputy Collectors and promotion from the cadre of <NAME>s lay to the cadre of officiating Deputy Collectors and it was from the cadre of officiating Deputy Collectors that one could obtain It is wholly contradicted the Rules of th July which are admittedly statutory rules These Rules provide that appointment to of the posts of Deputy Collectors shall be made by promotion of suitable <NAME>s The promotion that is spoken of in these Rules is promotion from the cadre of <NAME>s to the cadre of Deputy collectors In fact there is any legislative rule or executive order providing for the creation of such an intermediate I cadre of Officiating Deputy Collectors We direct <ORG> to readjust the promotions as officiating Deputy Collectors as also the confirmed in the cadre of Deputy Collectors in the light of the principles laid down in this judgment The readjustment shall be made with retrospective effect and the petitioners shall be given the benefit of seniority pay and other allowances from the respective dates on which they would have been promoted had the promotions been made on the cor rect basis indicated in the judgment subject to the qualification that so far as arrears of pay and other allowances are concerned they May no be given for the period prior to the Ming of the petition The first respondent will pay the costs of the petition to the petitioners We find in the course of our judicial experience and we notice this fact with some apprehension that members of public services in alarmingly large numbers resort to legal remedies in courts of law for agitating their grievance in regard to service matters it can therefore hardly be over emphasised that there is great need for simplifying and streamlining service rules and giving them statutory shape so as to promote contentment among the services by extending the areas of equal treatment and imparting stability to conditions of service Legal rules must govern the recruitment and conditions of public servants so that there is no arbitrariness or inequality in <ORG> action in regard to them and the rule of law is not eroded We make these observations not with a view to casting any reflection on the administration but to highlight a problem which has come to our notice quite often in the hope that it will help the social dimensions of the problem and the damage to public interest which may be likely to result if the problem is not promptly and satisfactorily resolved
