In our view these are the cases where the management held defective inquiry and before <ORG> or <ORG> the defect was sought to be removed by leading evidence and ultimately of the <ORG> seized of a reference under Section of the Industrial Disputes Act agreed with the management on the new evidence led before it the question of relation back of the order of <ORG> or <ORG> to the original order of termination would assume importance Therefore the observations of <ORG> in <NAME> case in connection with <ORG> case which is under Section of the Act will require a closer scrutiny in so far as they are to be applied to a proceeding arising out of a reference under Section or A of the Industrial Disputes Act which would stand on a different footing The moot question would arise whether the ratio of the <ORG> judgment in <NAME> case would almost automatically apply to such cases apart from the cases arising under Section of the I Act Therefore the question would arise whether the ratio of this decision would still apply to a case where the proceedings relate to Section or A of the Act apart from Section of the act The latter decisions of this Court have applied the ratio of the decision in <NAME> case to matters arising under Section and A of the Act In our view therefore the dispute in the present proceedings could be better resolved by a <ORG> of this Court which can consider the scope and ambit of the decision of the earlier <ORG> judgment in <NAME> case which has been the sheet anchor of the subsequent cases referred to earlier on which a strong reliance has been placed by learned counsel for the petitioner and which had nothing to do with proceedings under Section of the Act
