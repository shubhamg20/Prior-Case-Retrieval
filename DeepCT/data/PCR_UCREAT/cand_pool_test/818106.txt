<NAME> was committed by the Magistrate of Moradabad to <ORG> of Moradabad for trial on a charge that on or about the th of July he did attempt to excite feelings of disaffection to the Government established by law in British India by publishing in a newspaper called <ORG> of which he was proprietor editor and publisher an article entitled Azadi band hone se kabal namuna and had thereby committed an offence punishable under Section A of the Indian Penal Code and within the cognizance of <ORG> Upon being asked Do you wish to give any reasons as to why you should not be punished for this offence <NAME> replied I can give no reason That there is nothing on record which after the appellant plea and apology would make him liable to anything more than a nominal punishment Whoever by words either spoken or intended to be read or by signs or by visible representation or otherwise excites or attempts to excite feelings of disaffection to the Government established by law in British India shall be punished with transportation for life or for any term to which fine may be added or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years to which fine may be added or with fine If there be any difficulty as to the true meaning of Section A of the Indian Penal Code it is caused by the Explanation which forms part of that section it was contended by the counsel for the accused persons that disaffection and disapprobation were synonymous words and had one and the same meaning Sir <NAME> thus defined disaffection and disapprobation as those words are used in Section A Disaffection means a feeling contrary to affection in other words dislike or hatred If a person uses either spoken or written words calculated to create in the minds of the persons to whom they are addressed a disposition not to obey the lawful authority of the Government or to subvert or resist that authority if and when occasion should arise and if he does so with the intention of creating such a disposition in his hearers he will be guilty of the offence of attempting to excite disaffection within the moaning of the section though no disturbance is brought about by his words or any feeling of disaffection in fact produced by them It is sufficient for the purposes of the section that the words used are calculated to excite feelings of ill will against the Government and to hold it up to the hatred and contempt of the people and that they were used with the intention to create such feeling Later on in his direction to the jury Sir <NAME> in referring to the articles in respect of the publication of which the charges under Section A arose said Were those articles intended to excite feelings of enmity against the Government or on the other hand were they merely expressing though in strong language disapprobation of certain Government measures You will bear in mind that the question you have to decide has reference to the intention and in fact the crime consists of the intention for a man might lawfully do the act without the intention It is true that there is before you a charge against each prisoner that he has actually excited feelings of disaffection to the Government You will observe that the section places absolutely on the same footing the successful exciting of feelings of disaffection and the unsuccessful attempt to excite them so that if you find that either of the prisoners has tried to excite such feelings in others you must convict him even if there is nothing to show that he succeeded In directing the jury as to the meaning and effect of the Explanation in Section A Mr Justice <NAME> said Observe first that as I have already said while the first clause shows affirmatively what the offence made punishable by the section is the explanation states negatively what it is not Observe that it has no application whatever unless you come to the conclusion that the writings in question can fairly and reasonably be construed as the making of comments on the measures of the <ORG> So long as a journalist observes this distinction he has nothing to fear It seems to me that this view of the law secures all the liberty which any reasonable man can desire and that to allow more would be culpable weakness and fatal to the interest not only of the <ORG> but of the people But now there are other words in the explanation which we have still to consider In refusing the application of <NAME> to <ORG> for leave to appeal to Her Majesty in Council <NAME> in delivering the judgment of the Full Bench said The other ground upon which Mr <NAME> has asked us to certify that it is a fit case to send to <ORG> is that there has been misdirection and he based his argument on one major and two minor grounds That expression is used in connection with the law as laid down by Sir <NAME> in Calcutta in the <NAME> case There Sir <NAME> instead of using the words absence of affection said contrary to affection and if the words contrary to affection had been used instead of absence of affection in this case there can be no doubt that the summing up would have been absolutely correct In delivering the judgment of <ORG> the Lord Chancellor is reported to have said Their Lordships are of opinion taking the view of the whole of the summing up which is of very great length that there is nothing in that which in their Lordships opinion calls upon them to indicate any dissent from or necessity to correct what is therein contained If their construction of Section A differs materially from the construction placed upon that section by Mr Justice <NAME> it necessarily follows that their construction would not be accepted as correct by <ORG> which accepted Mr Justice <NAME> direction to the jury in <NAME> case as a sufficient and not a misleading direction The disapprobation of the measures of the Government may or may not in any particular case be the text upon which the speech is made or the article or letter is written but if upon a fair and impartial consideration of what was spoken or written it is reasonably obvious that the intention of the speaker or writer was to excite feelings of disaffection to the Government established by law in British India then a <ORG> or a jury should find that the speaker or writer or publisher as the case might be had committed the offence of attempting to excite feelings of disaffection to the Government established by law in British India We are further of opinion that the ordinary meaning of disaffection in Section A having regard to the evils at which Section A strikes is not varied by the explanation contained in the section Where it is ascertained that the intention of the speaker writer or publisher was to excite feelings of disaffection to the Government established by law in British India it is immaterial whether or not the words spoken written or published could have the effect of exciting such feelings of disaffection and it is immaterial whether the words were true or were false and except on the question of punishment or in a case in which the speaker writer or publisher is charged with having excited such feelings of disaffection it is immaterial whether or not the words did in fact excite such feelings of disaffection His counsel before us could not suggest that there was the slightest justification or excuse for the gross and libellous charges against the <ORG> contained in the article We dismiss this appeal Section Whenever the accused is examined by any Magistrate or by any Court other than a High Court established by Royal Charter or the Examination of accused Chief Court of the Punjab the whole of such examination how recorded
