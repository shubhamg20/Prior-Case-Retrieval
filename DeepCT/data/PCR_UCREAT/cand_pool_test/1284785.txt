In this case the plaintiff as assignee claims Rs Then there were certain words which it was agreed between the parties were added at the time that letter was written in Guzrati and the correct translation was in these terms On the sale proceeds being received in hand brokerage will be paid He had the opportunity of introducing such a purchaser and thus qualifying for his brokerage for days only Now there is no question as to the law which governs such a matter as this In this case I am not prepared to say that the learned Judge has decided wrongly on the contrary I think there is sufficient evidence to justify the decision at which he arrived and <NAME> used to come and see me often and he got me into this scrape But it is said that there is nothing to show that <NAME> introduced the purchaser and performed his part of the contract within the specified time days there is evidence that this must have been done within the time limit because we find that on the th June days from the date of the broker letter <NAME> wrote to the defendant in the following terms As per our conversation with your Mr <NAME> we intend to purchase the above mills together with the land connected with it at a cost price of Rs The main reason however which weighs with me is that the learned Judge has had to deal with conflicting verbal evidence on a question of fact and after seeing and hearing the witnesses he has come to the conclusion that the truth lies on the side of <NAME> and not on the side of the defendant and in such a case in my judgment this Court should not interfere unless it is clear that he has come to a wrong conclusion There is no finding on this particular point It has been argued for the respondent that it is sufficient if a purchaser was secured within days even if the actual purchase was completed later Had it been the fact that it was due to <NAME> intervention that the first letter was written it does not seem to me possible that the witness could have forgotten it He will not commit himself to this and I think for the reason that he had not then seen <NAME> but had learnt about the property through an advertisement in the <ORG> There is no specific evidence that <NAME> secured the purchaser between the th and th or the conclusion of the period allowed to him There is some general evidence that he introduced the purchaser which in any case is scarcely accurate if the first communication of the th to which I have referred was without his intervention There is no mention of <NAME> as broker in any of the letters until we get to the letter of th November which is of doubtful admissibility against the appellant It is remarkable also that there is no letter or other document by the broker which establishes his claim Finally there is evidence that the purchaser <ORG> took a commission of per cent on the entire sale proceeds of Its For these reasons I would allow this appeal It is however not necessary for me to hold anything more than that the plaintiffs have not established that <NAME> earned his commission within the terms of the agreement and I would therefore decree this appeal with costs and dismiss this suit with costs As regards the question whether we should interfere in appeal with questions of fact I will only say this that if after argument the Court has a conviction that the judgment under appeal is erroneous it should not be affirmed and this is not the less so because the judgment raised a question of fact The plaintiff thereupon instituted this suit on the th June The defendant asserted that the sale had taken place without the intervention of the plaintiff as broker and repudiated the claim as entirely unfounded If these principles are borne in mind there is no escape from the conclusion that the plaintiff cannot be awarded a decree merely on the finding that the sale was effected through his instrumentality There is no trace in the correspondence already summarised that he had done so This no doubt is not conclusive proof that he had not met the broker on or before the th June but there is no specific evidence upon which I can act that the two had met before that date Mr <NAME> in the course of his able argument for the respondent properly emphasised the fact that Mr Justice <NAME> who had the opportunity to see the witnesses which we have not has believed the purchaser in preference to the defendant and he has argued that in a case of this description where there is a conflict of oral testimony <ORG> should not reverse the finding of <ORG> But there may obviously be other circumstances quite apart from manner and demeanour which may show whether a statement is credible or not and these circumstances may warrant the <ORG> in differing from the Judge even on a question of fact turning on the credibility of witnesses whom the <ORG> has not seen We may also bear in mind the observation of Lord Chelmsford in Tayammaul Sashachalla Naikar I A at Sar But the parties to the cause are entitled as well on questions of fact as on questions of law to demand the decision of <ORG> though as James <NAME> said in Bigsby <NAME> Ch at <NAME>Ch if we are to accept as final the decision of the <ORG> of first instance in every case where there is a conflict of evidence our labours would be very much lightered But even in other cases it is undoubtedly the duty of <ORG> to weigh conflicting evidence and to draw its own inferences and conclusions though it should always bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and should make due allowance in this respect We may also bear in mind the fact that although as an ordinary rule <ORG> does not interfere with concurrent judgments of the <ORG>s below on questions of fact instances are by no means rare where their Lordships have examined the whole evidence formed for themselves an opinion on the entire case and reversed the unanimous decision of the two <ORG>s in India on a question of fact <NAME> <NAME> I A <NAME> <NAME> I It is not necessary for the present purpose to consider whether any general principle is deducible from the expressions used by their Lordships as to the circumstances under which they will depart from the rule ordinarily observed by them such as that the very clearest proof is shown that the decision is erroneous that the <ORG> is clearly satisfied that there has been miscarriage in the appreciation of evidence that it is manifestly clear from the probabilities that the <ORG> below was wrong that the case is very extraordinary that a strong case must be made out before the <ORG> would recommend reversal that it must very clearly appear that the conclusion is very plainly erroneous that there has been some miscarriage in respect of a presumption to which too much weight was given that very definite and explicit grounds must be assigned for interference that there is so strong a preponderance of testimony that the <ORG> can confidently pronounce the decision to be wrong and other expressions of like import There is further the unexplained fact that the purchaser received Rs There is the further significant fact that the claim for brokerage was not put forward till the th January though if the plaintiff is to be believed he had earned it before the th June and the sale had been actually completed on the th September Finally the case for the plaintiff is certainly not improved by the letter alleged to have been written on the th November which plainly bears the appearance of an attempt to create evidence for future use After the most careful and anxious consideration of the entire evidence on the record and the circumstances of the case I have arrived at the conclusion that the plaintiff has failed to establish that he has earned the commission claimed in terms of the contract and that the decree in his favour cannot be supported In my opinion the appeal should be allowed and the suit dismissed with costs throughout The result is that in view of the opinion expressed by the majority of the <ORG> this appeal will be allowed the judgment of the <ORG> of first instance set aside and the plaintiff suit dismissed with costs both of the <ORG> of first instance and of this appeal
