The order of conviction and sentence gave rise to five murder references and fourteen appeals by the convicts before <ORG> and Haryana Having lost their appeals and the death sentences having been con firmed the appellants have come in appeal by way of special leave Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also require to be taken into consideration alongwith the circumstances of the crime In other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances has to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following questions may be asked and answers a Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and called for a death sentence Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender When a piece of evidence introduced and relied upon by the prosecution itself creates a doubt a reasonable doubt as regards the complicity of the accused even if there are no infirmities in other evidence the doctrine of benefit of doubt must be invoked by the court in favour of the accused In the instant case though there is no infirmity in the evidence of PW <NAME> and PW <NAME> to connect <NAME> to the crime the fact that the second rifle used in the commission of crime having been originally issued to one <NAME> does not satisfactorily establish the link Any statement made to the police by such deceased can be subsequently allowed to be treated as dying declaration and evidence scanned The order of conviction and sentence gave rise to five murder references and fourteen appeals by the convicts before <ORG> and Haryana In order to avoid confusion the occurrence in each village will be adverted to in the same manner in which <ORG> has done viz Now we will address ourselves to the facts pertaining to the individual appeals The occurrence giving rise to the proceedings culminating in the appeal before this <ORG> took place at Village Alahi Baksh Badla at about on August There was a lighted lantern in the courtyard which was placed on the small boundary wall of the kitchen Appellant <NAME> fired a shot at <NAME> who was lying on the cot At the same time appellant <NAME> fired a shot at <NAME> who was lying on a cot Appellants <NAME> and <NAME> have been convicted for murder and sentenced to death We propose to deal with the appeals preferred by them separately This evidence is further corroborated by the evidence pertaining to the recovery of the rifle at the instance of appellant <NAME> which has been accepted by <ORG> and <ORG> We do not think that there is any justification to take a different view in regard to the assessment of their evidence The presence of <NAME> and his daughter <NAME> at the scene of occurrence is natural inasmuch as the occurrence took place at the house of <NAME> Counsel for the appellant has assailed the finding recorded by <ORG> and affirmed by the <ORG> by pressing into service the argument that as there was only one lantern burning in the courtyard and as it was a dark night it being the th day of the second half of the lunar month <NAME> and <NAME> could not have identified the culprits For the reasons indicated in the course of the earlier discussion we think that the concurrent view taken by <ORG> and the <ORG> that there was sufficient light to enable the identification of the culprits must be affirmed Counsel for the appellant next contended that the evidence pertaining to the recovery of the rifle and the evidence adduced by the prosecution in order to establish that one of the rifles used in the course of the occurrence was issued to appellant <NAME> in his capacity as an officer of <ORG> was not satisfactory and reliable We have on our own perused the evidence and we see no reason to disbelieve the evidence connecting appellant <NAME> with the weapon of offence Ex The evidence shows that appellant was personally known to the witness There is no warrant for such an assumption We therefore see no reason to disbelieve the testimony of Quarter Master <NAME> and Platoon Commander Yashpal <ORG> and <ORG> have accepted this evidence and we do not see any reason to disbelieve the same We will deal with the question of sentence at the fag end of the judgment Counsel for the appellant has challenged the validity of the finding recorded by <ORG> and <ORG> on these two points In our opinion the most important evidence from this stand point is the evidence adduced by the prosecution in order to establish that appellant <NAME> was in possession of the weapon of offence namely the second rifle which was used by the culprits There is no record to show that this rifle was returned by PW <ORG> has not given any convincing reason to justify taking a different view In fact the evidence shows that it was issued to PW some years before the occurrence Though we do not see any infirmity in the evidence of <NAME> and <NAME> in view of this factor which speaks in favour of the appellant we must invoke the doctrine of benefit of doubt We accordingly acquit Appellant <NAME> and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith unless he is required to be detained in the context of some other order as in its view it was established beyond reasonable doubt that the nine appellants had formed an unlawful assembly with the common object of committing murder of Smt <ORG> confirmed the order of conviction and sentence and dismissed the appeals preferred by the appellants There is an in built guarantee that she was an eye witness to the incident There is no reason to doubt or disbelieve her testimony There is no valid reason to take a different view Furthermore there is the evidence of PW <NAME> and PW <NAME> He came out from the house upon hearing the report of fun fire We see no reason to do otherwise The finding of guilt recorded by <ORG> and <ORG> in regard to this incident must therefore be unhesitatingly confirmed II In so far as the second incident is concerned the most important witness is <NAME> <NAME> inasmuch as he himself had sustained injuries by gun shot in the course of the incident in question That he was present at the time of the occurrence and had witnessed the incident is therefore incapable of being disputed appellant <NAME> and appellant <NAME> had chased him and fired the shots at him which caused injuries to him The medical evidence fully supports his testimony and establishes that he had sustained gun shot injuries in the course of this incident There is however no reasons to do so They are not shown to be interested witnesses there is no reason why they should falsely implicate the appellants and expose themselves to the obvious risk arising therefrom <ORG> and <ORG> were perfectly justified in accepting and acting upon the testimony of these two witnesses whose evidence lends further strength and support to the evidence of the injured witness viz We are therefore unable to accede to the argument advanced by the learned counsel for the appellants On our part we will deal with the question of sentence imposed on them in the concluding part of our judgment We agree with the reasoning of <ORG> We accordingly allow the appeal of <NAME> set aside the order of conviction and sentence passed against him and direct that he be set at liberty forthwith unless he is required to be detained in some other connection In so far as the rest of the appellants are concerned the evidence of this witness has been accepted and acted upon by <ORG> and <ORG> and we do not see any reason to do otherwise We will consider the question as to whether death sentence is called for in the concluding part of our judgment The evidence of PW <NAME> also corroborates the evidence regarding her presence and the occurrence We see no reason to dislodge this concurrent finding of fact We will deal with the question of sentence at a subsequent stage The order of conviction passed by <ORG> and affirmed by <ORG> is inter alia based on the dying declaration of <NAME> We have no reason to view the evidence askance We have no reason to disagree with the view of <ORG> and <ORG> that their evidence is reliable There is no substance in the argument that the culprits could not have been identified as the light shed by the lantern was not adequate to enable identification The finding of guilt is thus fully supported by evidence We will deal with the question of sentence in so far as they are concerned after a shortwhile It may do so in rarest of rare cases when its collective conscience is so shocked that it will expect the holders of the judicial power centre to inflict death penalty irrespective of their personal opinion as regards desirability or otherwise of retaining death penalty II Motive for Commission of murder When the murder is committed for a motive which evince total depravity and meanness For instance when a a hired assassin commits murder for the sake of money or reward a cold blooded murder is committed with a deliberate design in order to inherit property or to gain control over property of a ward or a person under the control of the murderer or vis a vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position or in a position of trust a murder is committed in the course for betrayal of the motherland is committed not for personal reasons but in circumstances which arouse social wrath For instance when such a crime is committed in order to terrorize such persons and frighten them into fleeing from a place or in order to deprive them of or make them with a view to reverse past injustices and in order to restore the social balance In cases of bride burning and what are known as dowry deaths or when murder is committed in order to remarry for the sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry another woman on account of infatuation a helpless woman or a person rendered helpless by old age or infirmity when the victim is a person vis a vis whom the murderer is in a position of domination or trust when the victim is a public figure generally loved and respected by the community for the services rendered by him and the murder is committed for political or similar reasons other than personal reasons In this background the guidelines indicated in <NAME> case supra will have to be culled out and applied to the facts of each individual case where the question of imposing of death sentences arises The following propositions emerge from <NAME> case <NAME> i the extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability ii Before opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the offender also require to be taken into consideration alongwith the circumstances of the crime In other words death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime and provided and only provided the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances iv A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances has to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised In order to apply these guidelines inter alia the following questions may be asked and answered a Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender If upon taking an overall global view of all the circumstances in the light of the aforesaid proposition and taking into account the answers to the questions posed here in above the circumstances of the case are such that death sentence is warranted the court would proceed to do so <NAME> <ORG> in its extremely well considered judgment has assigned the following reasons for imposing death penalty on appellant <NAME> in the context of each of the six crimes We therefore fully uphold the view concurrently taken by <ORG> and <ORG> that extreme penalty of death requires to be imposed on appellants <NAME> <NAME> son of <NAME> <NAME> The order of conviction and sentence passed by the lower courts in so far as he is concerned are set aside He shall be set at liberty forthwith unless he is required to be detained in connection with some other offence or in connection with some other orders authorizing his detention II In regard to the rest of the appeals by the rest of the appellants the orders of conviction and sentence passed by the lower courts are confirmed and all the appeals shall stand dismissed
