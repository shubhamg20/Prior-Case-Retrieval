The Article mandates that no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law Life or personal liberty includes a right to live with human dignity There is an inbuilt guarantee against torture or assault by the <ORG> or its functionaries Articles and of the Constitution further manifest the constitutional protection extended to every citizen and the guarantees held out for making life meaningful and not a mere animal existence The concern which was shown in <NAME> case supra more than two decades back seems to have fallen to leaf ears and the situation does not seem to be showing any noticeable change The exaggerated adherence to and insistence upon the establishment of proof beyond every reasonable doubt by the prosecution at times even when the prosecuting agencies are themselves fixed in the dock ignoring the ground realities the fact situation and the peculiar circumstances of a given case as in the present case often results in miscarriage of justice and makes the justice delivery system suspect and vulnerable In the ultimate analysis the society suffers and a criminal gets encouraged Tortures in police custody which of late are on the increase receive encouragement by this type of an unrealistic approach at times of the courts as well because it reinforces the belief in the mind of the police that no harm would come to them if one prisoner dies in the lock up because there would hardly be any evidence available to the prosecution to directly implicate them with the torture The courts must not lose sight of the fact that death in police custody is perhaps one of the worst kind of crimes in a civilized society governed by the rule of law and poses a serious threat to an orderly civilized society Disturbed by this situation <ORG> in its th Report recommended amendments to the Indian Evidence Act in short the Evidence Act so as to provide that in the prosecution of a police officer for an alleged offence of having caused bodily injuries to a person while in police custody if there is evidence that the injury was caused during the period when the person was in the police custody the court may presume that the injury was caused by the police officer having the custody of that person during that period unless the police officer proves to the contrary But at the same time there seems to be disturbing trend of increase in cases where false accusations of custodial torture are made trying to take advantage of the serious concern shown and the stern attitude reflected by the courts while dealing with custodial violence It needs to be carefully examined whether the allegations of custodial violence are genuine or are sham attempts to gain undeserved benefit masquerading as victims of custodial violence The accused persons five in number who were police officers of <ORG> Shahjahanabad Bhopal thus committed offences punishable under Sections and of Police Bhopal wrote a letter to the District Magistrate and also sent a letter to the Inspector General of Police for getting the matter investigated through some independent agency Statements were recorded the medical reports were obtained documents were seized panchnamas were prepared and on completion of the investigation the charge sheet was filed in the concerned court Being aggrieved by the said judgment conviction and sentence the accused appellants have filed appeal before <ORG> The appellants filed appeals before <ORG> While the latter version has been relied upon by the prosecution to contend that he had witnessed the deceased being taken away by the police officers PW on the other hand claimed to have witnessed beatings given by the accused persons to the deceased He gave varying dates so far his date of arrest is concerned Evidence of <NAME> PW has been corroborated by the evidence of other witnesses It was further stated that they took him to the emergency ward where he was declared dead In the examination under Section of the Code the accused appellant <NAME> has taken the similar stand The identification proceedings are in the nature of tests and significantly therefore there is no provision for it in the Code and the Evidence Act This is a very common plea of the accused and therefore the prosecution has to be cautious to ensure that there is no scope for making such allegation If however circumstances are beyond control and there is some delay it cannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution The identification parades belong to the stage of investigation and there is no provision in the Code which obliges the investigating agency to hold or confers a right upon the accused to claim a test identification parade But on a reading of the evidence of it seems to us clear that <NAME> knew the appellant by sight Though he made a mistake about his name by referring to him as <NAME> it was within the knowledge of <NAME> that the appellant was a brother of <NAME> and he identified him as such We do not think that there is any justification for the contention that the absence of the identification parade or a mistake made as to his name would be necessarily fatal to the prosecution case in the circumstances The <ORG> concluded It seems to us that it has been clearly laid down by this Court in <NAME> The State of Rajasthan supra AIR Cri LJ that the absence of test identification in all cases is not fatal and if the accused person is well known by sight it would be waste of time to put him up for identification Of course if the prosecution fails to hold an identification on the plea that the witnesses already knew the accused well and it transpires in the course of the trial that the witnesses did not know the accused previously the prosecution would run the risk of losing its case Noticing these circumstances this Court held In view of this corroborative evidence we find no substance in the argument urged on behalf of the appellant that the Investigating Officer ought to have held an identification parade and that the failure of <NAME> to mention the names of the two accused to the neighbours who came to the scene immediately after the occurrence shows that his story cannot be true The case does not rest on the evidence of <NAME> alone and the corroborative circumstances to which we have referred to above lend enough assurance to the implication of the appellant This Court found that in the circumstances if the Courts below had convicted the appellant there was no reason to interfere In <NAME> and others State of Gujarat SCC after considering the earlier decisions this Court observed It becomes at once clear that the aforesaid observations were made in the light of the peculiar facts and circumstances wherein the police is said to have given the names of the accused to the witnesses The said decision in turn relied upon an earlier decision of this <ORG> in the case of <ORG> Delhi <ORG> The plea that the deceased had come to the police station in a severe condition and after telling his name has collapsed gets falsified by the categorical statement made by the accused in his statement under Section of the Code to the effect that on receiving information where the deceased was lying unconscious in injured state
