It further held that there was no equity in favour of the appellant so that he may claim the right to complete what was left incomplete by the donor in her life time Allowing the appeal HELD The respondent has not made out a case for defeating the clearly expressed intentions of the donor coupled with the authority with which the donor was armed by reason of the signed blank transfer forms There was no question of competing Section of the Act gives a wide connotation to transfer of property Section of the Companies Act says that they shall be movable property transferable in the manner provided by articles of the Company There is a distinction between the title to get on the register and the full property in the shares in a company There is nothing in Regulation to indicate that without strict compliance with some rigidly prescribed form the transaction must fail to achieve its purpose The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal after certification by <ORG> of fitness of the case for it I rises in the following circumstances <NAME> a flourishing lawyer made a will on and died childless on It held that there was no equity in favour of <NAME> so that he may claim a right to complete what was left incomplete by the donor in her lifetime even though there could be no doubt that <NAME> had intended to donate the shares to <NAME> It went on to say The circumstances as they clearly emerge and the facts as found by the Courts below go to show that the deed of gift was executed on March and at the same time the re levant share certificates were handed over by the donor to the donee and sometime between March when the gift deed was executed and April when <NAME> died blank transfer forms signed by <NAME> were handed over by <NAME> to <NAME> the donee The appellant submissions on facts found may be summarised as follows As between the donor and the donee the transfer was complete with the registration of the gift deed and as there was a registered document even delivery of share certificates to the donee was not necessary in view of Section Transfer of Property Act There was no evidence whatsoever in the case to repel the irresistible inference of an implied authority given to the donee to fill in and submit the transfer forms so as to obtain the necessary entries in the registers of the various companies concerned <ORG> had after giving all the necessary findings of fact in favour of the appellant misdirected itself by resorting to the doctrine that there is no equity to complete an incomplete transaction as there is when a bonafide purchaser for value comes before the <ORG> There was no question of any equity involved here Section of the Contract Act could not apply to a case where the subject matter of the alleged agency is the taking of steps to complete a transfer and not the rights which could only accrue after the necessary steps are taken Section of the Contract Act could apply to a case where an agent has an actual or existing interest in the subject matter of the agency We think that questions to be really decided in the case before us have tended to become needlessly clouded by references to statutory provisions and to doctrines or concepts which really operate in separate and distinct fields of their own Nor does it prescribe the mode for every legally recognised transfer Section of this Act gives a wide connotation to transfer of pro perty Section of the Companies Act says that they shall be movable property transferable in the manner provided by the articles of the company which was a case of handing over share certificates together with blank signed transfer forms <ORG> said at But further there seems to their Lordships a good deal of confusion arising from the prominence given to the fact that the full property in shares in a company is only in the registered holder He sold what in England would have been chooses in action and he delivered chooses in action We think that Section of the Transfer of Property Act Justifies such a splitting up of rights constituting property in shares just as it is well recognised that rights of ownership of a property may be split up into a right to the corpus and another to the usufruct of the property and then separately dealt with It deals with transfers of shares only because they give certain rights to the legally recognised shareholders and imposes some obligations upon them with regard to the companies in which they hold shares Shares in the company shall be transferred in the following form or in any usual or common form which the directors shall approve A of in consideration of the sum of rupees paid to me by <NAME> hereinafter called the said transferee do hereby transfer to the said transferee the share or shares numbered in the undertaking called <ORG> to hold unto the said transferee his executors administrators and assigns subject to the several conditions on which I held the same at the time of the execution thereof and I the said transferee do hereby agree to take the said share or shares subject to the conditions aforesaid There is nothing in regulation or anywhere else in our Company law to indicate that without strict compliance with some rigidly prescribed form the transaction must fail to achieve its purpose Considerable argument was advanced by both sides on the correct interpretation of the leading English case mentioned there Re Nose Midland Bank Executor Trustee Co of course between the transferor and the transferee certain equities arise even on the execution and handing over of a blank transfer and among these equities is the right of the transferee to claim the dividend declared and paid to the transferor who is treated as a trustee on behalf of the transferee other cases cited on behalf of the appellant which we will only mention without discussion were Thus we find in Palmer Company Law at There is nothing to limit the restrictions which a company articles may place on the right of transfer The articles may give the directiors power to refuse to register a transfer in any specified cases for instance where calls are in arrear or where the company has a lien on the shares and some such provisions are usually inserted In the type of cases contemplated above where there are special restrictions on the transfer of shares imposed by the articles of association the difficulty or defect is inherent in the character of such shares But such is not shown to be the case at all with any of the shares which formed the subject matter of the gift in favour of <NAME> Hence in our opinion cases which deal with inchoate rights to shares do not assist the respondent because at least a gift of the right to obtain the transfer of shares in the books of the companies concerned was shown to be complete on the terms of the gift deed of <NAME> coupled with the handing over of the share certificates and the subsequent signing of the blank transfer forms Case <NAME> <NAME> Ch and <NAME> North Western Bank Ch that where the articles are in the form in which they are in the present case a legal title is not acquired as against an equitable owner before registration or at all events until the date when the person seeking to register has a present absolute and unconditional right to have the transfer registered I am not called upon to define the meaning of a present absolute and unconditional right but as it appears to me I am not sure that anything short of registration would do except under very special circumstances At all events I am of opinion that in this case prior to the date of the injunction the defendant <ORG> had not a present absolute and unconditional right to the registration of the transfer of these shares and that the prior equitable right of the plaintiff Mrs <NAME> must prevail I was referred on that to the well known case of <NAME> <NAME> and also the recent case of Re In such circumstances it is of course well settled that there is no equity to complete the imperfect gift In this case as I understand it the testator had done everything in his power to divest himself of the shares in question to Mr <NAME> There was nothing else the testator could do Therefore it seems to me that the present case is not in pari materia with the two cases to which I have been referred There was no question here of competing equities because the donee appellant was shown to have obtained a complete legal right to obtain shares under the gift deed and an implied authority to take steps to get his name registered We therefore allow this appeal with costs and set aside the judgment and decree of <ORG> of <ORG> and restore that of the learned Single Judge
