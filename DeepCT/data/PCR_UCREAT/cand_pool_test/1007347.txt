Directing the release of the undertrials on their executing a personal bond It is necessary therefore that the law as enacted by the <ORG> and as administered by the courts must radically change its approach to pre trial detention and ensure reasonable just and fair procedure which has a creative connotation after the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case confers fundamental right on every person not to be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and it is not enough to constitute compliance with the requirement of that Article that some semblance of a procedure should be prescribed by law but that the procedure should be reasonable fair and just If a person is deprived of his liberty under a procedure which is not reasonable fair or just such deprivation would be violative of his fundamental right under Art Any procedure prescribed by law for depriving a person of his liberty cannot be reasonable fair or just unless that procedure ensures a speedy trial for determination of the guilt of such person It proceeds on the erroneous assumption that risk of monetary loss is the only deterrent against fleeing from justice A If the court is satisfied on a consideration of the relevant factors that the accused has his ties in the community and there is no substantial risk of non appearance the accused may as far as possible be released on his personal bond There is also another principle which makes it desirable to ensure that the accused is present to receive his sentence in the event of being found guilty The entire object being only to ensure that the undertrial does not flee or hide himself from trial all the relevant considerations which enter into the determination of that question must be taken into account The offences with which some of them are charged are trivial which even if proved would not warrant punishment for more than a few months perhaps for a year or two and yet these unfortunate forgotten specimens of humanity are in jail deprived of their freedom for periods ranging from three to ten years without even as much as their trial having commenced It is high time that the public conscience is awakened and the Government as well as the judiciary begin to realise that in the dark cells of our prisons there are large numbers of men and women who are waiting patiently impatiently perhaps but in vain for justice a commodity which is tragically beyond their reach and grasp Though we issued notice to the State of Bihar two weeks ago it is unfortunate that on the th February no one has appeared on behalf of the State and we must therefore at this stage proceed on the basis that the allegations contained in the issues of <ORG> dated th and th January which are incorporated in the writ petition are correct It is necessary therefore that the law as enacted by the <ORG> and as administered by the courts must radically change its approach to pretrial detention and ensure reasonable just and fair procedure which has creative connotation after <NAME> case supra There are several considerations which deter an accused from running away from justice and risk of financial loss is only one of them and that too not a major one If the court is satisfied on a consideration of the relevant factors that the accused has his ties in the community and there is no substantial risk of non appearance the accused may as far as possible be released on his personal bond Of course if facts are brought to the notice of the court which go to show that having regard to the condition and background of the accused his previous record and the nature and circumstances of the offence there may be a substantial risk of his non appearance at the trial as for example where the accused is a notorious bad character or a confirmed criminal or the offence is serious these examples are only by way of illustration the court may not release the accused on his personal bond and may insist on bail with sureties Moreover when the accused is released on his personal bond it would be very harsh and oppressive if he is required to satisfy the court and what we have said here in regard to the court must apply equally in relation to the police while granting bail that he is solvent enough to pay the amount of the bond if he fails to appear at the trial and in consequence the bond is forfeited We have no doubt that if the system of bail even under the existing law is administered in the manner we have indicated in this judgment it would go a long way towards relieving hardship of the poor and help them to secure pretrial release from incarceration There is also one other infirmity of the legal and judicial system which is responsible for this gross denial of justice to the undertrial prisoners and that is the notorious delay in disposal of cases We have held in that case that Article confers a fundamental right on every person not to be deprived of his life or liberty except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and it is not enough to constitute compliance with the requirement of that Article that some semblance of a procedure should be prescribed by law but that the procedure should be reasonable fair and just If a person is deprived of his liberty under a procedure which is not reasonable fair or just such deprivation would be violative of his fundamental right under Article and he would be entitled to enforce such fundamental right and secure his release Now obviously procedure prescribed by law for depriving a person of his liberty cannot be reasonable fair or just unless that procedure ensures a speedy trial for determination of the guilt of such person There can therefore be no doubt that speedy trial and by speedy trial we mean reasonably expeditious trial is an integral and essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in Article The question which would however arise is as to what would be the consequence if a person accused of an offence is denied speedy trial and is sought to be deprived of his liberty by imprisonment as a result of a long delayed trial in violation of his fundamental right under Article Would he be entitled to be released unconditionally freed from the charge levelled against him on the ground that trying him after an unduly long period of time and convicting him after such trial would constitute violation of his fundamental right under Article That is a question we shall have to consider when we hear the writ petition on merits on the adjourned date These are the reasons for which we made our order dated th February But there is another principle which makes it desirable to ensure that the accused is present to receive his sentence in the event of being found guilty Although sufficient opportunity was given to the State of Bihar to meet the allegations made it is unfortunate that no one has appeared on behalf of the State But at the same time we see no reason why interim relief should be denied to these undertrials After carefully considering what has been said in respect of each individual undertrial we have considered it appropriate in the interests of justice to make the order of February directing the release of the persons mentioned in that order on their executing a personal bond The entire object being only to ensure that the undertrial does not flee or hide himself from trial all the relevant considerations which enter into the determination of that question must be taken into account There is urgent need for a clear provision There are sufficient guarantees for appearance in the host of considerations to which reference has been made earlier and it seems to me our law makers would take an important step in defence of individual liberty if appropriate provision was made in the statute for non financial releases
