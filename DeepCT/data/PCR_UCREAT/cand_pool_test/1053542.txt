The validity of this Amending Act was challenged by the appellants on the ground that the Amending Act was unreasonable and arbitrary but <ORG> dismissed the writ petition In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the Amending Act does not seek to rectify or remove the defect or lacuna on the basis of which the collection of the excess sales tax had been set aside by <ORG> and that the increase in the rate of sales tax from to with retrospective effect is clearly arbitrary and unreasonable for if any particular provision of the statute is for some lacuna or defect in the statute declared unconstitutional or invalid it is open to the <ORG> to pass a Validating Act with retrospective effect so that the <ORG> may not be saddled with liability of refund or other consequences which may arise as a result of the particular provision being declared invalid The only object of enacting the amended provision it appears is to nullify the effect of the judgment which became conclusive and binding on the parties to enable <ORG> to retain the amount wrongfully and illegally collected as sales tax and this object has been sought to be achieved by the impugned amendment which does not even purport or seek to remedy or remove the defect and lacuna but merely raises the rate of duty from to and further proceeds to nullify the judgment and order of <ORG> The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The question of constitutional validity of the Mysore Sales Tax Amendment Act Mysore Act of hereinafter referred to as the Act falls for determination in these two appeals preferred by the appellants with certificate granted by <ORG> under Art There was no dispute as to the amount of sales tax payable by the licensees upto Challenging the validity of the collection of the sales tax on the aforesaid basis the appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> at Bangalore being writ petition No of related to the excise year only the appellant filed two other writ petitions being writ petitions nos and both of for subsequent excise years These three writ petitions of the appellant along with similar writ petitions filed by other contractors were disposed of by a common judgment by a division Bench of <ORG> on th July <ORG> for reasons recorded in the judgment held We allow the rest of the petitioners only to the extent of holding that <ORG> is not entitled to collect from the petitioners any amount by way of Sales Tax on the following viz In the said petitions we hereby issue writs directing <ORG> to forbear from collecting from the petitioners any amount representing Sales Tax on the following viz Against the judgment of <ORG> the State preferred an appeal to <ORG> but the appeal was subsequently withdrawn It may be noticed that although the appellants had obtained an order of stay of payment of the disputed sales tax amounts from from <ORG> there were various other contractors who had paid the same computed on the sale price of <ORG> together with excise duty and the cess The Ordinance was replaced by the impugned Act which came into force on th July It shall be deemed to have come into force on the nineteenth day of July Notwithstanding anything contained in any judgment decree or order of any court or other authority the sales tax on country liquor other than toddy levied or collected or purported to have been levied or collected shall for all purposes be deemed to be and to have always been validly levied or collected in accordance with law as if this Act had been in force at all material times when such tax was levied or collected and accordingly a all acts proceedings or things done or taken by any authority or officer or person in connection with the levy or collection of such tax shall for all purposes be deemed to be and to have always been done or taken in accordance with law no suit or proceeding shall be entertained maintained or continued in any court for the refund of any tax as paid and no court shall enforce any decree or order directing the refund of any tax so paid The validity of this Amending Act has been challenged on the ground that the Amending Act is unreasonable and arbitrary The principal contention raised on behalf of the appellant is that the Amending Act does not seek to rectify or remove the defect or lacuna on the basis of which the collection of the excess sales tax had been set aside by <ORG> It is argued by the learned counsel for the appellant that <ORG> had held that the sales tax could not be levied on collected on Excise duty Health cess and Education cess imposed on Arrack or special liquor and had directed the refund of the amount collected on excise duty and cess which were included in the selling price of arrack It is the submission of the learned counsel that the amendment has been brought about only for the purpose of circumventing the judgment of <ORG> with the object of avoiding the liability to refund the amount wrongfully and illegally collected as sales tax from the appellant by raising the amount of tax from to In support of the submissions made particular reliance has been placed on the two decisions of this <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <ORG> etc In the Schedule were specified the three notifications enhancing the rate of cess On the question whether the enhanced levy was validated by the Act a five Judge Bench of this Court held that it did not give legal effect to the imposition of cess at the enhanced rate This Court thereafter allowed the appeals by the assessees Meanwhile an Amending Act called the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Gujarat Amendment Act had been passed introducing A into the Act but that provision was not brought to the notice of this Court makes a direct inroad into the judicial powers of the <ORG> and the Legislatures which under the Constitution have within prescribed limits powers to make laws prospectively and retrospectively are competent in exercise of these powers to remove the basis of a decision passed by a competent <ORG> thereby rendering the decision ineffective but no legislature in this country has power to ask the instrumentalities of the <ORG> to disobey or disregard the decision given by <ORG> and A was repugnant to the Constitution The most important condition of course is that the legislature must possess the power to impose the tax for if it does not the action must ever remain ineffective and illegal A <ORG> decision must always bind unless the conditions on which it is based are so fundamentally altered that the decision could not have been given in the altered circumstances The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the <ORG> has submitted that this very contention that the <ORG> has sought to enhance the rate of tax without seeking to remove or rectify the lacuna which was there in the earlier Act and for which the earlier provision has been struck down by <ORG> was raised in the writ petition filed in <ORG> by the appellant It is relevant to state that under the Act where the <ORG> is deemed to be a dealer entitled to collect tax under Section there is no provision for making an assessment of tax by the assessing authorities as in the case of ordinary dealers Without making an assessment the <ORG> Government is entitled to collect amounts by way of tax in the same manner as any other registered dealer authorised to do so under Section He submits that there are no valid grounds for interfering with the judgment of <ORG> In the earlier case between the parties to which reference has already been made <ORG> issued writs directing <ORG> to fore bear from collecting from the appellant any amount representing the sales tax on the following namely excise duty health cess and education cess imposed on Arrack or special liquor and to refund to the appellant what might have been collected from them by way of sales tax on items of excise health cess and education cess on Arrack or special liquor <ORG> had passed the aforesaid order issuing appropriate writ in view of <ORG> finding that sales tax is not payable on excise duty health cess and education cess In view of the aforesaid judgment and order passed by <ORG> amounts collected by the <ORG>s by way of Sales Tax on items of excise health cess and education cess on Arrack or special liquor from the appellant became refundable to the appellant It appears that the only object of enacting the amended provision is to nullify the effect of the judgment which became conclusive and binding on the parties to enable the <ORG> Government to retain the amount wrongfully and illegally collected as sales tax and this object has been sought to be achieved by the impugned amendment which does not even purport or seek to remedy or remove the defect and lacuna but merely raises the rate of duty from to and further proceeds to nullify the judgment and order of <ORG> We accordingly set aside the judgment and order of <ORG> to the extent it upholds the validity of the impugned amendment with retrospective effect from Ist of April and to the extent it seeks to nullify the earlier judgment of <ORG> We accordingly allow the appeals to this extent The appellants shall be entitled to costs of these appeals with one set of hearing fee
