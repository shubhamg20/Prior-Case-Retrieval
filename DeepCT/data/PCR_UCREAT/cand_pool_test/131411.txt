On September <ORG> hereafter called the <ORG> issued notice annexure under Regulation of the Restrictive Trade Practices Inquiry Regulations stating that the <ORG> had reasons to believe that the companies mentioned in the notice including the petitioners had entered into an agreement on September and were indulging in restrictive trade practices of the nature specified in the notice In response the petitioners filed applications contesting the validity of the notice and amongst others urged that the agreement referred to in the notice already had the approval of <ORG> within the meaning of Section of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act hereafter called the Act and therefore it was outside the purview of Sections and of the Act It was further urged that on the face of it the agreement did not operate to result in restrictive trade practice within the meaning of Section of the Act and the <ORG> therefore had no jurisdiction to proceed in the matter These objections were treated by the <ORG> as preliminary objections and were decided against the petitioners by the impugned orders dated March and October which are assailed by this petition under Article of the Constitution The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has argued at length but we see no prima facie case For this purpose we may refer to Section of the Act relevant part of which reads as under According to this section the <ORG> has the jurisdiction to hold investigation and make inquiry irrespective of the fact whether the agreement is registered under Section of the Act or not It makes no exception in cases where the agreement has the approval of the <ORG> We are therefore unable to agree with the learned counsel that the question has been finally decided as indeed if that were so Section of the Act which provides that any person aggrieved by an order made by the <ORG> under Section can prefer an appeal to <ORG> would provide a conclusive answer to this writ petition We find as stated earlier that no final order with reference to Section of the Act has so far been made against the petitioners and as such it is premature to consider this plea This is especially so because on the facts of the case the <ORG> has to give reasons if it comes to a conclusion that the restrictive trade practice is prejudicial to the public interest We see no substance in this argument
