His case was that he was discharged in October on an invalid pension and whilst a pension it was dismissed on February on the ground that he had been found guilty of misconduct before his retirement He next contends that his dismissal was contrary to the provision in Sub section Section Government of India Act that no civil servant can be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed Before doing so I will state as briefly as possible the facts in A No of He framed charges and had examined all the witnesses by nd August Mr <NAME> opinion however did not coincide with that of Mr <NAME> who took the view that the evidence against the plaintiff did not justify his dismissal and that it would be better to get him invalidated if he was certified to be physically unfit for further service <NAME> declined to grant him that relief for the following reason that although undoubtedly the plaintiff suit was for a declaration that he had been wrongly dismissed and for damages on that account the latter were not his real remedy because if the order dismissing him was wrongful he was entitled to be restored to the position in which he was when dismissed in other words to become a pensioner once more As regards both the claim for a declaration and for damages for wrongful dismissal he held that such a suit did not lie against the Secretary of <ORG> he having come to a similar conclusion in the other suit in which the relief sought was merely damages for wrongful dismissal I propose first of all to deal with the question of whether the appellant contention is right that he can only be dismissed by the authority by which he was appointed and not by any authority subordinate to that This contention is founded upon a construction of Section and the appellant contends that no power is given in that sub section to delegate the power of dismissal to any authority subordinate to that which makes the appointment and invites us to say that the opening words of the section namely subject to the provisions of this Act and of rules made thereunder only apply to the earlier half of that sub section and not the latter If that is so the Secretary of <ORG> under Sub section could make rules regulating the conditions of service and discipline and conduct of the civil servants to whom the Act applies That sub section expressly provides that rules may be made delegating the power of making rules to Local Governments I think that it is quite clear that Mr <NAME> considered that such of the charges which in his opinion had been proved against the appellant would not justify dismissal and that he thought it would be better to invalid the plaintiff If that resulted in the appellant being granted an invalid pension then he intended to drop the disciplinary proceedings But nevertheless I arrived at the same conclusion as that reached by <NAME> <ORG> It was further contended by the learned Advocate General that Mr <NAME> had no authority to act in this manner that is to say to give the appellant the alternative of getting out of the service in this way in order to avoid a decision in the disciplinary proceedings but he was unable to quote any rule showing the contrary and whilst I fully agree that it is undesirable that such a method of disposal of pending charges of misconduct should be adopted there is nothing in my view to prohibit it That being so the appellant asks for a declaration that he has been wrongfully dismissed and for damages What is the real remedy for which the appellant sues I agree with <NAME> that the appellant real object is to get himself restored to the position in which he was before he was dismissed in other words to become a pensioner once more and this observation must also apply to the claim for damages which is for his pension in another shape In the coarse of the judgment of their Lordships of <ORG> which was delivered by Lord <NAME> it is said that it was at least open to doubt whether that suit was within the purview of Section Specific Relief Act and that there could be no doubt as to the origin and purpose of that section which was intended to introduce the provisions of Section Chancery Procedure Act of as interpreted by Judicial decision and that before that Act it was not the practice of the <ORG> in ordinary suits to take a declaration of right except as introductory to relief which it proceeded to administer The declaration asked for is that the appellant was not liable to he removed from service subsequent to his retirement Upon the outbreak of the war in and before any leave was granted to the defendants the <ORG> took possession of the reclaimed land and were ready to make a payment in lieu of rates to the overseers of the poor of the adjoining pariah if certified that the land was of that parish The appellant therefore claimed that he had been wrongfully dismissed from <ORG> service and asked for damages for that wrongful dismissal It seems to me that the only question is whether the appellant held his appointment at the pleasure of the <ORG> These cases in my opinion have no bearing on this suit which is a suit for damages for wrongful dismissal that is to say for a breach of contract There are certain sections of the Government of India Act of and rules made thereunder to be considered in this connexion and the effect of one of them viz Section was considered by <ORG> That reads as follows Every person shall have the same remedies against the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> as he might have had against <ORG> if the Government of India Act of and this Act had not been passed This means that if the plaintiff could have brought a similar suit against <ORG> before the year he would be entitled to bring this suit That section states that every person in the civil service of the <ORG> in India holds office during His Majesty pleasure It is however argued on behalf of the appellant that His Majesty pleasure is qualified by the opening words of the sub section namely subject to the provisions of this Act and of the rules made thereunder and that the rules made thereunder place a limitation upon the exercise of the otherwise unlimited pleasure in the <ORG> because when the dismissal removal or reduction of any officer is ordered the order must be preceded by a properly recorded departmental enquiry resulting in a finding upon all the charges preferred against the officer By Rule <ORG> may for good and sufficient reasons amongst other things remove or dismiss any officer holding a post in a provincial or subordinate service or a special appointment Rule provides for the delegation of the powers conferred by Rule to any subordinate authority and Rule gives a right of appeal to every officer against whom an order may be passed under Rules and It is contended for the appellant that Rules and limit the power of the <ORG> to dismiss at pleasure and in support of this argument a decision of <ORG> namely in <NAME> <NAME> A is relied on In Part of the Act there were certain disciplinary regulations governing the dismissal of the servant and laying down the procedure to be adopted prior to any order of dismissal The plaint tiff alleged and it was common ground that before his service had been determined in the manner prescribed by the Act the Government dismissed him and he accordingly brought a suit for damages for wrongful dismissal against the appellant It is clear that the procedure prescribed by the Act was not followed by the Government but it was argued on their behalf that the rule was that civil servants of the <ORG> held office only during pleasure that the Act did not either expressly or by implication change the nature of the Civil Servants tenure of office and that the disciplinary regulations in Part of the Act to which reference has already been made were not inconsistent with the continuation of the general common law rule as to tenure It was held that the <ORG> had by law whether in England or new South Wales power to dismiss at pleasure either a civil or military officer a condition to that effect being an implied term of the contract of service except where it was otherwise expressly provided but that as the provisions in Part of the Act were manifestly intended for the protection and benefit of the officer they were inconsistent with such condition and that consequently the power of the <ORG> to dismiss at pleasure was restricted in that respect There is however the all important distinction between that case and this namely that in this case Section Government of India Act does expressly state that the tenure is at the pleasure of the <ORG> whereas in the former case there was no such express enactment and that being so in the face of the provisions in Part which were inconsistent with any such tenure there could not be imported by implication into the contract of service the term that the <ORG> may put an end to it at its pleasure and with great respect to another decision relied upon by the appellant namely <NAME> Secretary of State Rang I think that <NAME> who decided that case and relied upon <NAME> <NAME> A misapprehended the grounds for that decision It seems to me that the tenure of the officer is either at pleasure or some higher tenure and if the contention of the appellant is correct then Section whilst expressly stating that the tenure is at the pleasure of the <ORG> in the same section makes a provision for rules which alter that tenure into one of good behaviour because Rule and the procedure laid down in Rule clearly relate only to the conduct of the officer Rule merely lays down the procedure to be followed and is in fact headed Procedure in oases of Dismissal Removal or Reduction In <NAME> <NAME> A where it was held that a Colonial Government was on the same footing as <ORG> as to the employment and dismissal of servants of the <ORG> and that in the absence of special contract they held their offices during the pleasure of the <ORG> it was stated by Lord <NAME> on pp and They consider that unless in special oases where it is otherwise provided servants of the <ORG> hold their offices during the pleasure of the <ORG> not by virtue of any special prerogative of the <ORG> but because such are the terms of their engagement as is well understood throughout the public service and as regards the regulations As for the regulations their Lordships again agree that they are merely directions given by the <ORG> to the Governments of <ORG> Colonies for general guidance and that they do not constitute a contract between the <ORG> and ids servants As stated by Lord <NAME> if the <ORG> at any time desires to alter the procedure provided in the rules it can do so without the assent of the officer and it cannot be argued therefore that the rules mace under Section have any contractual force There is in addition to this a further objection to the appellant argument namely Section Public Servants Enquiries Act of For the reasons stated in my view both the appeals must be dismissed with costs With regard to the memorandum of objections with regard to the order as to costs passed by Waller namely in No of ordering that the costs should be borne by the defendant respondent and in No of ordering no costs I see no reason whatever for interference Section Government of India Act of Every person shall have the same remedies against the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> as he might have had against <ORG> if the Government of India Act of and this Act had not been passed and the cases referred to therein and has held that the effect of the authorities is that the company could only be sued for acts done by it in its capacity as a trading corporation but it could not be sued for acts of sovereignty It has been pointed out in the course of arguments that this Bombay decision when it lays down that no action lies against the Secretary of <ORG> in respect of acts of <ORG> and acts of sovereignty goes too far in which it was held that where an act complained of is professedly done under the sanction of Municipal Law and in the exercise of power conferred by that law the fact that it is done by the sovereign power and is not an act which could possibly be done by a private individual does not oust the jurisdiction of the civil Court I do not think it necessary to go into any detailed examination of these cases as what has to be seen here is whether allowing that a suit can in some circumstances be brought against the Secretary of <ORG> in respect of acts done in exorcise of the powers of a sovereign a suit can be brought against him in India by a public servant who has been dismissed on the ground of the dismissal being wrongful There can be no doubt as to the dismissal of a public official being an act of sovereignty and normally as held by <NAME> in the case above cited no remedy in tort lies against the Secretary of <ORG> for any act done by an officer of Government in exercise of powers which cannot be exercised save by the sovereign power The suits under appeal however are not actions in tort but actions for damages for breach of contract and there is no doubt but that proceedings may be taken against the <ORG> for breach of contract in some cases In England the power of the <ORG> to dismiss a public servant who holds an appointment at its pleasure is absolute Except where it is otherwise provided by Statute all public officers oil the <ORG> hold their appointments at the pleasure of the <ORG> and all in general are subject to dismissal at any time without cause assigned nor will an action for wrongful dismissal be entertained even though a special contract be proved It is however argued that though normally in all parts of the British Dominions the <ORG> has the power to dismiss any of its officers at its pleasure yet that power may be limited by statute in which case an action can be brought by any officer who has been dismissed contrary to the statutory provisions by which the power of dismissal has been restricted The section of the Government of India Act which has to be considered in this connexion is Section the essential part of which for the purpose of these appeals runs as follows Subject to the provisions of this Act and of rules made thereunder every person in <ORG> in India holds office during his Majesty pleasure and may be employed in any manner required by a proper authority within the scope of his duty but no person in that service may be dismissed by any authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed The rules framed under this section which have to be looked into in connection with dismissals of public servants are Rules and Rule lays down that without prejudice to the provisions of any law for the time being in force the local Government may for good and sufficient reasons dismiss any Officer holding a post in a provincial or subordinate service Rule allows Government to delegate to any subordinate authority subject to such conditions as it may prescribe any of the powers conferred by Rule in regard to officers of the subordinate service Rules is as to the procedure in cases of dismissal removal or reduction and runs thus Without prejudice to the provisions of the Public Servants Enquiries Act in all such cases in which the dismissal of any officer is ordered the order shall except when it is based on facts or conclusions established at a judicial trial or when the officer concerned has absconded with the accusation hanging over him be proceeded by a properly recorded departmental inquiry At such an inquiry a definite charge in writing shall be framed in respect of each offence and explained to the accused the evidence in support of it and any evidence which he may adduce in his defence shall be recorded in his presence and his defence shall be taken down in writing Each of the charges framed shall be discussed and a finding shall be recorded on each charge In the case of the appellant in A No of the procedure prescribed by this rule was not followed at all The appellant in A No of preferred an appeal which was dismissed The authority on which the appellants rely for their contention that the right of the <ORG> to dismiss its officers at its pleasure can be restricted is <NAME> <NAME> A They rely further on some Indian decisions as showing that there is such a restriction in British India under Section In <NAME> <NAME> A there was an Act of New South Wales which prescribed the procedure to be followed in matters of discipline It was held that the provisions as to this were manifestly intended for the protection and benefit of the officer and were inconsistent with importing into the contract of service the term that the <ORG> might put an end to it at its pleasure however the omission was noticed but still it was held that despite the fact that such words occurred in Section it was clear that subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules framed thereunder indicated that certain formalities must be observed before a Civil Servant could be dismissed and that in so far as those formalities were alleged not to have bean followed the plaintiff was not precluded from bringing an action In <NAME> <NAME> A it was held by <ORG> that a Civil Servant in Western Australia held his office at the <ORG> pleasure and that there was no contract to the contrary because of certain regulations which constituted directions given by the <ORG> for the guidance of its officers Those regulations indeed were not statutory whereas the rules framed under Section are framed under a statute but none the less they can be altered from time to time without reference to or consent from the officers concerned I take this to mean that the Rule is governed by that Act When that is the case I find it impossible to say that the Government or the authority to whom it delegates its power in the matter cannot with reference to Rule dismiss its Civil Servants even without an enquiry That the appellant in A No of was doing work as a reader in a press which could have been done by a private person does not make him any the less a public servant or limit the right of Government to dismiss him at its pleasure The statutory rules give him no right of Suit and the general rule is that DO remedy can be taken but the particular remedy prescribed by the statute I agree with <ORG> that this appellant had no right of action There is now a rule giving a Deputy Inspector General of Police the power to dismiss a Sub Inspector as well as to appoint him but it is argued that this rule in so far as it allows an officer who has been appointed by an Inspector General to be dismissed by a Deputy Inspector General overrides the provisions of the statute But it has been argued by Mr <NAME> that the rules framed under Section are as to disciplinary action to be taken against <ORG> servants who are still in service and that a man not in service cannot be dealt with under them This brings us to the provisions of Section Pensions Act of by which except in certain cases that do not apply here no civil Court shall entertain any suit relating to any pension There is of course no such authorisation here This appellant may have a grievance in that his pension has been taken away after it had been granted for misconduct that had occurred before the grant had been made which is contrary to Article of the Civil Service Regulations I agree that both these appeals should be dismissed with costs Had there been a regular inquiry and it is not now contended that there was one though it was so contended at first there would have been no suit
