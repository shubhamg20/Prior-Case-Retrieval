On behalf of the claimants it was contended first chat the Land Acquisition Judge had no jurisdiction to review at the instance of the Secretary of <ORG> the award of the Collector in so far as it was not challenged by the claimants to re examine items not controverted by them and to set aside the award partially on the ground that it was illegal and void and secondly that the Land Acquisition Judge had no jurisdiction to make an order for discovery and at any rate if he had such jurisdiction fie had exercised it improperly in the case before him On behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> it was contended first that the Land Acquisition Judge had jurisdiction which he had improperly refused to exercise to review the award of the Collector to cancel or modify it or to remit the proceedings to him for reconsideration and secondly that if the Land Acquisition Judge did not possess such jurisdiction this <ORG> had at any rate jurisdiction to take action of the same description and that the circumstances of the case rendered the interference of this <ORG> essential in the interest of justice On behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> the application now before us has been presented for leave to appeal against the order of this <ORG> only in so far as thereby the Rule obtained by the claimants was made absolute The application has been opposed by the claimants on the ground that the order in question is neither an order passed or made on appeal nor a final order within the meaning of Section of the Code or Section of the Letters Patent Two questions therefore arise for consideration namely first whether an order passed by this <ORG> in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section of the Code of or of its power of superintendence under Section of the High <ORG>s Act of may be deemed to be an order made or passed on appeal and secondly whether the order in this case in so far as it reversed the order of the <ORG> below for discovery and decided that it was beyond the competency of the Land Acquisition Judge to review certain portion of the award of the Collector is a final order within the meaning of Section of the Code of and Section of the Letters Patent In so far as the first of these questions is concerned it has been contended on behalf of the claimants that an order passed by this <ORG> in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction under Section of the Code or of its powers of superintendence under Section of the Charter Act cannot rightly be regarded as passed on appeal In support of this view reliance has been placed upon the arrangement of the provisions of the Code of which distinguish between appellate and revisional jurisdiction the principles which regulate the former are contained in Part VII embracing Sections to whereas the principles which underlie the latter are enunciated in Section contained in Part VIII In answer to this argument it has been contended on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> that even if it be conceded that the arrangement of the Code lends some colour of apparent support to the contention of the claimants the position becomes materially different when the provisions of Section of the Letters Patent are examined After careful consideration of the arguments which have been addressed to us and of the judicial decisions to which we shall presently refer we have arrived at the conclusion that the contention of the claimants in so far as this particular point is concerned cannot be sustained Consequently if we were to uphold the contention of the claimants that the expression an order made on appeal in Section does not include an order made in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction or of the powers of superintendence vested in the <ORG> we might be driven to the position that the <ORG> cannot exercise any revisional jurisdiction at all as such jurisdiction is not expressly mentioned in the Letters Patent The question therefore arises whether the revisional jurisdiction is essentially distinct from the appellate jurisdiction or whether it was intended by the Letters Patent to be included in the appellate jurisdiction We are therefore unable to accept as well founded the contention of the claimants that a narrow interpretation should be placed upon the expression made on appeal in Section of the Letters Patent and its application excluded from all cases in which the order has been made in the exercise of revisional jurisdiction or the power of superintendence vested in the <ORG> The principle of that decision applies with peculiar force to the circumstances of the present case They invited this <ORG> to consider the propriety of the order in so far as it affected the interest of each Under such circumstances the language of Section of the Letters Patent in our opinion does not require to be unduly stretched to enable us to hold that the order now sought to be impeached by way of appeal to His Majesty in Council was made by this <ORG> on appeal and <NAME> <NAME> where it was held that an order rejecting an application to review a judgement passed on appeal was not an order made on appeal within the meaning of Section of the Letters Patent This view may be defended on the ground that the order refusing an application for review is an order made by the identical <ORG> which passed the order assailed in other words the first element essential to constitute appellate jurisdiction namely the existence of the relations of superior and inferior <ORG> is absent We may also add that the case of <NAME> Gopal Chandra Neog is not inconsistent with the view we take as the point in controversy there apparently was whether an order by this <ORG> in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction allowing a party to sue in forma pauperis was a final judgment within the meaning of Section of the Letters Patent Upon a review then of the principles we have explained as also of the authorities to which reference has been made we are not prepared to give effect to the contention of the claimants in the case before us that the order against which leave is sought to appeal to His Majesty in Council is not an order made on appeal within the meaning of Section of the Letters Patent In so far as the second question raised by the claimants is concerned it has been argued on their behalf that the order passed by this <ORG> is not a final order within the meaning of Section of the Code of or Section of the Letters Patent In answer to this contention it has been argued on behalf of the Secretary of <ORG> that the order is a final order inasmuch as so far as this <ORG> is concerned the decision of the points in controversy has become final and cannot be re opened when an appeal is preferred against the ultimate decree of the Land Acquisition Judge Now it is obvious that whether a particular order is a final order for the purpose of the grant of leave to appeal to His Majesty in Council must depend upon its nature and contents and its relation to the proceedings in which it lies been made The order in the case before us as has already been explained deals with two questions raised in the <ORG> below namely first whether the Land Acquisition Judge had jurisdiction upon the reference obtained by the claimants to consider the validity of the award of the Collector in so far as it is not challenged on their behalf and secondly whether the Land Acquisition Judge had made a proper order for discovery against the claimants It is in our opinion clear beyond the possibility of dispute that in so far as the order sought to be impeached deals with the question of the propriety of the order for discovery it is in no sense a final order within the meaning of Section of the Letters Patent or of Section of the Code of To use the language of their Lordships of <ORG> in <NAME> Collector of Jaunpur I A A the order merely directs procedure and is consequently not a final order The only point therefore which deserves serious consideration is whether the order in so far as it decides that certain portions of the award of the Land Acquisition Collector are not embraced within the scope of the investigation by the Special Judge is a final order for the purposes of appeal to His Majesty in Council Now the expression final order is not defined either in the Letters Patent or in the Code and it may be conceded that the judicial interpretation of the phrase is by no means free from difficulty The term final order denotes an order which finally decides any matter directly at issue in the case in respect of the rights of the parties The Question which was raised before the Special Judge as a preliminary matter for decision and which at the invitation of the parties has been determined by this <ORG> related to the precise scope of the enquiry before the Land Acquisition Judge There is no controversy that the Judge is entitled to investigate the propriety of the award of the Collector in so far as it is impeached by the claimants It is manifest that whatever view may be taken of the question in controversy between the parties the reference before the Judge cannot come to a termination without an investigation of the matters which admittedly form a legitimate subject of enquiry It may be conceded generally that a final order is one which determines the rights of the parties in the suit or proceeding or a distinct and definite branch of it and reserves no further question or direction for future determination except such as may be necessary to carry it into effect but an order may be final though it does not determine the rights of the parties if even without such determination it terminates the particular suit or proceeding As a general rule an order cannot be rightly considered final which settles part only of several issues of law or fact in other words if the order decides a question the solution of which cannot whatever view may be taken of it terminate the proceeding before the <ORG> it cannot be appropriately called a final order To take a concrete illustration assume that a <ORG> under Rule II of Order XIV of the Code of tries an issue of law first and subsequently proceeds to deal with the issues of fact it cannot reasonably be contended that the decision of the issue of law is an adjudication which conclusively determines the right of the parties with regard to any of the matters in controversy within the meaning of Section Clause of the Code so as to attract the operation of Section in other words such a decision of the issue of law in a pending suit is not a conclusive determination or final order see Behari Lal Pundit <NAME> which was accepted as good law in Chanda Sala <NAME> at Ind Reference was also made apparently with approval to the observation of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> that an order is final only where it is made upon an application or other proceedings which must whether such an application or other proceedings fail or succeed determine the action and conversely an order is interlocutory where it cannot be affirmed that in either event the action will be determined
