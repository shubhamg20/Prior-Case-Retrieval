PETITIONER <NAME> Vs RESPONDENT PARAS NATH DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> SIKRI BACHAWAT CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC RF SC ACT Temporary Control of Rent and Eviction Act ss and District Magistrate refusing permission to landlord to sue tenant for eviction Commissioner in revision granting it Landlord filing suit and obtaining decree state Government thereafter revoking permission by order Such order whether renders decree unenforceable HEADNOTE The appellant was a tenant of the respondent in respect of a shop in Agra Uttar Pradesh The respondent applied to the District Magistrate under of the Temporary Control of Rent and Eviction Act for permission to institute a suit against the appellant for evicting him from the shop The appellant thereupon moved <ORG> under of the Act but it was only after the respondent had flied a suit and obtained a decree that <ORG> passed an order revoking the permission granted by the Commissioner special leave the question for consideration was whether a decree for eviction obtained in a suit instituted after obtaining the permission of the Commissioner under of the Act becomes unenforceable if <ORG> acting under of the Act revokes the permission granted by the Commissioner after the decree is passed There is no provision in the Act providing that a suit validly instituted after getting the required permission under ceases to be maintainable because of any order made by <ORG> under Similarly there is no provision in the Act invalidating a decree passed after the Act came into force in a validly instituted suit On an examination of the relevant provisions of the Act the conclusion must be that when the Commissioner sets aside the order passed by the District Magistrate granting permission to file a suit for ejecting a tenant the order of the Commissioner prevails If he cancels the permission granted by the District Magistrate there is no effective permission left and the suit instituted by It follows that the <ORG> decision in <NAME> case to the extent it held that a suit filed by the landlord after obtaining the permission of the District Magistrate cannot become infructuous even if the Commissioner revokes the permission was incorrect <NAME> case was however correctly decided in so far as it held that a suit validly instituted after obtaining a permission as required by does not cease to be maintainable even if <ORG> revokes after the institution of the suit the permission granted The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The question of law that arises for decision in this appeal by special leave is not free from difficulty That question is whether a decree for eviction obtained in a suit instituted after obtaining the permission of the Commissioner under sub of of the Temporary Control of Rent and Eviction Act to be hereinafter referred to as the Act becomes unenforceable if the State Government acting under of that Act revokes the permission granted by the Commissioner after the decree is passed The appellant was a tenant of the respondent in respect of a shop in Balugani in Agra On January the respondent applied to the District Magistrate under of the Act for permission to institute a suit against the appellant for evicting him from the shop in question The respondent took up the matter in revision to the Commissioner under sub of On January the respondent served on the appellant a notice under of the Transfer of Property Act The appellant filed his written statement in that case on May Therein again he took the plea that the permission granted by the Commissioner is not final as he had moved the <ORG> to revoke the same As against that decision the respondent went up in second appeal to <ORG> This appeal is directed against that decision It is deemed to have come into force on the st day of October though it was passed in Subject to any order passed under sub section no suit shall without the permission of the District Magistrate be filed in any civil court against a tenant for his eviction from any accommodation except on one or more of the following grounds A Where any application as been made to the District Magistrate or permission to sue a tenant for eviction from any accommodation and the District Magistrate grants or refuses the permission the party aggrieved by his order may within days from the date on which the order is communicated to him apply to the Commissioner to revise the order The Commissioner shall hear the application made under sub section as far as may be within six weeks from the date of making it and he may if he is not satisfied as to the correctness legality or propriety of the order passed by the District Magistrate or as to the regularity of proceedings held before him alter or revise his order or make such other order as may be just and proper by <ORG> under section be We have earlier quoted the relevant portion of The <ORG> held that a decree obtained in a suit for eviction instituted after obtaining the requisite permission will not become unenforceable even if <ORG> revoked after the decree is passed the permission granted in exercise of its powers under Majority of the Judges in that case further held that once a suit is instituted after obtaining the permission of the District Magistrate any further order made either by the Commissioner or <ORG> cannot affect the course of that suit or the decree passed therein <NAME> the other Judge did not express any opinion on that question but even according to him in the appeal filed against the decree the appellate court cannot receive in evidence the order made by <ORG> which means that the decree cannot be reversed on the ground that <ORG> had revoked the permission granted The contention of Mr <NAME> the learned Counsel for the appellant was that the Act generally speaking has restricted the right of the landlord to evict his tenant to one or other of the grounds mentioned in cls of but in order to meet any exceptional case it is provided in that a suit for eviction may be instituted on any ground other than those mentioned in cls If a landlord chooses to institute a suit on the basis of the permission granted by the District Magistrate or the Commissioner without waiting for the decision of <ORG> he takes the risk if <ORG> revokes the permission granted by the District Magistrate or the Commissioner then the suit must be deemed to have been instituted without permission and consequently not maintainable He urged that as empowers <ORG> to revise the order made by the subordinate authorities whether the same is in favour of the landlord or the tenant we should not place an interpretation on which would affect the power of <ORG> to do justice to the tenants for whose benefit the Act has been enacted On the other hand it was urged by Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the respondent that the landlord has a right to sue for the eviction of his tenant under the provision of the Transfer of Property Act subject to the restrictions stipulated therein a to of is to obtain the prior permission of the District Magistrate subject to the order made under sub of by the Commissioner once a suit is validly instituted in accordance with those provisions no order of <ORG> can either interfere with the course of that suit or invalidate the decree obtained therein It can exercise its power under that provision at any time it pleases may be after years or years the power conferred on <ORG> is extremely wide as observed by this Court in Shri Bhagwan and anr His further contention was that on a proper construction of sub of it would be seen that the suit instituted after obtaining the required permission being a validly instituted suit its progress cannot be interrupted the permission required under is the permission of the District Magistrate subject to any order under by the Commissioner in other words the permission given by the District Magistrate is not final till affirmed by the Commissioner till then it remains tentative once the Commissioner affirms the same or grants the permission asked for it becomes final and thus amounts to a valid permission to sue hence a suit filed on the basis of that permission is a validly instituted suit unless the permission granted was revoke by <ORG> before the institution of the suit Proceeding further he stated that it is true that the order of the Commissioner though final yet it is subject to any order that may be passed by <ORG> but the provision dealing with the permission to file a suit for eviction does not refer to the order under it only speaks of the permission granted by the District Magistrate subject to the order of the Commissioner and not further subject to any orders made by <ORG> In this connection he invited our attention to the fact that as against the order passed by the District Magistrate under subs of a revision petition can be filed before the Commissioner within days of that order and not thereafter The Commissioner has not even the power to condone the delay in filing the revision petition The power given to the <ORG> under is merely a supervisory power Such a power according to him is a reserve power and therefore has to be exercised before the court jurisdiction is invoked He particularly laid emphasis on the fact that sub of the compliance of which is necessary before validly instituting the suit does not at all refer to an order under It is not possible to find out from that provision under what circumstances the District Magistrate can grant the permission asked for and under what circumstances he can refuse the same It can be exercised by it in any way it pleases If a landlord files a suit for the eviction of his tenant without obtaining the permission of the District Magistrate that suit is not maintainable but if he files a suit after obtaining the permission of the District Magistrate and if the Commissioner revokes the permission granted by the District Magistrate in a properly instituted application under then the suit instituted by him will be considered as having been filed without the permission of the District Magistrate because in specific terms says that the permission given by the District Magistrate is subject to any order passed under sub In other words the permission given by the District Magistrate does not acquire any finality until either the period fixed for filing an application under sub of expires and no application under that section was filed within that time or if an application had been filed within that time the same had been disposed of by the Commissioner The permission to file a suit for eviction assumes finality under once the Commissioner decides the revision petition pending before him There is no provision in the Act providing that a suit validly instituted after getting the required permission under ceases to be maintainable because of any order made by <ORG> under Similarly there is no provision in the Act invalidating a decree passed after the Act came into force in a validly instituted suit Section provides no decree for the eviction of a tenant from any accommodation passed before the date of commencement of this Act shall in so far as it relates to the eviction of such tenant be executed against him as long as this Act remains in force except on any of the grounds mentioned in Provided that the tenant agrees to pay to the landlord reasonable annual rent or the rent payable by him before the passing of the decree whichever is higher No such provision was brought to our notice On an examination the relevant provisions of the Act our conclusion is that when the Commissioner sets aside the order passed by the District Magistrate granting permission to file a suit for ejecting a tenant the order of the Commissioner prevails If he cancels the permission granted by the District Magistrate there is no effective permission left and the suit instituted by the plaintiff without awaiting his decision must be treated as one filed without any valid permission by the District Magistrate From this it follows that the <ORG> decision in <NAME> case to the extent it held that a suit filed by the landlord after obtaining the permission of the District Magistrate cannot become infructuous even if the Commissioner revokes the permission is incorrect But we agree with the <ORG> that a suit validly instituted after obtaining a permission as required by does not cease to be maintainable even if <ORG> revokes after the institution of the suit the permission granted But in the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs
