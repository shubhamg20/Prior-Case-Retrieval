HEADNOTE The petitioner a registered co operative society carrying on the business of plying motor buses as stage carriages had permits for four routes which were due to expire It was contended on behalf of the petitioner that in view of Ch IVA of the Act the <ORG> had no right to apply for permits except thereunder and the grant of permits on applications made under Ch IV was therefore illegal and infringed the petitioner fundamental rights under Arts The powers conferred by the two chapters being thus not one but two different powers the principle enunciated in <NAME> case has no application There was therefore no reason for holding that Ch IVA of the Act contained the only provision under which the Govern ment could be allowed to ply stage carriages If its decision was in any way erroneous having regard to the proviso to of the Act that could not amount to a violation of Art The petitioner had other remedies open to him The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The petitioner is a co operative society duly registered and it carries on the business of plying motor buses as stage carriages on the public highways in the State of Bombay Its case in this petition is that it has been deprived of its right to carry on this business and has also been subjected to discriminatory treatment in the matter of the grant of permits to run its buses The questions raised in this matter turn on some of the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act as amended by Act of A transport vehicle is defined in as a public service vehicle or a goods vehicle Section provides that every application for a permit shall be made to <ORG> of the region in which it is proposed to use the vehicle Section specifies the matters to which <ORG> shall have regard in considering an application for the grant of a permit Section provides that the provisions of Chapter IVA shall have effect notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Chapter IV taking notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Chapter IV It appears that the petitioner had permits to run buses on four routes in Aurangabad and that these permits were due to expire on October The petitioner again moved <ORG> which thereupon quashed the order of respondent No granting temporary permits to the State of Bombay On August the petitioner filed the present petition in this <ORG> under art of the Constitution for appropriate writs quashing the order of respondent No dated July restraining the State of Bombay from applying for permits save under the provisions of Chapter IVA and respondent No from entertaining any application by the State of Bombay under Chapter IV and directing respondent No to hear the petitioner applications for permits according to law It says that the order of the first respondent granting permits to the State of Bombay Under chapter IV was therefore illegal and affected its fundamental rights under art If a statute contains provisions giving more than one power then the rule cannot be applied so as to take away the powers conferred by anyone of these provisions The <ORG> has of course the power to do any business it likes and therefore the business of running stage carriages We have earlier drawn attention to the change made in cl a of by the amendment of The rule applied in <NAME> case does not permit the ordinary meaning of sub and sub cl a to be cut down because of the provisions of Chapter IVA Under Chapter IV the <ORG> does not have any such advantage it has to compete with other applicants to secure permits to be able to run its buses Where the statutory language is plain and the meaning clear there is no scope for applying the rule It contemplates that the <ORG> has to apply for permits under to run buses as a commercial enterprise It is said that Chapter IVA must therefore be construed as containing the only provisions enabling the <ORG> to run a stage carriage The observations in the cases referred to had been made in regard to cl a of as it stood before its amendment in We find nothing in <NAME> case or any other case which points to an evil nor has the learned counsel drawn our attention to any which the Act can be said to have intended to remedy We therefore find no justification for reading Chapter IVA as containing A The learned counsel then referred to the concluding portion of which makes it incumbent on the authority considering applications for permits to take into consideration the representations made by the persons therein mentioned There is nothing in which leads to the conclusion that whenever the <ORG> applies along with private citizens for permits the <ORG> must get them It also seems to us that there is nothing in our law to prevent the <ORG> from entering a business in competition with private citizens It is said that the <ORG> is not an individual owner and therefore it is not contemplated as an applicant for a permit under We will now consider the question of the violation of art The first contention in this regard was based on the proviso to The decision of respondent No may have been right or wrong and as to that we say nothing but we are unable to see that decision offends Art The respondent No was acting as a quasi judicial body and if it has made any mistake in its decision there are appropriate remedies available to the petitioner for obtaining relief For these reasons we think that this petition must fail and hence it is dismissed with costs
