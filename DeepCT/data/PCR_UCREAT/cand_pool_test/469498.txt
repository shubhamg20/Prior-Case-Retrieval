The appellants filed writ petitions in <ORG> questioning the notification under and declaration under of the Act alleging that the action of the <ORG> in invoking and dispensing with the inquiry under A were not called for since the case of urgency put forward by the State <ORG> had been belied by the delay of nearly one year that had ensued between the date of notifica tion under and the declaration under of the Act It was also contended that in the large extent of the land acquired there were some buildings here and there and so the acquisition was not justified since these portions were not either waste or arable lands which could be dealt with under <ORG> being of the view that the failure to issue the declaration under of the Act immediately after the notification under was fatal held that the notification dated April under which contained a direction under dispensing with the inquiry under A of the Act was invalid and therefore both the notification under and the subsequent declaration made under were liable to be quashed The schemes relating to development of residential areas in the urban centres are so urgent that it is necessary to invoke of the Act to dispense with the inquiry under A In the instant case there is no allegation of any kind of mala fides on the part of either the <ORG> or any of the officers nor do the respondents contend that there was no urgent necessity for providing housing accommodation to a large number of people of the city during the relevant time In a situation where there is real urgency it would be difficult to apply section A of the Act in the case of few bits of land on which some structures are standing and to exempt the rest of the property from its application Meerut for its housing scheme with the object of providing housing accommodation to the residents of Meerut city He accordingly wrote a letter on December to the Commissioner and Secretary <ORG> <ORG> recom mending the acquisition of the above extent of land in the villages men tioned above and he also stated that since there was acute shortage of houses in Meerut city it was necessary that <ORG> should invoke section i and of the Land Acquisition Act hereinafter referred to as the Act The certificate further stated that the land which was proposed to be acquired was being used for cultivation and that the said land had been proposed to be used for residential purposes under the master plan of Meerut city After taking into consideration all the material before it including the certificates of the Collector and the Secretary <ORG> referred to above <ORG> published a notification under subsection of section of the Act notifying for general information that the land mentioned in the Schedule was needed for a public purpose namely for the construction of residential buildings for the people of Meerut by <ORG> under a planned development scheme The possession of the land which had been notified for acquisition was taken and handed over to <ORG> in July <ORG> after hearing the parties held that the notification dated under section of the Act which contained a direction under section of the Act dispensing with the inquiry under section A of the Act was an invalid one and therefore both the notification under section and the subsequent declaration made under section of the Act were liable to be quashed That was the effect of quashing the notification issued under section of the Act and all subsequent proceedings as the relief was not confined to the petitioners only The main ground on which <ORG> set aside the impugned notification and the declaration was that the case of urgency put forward by <ORG> for dispensing with the compliance with the provisions of section A of the Act had been belied by the delay of nearly one year that had ensued between the date of the notification under section and the date of declaration made under section of the Act It however rejected the contention of the petitioners based on the delay that had preceded the issue of the notification under section of the Act That there was delay of nearly one year between the publication of the notification under section of the Act containing the direction dispensing with the compliance with section A of the Act and the date of publication of the declaration issued under section of the Act is not disputed It is seen from the record before us that after the publication of the notification under section of the Act the Collector after going through it found that there were some errors in the notification which needed to be corrected by issuing a corrigendum It is on account of some error on the part of the officials who were entrusted with the duty of processing of the case at the level of the <ORG> there was a delay of nearly one year between the publication of the notification under section and the publication of the declaration under section of the Act In this case there is no allegation of any kind of mala fides on the part of either the <ORG> or any of the officers nor do the respondents contend that there was no urgent necessity for providing housing accommodation to a large number of people of Meerut city during the relevant time The letters and the certificates submitted by the Collector and the Secretary of <ORG> to <ORG> before the issue of the notification under section of the Act clearly demonstrated that at that time there was a great urgency felt by them regarding the provision of housing accommodation at Meerut We may take judicial notice of this fact Perhaps at the time to which the decision in <ORG> State of Maharashtra related the situation might have been that the schemes relating to development of residential areas in the urban centres were not so urgent and it was not necessary to eliminate the inquiry under section A of the Act During this period of nearly years since then the population of India has gone up by hundreds of millions and it is no longer possible for the Court to take the view that the schemes of development of residential areas do not appear to demand such emergent action as to eliminate summary inquiries under section A of the Act The observation made in the above decision of <ORG> is quoted with approval by this Court in <NAME> Lt It was next contended that in the large extent of land acquired which was about acres there were some buildings here and there and so the acquisition of these parts of the land on which buildings were situated was unjustified since those portions were not either waste or arable lands which could be dealt with under section of the Act We do not however find any substance in it In such a situation where there is real urgency it would be difficult to apply section A of the Act in the case of few bits of land on which some structures are standing and to exempt the rest of the property from its application The power to take possession under sub section may also be exercised in the case of land other than waste or arable land where the land is acquired for in connection with sanitary improvements of any kind or planned development It is no doubt true that in the notification issued under section of the Act while exempting the application of section A of the Act to the proceedings the State <ORG> had stated that the land in question was arable land and it had not specifically referred to sub section A of section of the Act under which it could take possession of land other than waste and arable land by applying the urgency clause The mere omission to refer expressly section A of the Act in the notification cannot be considered to be fatal in this case as long as the <ORG> had the power in that sub section to take lands other than waste and arable lands also by invoking the urgency clause We do not therefore find any substance in the above contention It is however argued by the learned counsel for the respondents that many of the persons from whom lands have been acquired are also persons without houses or shop sites and if they are to be thrown out of their land they would be exposed to serious prejudice We may at this stage refer to the provision contained in section of the Delhi Development Act which reads as follows The powers of the <ORG> or as the case may be the local authority concerned with respect to the disposal of land under sub section shall be so exercised as to secure so far as practicable that persons who are living or carrying on business or other activities on the land shall if they desire to obtain accommodation on land belonging to the <ORG> or the local authority concerned and are willing to comply with any requirements of the <ORG> or the local authority concerned as to its development and use have an opportunity to obtain thereon accommodation suitable to their reasonable requirements on terms settled with due regard to the price at which any such land has been acquired from them Provided that where the <ORG> or the local au thority concerned proposes to dispose of by sale any land without any development having been undertaken or carried out thereon it shall offer the land in the first instance to the persons from whom it was acquired if they desire to purchase it subject to such requirements as to its develop ment and use as the <ORG> or the local authority concerned may think fit to impose We accordingly allow these appeals set aside the judgment of <ORG> and dismiss the Writ Petitions filed by the respondents in <ORG> There is no order as to costs
