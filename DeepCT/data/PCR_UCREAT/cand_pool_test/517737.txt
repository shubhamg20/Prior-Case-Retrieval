General Clauses Act Sections and Whether there is any inconsistency between the Major <ORG>s Act and the <ORG> Act Operation efficacy and effectiveness of quit notice issued by assist ant estate manager under the <ORG> Act The appellant was served with a notice under Section read with Section of the Transfer of Property Act terminating the tenancy in terms of the covenants of lease and directing delivery of possession of the demised property giving one month time from nd January In the meanwhile the Major <ORG> Act a Central Act was made applicable to the <ORG> by operation of Section A thereof with effect from February One suit was dismissed on the ground that the tenancy was not duly determined as per law while the other suits were decreed The appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> under Articles and of the Constitution and the other tenants filed regular appeals to a Bench of two Judges of <ORG> which were pending In the writ petition of the appellant petitioner challenged the vires of sections and of the Maharashtra Amending Act introducing Section A in Chapter VII of the Presidency Small Cause <ORG>s Act and deleting Sections to from the Principal Act and of amendment of SectiOn thereof as well as Section of the Presidency Small Cause <ORG>s Act as amended by the Maharashtra Amendment Act of as offending Article of tile Constitution When the matter came up before the Single Judge of <ORG> it was referred to <ORG> which upheld the constitutional validity of the said sections and remitted the matter to the Single Judge for disposal on merits It was contended on behalf of the appel lant that the quit notice issued under Section read with Section III of the Transfer of Property Act was invalid and that by issue of the said notice no right accrued to the respondents and that the termination of tenancy became operative only on expiry of one month given thereunder i February by which date the <ORG> Act became inop erative as from February the Central Act had come into force that termination of tenancy was an act inter vivos by operation of Section read with Section III of the Transfer of Property Act and that under Section the respondent not being a living person was not entitled to the benefit of the quit notice as its operation was not saved by Section and Section of the said Act It was also contended that the respondents were estopped from ejecting the appellant and other tenants who were similarly situated on the principle of promissory estoppel as the Estate Manager of the respondent in his letter dated April directed the tenant to deposit Rs The appeal was contested on behalf of the respondents by contending that when right title and interest in immovable property stood transferred by operation of law the spirit behind Section of the Transfer of Property Act will apply and the successor in interest would be entitled to the rights of the predecessor and that as the Estate Manager had no authority to give a promise and that even assuming that he had such a power it was a conditional one namely approval by the <ORG> and that the <ORG> having resolved to reject the claim and on reconstruction decided to allot to its own employees out of administrative necessity the principle of promissory estop pel cannot be applied The notice terminating the tenancy of <ORG> would enure to the benefit of the respondent and it could be availed of by the respondent to lay the suit for ejectment There is a reasonable connection between the impugned acts and officials duty ii The notice under Section and Section III of the Transfer of Property Act is an act done or purported to have been done in the official capacity as Power of Attorney holder Assistant Estate Manager on behalf of the respondent <ORG> of Trustees the right to lay the suit on expiry of one month period prescribed in the notice namely on or after February had accrued to the respondent It is an act done or purported to have been done under the Central Act in exercise of the official function This principle has been evolved by equity to avoid injustice This doctrine would be displaced in a case where equity would not require that the Government should be held bound by the promise made by it Where the Government is required to carry out the promise the <ORG> would have to balance the public interest in the Government carrying out the promise made to the citizens which helps citizens to act upon and alter his position and the public interest likely to suffer if the promises were required to be carried out by the Government and determine which way the equity lies It cannot be applied in the teeth of an obligation or liability imposed by law It cannot be invoked to compel the Government to do an act prohibited by law When a constitutional question has been raised and does arise for consideration unless there is a fulldressed argument addressed by either side before this <ORG> no satisfactory resolution could be made thereof the <ORG> has power to acquire and hold movable and immovable property and also has power to lease to sell or otherwise convey movable and immovable property which may have become vested in or acquired by them He was served with a notice under Sec After Amendment Act of came into force suits were laid against three other tenants Since the State Act ceased to be operative with effect from Febru ary the quit notice issued under Section read with Section of Transfer of Property Act became ineffective and without determining the tenancy afresh the suit was not validly laid It may be mentioned at this juncture that one suit was dismissed on the ground that the tenancy was not duly determined as per law In the writ petition the petitioner challenged the vires of Amendment Provisions and also Amendment Provisions to the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act When it came up for heating before <NAME> he referred it to <ORG> Let us first deal with the arguments on the foot of the provisions of Act Section ill provides that on the expira tion of a notice to determine the lease or to quit or of intention to quit the property leased duly given by one party to the other I at page paragraph have stated to the similar fact thus The notice when once given enures for the benefit of the successor in title of the landlord or tenant giving it III Note it is stated thus Where the lessor gives notice to quit and then assigns his interest to another the assignee can take advantage of the notice In March notice was given to the tenant that the tenancy expired on March and called upon the tenant to deliver possession In that context it was held by <ORG> that by operation of the statutory provisions the period of lease of years from time to time was automati cally extended unless the tenancy was validly terminated by giving a notice of one year or surrender was made by the tenant as specified in the statute The ratio therein has little application to the facts of this case Accordingly it was held by <ORG> that there was no valid notice to quit We accordingly hold that the notice terminating the tenancy of <ORG> would enure to the benefit of the respondent and it could be availed of by the respondent to lay the suit for ejectment provides that notwith standing anything contained in sub section A and anything done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken including notice There is no inconsistency between the Central and the State Act in this regard Section provides under In any Central Act or Regulation made after the commence ment of this Act it shall be sufficient for the purpose of indicating the application of a law to every person or number of persons for the time being executing the functions of an office to mention the official title of the officer at present executing the functions of an office or that of the officer by whom the functions are commonly executed Section gives effect to the previous operation of anything done or subsists the right acquired or privilege accrued under the Repealed Act and the legal proceedings of remedy may be instituted continued or enforced as if the repealing Act had not been passed The contention of Mr <NAME> that the Central Act and the General Clauses Act would apply only to the acts done under the Central Act or State Act by exercise of the statutory power which alone have been validated and they have no application to bilateral acts under Central Act and the notice under Sec Thereunder it was contended that short delivery of the goods was an omission and not an act done under the Act and though the suit was laid beyond three months it was not barred by limitation It was held that after the expiry of three months from the day on which the cause of action had arisen for short delivery which was done or purported to have been done under the Act the suit was barred by limitation it was first to determine whether the act which is complained of in the suit can be said to have been within the scope of the official duty of the person or persons who are sought to be made liable This question can be answered in the affirmative where there is a reasonable connection between the act and the discharge of the official duty The protection cannot be held to be confined to acts done in the exercise of a statutory power but also extends to acts done within the scope of an official duty Thus we have no hesitation to hold that the notice under Sec of the Transfer of Property Act is an act done or purported to have been done in the official capacity as Power of Attorney holder Asstt It is an act done or purported to have been done under the Central Act in exercise of the official function Even assuming that he has such a power it is conditional one namely approval by the <ORG> The principle of promissory estoppel is that where one party has by his word or conduct made to the other a clear and unequivocal promise or representation which is intended to create legal relations or affect a legal relationship to arise in the future knowing or intending that it would be acted upon by the other party to whom the promise or representation is made and it is in fact so acted upon the other party the promise or representation would be binding on the party making it and he would not be entitled to go back upon it if it would be inequitable to allow him to do so having regard to the dealings which have taken place between the parties This principle has been evolved by equity to avoid injustice as he then was speaking for <ORG> of this Court while upholding the application of promissory estoppel to execu tive acts of the State negated the plea of executive neces sity thus We are unable to accede to the contention that the execu tive necessity releases the <ORG> from honouring its solemn promises relying on which citizens have acted to theft detriment Under our constitutional set up no person may be deprived of his right or liberty except in due course of and by if a member of the <ORG> seeks to deprive a citizen of his right or liberty otherwise than in exercise of power derived from the law common or statute the <ORG> will be competent to and indeed would be bound to protect the rights of the aggrieved citizens It was further held in its summing up thus Under our jurisprudence the Government is not exempt from liability to carry out the representation made by it as to its future conduct and it cannot on some undefined and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency fail to carry out the promise solemnly made by it not claim to be the Judge of its own obligation to the citizen on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances in which the obligation has arisen Equity will in a given case where justice and fairness demands present a person from exercis ing on strict legal rights even where they arise not in contract but on his own title deed or in statute The parties need not be in any count of legal relationship before the transaction from which the promissory estoppel takes its origin The doctrine would apply even where there is no pre existing legal relation ship between the parties but the promise is intended to create legal relations or effect a legal rela tionship which will arise in nature The former is equally bound as the latter There fore the Government cannot claim any immunity from the doctrine of promissory estoppel and it cannot say that it is under no obligation to act in a manner i fair and just or that it is not bound by the consi derations of honesty and good faith The doctrine of promissory estoppel would be displaced in such a case because on the facts equity would not require that the Government should be held bound by the promise made by it In order to resist its liability the <ORG> It was held that it cannot be applied in the teeth of an obligation or liability imposed by law to do an act prohibited by law SCR at Bhagwati the Chief Justice while reiterating the law laid down in <ORG> case supra made it clear thus there can be no promissory estoppel against the legislature in the exercise of its legislative functions nor can the Govt He does not know and cannot be expected to know the limits of their authority and he ought not to suffer if they exceed it On further appeal <ORG> while reversing the view Lord <NAME> stated thus I know of no such principle in our law nor was any authori ty for it cited The illegality of an act is the same wheth er or not the actor has been misled by an assumption of authority on the part of a <ORG> officer however high or law in the hierarchy The question is whether the character of an act done in face of a statutory prohibition is affected by the fact that it has been induced by a misleading assumption of authority Lord Normand stated at page thus But it is certain that neither a minister nor any subordi nate officer of the <ORG> can by any conduct or representa tion bar the <ORG> from enforcing a statutory prohibition or entitle the subject to maintain that there has been no breach of it No public officer unless he possesses some special power can hold out on behalf of the <ORG> that he or some other public officer has the right to enter into a contract in respect of the property of the <ORG> when in fact no such right exists In Administrative Law by Wade th Edition at page it is stated thus If the force of law is given to a ruling from an official merely because it is wrong the official who has not legal power is in effect substituted for the proper authority which is forced to accept what it considers a bad decision Thus we have no hesitation to hold that before making the public authority responsible for acts of its subordi nate it must be established that the subordinate officer did in fact make the representation and as a fact It is seen from the record that the Estate Manager is merely an inter mediary to collect the material between the respondent <ORG> and its tenants and to place the material for consid eration It is undoubtedly true as held by <NAME> of decisions of this Court that a pure question of law untraveled by questions of fact which goes to the roots of the jurisdiction we cannot permit the appel lant to raise this point for the following reasons Firstly except making a bald averment in the written statement that the suit is not maintainable nothing has been pleaded in detail in the written statement Though the appeal was argued for three days Mr <NAME> did not argue this point across the <ORG> nor we had the advantage of hearing the learned Solicitor General When a constitutional question has been raised and does arise for consideration unless there is a full dressed argument addressed by either side before this court no satisfactory resolution could be made Accordingly we do not find any merit in the appeal
