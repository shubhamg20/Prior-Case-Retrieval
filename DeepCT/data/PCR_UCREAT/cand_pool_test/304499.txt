HEADNOTE Sub section of of the Rajasthan Motor Vehicles Taxation Act provided No motor vehicle shall be used in any public place or kept for use in Rajasthan unless the owner thereof has paid in respect of it a tax at the appropriate rate specified in the schedule to this Act within the time allowed The appellants were carrying on the business of plying stage carriages in the <ORG> of Ajmer There was one route which lay mainly in Ajmer <ORG> but it crossed narrow strips of the territory of the <ORG> of Rajasthan Formerly there was an agreement between the Ajmer <ORG> and the former <ORG> of Kishangarh by which neither <ORG> charged any tax or fees on vehicles registered in Ajmer or Kishangarh The appellants challenged the legality of the demand on the grounds that of the Act read with the Schedules constituted a direct and immediate restriction on the movement of trade and commerce with and within Rajasthan inasmuch as motor vehicles which carried passengers and goods within or through Rajasthan had to pay the tax which imposed a pecuniary burden on a com mercial activity and was therefore hit by Art The respondents claimed that taxation for the purpose of raising revenue or for the maintenance of roads etc Regulatory measures or measures imposing compensatory taxes for the use of trading facilities did not hamper trade commerce and intercourse but rather facilitated them and therefore were not hit by the freedom declared by Art the restrictions in Part XIIT of the Constitution applied to taxation laws and such laws were not confined only to legislation with respect to entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India referred to the right of free movement of trade without any obstructions by way of barriers inter <ORG> or intra <ORG> or other impediments operating as such barriers and the said freedom was not impeded but on the other hand promoted by regulations creating conditions for the free movement of trade such as police regulations provisions for services maintenance of roads provision for aerodromes wharfs etc A tax which is made the condition precedent of the right to enter upon and carry on business is a restriction on the right to carry on trade and commerce within Art The Act was not in its true character regulatory because there was no provision therein which could be regarded as regulatory of motor vehicles The Act plainly levied a tax upon possession or use of motor vehicles was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> These are three consolidated appeals which arise from the judgment and order of a Division Bench of Rajasthan <ORG> dated August of the Consti tution certifying that the cases involve a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of Art As the constitutional issues involved affect the state of the Union notices were issued to the Advocates General concerned A notice was also issued to the Attorney General on behalf of <ORG> The result has been that we have heard very full arguments not only from Counsel appear for the appellants and the respondents but also from the learned Counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> the learned Advocates General or Counsel appearing for the intervening States and also from learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the three interveners referred to above When the appellants failed to pay the tax demanded from them the second respondent issued certificates under of the Act to the third respondent for the recovery of the tax due as arrears of land revenue On receipt of the demand notices the second and the third appellants filed appeals before the <ORG> Commissioner Jaipur under of the Act These appeals were however dismissed by an order of the <ORG> Commissioner dated October Thereafter the three appellants filed three separate writ petitions in <ORG> in which their main contention was that the relevant provisions of the Act imposing a tax on their motor vehicles were unconstitutional and void as they contravened the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse through out the territory of India declared by Art Firstly they considered the validity of the Act from the stand point of Act St of the Constitution which guarantees to all citizens of India the right to move freely throughout the territory of India this the Full Bench dealt with under the heading of freedom of intercourse from the stand point of the individual citizen and came to the conclusion that restrictions which the Act imposed on the individual citizen were reasonable restrictions having regard to the necessity of raising funds for the maintenance of roads and the making of new roads in the State of Rajasthan <ORG> expressed its final conclusion in the following words Transport vehicles are provided by individuals carrying on business in them and those who carry on trade and commerce as a whole can use these transport vehicles In view of that conclusion <ORG> answered the question referred to it in the negative The cases then went back to <ORG> with the answer given by <ORG> and the writ petitions were dismissed by <ORG> by its judgment and order dated August shall affect the operation of any law made before the commencement of the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to or prevent <ORG> or the <ORG> of a <ORG> from making any law relates to any such matter as is referred to in sub cl that sub clause refers to the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise has also no hearing on the questions which we have to consider in these appeals We now proceed to read the relevant provisions of the Act That point has not been agitated before us and we must proceed on the footing that the Act was validly made by the <NAME> Section of the Act is the charging section the validity of which has been challenged before us on the ground that it violates the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse granted under Art Save as otherwise provided by this Act or by rules made thereunder or by any other law for the time being in force no motor vehicle shall be used in any public place or kept for use in Rajasthan unless the owner thereof has paid in respect of it a tax at the appropriate rate specified in the Schedules to this Act within the time allowed by section and save as hereinafter specified such tax shall be payable annually notwithstanding that the motor vehicle may from time to time cease to be used The expression trade and industry includes transport for hire Sections to deal with payment of tax tax payable on first liability to tax and refund of tax Section deals with the payment of additional tax in circumstances which need not be stated here and in the event of such person having been previously convicted of an offence under this Act or under any rule made thereunder with fine which may extend to Rs Section deals with the compounding of offences and lays down that when any person without any reasonable cause fails or refuses to pay the tax the Taxation Officer may forward to the Collector of the district concerned a certificate over his signature specifying the amount of tax due from such person and the Collector shall recover the tax as if it were an arrears of land revenue Section provides for appeals to the Transport Commissioner Section lays down that the liability of a person to pay the tax shall not be questioned or determined otherwise than as provided in the act or in the rules made thereunder Sections to deal with certain ancillary matters and enables the <ORG> to make rules for carrying into effect the purpose of the Act Notwithstanding anything in Articles neither <ORG> nor the <ORG> of a State shall have power to make any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one State over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule Nothing in clause shall prevent <ORG> from making any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference or making or authorising the making of any discrimination if it is declared by such law that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India Notwithstanding anything in Article or Article <ORG> may by law a impose on goods imported from other States any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced and impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest Provided that no Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause shall be introduced or moved in the Legislature of a State without the previous sanction of the President Article is also not material as it relates to the appointment of an appropriate authority for carrying out the purposes of Arts Another connected question is that if the majority view is the correct view does the principle underlying it apply to the facts of the present cases It is therefore necessary to set out briefly the facts of the <ORG> case and the three views expressed therein The three appellants in that case were tea companies two of which carried on the trade of growing tea in Assam and the other carried on its trade in Jalpaiguri in West Bengal They carried their tea to Calcutta in order that it might be sold in the Calcutta market for home consumption or export outside India Tea produced in Jalpaiguri had to pass through a few miles of territory in Assam while the tea produced in Assam had to go all the way through Assam to reach Calcutta Besides the tea which was carried by rail a substantial quantity had to go by road or by inland water ways and as such That Act levied a tax on certain goods carried by road or inland waterways in the State of Assam and the validity of the levy of such a tax was in question in the <ORG> case We may now summarise the views expressed in that decision He draw a distinction between taxation as such for the purpose of revenue on the One hand and taxation for the purpose of making discrimination or giving preference on the other hand the letter he said could be treated as impediment to free trade and commerce does not mean freedom from taxation simpliciter but does mean freedom from taxation which has the effect of directly impeding the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse the freedom envisaged in Art preferential legislation may be made by Par liament for the purpose of dealing with an emergency like a scarcity of goods in any part of India Art reasonable restrictions may be imposed by the Legislature of a State in the public interest Art non discriminatory taxes may be imposed by the Legislature of a State on goods imported from another State or other States if similar taxes are imposed on goods produced of manufactured in that State Art a and lastly restrictions imposed by existing laws have been continued except in so far as the President may by order otherwise direct Art The majority view differed from that of the learned Chief Justice in that it did not accept as correct the contention that tax laws were governed by the provisions of Part XII of the Constitution only and were outside Part XIII Besides it is not irrelevant to remember in this connection that the Article we are construing imposes a constitutional limitation on the power of the <ORG> and <ORG> to levy taxes and generally but for such limitation the power of taxation would be presumed to be for public good and would not be subject to judicial review or scrutiny Thus considered we think it would be reasonable and proper to hold that restrictions freedom from which is guaranteed by Art Taxes may and do amount to restrictions but it is only such taxes as directly and immedia tely restrict trade that would fall within the purview of Art The argument that all taxes should be governed by Art The third view held by <NAME> <NAME> was that the freedom contemplated was freedom of trade commerce and intercourse in ill their varied aspects inclusive of all activities which constitute commercial intercourse and not merely restrictions on the movement aspect He said The guarantee of freedom of trade and commerce is not addressed merely against prohibitions complete or partial it is addressed to tariffs licensing marketing regulations price control nationalization economic or social planning discriminatory tariffs compulsory appropriation of goods freezing or stand still orders and similar other impediments operating directly and immediately on the freedom of commercial intercourse as well Every sequence in the series of operations which constitutes trade or commerce is an act of trade or commerce and burdens or impediments imposed on any such step are restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse So far we have set out the factual and legal background against which the problem before us has to be solved It is necessary to do this because extensive references have been made to Australian and American decisions Australian decisions with regard to the interpretation of of the Australian Constitution and American decisions with regard to the Commerce Clause of the American Constitution There were differences of language religion etc Even inside the same Province there were under developed and highly developed areas from the point of view of industries communications etc After India attained political freedom in and before the Constitution was adopted the process of merger and integration of the Indian States with the rest of the country had been accomplished so that when the Constitution was first passed the territory of India consisted of Part A States which broadly stated represented the Provinces in British India and Part States which were made up of Indian States Therefore in interpreting the relevant articles in Part XIII we must have regard to the general scheme of the Constitution of India with special reference to Part III Fundamental Rights Part XII Finance Property etc and and their inter relation to Part XIII in the context of a federal or quasi federal constitution in which the States have certain powers including the power to raise revenues for their purposes by taxation On behalf of the appellants it has been contended before us that of the Act read with the Schedules constitutes a direct and immediate restriction on the movement of trade and commerce with and within Rajasthan inasmuch as motor vehicles which carry passengers and goods within or through Rajasthan have to pay the tax which it is stated imposes a pecuniary burden on a commercial activity and is therefore hit by Art On behalf of the respondents the argument has proceeded on the footing that taxation per so i taxation for the purpose of raising revenue or for the maintenance of roads etc and the impugned provisions of the Act in question did not constitute an immediate or direct im pediment on the movement of trade and commerce inasmuch as the tax imposed was a consolidated tax on the vehicle itself though the quantum of the tax was fixed in some instances with reference to the seating capacity or loading capacity etc The argument is that in this respect the facts of the present cases differ from the facts of the <ORG> case it is argued that in the latter the tax was on the carriage of goods whereas in the present cases the tax is a consolidated tax on the vehicle itself like a property tax and therefore it does not relate to the movement part of trade commerce and intercourse though it may have an indirect effect on trade and commerce by raising the tariff or fare for passengers and goods He has however tried to reconcile the various provisions in Part XIII by suggesting that there are two connected but independent subjects dealt with therein one is freedom of movement of trade and commerce and in course this he has described as channeling of trade commerce and intercourse and the second is protection from discrimination and preference which is not necessarily connected with movement but may arise from subsidy etc Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the State of Maharashtra and some other States has contended that Part XIII of the Constitution is confined to such action legislative or executive as is taken in relation to any of the entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the Seventh Schedule namely entries relating to and in list was trade commerce and intercourse namely the entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the Seventh Schedule but the restrictions from which freedom was granted might come from any direction they might come from legislative or executive action relating to other entries also We may first take the widest view the view expressed by <NAME> in the <ORG> case a view which has been supported by the appellants and one or two of the interveners before us Article which is in general terms and is made subject to the other provisions of Part XIII imposes a general limitation on the exercise of legislative power whether by the <ORG> or the States under any of the topics taxation topics as well as other topics enumerated in the three lists of the Seventh Schedule in order to make certain that trade commerce and intercourse thought the territory of India shall be free authority may by law impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one <ORG> and another or within any part the territory of India as may be required in the public interest to the effect that <ORG> shall not have the power to make any law giving any preference to any one <ORG> over another or discriminating between one <ORG> and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule Article which places a ban on <ORG> against the giving of preferences to one <ORG> over another or of discriminating between one <ORG> and another also provides that the same kind of ban should be placed upon <ORG> also legislating by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in lists II and III of the Seventh Schedule shall prevent <ORG> from making any law giving preference to one <ORG> over another or discriminating between one <ORG> and another if it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India Clause a of that article provides that <ORG> may impose on goods imported from other <ORG>s any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that <ORG> are subject so however as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced This clause therefore permits the levy on goods imported from sister <ORG>s any tax which similar goods manufactured or produced in that <ORG> are subject to under its taxing laws In other words goods imported from sister <ORG>s are placed on a par with similar goods manufactured or produced inside the <ORG> in regard to <ORG> taxation within the <ORG> allocated field Thus the <ORG>s in India have full power of imposing what in American <ORG> legislation is called the use tax gross receipts tax etc not to speak of the familiar property tax subject only to the condition that such tax is imposed on all goods of the same kind produced or manufactured in the taxing <ORG> although such taxation is undoubtedly calculated to fetter inter<ORG> trade and commerce Leaving aside the prerequisite of previous Presidential sanction for the validity of <ORG> legislation under cl provided in the proviso thereto there are two important differences between Art which require special mention The second difference springs from the fact that while <ORG> power to impose restrictions under Art upon freedom of commerce in the public interest is not subject to the requirement of reasonableness the power of the States to impose restrictions on the freedom of commerce in the public interest under Art But even in the matter of textual construction there are difficulties Article again imposes a restriction on that relaxation notwithstanding anything in Article but Art We do not propose to recite the somewhat checkered history of the Australian decisions in respect of which Lord <NAME> after a review of the earlier cases said in <ORG> <ORG> that in the labyrinth of cases decided under there was no golden thread What is more important for our purpose is that he expressed the view that two general propositions stood out from the decisions i that regulation of trade commerce and intercourse among the States is compatible with its absolute freedom and ii that of the Australian Constitution is violated only when a legislative or A executive act operates to restrict such trade commerce and intercourse directly and immediately as distinct from creating some indirect or inconsequential impediment which may fairly be regarded as remote It seems clear however that since the conception of freedom of trade commerce and intercourse in a community regulated by law presupposes some degree of restriction upon the individual that freedom must necessarily be delimited by considerations of social orderliness If the authorities concerned really wanted to hamper anybody trade they could easily raise the amount of tax or toll to an amount which would be prohibitive or deterrent or create other impediments which instead of facilitating trade and commerce would hamper them Even such legislation as imposes traffic regulations would require the sanction of the President The States must also have revenue to carry out their administration and there are several items relating to the imposition of taxes in list An examination of the entries in the lists of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution would show that there are a large number of entries in the <ORG> list list II and the Concurrent list list III under which a <ORG> <ORG> has power to make laws Even laws other than taxation laws made under different entries in the lists referred to above may indirectly or remotely affect trade and commerce must have the previous sanction of the President then the Constitution in so far as it gives plenary power to the <ORG>s and <ORG> <ORG>s in the fields allocated to them would be meaningless An additional argument is that the provisions of Part XIII apply only to such legislation as is made under entries in the Seventh Schedule which deal with trade commerce and intercourse <ORG> trade and commerce entry in list II which deals with trade and commerce within the <ORG> subject to the provisions of entry in list III and entry in list III which deals with trade and commerce as specified therein are the only entries legislation relating to which attracts the provisions of Part XIII and legislation on other topics is not affected by these provisions It has been pointed out that the title of Part XIII is trade commerce and an intercourse intercourse it is stated means commercial intercourse there being no separate legislative entry in any of the three list relating to intercourse and the word throughout has reference to space rather than to movement Article specifically uses the expression by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the Seventh Schedule the words by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce etc will then be construed as a fetter on the commerce power i the power given to the <ORG> to make laws under entries relating to trade and commerce only It is pointed out that the power to tax is an incident of sovereignty and it is divided between the <ORG> and the <ORG>s under the Constitution Part XII of the Constitution deals with several aspects of taxation and all the restrictions on the power to tax are contained in Part XII which according to this interpretation is self contained Therefore so it is argued the freedom guaranteed by Art which it is said is restricted to legislation with respect to entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists in the Seventh Schedule In Atiabari Tea Co Case deals with the arguments advanced in support of the interpretation in detail and as we are substantially in agreement with the reasons given in that judgment we do not think that any useful purpose would be served by repeating them It is enough to point out that though the power of levying tax is essentially for the very existence of government its exercise may be controlled by constitutional provisions made in that behalf We have carefully examined the provisions in Part XII of the Constitution and are unable to agree that those provisions exhaust all the limitations on the power to impose a tax Article which deals with the extent of laws made by <ORG> and by the Legislatures of States expressly states that the power of <ORG> and of the State Legislatures to make laws is subject to the provisions of this Constitution After carefully considering the arguments advanced before us we have come to the conclusion that the narrow interpretation canvassed for on behalf of the majority of the <ORG> cannot be accepted namely that the relevant articles in Part XIII apply only to legislation in respect of the entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the lists of the Seventh Schedule They are excluded from the purview of the provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution for the simple reason that they do not hamper trade commerce and intercourse but rather facilitate them In our opinion both these interpretations proceed on a somewhat narrow basis and are not justified by the general words used in Art Article guarantees to all citizens certain rights which are compendiously stated to be the right to freedom two such rights are i to move freely throughout the territory of India and ii to carry on any occupation trade or business The right to move freely throughout the territory of India is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public or for the protection of any scheduled tribe The right to carry on any occupation trade or business is subject to reasonable restrictions in the interests of the general public and in particular to any law relating to the carrying on by the <ORG> of any trade business etc In some of the Australian decisions a distinction was sought to be drawn between the free flow of the same volume of inter <ORG> trade and the individual right to carry on his trade in more than one <ORG> and it was argued that of the Australian Constitution related to the free flow of the volume of trade as distinguished from an individual right to carry on his trade of the Constitution which has been adverted to before us is this it has been argued that if a law imposing a restriction on the right of a citizen to carry on his trade or business is justified under el This is an aspect of the problem which may require a more detailed and careful examination in an appropriate case which related to discrimination and preference also aimed at the mischief of subsidy which might be given to a <ORG> by way of preference or discrimination that mischief he said would come within Art For the purpose of the cases which we are considering nothing very much turns upon whether we take the word intercourse in a wide sense or in a narrow sense We have therefore come to the conclusion that neither the widest interpretation nor the narrow interpretations canvassed before us are acceptable The interpretation which was accepted by the majority in the <ORG> case is correct but subject to this clarification Regulatory measures or measures imposing compensatory taxes for the use of trading facilities do not come within the purview of the restrictions contemplated by Art That section makes it quite clear that the tax is imposed on a motor vehicle which shall be used in any public place or kept for use in Rajasthan the tax is to be at appropriate rates specified in the Schedules to the Act and save as specified in the Act the tax shall be payable annually notwithstanding that the motor vehicle may from time to time cease to be used In dealing with the question whether these taxes were reasonable restrictions on the right of individuals to move freely throughout the territory of India etc These funds can only the raised through taxation and if the <ORG> taxes the users of motor vehicles in order to make and maintain roads it can hardly be said that the <ORG> is putting unreasonable restrictions on the individuals right to move freely throughout the territory of India or to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business It is obvious from these figures that the <ORG> is charging from the users of motor vehicles something in the neighbourhood of of the cost it has to incur in maintaining and making roads per seat and for an ordinary five seater car it came to Rs Assuming that such a vehicle could be reasonably used for days in a year the tax amounted to Rs If the Act and the Schedules appended thereto are examined in this manner it will be noticed that the tax imposed is really a tax for the use of the roads in Rajasthan and it cannot be said that it hinders the free movement of trade commerce and intercourse It seems to us that a working test for deciding whether a tax is compensatory or not is to enquire whether the trades people are having the use of certain facilities for the better conduct of their business and paying not patently much more than what is required for providing the facilities Nor do we think that it xi ill make any difference that the money collected from the tax is not put into a separate fund so long as facilities for the trades people who pay the tax are provided and the expenses incurred in providing them are born by the <ORG> out of whatever source it may be In the instruments of commerce that have been mentioned is no violation of the freedom of inter <ORG> trades lies in the relation to inter state trade which their nature and purpose give them The learned Chief Justice reiterated the same view in <ORG> <NAME> We have therefore come to the conclusion that the Act does not violate the provisions of Art The taxes imposed were therefore legal and <ORG> rightly dismissed the writ petitions filed by the appellants <NAME> I agree with the conclusion arrived at by my learned brother <NAME> but in view of the importance of the question raised I would prefer to give my own reasons for the construction of the relevant provisions of Part XIII of the Constitution of the Constitution and what are the limitations implicit in it or envisaged in the succeeding articles The conflicting and sometimes mutually destructive arguments of learned counsel appearing for the various parties and interveners omitting the immaterial variations may conveniently be placed under following heads Trade commerce and intercourse is a term of widest amplitude taking in the gamut of activities starting from production or manufacture and ending with the completion of a particular commercial transactions and every restriction imposed by any law or executive action on any part of the said integrated activity would be violative of the freedom under Art All the learned counsel appearing in the case has agreed or at any rate no argument was advanced to the contrary that the freedom whatever may be its content or scope on which there is difference of opinion relates to both inter <ORG> and intra <ORG> trade We have to bear in mind in approaching the problem presented before us that our Constitution was not written on clean slate We cannot ignore the fact that the Constitution was drafted by persons some of whom had a deep knowledge of the constitutional problems of other countries and therefore they must be assumed to have had the knowledge of the interpretation put upon certain legal concepts by the highest tribunals of those countries At the same time it can be reasonably assumed that they have made a sincere attempt to accept the good and to avoid the defects found by experience in the other constitutions and also to could them to suit our conditions Therefore in approaching the problem of construing the provisions of Part XIII of our Constitution unless the terms of the provisions of the said Part are clear and unambiguous it would be the duty of this Court to construe them in such a manner as not to disturb the framework of the Constitution of the Constitution of the United <ORG>s of America says that the <ORG> shall have power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the several <ORG>s and with the Indian tribes This of course gives <ORG> power wherever traffic or intercourse concerns an inter State market The said decisions show that in America the principle accepted was that every restriction imposed by a <ORG> law did not offend the commerce clause unless it directly affected it and that even taxation was permissible if it was for services rendered by the <ORG> to promote trade Section says The power of the <ORG> to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping and to railways the property of any <ORG> Unlike the American Constitution the Australian Constitution confers a legislative power on <ORG> to make laws in respect of trade and commerce with other countries and among the <ORG>s and also in respect of certain specific subjects of trade and commerce and then declares that trade commerce and intercourse among the <ORG>s shall be absolutely free Unlike the American Constitution in the Australian Constitution there is a declaration of freedom of trade commerce and intercourse among the <ORG>s Paradoxically <ORG> and in appeals from some decisions of those Courts <ORG> evolved the power to restrict the said freedom by the <ORG>s from the concept of absolute freedom itself This was necessitated because there were no statutory provisions limiting the absolute freedom and as uncontrolled freedom in the field of inter<ORG> Commerce may lead to chaos limitations of the freedom were evolved to save the said freedom The scope of the limitations so evolved would be useful to construe the relevant provisions of all Constitution which expressly provides for similar limitations The scope of the freedom and it limitations are found in the leading decisions on the subject which throw considerable light on the question now raised and they are <NAME> case <ORG> The <ORG> of Queensland <NAME> <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> The Australian decisions broadly laid down the following three propositions i the impugned law whether fiscal or otherwise shall directly and immediately restrict traffic across the borders before it could be said to violate the freedom under a of the <ORG> Constitution Act ii compensatory measures for the purpose of regulating commerce are not restrictions on the said freedom and iii when a question arises whether a fiscal statute amounts to a restriction on and the levy of taxes to meet the expenditure incurred in connection therewith the said laws are not restrictions on the said freedom but only facilities to promote the same Now let us look at the provisions of Art It may take different forms Trade cannot be free throughout the territory of India if there are barriers in any part of India be it <ORG> or intra State So long as there is impediment to that freedom its nature or extent is irrelevant may be defined as a right to free movement of persons or things tangible or intangible commercial or non commercial unobstructed by barriers <ORG> or intra State or any other impediment operating as such barriers The Constitution confers on the <ORG> and the <ORG> <ORG> extensive powers to make laws in respect of various matters So too laws other than those of taxation made by virtue of different entries in the Lists may remotely affect trade There are admittedly no such words of compulsion At the same time it is also difficult to accept the argument advanced by the <ORG>s that the laws made under entry of List I entry of List II and entry of List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution only are subject to that freedom for firstly the article does not restrict the freedom to the area covered by those entries and secondly laws made under the other entries may more effectively and directly affect the movement of trade What is guaranteed to a citizen by the Constitution is a fundamental right to carry on business The fact that the Constitution saves laws made imposing reasonable restrictions on the freedom has no relevance to the content of the freedom though it protects certain laws made infringing that freedom it should be held that a fiscal taxation was not a restriction within the meaning of the said clause every law imposing such a tax would infringe the fundamental right There are no merits in the contention either It is said that taxation is always in public interest and that it is not possible for any court to ascertain on the material placed before it that a rate is reasonable or not It is conceded that regulatory taxes or laws of taxation intended to prohibit or restrict an activity and not to raise a general tax in the interest of revenue may be a restriction and a court may be in a position to see whether such laws pass the test laid down in Art The arguments is confined only to what is described as fiscal taxation that is taxation solely intended for raising revenue for the <ORG> It is also not denied that unreasonable procedural restrictions imposed by law of taxation would infringe the freedom Article says in express terms The <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void A law of taxation is made by <ORG> or the <ORG> of a State as the case may be in exercise of the power conferred under the Constitution by virtue of the entries found therein Nor can I agree with the contention that it is impossible for a court to hold in any case that a rate of taxation is reasonable or not It may be legitimately contended that it is difficult for a court to come to a definite conclusion on the correctness of a rate fixed by the <ORG> I entirely agree with these observations Experience shows that the court applies certain presumptions such as that of the wisdom knowledge and the good intentions of the <ORG> and does not also meti culously go in to the question but only looks at the broad features of the Constitution let us look at the succeeding provisions which place limitations on the said freedom But the restrictions can be imposed by <ORG> only by law <ORG> power to make law is derived from Arts Thereunder it can make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule and in respect of a territory not included in a States with respect to matters enumerated in any of the three Lists Therefore in exercise of the said power and by virtue of the language of the entries correlated to that power <ORG> can make any law imposing restrictions on the said freedom There is no room for this argument for the words by law in the article clearly refer to the power of the <ORG> to make law under the Constitution Therefore under this article the <ORG> can only impose restrictions by virtue of any of the entries in the Lists in respect of which it can make laws Whether there is a restriction or not does not depend upon the relevant entry but on the nature of the impact of the law on the freedom Article which prohibits the <ORG> from making a law giving preference to one State over another or making any discrimination between one State and another is confined only to the entries relating to trade and commerce In this context the principles evolved by American and Australian decision in their attempt to reconcile the commerce power and the <ORG> police power or the freedom of commerce and the <ORG> power to make laws affecting that freedom can usefully be invoked with suitable modifications and adjustments The question whether a law imposes a restriction or not depends on the question whether the said law imposes directly and immediately a limitation on the freedom of movement of trade Article opens out with a non obstante clause namely Notwithstanding anything in article It is accepted on all hands that there is a defect in the phraseology used in this article This article prohibits both <ORG> and the <ORG> Legislature from making a law giving preference to a <ORG> or <ORG>s or making a discrimination among the <ORG>s The article so far as it relates to <ORG> may be read Notwithstanding anything in article the <ORG> shall not have power to make any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one State over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule Now this provision prohibits the making of laws of the nature mentioned therein only by virtue of the entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule This article clearly says that neither <ORG> nor the <ORG> of a State can make a law imposing a restriction which has the effect of giving preference or making discrimination as the case may be among the States But a difficulty that confronts one is whether the limitation on the laws is confined only to the law made by virtue of the entries referring to trade and commerce or by virtue of any entry in the Seventh Schedule which may affect trade and commerce But it is contended that the words by virtue of the entries relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule are of wider import than the words by virtue of the said entries and therefore any law specified in Art The words any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists are of the widest import and they yield to a very liberal interpretation There cannot be any distinction on principle from the standpoint of the mischief sought to be averted between a law made by virtue of an entry ex facie referring to trade and commerce and that made by virtue of any entry affecting trade and commerce For instance a law may be made by <ORG> under entries relating to railways highways shipping etc If a law made under entry of List If giving preference or making discrimination among the States is objectionable it should also be objectionable if made by virtue of any other entry I would therefore hold that any law made by <ORG> by virtue of any entry imposing the said discriminatory restrictions would be bad Under the said article if a law made by <ORG> imposing such discriminatory restrictions is necessary for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising out of scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India The article opens out again with a non obstante clause namely Notwithstanding anything in article or article a <ORG> may by law impose on goods imported from other <ORG>s or the <ORG> territories any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that <ORG> are subject so however as not to discriminate between them and Art Clause a therefore only enables <ORG> to impose non discriminatory taxes on goods imported from other <ORG>s or the <ORG> territories enables a <ORG> to make laws imposing reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce and intercourse and I would interpret the word restrictions in the same way as I have interpreted the said expression in Art Article i exempts a law imposing or levying any tax from the impact of the fundamental rights enshrined in Art Article preserves the residuary power of the <ORG> in respect of any matter not enumerated in the Concurrent List or the <ORG> List including the power to impose taxes These articles therefore generally impose limitations on the appropriate legislative power of taxation of <ORG>s or give exemption in special cases in my view there is no such conflict the said articles can co exist by a process of harmonious construction In short these articles may limit the power of the appropriate legislature in imposing tax but cannot be relied upon to curtail the ambit of the freedom under Art which provides that every religious denomination or any section thereof shall have the right inter alia to own and acquire movable and immovable property which confers the freedom cannot preclude the Legislative power imposing a tax affecting that freedom Article was omitted by the Constitution Seventh Amendment Act but the said article saved the operation of any law made by any States specified in Part in the First Schedule before the commencement of the Constitution levying any tax or duty on the import of any goods in to the State from other States or on the export of goods from the State to other States and enacted that if there be an agreement between <ORG> and the Government of that State in that behalf the said tax or duty might be levied or collected for such period not exceeding ten years from the commencement of the Constitution subject to the terms of the said agreement in the group of articles in Part XIII It is suggested that the saving clause might have become necessary as there was an impediment under the other provi sions of the Constitution declared a right of free movement of trade without any obstructions by way of barriers inter State or intraState or other impediments operating as such barriers The said freedom is not impeded but on the other hand promoted by regulations creating conditions for the free movement of trade such as police regulations provision for services maintenance of roads provision for aerodromes Wharfs etc <ORG> may be law impose restrictions on such freedom in the public interest and the said law can be made by virtue of any entry with respect where of <ORG> has power to make a law The State also in exercise of its legislative power may impose similar restrictions subject to the two conditions laid down in Art Neither <ORG> nor <ORG> can make a law giving preference to one State over another or making discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any entry in the Lists infringing the said freedom This ban is lifted in the case of <ORG> for the purpose of dealing with situations arising out of scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India and also in the case of a State under Art And The State can impose a non discriminatory tax on goods imported from other States or the <ORG> territory to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject I agree with my learned brother XI of in provided Save as otherwise provided by this Act or by rules made thereunder or by any other law for the time being in force no motor vehicle shall be used in any public place or kept for use in Rajasthan unless the owner thereof has paid in respect of it a tax at the appropriate rate specified in the schedules to this Act within the time allowed by section and save as hereinafter specified such tax shall be payable actually notwithstanding that the motor vehicle may from time to time cease to be used and in the event of such person having been previously convicted of an offence under this Act or under any rule made thereunder with fine which may extend to Rs They filed petitions under Art was against trade barriers tariff walls or imposts which have a deleterious effect on the free flow of trade commerce and intercourse but not against taxation <NAME> The dispute is only as to what is comprehended within that freedom and a further question is whether the powers of <ORG> and the State <ORG> to levy taxes according to the Sundry Entries in the Legislative Lists are meant to be circumscribed in any way and if so to what extent Besides the Government of India Act also contained in a a provision on the subject of freedom of trade and commerce and the contention of the <ORG> partly has been that Part XIII enacts little more than what was contained there known and well accepted propositions relating to the interpretation of Constitutions in which there are fundamental limits upon the power to legislate If what has been done is legislation within the general scope of the affirmative words which give the power and if it violates no express condition or restriction by which that power is limited it is not for <ORG> to inquire further or two enlarge constru ctively those conditions or restrictions We have thus to see what powers have affirmatively been conferred on the legislatures of the State and what are the restrictions on that power In this connection we must also bear in mind the weighty observations of <NAME> in <NAME> Prasad <NAME> We must again refer to the fundamental proposition enunciated in <NAME> Burah that Indian <ORG>s within their own sphere have plenary powers of legislation as large and of the same nature as those of <ORG> itself Every intendment ought therefore to be made in favour of a <ORG> which is exercising the powers conferred on it The question whether the power of <ORG> to legislate and lay down principles of taxation under Entry of the Concurrent List would also have to be considered under Part XIII does not arise in this case for admittedly there is no law by <ORG> that Entry either prior or subsequent to the State Act Thus so far as the taxing power of <ORG> is concer ned it must be admitted that it was not only exercised under Entry but if judged solely under that Entry that it was properly exercised The question thus is whether on the exercise of this power there are to be found other curbs in other parts of the Constitution and whether those curbs have not been observed and if the law deprives the motor operators of the right a to move freely throughout the territory of India to acquire hold and dispose of property and to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business and the restriction is incapable of being justified as reasonable The scheme of the Legislative Lists shows that taxation entries are separate from other entries and the other entries do not include a power to impose a tax though the power to levy fees is included as it is expressly so stated That Article guarantees to the citizens of India certain basic freedoms This brings us to the consideration of the last point on which arguments occupied the <ORG> for several days deliberation and if there is as points obs curity in its language this may be taken to be due not to any uncertainty as to the ado ption of the stricter from of federal principle but to that difficulty in obtaining ready agreement about phrases which attends the drafting of legislative measures by larger assemblages But declarations in a Constitution however worded must be given effect to and they always loom large on the horizon of law making if they curtail legislative power and it is not surprising that <ORG> was faced with the problem of deciding which laws rendered trade commerce and intercourse unfree and which did not <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> aptly summed up In this labyrinth there is no golden thread That conception involved freedom from customs duties imports border prohibitions and restrictions of every kind the people of Australia were to be free to trade with each other and to pass to and fro among the States without any burden hindrances or restrictions based merely on the fact that they were no members of the same State After referring to some cases in which the burdens and hindrances took diverse forms and appeared under various disguises the <ORG> observed that it must be a question of fact in every case whether there was an interference with the freedom of passage and finally observed As a matter of actual language freedom in must be somehow limited and the only limitation which emerges from the context and which can logically and realistically be applied is freedom at what is the crucial point in <ORG> trade that it is at the <ORG> barrier It was said that all the commercial arrangements of which transportation is the direct and necessary result from part of trade and commerce In reaching this conclusion Knox referred to <ORG> and Commissioners of Taxation Kirk where Lord <NAME> observed The word trade no doubt primarily means traffic by way of sale or exchange or commercial dealing but also added that it may have a large meaning It was held in earlier cases that this conferred a personal right on an Australian and independent of any commercial attributes he may possess to pass over the Ex Later it was held that the concept of trade commerce and intercourse meant what was held to be included in the concept of commerce as understood in the United States per <NAME> in the <ORG> case Section was expressly made subject to Section was declared invalid by <ORG> but ss and were hold to be valid The action of the Minister was declared ultra vires and <NAME> was held entitled to succeed in his claim for damages A large number of cases were noticed in which it was decided that trade and commerce was validly burdened in the exercise of power to make laws without impairing movement of trade at the borders These laws dealt with various subjects like monopolies price fixation health regulations licensing systems entry of goods or persons and transport <NAME> observed I venture to repeat what I said in the former case <ORG> case One proposition which I regard as established is hat simple legislative prohibition <ORG> or <ORG> as distinct from regulation of inter <ORG> trade and commerce is invalid The Act provided for the acquisition of shares in certain private banks by the <ORG> Bank by agreement or compulsion and generally for their closure and management by the <ORG> Bank in their judgement laid down that the freedom in was a personal right attaching to the individual that a banker who carried on business in more than one State was engaged in trade commerce and intercourse among the States that <NAME> <ORG> could not be understood to have laid down that protected only the actual passage of goods or persons from one State to another and the Act prohibiting such trade commerce or inter We shall now leave the Australian scene for the time being but will revert to it to show how further difficulties arising in Australia from these settled views were solved to begin with by <ORG> and subsequently thereto by <ORG> We shall also refer to the late cases that were decided in reference to of the Australian Commonwealth Act but which were not available to <ORG> in India when our Constitution was framed We shall then be in a position to see how in Australia the difficulties were surmounted and how in India those difficulties were envisaged and tried to be met by proper legislative enactments Before we proceed to an examination of the provisions in the Indian Constitution and their evolution we will refer to the provisions on the subject of freedom of trade and commerce in the Constitutions of Canada and the United States of America because they were also precedents which were available again in <ORG> Lamb <ORG> found it necessary to limit the general words of No of to afford scope for powers given exclusively to the Provincial Leg islatures Halsbury in Attorney General for Onterio Attorney General for the Dominion said that the words must be given a statutory meaning There is however no definite statement of the limits to be placed but generally the exercise of regulation of trade and commerce within the Provinces is upheld under No of which gives the following power to the Provinces Generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province In <ORG> <NAME> at <ORG> said that if the general power of regulation given to <ORG> could be said to prohibit provincial taxation on the persons or things regulated it could only be by straining those general words to their widest extent Earlier still there was the rule of <ORG> under the <ORG> through the Secretary of <ORG> for India and the Governor General There was thus in truth and reality only one Government and the so called Governments of the Presidencies and Provinces were agents of the Central Government The only difference was that there was no third List which was hardly necessary ax the residual power was in the <ORG> Apart from the limitations arising from the allotment of subjects under the Devolution Rules there was a control of the <ORG> By it was provided that all moneys were to be paid into an account in the custody of the Governor General and he made rules with the sanction of the Secretary of <ORG> and issued orders both general and special for payments withdrawals or disbursements from that account In this there was the echo of what the <NAME> Chelmsford Report said Our conception of the eventual future of India is a sisterhood of States self governing in all matters of purely local or provincial interest In this picture there is a place for the Native States The increasing importance of industry brings problems that must be faced by both together The States themselves have their own tariff policies and there is a serious possibility that unless provision can be made for the reconciliation of divergent interests numbers of tariff walls will be perpetuated in an area where fiscal unity is most desirable In para of the Report they observed It is greatly to be desired that States adhering to the <ORG> should like the Provinces accept the principle of internal freedom for trade in India and that <ORG> alone should have the power to impose tariffs and other restrictions on trade But internal customs barriers are in principle inconsistent with the freedom of interchange of a fully developed <ORG> and we are strongly of the opinion that every effort should be made to substitute other forms of taxation for these internal customs the accession of a <ORG> to the Fede ration should imply its acceptance of the principle that it will not set up a barrier to free interchange so formidable as to constitute a threat to the future of <ORG> However in dealing with commercial discrimination <ORG> was more concerned with British Imports and the Fiscal Convention which it was anticipated would lapse on the new Constitution coming into force No Provincial Legislature or Government shall a by virtue of the entry in the Provincial Legislative List relating to trade and commerce within the Province or the entry in that list relating to the production supply and distribution of commodities have power to pass any law or take any executive action prohibiting or restricting the entry into or export from the Province of goods of any class or description by virtue of anything in this Act have power to impose any tax cess toll or due which as between goods manufactured or produced in the Provinces and similar goods not so manufactured or produced discriminates in favour of the former or which in the case of goods manufactured or produced outside the Provinces discriminates between goods manufactured or produced in one locality and similar goods manufactured or produced in another locality Any law passed in contravention of this section shall to the extent of the contra vention be invalid By this section power was denied to the Provincial Legislatures under two Entries in the Provincial List to impair free entry and export of goods in the Provinces The word commodities was used instead of goods in the White Paper and the change to goods appears to have been lost sight of in Clause a of sub banned restrictions at the barriers of the Provinces on the entry and export of goods and cl prohibited discrimination in taxing goods between goods manufactured and produced in the Province as against goods not so manufactured or produced and local discriminations Notwithstanding anything in article neither <ORG> nor the <ORG> of a State shall have power to make any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference to one State over another or making or authorising the making of any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule Nothing in clause shall prevent <ORG> from making any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference or making of authorising the making of any discrimination of it is declared by such law that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India the words by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule shall be omitted <ORG> may by law a impose on goods imported from other States or the <ORG> territories any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject so how ever as not to discriminate between goods so imported and good so manufactured or produced and impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest Provided that no Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause shall be introduced or moved in the <ORG> of a State without the previous sanction of the President Nothing in articles and shall affect the provisions of any existing law except in so far an the President may by order otherwise direct and nothing in article shall affect the operation of any law made before the commencement of the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to or prevent <ORG> or the <ORG> of a State from making any law relating to any such matter as is referred to in sub clause ii of clause of article The original Article before its deletion read Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part or in any other provisions of this Constitution any State specified in Part of the First Schedule which before the commencement of this Con stitution was levying any tax or duty on the import of goods into the State from other States or on the export of goods from the State to other States may if an agreement in that behalf has been entered into between the Government of India and the Government of that State continue to levy and collect such tax or duty subject to the terms of such agreement and for such period not exceeding ten years as may be specified in the agreement Provided that the President may at any time after the expiration of five year from such commencement terminate or modify any such agreement if after consideration of them report of <ORG> constituted under Article he thinks it necessary to do so <ORG> may by law appoint such authority as it considers appropriate for carrying out the purposes of Articles and and confer on the authority so appointed such powers and such duties as it thinks necessary Apart from other Entries under which trade and commerce can be affected and which are to be found in all the three Lists there are two Entries in the Union List two in the State List and one in the Concurrent List which bear directly upon trade and commerce Trade and Commerce in and the production supply and distribution of a the products of any industry where the control of such industry by the <ORG> is declared by Parliamentary law to be expedient in the public interest and imported goods of the same kind as such products food stuffs including edible oilseeds and oils cattle fodder including oilcakes and other concentrates raw cotton whether ginned or unpinned and cotton seed or raw jute In our Constitution questions of conflict under two rival Lists may arise but on the plane of exercise of commerce power such questions can hardly arise Next the words throughout the territory of India avoid disputes which took place in Australia till the <NAME> case was decided by <ORG> namely whether freedom is secured only at the frontiers of the States or also within the States That Article gives power to <ORG> to put restrictions on this freedom Disputes similar to those which took place in Australia in which it was hotly debated whether the Commonwealth was bound or not have thus been avoided The words within any part of the territory of India give power to <ORG> to legislate for any part not only generally but also locally The effect of these words is to take away the power granted to <ORG> to fetter freedom in this preceding Article in the circumstances stated in this Article The Article says that neither a <ORG> nor <ORG> of a State shall have power i to make any law giving or ii to make a law authorising the giving of A any preference to one State over an other any discrimination between one State and another by virtue of any Entry relating to trade and commerce in any of the Lists in the Seventh Schedule Entry of the Concurrent List or Entry of List If read with Entry of List to confine the citation to Entries with which we are primarily concerned here In the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution in addition to Entries and List and List II and List III there are many other Entries regulating special trades by virtue of any entry relating to trade and commerce is meant not the five Entries last named by us but others also Entry of List II Entries of List Entry of List III to mention only a few from each List Thus is achieved one purpose which is paramount viz There is however one exception to it and that it is contained in cl Let us quote them again Nothing in clause shall prevent <ORG> from making any law giving or authorising the giving of any preference or making or authorising the making of any discrimination if it is declared by such law that it is necessary to do so for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods in any part of the territory of India there would arise a question of balancing it against Art Article saved existing laws to start with and at the time of the passing of the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act room was made for the operation of laws by which a <ORG> or a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> carries on any trade business industry or service whether as a monopoly or otherwise We shall now notice some cases which were decided by <ORG> and <ORG> because it is these cases which have been cited to us in support by the rival parties After the Constitution of India came into force on January came the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> next approved of the following passage from the <ORG> case which has already been quoted by us I venture to repeat what I said in the former case the <NAME> case One proposition which I regard as established is that simple legislative prohibition <ORG> or <ORG> as distinct from regulation of inter<ORG> trade and commerce is invalid The Chief Justice basing himself on the Banks case opined that <ORG> had finally decided that laws directly operating upon persons engaging in inter State trade and commerce were not infringements of a if they were what could fairly be described as regulation If however they were laws which directly dealt with the subject matter of trade and commerce and exceeded regulation and passed into prohibition they were invalid Before we examine the decision of <ORG> lot us recall and re state the main events in brief Then came the <ORG> case which laid down that regulation of trade commerce and intercourse among the States was not incompatible with their absolute freedom and that there was a breach of only when the legislature or the executive acted to restrict such trade commerce or intercourse directly and immediately as distinct from creating some indirect or consequential impediment which could only be regarded as remote How were these cases affected by the pronouncement of <ORG> The earlier view that The King <NAME> was approved by <ORG> in <NAME> The <ORG> fell to the ground when <ORG> in the <ORG> case abjured this There was also the approval given to the <ORG> case to which we have referred <ORG> pointed out that in the <ORG> cases sufficient weight was not given to <NAME> Cowan where determinations of executive in its discretion were said to be invalid The Board overruled the <ORG> cases and observed In their opinion it follows that if the validity of the Transport Act is to be established in the present case it can only be upon the ground that the restrictions contained therein are regulatory in the sense in which that word is used in the <ORG> case There was a clear distinction in conception between laws interfering with freedom to carry out the very activity constituting interState trade and laws imposing on those engaged therein rules of proper conduct or other restraints directed to the due and orderly manner of carrying it out There was a divergence of opinion again over the question of licence charges and registration fees There is yet another line of cases recently decicided in Australia Having dealt with the historical background of the Constitution the possible models which were considered in the drafting of Part XIIL we proceed to consider the three views expressed in the <ORG> case There is hardly any tax which the States are authorised to collect which could not be said to fall on traders in those cases where the tax is a general tat which a trade pays in common with others We would therefore respectfully disagree with the view of <NAME> when he holds Not merely discriminative tariffs restricting movement of goods are included in the restrictions which are bit by Article but all taxation on commercial intercourse even imposed as a measure for collection of revenue is so hit Between discriminatory tariffs and trade barriers on the one hand and taxation for raising revenue on commercial intercourse the difference is one of purpose and not of quality Both these forms of burdens on commercial intercourse trench upon the freedom guaranteed by Article But there is difference between a tax which burdens a trader in this manner and a tax which being general is paid by tradesmen in common with others There is a vital difference between the two viewed from the angle of freedom of trade and commerce To refuse to draw such a distinction would mean that there is no taxing entry in Lists and which is not subject to Arts Support for the contrary proposition is not to be found in <NAME> <ORG> <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> did not lay down Every step in the series of operations which constitutes the particular transaction is an act of trade and control under the <ORG> law of any of these steps must be an interference with its freedom as trade The passage represents the view hold in <NAME> case But this is not to say that we accept the view that all taxes or taxing laws are outside the reach of Part XIII and lift the ban which has been imposed in favour of action by law made by <ORG> and the State <ORG>s respectively Article expressly mentions the power to impose taxes which must include at least excise duties and sales tax and from this also it is quite clear that taxation is within the prohibition contained in Part XII This argument was also rejected by the majority in <ORG> case and we respectfully agree In our Constitution many problems which agitated the Australian High Court have been obviated and in so far as restriction of the freedom is concerned it can only be achieved by law made in the public interest and in the manner indicated <ORG> in the <NAME> case observed If these two tests are applied first whether the effect of the Act is in a parti cular respect direct or remote and secondly whether in its true character it is regulatory the area of dispute may be considerably narrower There is a real difference between regulation and restriction Sometimes however the regulation it self may amount to a restriction and if such a stage is reached then under our Constitution there striation must be reasonably in the public interest and the President prior sanction must be obtained if the law imposing such restriction is made by <ORG> Similarly a demand for a tax from traders in common with others is not a restriction of their right to carry on trade and commerce A tax however which is made the condition precedent of the right to enter upon and carry on business at all is a very different matter It is a restriction on the right to carry on trade and commerce and the restriction is released on the payment of the tax which is the price of such release Section which imposes the tax is the charging section and has on its terms to be read with each of the Schedules to the Act there are provisions for penalties and for compounding There is one other provision to which attention may be drawn and that is which reads Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act it shall be lawful for the Government to levy tolls on motor vehicles under any law or usage for the time being in force such rates as i may from time to time fix i for the use of any bridges or ii on any bridge constructed reconstructed or repaired after the commencement of this Act If the above motor vehicles are fitted with resilient or non resilient tyres extra tax will be levied at of the above rate Part A is then divided into three sections dealing with different classes of vehicles and prescribe different rates for each such class There are further sub divisions in each category A and according to the seating capacity of the vehicles on the basis of which different rates of tax are imposed but it is not necessary to go into their details There was one route Formerly there was an agreement between the Ajmer <ORG> and There is no provision in the Act which can be regarded as regulatory of motor vehicles or their use The Act plainly levies a tax upon the possession or use of motor vehicles We would therefore allow the appeals and quash the demand made upon the appellants By COURT In accordance with the opinion of the majority these appeals are dismissed with costs one hearing fee
