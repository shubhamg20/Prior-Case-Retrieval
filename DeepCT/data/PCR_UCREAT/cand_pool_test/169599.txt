a to of sub of have regard to the interest of the public generally the advantages to the public of the service to be provided the adequacy of other passenger transport services operating between the places to be served the operation by the applicant of other transport services etc and also take into consideration the representations made by local or police authorities and by persons already providing passenger transport facilities by any means along or near the proposed route or area While sub thereof conferred power on <ORG> to issue directions of a general character in public interest in respect of any matter relating to road transport sub specifically conferred the power to issue directions regarding grant of stage carriage permits to all eligible applicants if <ORG> was of the opinion that it was in the public interest to do so Further under sub of A the provisions of stood amended to the effect that while considering an application for permit it was no longer necessary for the <ORG> to have regard to the adequacy of other passenger transport services operating between the places to be served or to the operation by the applicant of other transport services nor was the <ORG> required to look into representations made by any one other than local or police authorities and authorising <ORG> to issue necessary directions from time to time in regard to the number of permits that may be granted in respect of any route or area the preference to be given to specifically deserving categories etc These amendments came into force on January a and of sub of and to take into consideration representations made by local or police authorities only According to the High <ORG> the question of reservation would arise only in those cases where the seats or articles are limited for distribution or allotment but where there is no limit or no fixed number the question of reservation would not arise Allowing the appeals HELD Whenever a court is called upon to interpret an amended provision it has to bear in mind the history of the provision the mischief which the legislature attempted to remedy the remedy provided by the amendment and the reason for providing such remedy After the amendment sub of A did not comprehend within its scope the power to issue directions for issuing permits to all eligible applicants without any sort of restriction relevant to the scheme of the Act The sub section states that <ORG> may issue such directions of a general character as it may consider necessary in the public interest It takes within its fold several factors such as the maximum number of permits that may be Issued on a route or in any area having regard to the needs and convenience of the travelling public the non availability of sufficient number of stage carriages in other routes or areas which may be in need of running of additional services the problems of law and order availability of fuel etc Any direction given by <ORG> under A should therefore be in conformity with all matters regarding which the statute has made provision The observation of the High <ORG> that preferences have to be shown and reservations have to be made only when there is scarcity of permits and since there were no restrictions on the number of permits to be issued there was no necessity to make any such provision is shocking Preference and reservations have value only when there is a limit on the number of permits to be issued and in the context of the Act there should necessarily be a limit on the issue of permits to operate motor vehicles in respect of any route or area Whatever the <ORG> may have observed while considering that provision would not apply now as There is a clear departure made by the legislature from that policy when it enacted the new sub of A In the face of this amendment by which the former sub of A which specifically authorised <ORG> when it was satisfied that it was necessary to do so in the public interest to issue directions to <ORG> to grant permits to all eligible applicants was deliberately taken away by the State legislature the High <ORG> was wrong in holding that such power was still available under sub of A which was widely worded The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> In these appeals by special leave filed against the common judgment dated March of <ORG> the validity of two Notifications issued by <ORG> under section A of the Motor Vehicles Act Act IV of hereinafter referred to as the Act as in force in the State of Uttar Pradesh arises for consideration Notification No XXX Dated January The

writ petitions filed by them under Article of the Constitution before <ORG> inter alia on the ground that they were ultra vires the provisions of the Act under which they had been issued Aggrieved by the decision of <ORG> the appellants have preferred these appeals by special leave as stated above On finding that the Indian Motor Vehicles Act which Was brought into force at an early stage of development of motor transport was inadequate to meet the new situation created by the growth of motor transport by the year <ORG> passed the Act for the purpose of regulating motor traffic in the interests alike of the safety and convenience of the public and of the development of a coordinated system of transport The subject of regulation of motor vehicles being within the scope of Entry mechanically propelled vehicles including the principles on which taxes on such vehicles are to be levied in List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution various amendments were made from time to time by several State Legislatures with the assent of the President of India either adding to or modifying the provisions of the Act Chapter IV of the Act which includes section to section contains

<ORG> may think fit to appoint have regard to the following matters namely a the interest of the public generally the advantages to the public of the service to be provided including the saving of time likely to be effected thereby and any convenience arising from journeys not being broken the adequacy of other passenger transport services operating or likely to operate in the near future whether by road or other means between the places to be served the benefit to any particular locality or localities likely to be afforded by the service the operation by the applicant of other transport services including those in respect of which applications from him for permits are pending the condition of the roads included in the proposed route or area and shall also take into consideration any representations made by persons already providing passenger transport facilities by any means along or near the proposed route or area or by any association representing persons interested in the provision of road trans port facilities recognised in this behalf by <ORG> or by any local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction any part of the proposed route or area lies Provided that other conditions being equal an application for a stage carriage permit from a cooperative society registered or deemed to have been registered under any enactment in force for the time being shall as far as may be be given preference over applications from individual owners <ORG> shall refuse to grant a stage carriage permit if it appears from any timetable furnished that the provisions of this Act relating to the speed at which vehicles may be driven are likely to be contravened Provided that before such refusal an opportunity shall be given to the applicant to amend the time table so as to conform to the said provisions <ORG> may having regard to the matters mentioned in sub section limit the number of stage carriages generally or of any specified type for which stage carriage permits may be granted in the region or on any specified area or on any specified route within the region Section of the Act provides that subject to section <ORG> may on an application made to it under section grant a stage carriage permit in accordance with the application or with such modifications as it deems fit or refuse to grant such a permit If <ORG> decides to grant a stage carriage permit it may attach to it all or any of the conditions mentioned in section of the Act Sub section of section of the Act provides that when any representation such as is referred to in sub section thereof is made <ORG> shall dispose of the application at a public hearing at which the applicant and the persons making the representations shall have an opportunity of being heard either in person or by a duly authorised representative Representations can be made among others by any person who is providing transport facilities on the route or in the area any rival applicant police authorities and local authorities Any person who satisfies the qualifications mentioned in section of the Act and who is aggrieved by the resolution of <ORG> may file an appeal before <ORG> which should consist of a wholetime judicial officer not below the rank of a District Judge Subsection of section of the Act which confers power on <ORG> to control transport reads thus the desirability of preventing the deterioration of the road system and the desirability of preventing uneconomic competition among motor vehicles may from time to time by notification in the official <ORG> issue directions to <ORG> i regarding the fixing of fares and freights including the maximum and minimum in respect thereof for stage carriages contract carriages and public carriers ii regarding the prohibition or restriction subject to such conditions as may be specified in the directions of the conveying of long distance goods traffic generally or of specified classes of goods by private or public carriers iii regarding the grant of permits for alternative routes or areas to persons In whose cases the existing permits are not renewed in pursuance of the provisions of sub section of section or are cancelled or the terms thereof are modified in exercise of the powers conferred by clause or clause of sub section of section iv regarding any other matter which may appear to <ORG> necessary or expedient for giving effect to any agreement entered into with <ORG> or any other State Government or the Government of any other country relating to the regulation of motor transport generally and in particular to its coordination with A other means of transport and the conveying of long distance goods traffic Provided that no such notification shall be issued unless a draft of the proposed directions is published in the official <ORG> specifying therein a date being not less than one month after such publication on or after which the draft will be taken into consideration and any objection or suggestion which may be received has in consultation with <ORG> been considered after giving the representatives of the interests affected an opportunity of being heard The State Government may issue such directions of a general character as it may consider necessary or expedient in the public interest in respect of any matter relating to road transport to <ORG> or to <ORG> and such Transport Authority shall give effect to all such directions revisions in that behalf including any pending applications appeals and revisions as if a in section i for sub section the following sub sections were substituted ii <ORG> shall in considering an application for a stage carriage permit have regard to the following matters namely a the interest of the public generally the advantage to the public of the service to be provided including the saving of time likely to be effected thereby and any convenience arising from journeys not being broken the benefit to any particular locality or localities likely to be afforded by the service and shall also take into consideration any representation made by any local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction any part of the proposed route or area lies and sub section were omitted The above Act was preceded by the Ordinance which contained more or less the same provisions Therefore with a view to making it easier to secure permits in respect of non nationalised routes and to introducing simplicity in procedure and to providing greater employment and securing equitable distribution thereof it was considered necessary to amend sections SO SS and of the Motor Vehicles Act suitably Now therefore in exercise of the power conferred by section A of the Motor Vehicles Act the Governor is pleased to direct that stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas aforesaid contract carriage permits and public carrier permits shall be granted according to the provisions of the said Act to all eligible applicants Accor dingly the State Government issued a Notification on September which ran as follows Whereas in exercise of the power conferred by Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act <ORG> was by notification No XXX dated March pleased to direct that stage carriage permits except in respect of routes or areas aforesaid contract carriage permits and public carrier permits shall be granted according to the provisions of the said Act to all eligible applicants And whereas on further consideration <ORG> is of opinion that the policy of granting such permits to all eligible applicants requires review with a view to a Preventing unproductive expenditure and under utilization of capital and fuel Now therefore in exercise of the powers conferred by the said Section A of the Motor Vehicles Act read with Section of the General Clauses Act the Governor is pleased to direct that The consideration of applications for stage carriage permits pending with <ORG> shall stand postponed until further directions are issued in this behalf by the State Government No fresh applications for such permits shall be entertained until further directions are issued in this behalf by <ORG> The above Notification shows that as a consequence of the policy of granting permits to all eligible applicants necessity had arisen to take measures i to prevent unproductive expenditure and under utilisation of capital and fuel ii to prevent elimination of small operators due to unfair competition resulting from the issue of more permits than required for a route and iii to embark upon long term planning of passenger road transport services Power of State Government to issue directions to Transport Authorities The State Government may issue such directions of a general character as it may consider necessary or expedient in the public interest in respect of any matter relating to road transport to <ORG> or to <ORG> and such Transport Authority shall give effect to all such directions the preference or the order of preference to be given to or the quota to be fixed for specially deserving categories such as <ORG> personnel educated unemployed persons such persons holding driving licences as are members of cooperative societies formed for passenger transport business persons belonging to the Scheduled castes and Scheduled Tribes Where any direction is issued under sub section to <ORG> then any appeal or revision pending before <ORG> shall also be decided in such manner as to give effect to such directions Where any direction is issued under sub section with retrospective effect then a <ORG> or <ORG> may review any order passed earlier by it with a view to making it conform to such direction and may for that purpose cancel any permit already issued The provisions of this section shall have effect not withstanding anything contained in sections and It was accordingly considered necessary to amend the Motor Vehicles Act to authorise <ORG> to issue directions from time to time in regard to the number of permits that may be granted in respect of any route or area the preference to be given to specially deserving categories and the procedure for grant of permits Pursuant to the said amended section A of the Act <ORG> issued a Notification containing directions on March in the following terms Whereas in exercise of the powers conferred by section A of the Act <ORG> had by a notification No XXX dated September as amended by notification No XXX dated October postponed the consideration of applications for permits by any transport authority in respect of non notified routes until further directions in this behalf of <ORG> Provided that other conditions being equal an application for a stage carriage permit from a co operative society registered or deemed to have been registered under any enactment in force for the time being and an application for a stage carriage permit from a person who has a valid licence for driving transport vehicles shall as far as may be be given preference over applications from individual owners The number of permits reserved under sub section and clause a of sub section shall not exceed fifty per cent of the total number of stage carriage permits granted during a calendar year In giving effect to the provisions of sub section and clause a of sub section <ORG> or <ORG> may if it considers necessary or expedient so to do group the various routes within its jurisdiction Where any stage carriage permit is to be granted from the quota reserved under sub section or clause a of sub section to any cooperative society registered or deemed to have been registered under any enactment in force for the time being or any firm to which the provisions of the Indian Partnership Act apply no permit shall be granted to such society or firm unless the members of the co operative society or the partners of the firm belong to the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes or economically weaker sections of the community Provided that where the members of such co operative society or the partners of such firm are partly from the Scheduled Castes partly from the Scheduled Tribes and partly from the economically weaker sections of the community or from any two of these categories any permit under this sub section shall be granted to such society or firm only from the quota reserved for the category to which the largest number of members of the co operative society or as the case may be partners of the firm belong Provided further that where no reservation has been made in the State for economically weaker sections of the community under clause a of sub section no permit under this sub section shall be granted to a co operative society or firm unless the members of such society or partners of such firm belong to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes or partly to the Scheduled Castes and partly to the Scheduled Tribes and the permit to such society or firm shall be granted only from the quota reserved for the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes according as to whether the larger number of the members of the co operative society or partners of the firm belong to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes Notwithstanding anything contained in this section an application for stage carriage permit from a State transport undertaking for operating in any inter State route shall be given preference over all other applications Provided that the authority shall not grant a permit under this sub section unless it is satisfied that the State transport undertaking would be able to operate in the inter State route without detriment to its responsibility for providing efficient and adequate road transport service in any notified area or notified route as is referred to in sub section of section where the undertaking operates the service Since it was considered necessary to promote the well being of economically weaker sections of the community <ORG> was empowered under certain circumstances either to reserve certain percentage of permits for stage carriages for persons belonging to economically weaker sections of the community or to give preference to them in the prescribed manner It was however provided that the number of permits reserved under section and a of the Act should not exceed fifty per cent of the total number of stage carriage permits granted in a calendar year It was also provided that if <ORG> applied for a stage carriage permit operating in any inter State route such application should be given preference over all other applications provided the authority we satisfied that the <ORG> would be able to operate in the inter State route without detriment to its responsibility for providing efficient and adequate road transport service in any notified area or notified route as is referred to in sub section of section of the Act where the <ORG> operated its service The above said amendments made to sections and came into force on January It is conceded by the learned Attorney General who appeared for <ORG> that these amendments which were made by <ORG> would have an over riding effect on section A of the Act introduced earlier by <ORG> and that section A should be read subject to those later amendments made by <ORG> By the second impugned notification dated January <ORG> directed <ORG> and <ORG> to have regard only to matters referred to in clauses a and of sub section of section of the Act and should also take into consideration representation made by the local authority or police authority within whose jurisdiction any part of the proposed route or area lay It also directed that section should be deemed to have been complied with if <ORG> concerned intimated the particulars of the applications to such local authority and police authority for making representations if any within a period of fifteen days from the date of despatch of the intimation with the stipulation that if no representation was received within the prescribed period of time it would be presumed that they had no representation to make and considered any representation made by such local authority and police authority A reading of these two notifications shows that <ORG> ignored first the legislative policy underlying the Uttar Pradesh Act of by which the new sub section of section A was enacted in substitution of the former sub section with retrospective effect It was argued on behalf of <ORG> before <ORG> that <ORG> not contravened either section A or the provisions of section as amended in the year Repelling the contention of the writ petitioners that in the absence of reservation of the required percentage of permits for persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes and weaker sections as provided in section as amended by <ORG> in the grant of permits would be vitiated <ORG> observed as follows The question of reservation however arises only in those cases where the seats or articles are limited for distribution or allotment but where there is no limit or no fixed number the question of reserved on will not arise So we are not able to agree with the submission of the petitioner learned counsel that there is a conflict between section A as inserted by <ORG> and the amendments made in section by <ORG> in the Motor Vehicles Act of section A which authorised <ORG> to issue such directions of a general character as it might consider necessary or expedient in the public interest in respect of any matter relating to road transport to <ORG> or to <ORG> and which required such authority to give effect to any such directions We may here state that any observations made in <NAME> case supra would be inapplicable so far as these cases presently before us are concerned Without saying anything more on the point it may be stated that whatever this <ORG> may have observed while considering that provision would not apply now as there is a clear departure made by the <ORG> from that policy when it enacted the new sub section of section A In the face of this amendment by which the former sub section of section A which specifically authorised he State Government when it was satisfied that it was necessary to do so in the public interest to issue directions to the Transport Authorities to grant permits to all eligible applicants was deliberately taken away by the State <ORG> the High <ORG> was wrong in holding that such power was still available under sub section of section A of the Act which was widely worded It is a well settled rule of construction of statutes that whenever a court is called upon to interpret an amended provision it has to bear in mind the history of that provision the mischief which the <ORG> attempted to remedy the remedy provided by the amendment and the reason for providing such remedy Therefore after the amendment at any rate it has to be held that sub section of section A of the Act did not comprehend within its scope the power to issue direction for issuing permits to all eligible applicants without any sort of restriction relevant to the scheme of the Act What does section A after all say It says that <ORG> may issue such directions of a general character as it may consider necessary in the public interest What is the meaning of the term public interest In the context of the Act it takes within its fold several factors such as the maximum number of permits that may be issued on a route or in any area having regard to the needs and convenience of the travelling public the non availability of sufficient number of stage carriage services in other routes or areas which may be in need of running of additional services the problems of law and order availability of fuel problems arising out of atmospheric pollution caused by a large number of motor vehicles operating in any route or area the condition of roads and bridges on the routes uneconomic running of stage carriage services leading to elimination of small operators and employment of more capital than necessary in any sector leading to starvation of capital investment in other sectors etc We nave to bear in mind that like every other economic activity the running of stage carriage service is an activity which involves use of scarce or limited productive resources There are provisions relating to licensing of drivers on the basis of their competence licensing of conductors specifications to which the motor vehicles should conform coordination of road and rail transport prevention of deterioration of the road system prevention of uneconomic competition among motor vehicles fixation of reasonable fare compliance by motor vehicles with the prescribed time table construction of bus stands with necessary amenities maintenance of standards of comfort and cleanliness in the vehicles development of <ORG> tourist traffic and several other matters with the object of making available adequate and efficient transport facilities to all parts of the country Any direction given by <ORG> under section A of the Act should therefore be in conformity with all matters regarding which the statute has made provision It is surprising that <ORG> has reached the conclusion that the preferences and reservations to be observed while granting permits as stated in the proviso to sub section to section and in sub sections A to of section have not been contravened as there is no restriction on the number of permits to be issued The observation of <ORG> that preferences have to be shown and reservations have to be made only when there is scarcity of permits and since there are no restrictions on the number of permits to be issued there is no necessity to make any such provision really shocks us Preferences and reservations have value only when there is a limit on the number of permits to be issued and in the context of the Act there should necessarily he a limit on the issue of permits to operate motor vehicles in respect of any route or area We do not agree with the above submission We are clearly of the view that the State <ORG> has transgressed the provisions contained in sub section and sub sections A to of section The first notification which directs that all eligible applicants shall be granted permits and that there shall be no upper limit to the number of permits to be issued for stage carriages and the second notification which says that <ORG> shall have regard only to matters referred to in clauses a and of sub section of section of the Act and thereby precludes <ORG> to take into consideration matters contained in the proviso to section and in sub section A to of section of the Act are ultra vires the Act and they are liable to he struck down We therefore allow these appeals set aside the judgment of <ORG> in each of these cases and declare that the Notification No XXX KM dated January and the Notification No XXX dated January issued by the GoverDmeDt of the State of Uttar Pradesh under section A of the Act are ultra vires and therefore void and ineffective
