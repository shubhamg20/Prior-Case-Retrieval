HEADNOTE After the <ORG> of Bombay was bifurcated the legislature of the <ORG> of Gujarat enacted the Bombay Labour Welfare Fund Gujarat Extension and Amendment Act making various amendments in the Bombay Labour Welfare Fund Act Demand for the payment ofthe unpaid accumulations having been made the respondents filed petitions in<ORG> challenging various provisions of the Act and <ORG> held that in so far as it relates to unpaid accumulations specified ins and A of the Act and rules and of the rules made thereunder are unconstitutional and void on the grounds i that the impugned provisions violated the fundamental rights of citizen employers and employees under Art and hence there was no law and the demands were thus without the authority of law and that discrimination was writ large in the definition of establishment There is no reason to think that the <ORG> will be When the moneys representing the unpaid accumulations are paid to the <ORG> the liability of the employers to make payment to the employees in respect of their claims against the employers would be discharged to the extent of the amount paid to the <ORG> and on such liability being transferred to the <ORG> the debts or claims to that extent cannot thereafter be enforced against the employers As regards notice all persons having property located within a state and subject to its dominion must take note of its statutes affecting control and disposition of such property and the procedure prescribed for those purposes If a pre constitutional law which takes away or abridges the rights under Art could remain operative even after the Constitution came into force as regards non citizens there is no reason why a post constitutional law which takes away or abridges them should not be operative as respects noncitizens if the meaning of the word void in Art is an injunction to the <ORG> not to pass any law which takes away or abridges the fundamental rights conferred by Part III and the consequence of the contravention of the injunction is that the law would be void to the extent of the contravention The expression to the extent of the contravention in the sub article can only mean to the extent of the contravention of the rights conferred under that Part Just as a pre constitutional law taking away or abridging the fundamental rights under Art remains operative after the Constitution came into force as respects of noncitizens as it is not inconsistent that their fundamental rights so also a postconstitutional law offending Art remains operative as against non citizens as it is not in contravention of any of their fundamental rights The law might be still born so far as the persons entities or denominations whose fundamental rights are taken away or abridged but there is no reason why the law should he void or still born as against those who have no fundamental rights The expression any law occurring in the latter part of the sub article must necessarily refer to the same expression in the former part and therefore the Constitution makers have already made it clear that the law that would be void is only the law which contravenes the fundamental rights conferred by Part III and so the phrase to the extent of the contravention can mean only to the extent of the contravention of the rights conferred When it is seen that the latter part of the sub article is concerned with the effect of the violation of the injunction contained in the former part the words to the extent of the contravention can only refer to the rights conferred under Part III ind denote only the compass of voidness with respect to persons or entities resulting from the contravention of the rights conferred upon them There is no reason why the Constitution makers wanted to state that the other sections which did not violate the fundamental rights would not be void A Assuming that this Court has rejected the distinction between legislative incapacity arising from lack of power under the relevant legislative entry and that arising from a check upon legislative power on account of constitutional provisions like fundamental rights it does not follow that if the law enacted by the legislature having no capacity in the former sense would be void in rem a law passed by a legislature having no legislative capacity in the latter sense should also be void in rem because i If on a textual reading of Art the conclusion reached namely that a law passed by a legislature having no legislative capacity in the latter sense is only void qua those persons whose fundamental rights are taken away or abridged is the only reasonable one there is no need to consider whether that conclusion could not be arrived at except on the basis of such a distinction and ii Further there is nothing strange in the notion of a legislature having no inherent legislative capacity or power to take away or abridge by law the fundamental rights conferred on citizens and yet having legislative power to pass the same law in respect of non citizens who have no such fundamental rights to be taken away or abridged But the mandate is that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III If a law is otherwise good and does not contravene any of their fundamental rights noncitizens cannot take advantage of the voidness of the law for the reason that it contravenes the fundamental rights of citizens and claim that there is no law at ail A reasonable classification is one which includes all who are similarly situated and none who are not with respect to the purpose of the law A classification is under inclusive when all who are included in the class are tainted with the mischief but there are others also tainted whom the classification does not include A classification is over inclusive when it includes not only those who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose but also others who are not so situated In the utilities tax and economic regulation cases there are good reasons for judicial self restraint if not official deference to legislative judgment The Courts have only the power to destroy but not to reconstruct When to this are added the complexity of economic regulation the uncertainty the liability to error the bewildering conflict of the experts and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events self limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability Administrative convenience in the collection of unpaid accumulations is a factor to be taken into account in adjudging whether the classification is reasonable The reason why government establishments other than factories were not included in the definition is that there are hardly any establishments run by the Central or <ORG> Government A The justification for including tramways and motor omnibuses within the purview of the definition is that the legislature of the <ORG> of Bombay when it enacted the Act in must have had reason to think that unpaid accumulations in these concerns would be large because they usually employed a large amount of labour force and they were bound to keep records of the wages earned and paid The first respondent a company registered under the Companies Act filed a Writ petition in <ORG> In that petition it impugned the provisions of sections A and of the Bombay Labour Welfare Fund Act hereinafter referred to as the Act and of the Bombay Labour Welfare Fund Gujarat Extension and Amendment Act hereinafter referred to as the First Amendment Act and rules and of the Bombay Labour Welfare Fund Rules hereinafter referred to as tie Rules as unconstitutional and prayed for the issue of a writ in the nature of mandamus or other appropriate writ or direction against the respondents in the writ petition to desist from enforcing the direction in the I notice dated August of respondent No to the writ petition requiring the petitioner st respondent to pay the unpaid accumulations specified therein The Act was passed by the legislature of the then State of Bombay in with a view to provide for the constitution of a fund for financing the activities for promoting the welfare of labour in the State of Bombay Section provided that the fund shall vest in and be applied by <ORG> subject to the provisions and for the purposes of the Act Section gave power to the State Government to make rules and in the exercise of that power the State Government made the Rules Section defines employee Section defines employer as any person who employs either directly or through another person either on behalf of himself or any other person one or more employees in an establishment and includes certain other persons The section further provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force or any contract or instrument all unpaid accumulations shall be collected by such agencies and in such manner as may be prescribed and be paid in the first instance to the <ORG> which shalt keep a separate account therefor until claims thereto have been decided in the manner provided in A Section A is a new section introduced retrospectively in the Act and sub section and of that section state that all unpaid accumulations shall be deemed to be abandoned property and that any unpaid accumulations paid to the <ORG> in accordance with the Provisions of shall on such payment discharge an employer of the liability to make payment to an employee in respect thereof but to the extent only of the amount paid to the <ORG> and that the liability to make payment to the employee to the extent aforesaid shall subject to the other provisions of the section be deemed to be transferred to the <ORG> Sub section provides that such public notice shall contain such particulars as may be prescribed and that it shall be affixed on the notice board or in its absence on a conspicuous part of the premises of each establishment in which the unpaid accumulations were earned and shall be published in <ORG> and also in any two newspapers in the language commonly understood in the area in which such establishment is situated or in such other manner as may be prescribed regard being had to the amount of the claim Sub section states that a certificate of the <ORG> to the effect that the provisions of sub section and were complied with shall be conclusive evidence thereof Sub section provides that any claim received whether in answer to the notice or otherwise within a period of four years from the date of the first publication of the notice in respect of such claim shall be transferred by the <ORG> to the authority appointed under of the Payment of Wages Act having jurisdiction in the area in which the factory or establishment is situated and the <ORG> shall proceed to adjudicate upon and decide such claim and that in bearing such claim the <ORG> shall have the powers conferred by and shall follow the procedure in so far as it is applicable followed in giving effect to the provisions of that Act Sub section provides for an appeal against the decision rejecting any claim Sub section provides that the <ORG> shall comply with any order made in appeal Section provides for the appointment of an officer called the Welfare Commissioner and defines his powers and duties Section confers rule making power on <ORG> Section empowers <ORG> by notification in the official gazette to exempt any class of establishment from all or any of the provisions of the Act subject to such conditions as may be specified in the notification The first respondent raised several contentions before <ORG> but the Court rejected all except two of them and they were that the impugned provisions violated the fundamental right of citizen employers and employees under article and therefore the provisions were void under article of the Constitution and hence there was no law and so the notice issued by the Welfare Com missioner was without the authority of law and that discrimination was writ large in the definition of establishment in and since the definition permeates through every part of the impunged provisions and is an integral part of the impugned provisions the impugned provisions were violative of article and were void Sub sections to of A provide for a public notice calling upon interested employees to submit to the <ORG> their claims for any payment due to them and subsections to I of A lay down the machinery for adjudication of claims which might be received in pursuance to the public notice No doubt when we look at the scheme of the legislation from a practical point of view what is being treated as abandoned property is the money which the employees are entitled to get from the employers and what the <ORG> takes over is the obligation of the employers to pay the amount due to the employees in consideration of the moneys paid by the employers to the <ORG> When the moneys representing the unpaid accumulations are paid to the <ORG> the liability of the employers to make payment to the employees in respect of their claims against the employers would be discharged to the extent of the amount paid to the <ORG> and on such liability being transferred to the <ORG> the debts or claims to that extent cannot thereafter be enforced against the employer And in the absence of some persuasive reason which is lacking here we see no reason to think that the <ORG> will be in fact less able or less willing to pay the amounts when it has taken them over As regards notice we are of the view that all persons having property located within a state and subject to its dominion must take note of its statutes affecting control and disposition of such property and the procedure prescribed for these purposes Be that as it may we do not however think it necessary to consider whether <ORG> was right in its view that the impugned pro visions violated the fundamental rights of the citizen employers or employees for it is a wise tradition with courts that they will not adjudge on the constitutionality of a statute except when they are called upon to do so when legal rights of the litigants are in actual controversy and as part of this rule is the principle that one to whom the application of a statute in constitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that it must also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its application might be unconstitutional see United States Rainas We however proceed on the assumption that the impugned provisions abridge the fundamental right of citizen employers and citizen employees under article in order to decide the further question and that is whether on that assumption the first respondent could claim that the law was void as against the non citizen employers or employees under article and further contend that the non citizen employers have been deprived of their property without the authority of law as ex hypothesi a void law is a nullity As already stated <ORG> found that the impugned provisions in so far as they abridged the fundamental rights of the citizen employers and employees under article were void under article and even if the respondent company had no fundamental right under article it had the ordinary right to hold and dispose of its property and that the right cannot be taken away or even affected except under the authority of a law The first respondent no doubt has the ordinary right of every person in the country to hold and dispose of property and that right if That would give rise to a justiciable issue which can be agitated in a proceeding under article <NAME> who delivered the majority judgment was of the view that the prosecution could be continued on the ground that the provisions of the Constitution including article were not retrospective The learned judge said that after the commencement of the Constitution no existing law could be allowed to stand in the way of the exercise of fundamental rights that such inconsistent laws were not wiped off or obliterated from the statute book and that the statute would operate in respect of all matters or events which took place before the Constitution came into force and that it is also operated after the Constitution came into force and would remain in the statute book as operative so far as non citizens are concerned This decision is clear that even though a law which is inconsistent with fundamental rights under article would become void after the commencement of the Constitution the law would still continue in force in so far as non citizens are concerned At the learned Judge observed It is beyond all dispute that it is for the <ORG> to judge whether the restrictions imposed by any existing law or any part thereof on the fundamental rights of citizens are reasonable or unreasonable in the interest of the general public or for the protection of the interests of <ORG> If the <ORG> holds that the restrictions are unreasonable then the Act or the part thereof which imposes such unreasonable restrictions comes into conflict and becomes inconsistent with the fundamental right conferred on the citizens by article and is by article rendered void not in toto or for all purposes or for all persons but to the extent of such inconsistency i to the extent it is inconsistent with the exercise of that fundamental right by the citizens This is plainly the position as I see it Both these declarations according to the learned Chief Justice of unconstitutionality go to the root of the power itself and there is no real distinction between them and they represent but two aspects of want of legislative power After referring to the meaning given to the word void in <NAME> Case <NAME> Acting said for the <ORG> All laws existing or future which are inconsistent with the provisions of Part III of our Constitution are by the express provision of article rendered void to the extent of such inconsistency The proposition laid down by the learned Judge was that if a law is enacted by a legislature on a topic not within its competence the law was a nullity but if the law was on a topic within its competence but if it violated some constitutional prohibition The learned judge said that the observa tions of <NAME> in <NAME> case that qua citizens that part of of the Bombay Prohibition Act which had been declared invalid by this Court had to be regarded as null and void could notin the context be construed as implying that the impugned law mustbe regarded as non est so as to be incapable of taking effect when thebar was removed being on the statute book even that portion which is unenforceable on the ground that it is unconstitutional will operate proprio vigore when the Constitutional bar is removed and there is no need for a fresh legislation In <NAME> State of and Others it was held that a post Constitution law is void from its inception but that a pre Constitution law having been validly enacted would continue in force so far as non citizens are concerned after the Constitution came into force The Court further said that there is no distinction in the meaning of the word void in article and in and that it connoted the same concept but since from its inception the post Constitution lay is void the law cannot be resuscitated without reenactment Even so it is said that by a parity of reasoning the post Constitution laws are also void to the extent of their repugnancy and therefore the law in respect of noncitizens will be on the statute book and by the application of the doctrine of eclipse the same result should flow in its case also He was of the view that a post Constitution law may infringe either a fundamental right conferred on citizens only or a fundamental right conferred on any person citizen or noncitizen and that in the first case the law will not stand in the way of the exercise by the citizens of that fundamental right and therefore will not have any operation on the rights of the citizens but it will be quite effective as regards non citizens The fact that pre Constitution law was valid when enacted can afford no reason why it should remain operative as respects noncitizens after the Constitution came into force as it became void on account of its inconsistency with the provisions of Part Therefore the real reason why it remains operative as against non citizens is that it is void only to the extent of its inconsistency with the rights conferred under Article and that its voidness is therefore confined to citizens as ex hypothesis the law became inconsistent with their fundamental rights alone If that be so we see no reason why a post Constitution law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by article should not be operative in regard to non citizens as it is void only to the extent of the contravention of the rights conferred on citizens namely those under article Article is an injunction to the state not to pass any law which takes away or abridges the fundamental rights conferred by Part III and the consequence of the contravention of the injunction is that the law would be void to the extent of the contravention The expression to the extent of the contravention in the sub article can only mean to the extent of the contravention of the rights conferred under that part Just as a pre Constitution law taking away or abridging the fundamental rights under article remains operative after the Constitution came into force as respects non citizens as it is not inconsistent with their fundamental rights so also a post Constitution law offending article remains operative as against non citizens as it is not in contravention of any of their fundamental rights In other words the voidness is not in rem but to the extent only of inconsistency or contravention as the case may be of the rights conferred under Part The law might be still born so far as the persons entities or denominations whose fundamental rights are taken away or abridged but there is no reason why the law should be void or still born as against those who have no fundamental rights We think that the expression any law occurring in the latter part of the sub article must necessarily refer to the same expression in the former part and therefore the Constitution makers have already made it clear that the law that would be void is only the law that contravenes the fundamental rights conferred by Part and so the phrase to the extent of the contravention can mean only to the extent of the contravention of the rights conferred For instance if a section in a statute takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Part III it will be void because it is the law embodied in the section which takes away or abridges the fundamental right When we see that the latter part of the sub article is concerned with the effect of the voilation of the injunction contained in the former part the words to the extent of the contravention can only refer to the rights conferred under Part III and denote only the compass of voidness with respect to persons or entities resulting from the contravention of the rights conferred upon them There are many fundamental rights and they inhere in diverse types of persons minorities or denominations There is no conceivable reason why a law which takes away the fundamental right of one class of persons or minorities or denominations should be void as against others who have no such fundamental rights as ex hypothesi the law cannot contravene their rights It was submitted that this Court has rejected the distinction drawn by <NAME> in <NAME> case between legislative incapacity arising from lack of power under the relevant legislative entry and that arising from a check upon legislative power on account of constitutional provisions like fundamental rights and that if the law enacted by a legislature having no capacity in the former sense would be void in rem there is no reason why a law passed by a legislature having no legislative capacity in the latter It was also urged that the expression the <ORG> shall not make any law in article is a clear mandate of the fundamental law of the land and therefore it is a case of total incapacity and total want of power But the question is what is the mandate The mandate is that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part However we venture to think that there is nothing strange in the notion of a legislature having no inherent legislative capacity or power to take away or abridge by a law the fundamental rights conferred on citizens and yet having legislative power to pass the same law in respect of noncitizens who have no such fundamental rights to be taken away or abridged According to him there is no such thing as voidness in an absolute sense for the whole question is void as against whom And he cites the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> Fernando in his support That only illustrates that any statement that a law which takes away or abridges fundamental rights conferred under Part III is still born or null and void requires qualifications in certain situations Although the general rule is that a statute declared unconstitutional is void at all times and that its invalidity must be recognized and acknowledged for all purposes and is no law and a nullity this is neither universally nor absolutely true and there are many exceptions to it This is illustrated by the analysis given by kelsen The decision made by the competent authority that something that presents itself as a norm is null ab initio because it fulfils the conditions of nullity determined by the legal order is a constitutive act it has a definite legal effect without and prior to this act the phenomenon in question cannot be considered as null For our purpose it is enough to say that if a law is otherwise good and does not contravene any of their fundamental rights noncitizens cannot take advantage of the voidness of the law for the reason that it contravenes the fundamental right of citizens and claim that there is no law at all Nor would this proposition violate any principle of equality before the law because citizens and non citizens are not similarly situated as the citizens have certain fundamental rights which non citizens have not Therefore even assuming that under article of the Constitution the first respondent was entitled to move the High Court and seek a remedy for infringement of its ordinary right to property the impugned provisions were not non est but were valid laws enacted by a competent legislature as respects non citizens and the first respondent cannot take the plea that its rights to property are being taken away or abridged without the authority of law <ORG> held that there was no intelligible differentia to distinguish establishments grouped together under the definition of establishment in and establishments left out of the group and that in any event the differentia had no rational relation or nexus with the object sought to be achieved by the Act and that the im See <ORG> <ORG> Ark The <ORG> was also of the view that when Government factories were included in the definition of establishment there was no reason for excluding government establishments other than factories from the definition No affidavit in rejoinder was filed on behalf of respondents to contradict this statement A reasonable classification is one which includes all who are similarly situated and none who are not The question then is what does the phrase similarly situated mean The answer to the question is that we must look beyond the classification to the purpose of the law A reasonable classification is one which includes all persons who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose of the law A classification is under inclusive when all who are included in the class are tainted with the mischief but there are others also tainted whom the classification does not include A classification is over inclusive when it includes not only those who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose but others who are not so situated as well Since the classification does not include all who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose of the law the classification might appear at first blush to be unreas onable Mr Justice <NAME> in urging tolerance of under inclusive classifications stated that such legislation should not be disturbed by the <ORG> unless it can clearly see that there is no fair reason for the law which would not require with equal force its extension to those whom it leaves untouched it is not to be overthrown because there are other instances to which it might have been applied There is no doctrinaire requirement that the legislation should be couched in all embracing terms Administrative convenience in the collection of unpaid accumulations is a factor to be taken into account in adjudging whether the classification is reasonable The prominence given to the equal protection clause in many modern opinions and decisions in America all show that the <ORG> feels less constrained to give judicial deference to legislative judgment in the field of human and civil rights than in that of economic regulation and that it is making a vigorous use of the equal protection clause to strike down legislative action in the area of fundamental human rights Law reflects distinction that exist in fact or at least appear to exist in the judgment of legislators those who have the responsibility for making law fit fact That the legislation is directed to practical problems that the economic mechanism is highly sensitive and complex that many problems are singular and contingent that laws are not abstract propositions and do not relate to abstract units and are not to be measured by abstract symmetry that exact wisdom and nice adaption of remedies cannot be required that judgment is largely a prophecy based on meagre and uninterpreted experience should stand as reminder that in this area the <ORG> does not lake the equal protection requirement in a pedagogic manner supra In the utilities tax and economic regulation cases there are good reasons for judicial self restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment The legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility The <ORG>s have only the power to destroy not to reconstruct When these are added to the complexity of economic regulation the uncertainty the liability to error the bewildering conflict of the experts and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events self limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability supra But then there are practical problems There remains then the further question whether there was any justification for including tramways and motor omnibuses within the purview of the definition So far as tramways and motor omnibuses are concerned the legislature of Bombay when it enacted the Act in must have had reason to think that unpaid accumulations in these concerns would be large as they usually employed large amount of labour force and that they were bound to keep records of the wages earned and paid In this Act unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context ii industrial establishment means any a tramway or motor omnibus service Register of Wages A Register of Wages shall be maintained in every factory and industrial establishment and may be kept in such form as the paymaster finds convenient but shall include the following particulars a the gross wages earned by each person employed for each wage period all deductions made from those wages with an indication in each case of the clause of sub section of section under which the deduction is made the wages actually paid to each person employed for each wage period But there is no necessary reason for choosing the intent to exclude one group over the intent to include another
