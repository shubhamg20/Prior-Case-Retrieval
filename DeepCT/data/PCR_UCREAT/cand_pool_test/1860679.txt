In clause No of the complaint filed before the Magistrate it was stated That the accused No is tho Manager of accused No and accused No to are the Directors of accused No and as such they were incharge of and responsible for the conduct of business of accused No at the time of sampling The Magistrate passed an order summoning all the accused for being tried for violation of ss of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act and that order was assailed before <ORG> It was argued before <ORG> that the complaint did not attribute any criminal responsibility to the Directors inasmuch as there was no clear averment of the fact that the Directors were really incharge of the manufacture of toffees and were responsible for the conduct of business and that the words as such in clause No of the complaint indicated that the complainant had merely presumed that the Directors of the Company must be guilty because they were holding a particular office In appeal it was contended on behalf Of the appellant that on the allegations made in the complaint a clear case had been made out against all the respondents and <ORG> ought not to have quashed the proceedings on the ground that the complaint did not disclose any offence It is not merely a rovisional power meant to be exercised against the orders passed by subordinate courts It is well settled that the inherent powers under can be exercised only when no other remedy is available to the litigant and Dot where a specific remedy is provided by the statute So far as the Directors of the Company were concerned there was nothing to show apart from the presumption drawn by the complainant that there was any act committed by them from which a reasonable inference could be drawn to the effect that they were also vicariously liable and <ORG> was right in holding that no case had been made out ex facie on the allegations made in the complaint Section gives ample powers to any court to take cognizance and add any person not being an accused before it and try him along with the other accused However this being an extraordinary power conferred on the court it should be used very sparingly and only if compelling reasons exist for doing so This appeal by special leave is directed against a judgment dated March of <ORG> quashing the proceedings taken against respondents Nos to and arises in the following circumstances The only point canvassed before us was that on the allegations made in the complaint a clear case was made out against all the respondents and <ORG> ought not to have quashed the proceedings on the ground that the complaint did not disclose any offence After the coming into force of the Code of Criminal Procedure hereinafter referred to as the present Code there was a serious divergence of judicial opinion on the question as to whether where a power is exercised under section of the present Code <ORG> could exercise those very powers under section of the present Code inherent powers of the court to pass orders necessary in order to prevent the abuse of the process of the court In this connection <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed as follows On a plain reading of section however it would follow that nothing in the Code which would include sub section of section also shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent powers of <ORG> This provision confers a separate and independent power on <ORG> alone to pass orders ex debito justitiae in cases where grave and substantial injustice has been done or where the process of the <ORG> has been seriously abused It is not merely a revisional power meant to be exercised against the orders passed by subordinate courts Thus the scope ambit and range of A which is now is quite different from the powers conferred by the present Code under the provisions of It is well settled that the inherent powers under of the present Code can be exercised only when no other remedy is available to the litigant and not where a specific remedy is provided by the statute If these considerations are kept in mind there will be no inconsistency between sections and of the present Code Another important consideration which is to be kept in mind is as to when <ORG> acting under the provisions of should exercise the inherent power in so far as quashing of criminal proceedings are concerned where the scope of ss and of the present Code was consider ed and while laying down the guidelines and the grounds on which proceedings could be quashed this Court observed as follows Thus it may be safely held that in the following cases an order of the Magistrate issuing process against the accused can be quashed or set aside Where the allegations made in the complaint or the statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the accused Where the allegations made in the complaint are patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused Where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in issuing process is capricious and arbitrary having been based either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly irrelevant or inadmissible and Where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal defects such as want of sanction or absence of a complaint by legally competent authority and the like The cases mentioned by us are purely illustrative and provide sufficient guidelines to indicate contingencies where <ORG> can quash Proceedings In other words the test is that taking the allegations and the complaint as they are without adding or subtracting any thing if no offence is made out then <ORG> will be justified in quashing the proceedings in exercise of its powers under of the present Code There is no dispute regarding these facts It was however contended that there is no allegation whatsoever against the Directors respondent Nos to Reliance has been placed on the words as such in order to argue that because the complaint does not attribute any criminal responsibility to accused Nos to except that they were incharge of and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company It is true that there is no clear averment of the fact that the Directors were really incharge of the manufacture and responsible for the conduct of business but the words as such indicate that the complainant has merely presumed that the Directors of the company must be guilty because they are holding a particular office This argument found favour with <ORG> which quashed the proceedings against the Directors as also against the Manager respondent No So far as the Directors are concerned there is not even a whisper nor a shred of evidence nor anything to show apart from the presumption drawn by the complainant that there is any act committed by the Directors from which a reasonable inference can be drawn that they could also be vicariously liable In these circumstances therefore we find ourselves in complete agreement with the argument of <ORG> that no case against the Directors accused Nos to has been made out ex facie on the allegations made in the complaint and the proceedings against them were rightly quashed Although we uphold the order of <ORG> we would like to state that there are ample provisions in the Code of Criminal Procedure in which the Court can take cognizance against persons who have not been made accused and try them in the same manner along with the other accused In the old Code contained a lacuna in the mode of taking cognizance if a new person was to be added as an accused Where in the course of any inquiry into or trial of an offence it appears from the evidence that any person not being the accused has committed any offence for which such person could be tried together with the accused the Court may proceed against such person for the offence which he appears to have committed This provision gives ample powers to any court to take cognizance and add any person not being an accused before it and try him alongwith the other accused In these circumstances therefore if the prosecution can at any stage produce evidence which satisfies the court that the other accused or those who have not been arrayed as accused against whom proceedings have been quashed have also committed the offence the <ORG> can take cognizance against them and try them along with the other accused But we would hasten to add that this is really an extraordinary power which is conferred on the <ORG> and should be used very sparingly and only if compelling reasons exist for taking cognizance against the other person against whom action has not been taken We leave the entire matter to the discretion of the court concerned so that it may act according to law For these reasons therefore we allow this appeal only to the extent that the order of <ORG> quashing the proceedings against the Manager <NAME> respondent No is hereby set aside and that of the Metropolitan Magistrate is restored
