The appellant opposed the registration on the ground that it had an exclusive proprietary interest in the trade mark Amritdhara in relation to a similar medicinal preparation which had acquired considerable repu tation since and that the respondent trade name <ORG> was likely to deceive and cause confusion and therefore the registration was prohibited by of the Trade Marks Act The Registrar of Trade Marks held that there was sufficient similarity between Amritdhar a and Lakshamandhara so as to cause confusion and it was likely to deceive the public but the acquiescence of the appellant in the use of the trade name <ORG> by the respondent in the relation to his product for a long period to the knowledge of the appellant was special circumstance under entitling the respondent to have his name registered along with the appellant trade name Both the appellant and the respondent appealed to <ORG> which allowed the respondent appeal holding that the words Amrit and dhara were common words in the Hindi language as also the words Lakshman and dhara and that there was no possibility of any Indian confusing the two ideas On July <NAME> respondent before us made an application under a of the Trade Marks Act Act of hereinafter referred to as the Act for registration of the trade name of a biochemical medicinal preparation commonly known as Laksbmandhara in Class of the Fourth Schedule to the Trade Marks Rules The application was made by the respondent as the sole proprietor of <ORG> situate at Dhankutti in Kanpur Notice of the application was given by the Registrar of Trade Marks Bombay and <ORG> a limited liability company and appellant before us filed an application in opposition It was further stated that during the long period of introduction and sale of Lakshmandhara since no objection was ever raised from any quarter from the appellant or anybody else to the use of the name Lakshmandhara It appears that apart from the affidavits filed no other evidence was led on behalf of either party but certified copies of certain decisions in earlier cases to which the respondent was not however a party given in favour of the appellant in support of its claim of infringement of its registered trade mark Amritdhara were filed Even in <ORG> the appellant successfully opposed the introduction of names which contained the word dhara as part of the trade name We are saying this because the High Court through that the Registrar did not express his own opinion whether the name Lakshmandhara was likely to cause deception to the public or confusion to the trade The respondent however relied also on two other circumstances viz The respondent contended that these two circumstances brought the case With in the meaning of special circumstances in A of the Act which permitted the registration by more than one Proprietor of trade marks which are identical or nearly resemble each other subject to such condition and limitations if any as the Registrar might think fit to impose As to acquiescence he however found in favour of the respondent and expressed his finding in these words In the case before me it is not disputed that the applicant commenced his user in a small way in and it may even be said that up to about the applicant user was insignificant Here we have a case in which Pandit <NAME> states that he had no notice of the applicant mark It seems to me that the opponents and their agents were well aware of the advertisements by the applicant and did not raise any protest till the applicant mark was advertised in <ORG> In my opinion this is acquiescence which would come under the phrase or other special circumstances in section of the Trade Marks Act and that appears to me to be fatal to the case of the opponents Before the Registrar it was admitted on behalf of the respondent that his goods were sold mainly in Uttar Pradesh and there were at the most only sporadic sales in other States The learned Judges then said There is no possibility of any Indian confusing the two ideas We therefore see no reason to disallow registration of the trade mark Lakshmandhara In view however of their finding that the two names were not likely to cause any confusion and that the respondent had been an honest concurrent user from onwards they held that there was no justification for refusing registration to the trade mark Lakshmandhara for the whole of India They accordingly allowed the appeal of the respondent and dismissed that of the appellant by their judgment dated March The appellant then obtained special leave from this Court and the present appeal has been filed in pursuance of the leave granted by this court We shall deal with these two points in the order in which we have stated them We may first read the relevant sections of the Act viz and In case of honest concurrent use or of other special circumstances which in the opinion of the Registrar make it proper so to do he may permit the registration by more than one proprietor of trade marks which are identical or nearly resemble each other in respect of the same goods or description of goods subject to such conditions and limitations if any as the Registrar may think fit to impose It will be noticed that the words used in the sections and relevant for our purpose are likely to deceive or cause confusion The Act does not lay down any criteria for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion Therefore every case must depend on its own particular facts and the value of authorities lies not so much in the actual decision as in the tests applied for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion In cases in which the tribunal considers that there is doubt as to whether deception is likely the application should be refused For deceptive resemblance two important questions are who are the persons whom the resemblance must be likely to deceive or confuse and what rules of comparison are to be As to confusion it is perhaps an appropriate description of the state of mind of a customer who on seeing a mark thinks that it differs from the mark on goods which he has previously bought but is doubtful whether that impression is Dot due to imperfect recollection Let us apply these tests to the facts of the case under our consideration Current of <NAME> in a literal sense has no meaning to give it meaning one must further make the inference that the current or stream is as pure and strong as <NAME> of the Ramayana The trade mark is the whole thing the whole word has to be considered a the case of the application to register Erectiks opposed by the proprietors of the trade mark Erector Farwell said in <ORG> Application I do not think it is right to take a part of the word and compare it with a part of the other Word one word must be considered as a whole and compared with the other word as a whole I think it is a danger ous method to adopt to divide the word up and seek to distinguish a portion of it from a portion of the other word On a consideration of all the circumstances we have come to the conclusion that the overall similarity between the two names in respect of the same description of goods was likely to cause deception or confusion within the meaning of of the Act and Registrar was right in the view he expressed If a trader allows another person who is acting in good faith to build up a reputa tion under a trade name or mark to which he has rights he may lose his right to complain and may even be debarred from himself using such name or work For these reasons we would allow the appeal set aside the Judgment and order of <ORG> and restore those of the Registrar of Trade Marks Bombay dated September
