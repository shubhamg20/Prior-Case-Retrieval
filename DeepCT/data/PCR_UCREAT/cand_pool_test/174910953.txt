They raise common questions of law for decision and they are directed against a common judgment of <ORG> The facts of the case lie within a narrow compass Thereafter the Governor of issued an ordinance known as Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Amendment and Validation Ordinance Ordinance No This ordinance was later on enacted as an Act to which we have already made reference Hence we shall refer to the provisions of the Amending Act Under the principal Act a dealer is defined in Section as dealer means any person or association of persons carrying on the business of buying or selling goods in Uttar Pradesh whether for commission remuneration or otherwise and includes any firm or <ORG> and any society club or association which sells goods to its members and also includes any department of <ORG> or <ORG> which carries on such business and any undertaking engaged in the generation or distribution of electrical energy or any other form of power Section of the Act provides for the levy of multi point tax The portion of that section which is material for our present purpose reads Subject to the provisions of this Act every dealer shall for each assessment year pay a tax at the rate of two naye paise per rupee on his turnover of such year which shall be determined in such manner as may be prescribed It provides Except as provided in Sub section there shall be levied and paid for each assessment year or part thereof a tax on the turnover to be determined in such manner as may be prescribed of first purchases made by a dealer or through a dealer acting as a purchasing agent in respect of such goods or class of goods and at such rates not exceeding two paise per rupee in the case of foodgrains including cereals and pulses and five paise per rupee in the case of other goods and with effect from such date as may from time to time be notified by <ORG> in this behalf The notification issued Under Section of the principal Act on October Notification No provided that with effect from October the turnover of purchases in respect of goods mentioned therein shall be liable to tax Under Section at the rate mentioned Foodgrains That section reads Notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary every notification issued or purporting to have been issued Under Section A or Section of the principal Act before the commencement of this Act shall be deemed to have been issued under that section as amended by this Act and shall be so interpreted and be deemed to be and always to have been as valid as if the provisions of this Act were in force at all material times and accordingly anything done or any action taken including any order made proceeding taken jurisdiction exercised assessment made or tax levied collected or paid purporting to have been done or taken in pursuance of any such notification shall be deemed to be and always to have been validly and lawfully done or taken Under the former section the tax is levied on the turnover of sales while under the latter the tax is levied on the turnover of first purchases It has been held by <ORG> in one case that tax cannot be levied separately on plain and ornamented glass bangles Under Section A and in another that tax cannot be levied separately on unsplit and split pulses Under Section because in their opinion plain glass bangles are not a commodity different from ornamented glass bangles and similarly unsplit pulses and split pulses are also not two different commodities The appellants challenged the validity of Explanation II of Section as well as Section introduced by the Amending Act before <ORG> in petitions under Article of the Constitution They further took the plea that the amendments incorporated were not effective enough to bring to tax the first purchases of split or processed foodgrains and pulses Thereafter these appeals have been brought after obtaining certificates from <ORG> The validity of the levy in question was challenged on the following grounds That no fresh levy can be imposed by a retrospective legislation That the legislature cannot in case of legislation of the nature with which we are concerned separate into independent commodities split and unsplit pulses or processed or unprocessed pulses and on that footing seek to impose tax twice over on the same commodity in respect of the goods liable to be taxed at a single point That the newly added Explanation to Section read with Section of the Amending Act amounts to an unlawful usurpation of judicial power by the legislature The newly added Explanation II to Section is violative of Article of the Constitution There is no rational basis for separating split or processed pulses from unsplit or unprocessed pulses On a true construction of Explanation II to Section no fresh charge can be held to have been imposed No levy of purchase tax can be made without a fresh Notification Under Section read with Explanation II showing therein separately foodgrains unsplit or unprocessed as well as foodgrains split or processed and That the power conferred on the <ORG> Under Section amounts to an excessive delegation of legislative power and consequently void It is well settled that subject to Constitutional restrictions a power to legislate includes a power to legislate prospectively as well as retrospectively We see no force in the second contention advanced on behalf of the appellants But the legislature has wide powers of classification in the case of taxing statutes In <NAME> case supra this Court ruled that there was no unconstitutional discrimination in the imposition of the excise duty on tobacco in the broken leaf form Therein it was observed that tobacco in the broken leaf form was capable of being used in the manufacture of bidis while tobacco in the whole leaf form could not be so used economically the two forms of tobacco were different by the test of capability of user the tariff is not based either wholly or even primarily by reference to the use of tobacco and there was a clear and unambiguous distinction between tobacco in the whole leaf form covered by item and tobacco in the broken leaf form covered by item which had a reasonable relation to the object intended by the imposition of the tariff this Court laid down the tests to find out whether there are discriminatory provisions in a taxing statute If there was equality and uniformity within each group the law could not be discriminatory though due to fortuitous circumstances in a peculiar situation some included in a class might get some advantage over others so long as they were not sought out for special treatment Although taxation laws could be no exception to this rule the courts would in view of the inherent complexity of fiscal adjustment of diverse elements permit a larger discretion to the legislature in the matter of classification so long as there was no transgression of the fundamental principles underlying the doctrine of classification In a democratic set up it is for the legislature to decide what economic or social policy it should pursue or what administrative consideration it should bear in mind But we see no substance in that contention The tax is levied on the dealer the fact that he is allowed to pass on the tax to the consumers or he is generally in a position to pass on the same to the consumer has no relevance when we consider the legislative competence this Court held that by the fiction in Section vii second proviso read with Section of the Indian Income tax Act what is really not income is for the purpose of computation of assessable income made taxable income There is therefore no question of the proviso carving out any portion out of the area covered by the main part and leaving the other part unaffected Therein this Court observed The question then arises whether the first Explanation to the section widens the scope of Sub section of Section so as to include claims by registered societies against non members even if the same are not covered by Clause In all these matters the courts have to find out the true intention of the legislature We next come to the contention that no levy of purchase tax can be made on split or unprocessed pulses without a fresh notification Under Section read with Explanation II showing therein separately foodgrains unsplit or unprocessed as well as foodgrains split or processed Therefore we were told that no tax can be levied on processed or split foodgrains on the basis of that notification The notification in question was issued Under Section Consequently while reading the expression foodgrains in the notification also we must adopt the same approach what did Section seek to achieve That section says in plain words that notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary every notification issued or purporting to have been issued Under Section of the principal Act before the commencement of the Amending Act shall be deemed to have been issued under that section as amended by the Amending Act and shall be so interpreted and be deemed to be and always to have been as valid as if the provisions of the amending Act were in force at all material times and accordingly anything done or any action taken including any order made proceedings taken jurisdiction exercised assessment made or tax levied collected or paid purporting to have been done or taken in pursuance of any such notification shall be deemed to be and always to have been validly and lawfully done or taken It was urged on behalf of the appellants that a taxing provision will have to be strictly interpreted and in finding out the intention of the legislature in the matter of imposing tax we cannot travel beyond the words of the section There is no doubt that a taxing provision has to be strictly interpreted A construction which will lead to such a result must if that is possible be avoided We have earlier come to the conclusion that because Explanation II to Section the expression foodgrains including pulses in Section should be read as including two different items i unsplit or unprocessed foodgrains including pulses and split or processed foodgrains including pulses It is true that the legislature cannot delegate its legislative functions to any other body After having done that it has given power to the executive a high authority and which is presumed to command the majority support in the legislature to select for special treatment dealings in certain class of goods We have not found any substance in any of the contentions advanced on behalf of the appellants
