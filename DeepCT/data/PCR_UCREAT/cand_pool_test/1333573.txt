There was thus no need for anyone to apply for an order for sale that he as well as the mortgagee has a right to execute the decree by applying for sale and I think we should follow those decisions <NAME> observed that an application by the decree holder to give time to the judgment debtor merely as a matter of grace would be a step in retardation In the present case the applicant though he was the decree holder was the person who had to pay and he was applying for time not as a matter of grace to a judgment debtor but in order the better to enable himself to execute the decree the execution of which would have been completed as soon as the redemption money was paid I therefore agree with my learned colleague that this Appeal should be allowed with costs in both Courts This is a matter arising in the execution of a decree for the redemption of a usufructuary mortgage in South Malabar in Govinda Menon Kombunni Mannadiar A No whether a mortgagor who obtained a decree for redemption can apply for sale when no final decree is passed under Order XXXIV Rule which enables the mortgagee only to apply for the passing of a final decree does not arise though I may add that if it arises I am inclined to follow those decisions and do not share the doubts expressed by <NAME> in the last of them that Provisions like directions for sale in default allowing time to pay moneys declared as due and so on not inconsistent with the Improvements Act and directed or allowed by the new Civil Procedure Code to be mentioned in a decree for redemption or ejectment can of course be mentioned in decrees passed in suits falling under the Compensation Act also In my opinion there is no warrant for the view that an application to take a step in aid of execution should be made in execution and no authority has been cited by the Subordinate Judge or the learned vakil for the respondent in its support
