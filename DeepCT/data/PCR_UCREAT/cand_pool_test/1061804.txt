Dismissing the petition this <ORG> HELD There is a distinction between the public and private sectors A Keeping in view the true object of the impugned enactment there is no doubt that employees of the private sector who are left out of the ambit of the impugned provi sion do not fall in the same class as employees of the public sector and the benefit of the fall out of the provi sion being available only to the public sector employees cannot render the classification invalid or arbitrary These basic postulates have to be borne in mind while determining the constitutional validity of a taxing provision challenged on the ground of discrimination There is a clear distinction between the legislative intention and the purpose or object of the legislation For determining the purpose or object of the legisla tion it is permissible to look into the circumstances which prevailed at the time when the law was passed and which necessitated the passing of that law Even though for the purpose of construing the meaning of the enacted provision it is not permissible to use these aids yet it is permissible to look into the historical facts and surrounding circumstances for ascer taining the evil sought to be remedied The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This petition under Article of the Consti tution challenges the constitutional validity of clause inserted in section of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act by the Finance Act with effect from Section deals with incomes not included in total income for the purpose of taxation under the Act The question therefore is whether there is any such hostile discrimination as alleged by the petitioners and if so is it possible to construe the provi sion in the manner suggested on behalf of the petitioners to apply it equally to all employees of the public as well as private sectors The first petitioner is an employee of second respond ent <ORG> a private sector company and the second petitioner is a registered trade union representing the employees of the second re spondent company Counsel for the first respondent supporting the validity of the provision indicated that employees of the public sector constituted a distinct class for the purpose of taxation so that there was no discrimination between employees of the same class if the real object of the provision is borne in mind We shall refer to the arguments of the two sides in some detail later Chapter III of the Indian Income Tax Act relates to incomes which do not form part of the total income Section in Chapter III deals with incomes not included in total income The several clauses in section specify different incomes which would ordinarily be included in the total income of the assessee for the purpose of taxation but for such a provision Clause of Section is as under any payment received by an employee of a public sector company at the time of his voluntary retirement in accordance with any scheme which <ORG> may having regard to the economic viability of such company and other relevant circumstances approve in this behalf <NAME> for the petitioners first contended that the reason given for enacting clause as indicated in the memorandum explaining provisions of the Finance Bill is that the tax benefit is given as a welfare measure His next conten tion is that if that be the only stated basis of the clas sification it has no rational nexus with the object of the provision and it violates Article of the Constitution On this basis it was contended that instead of striking down the provision as invalid which while denying the benefit to the public sector employees would not also serve any useful purpose for the private sector employees the court should adopt a positive and constructive approach and the provision so construed as to extend its benefit to all employees irrespective of the category of their employer to uphold its validity In reply Dr <NAME> for the first respondent contended that the employees of public sector constitute a distinct class for this purpose in view of the fact that the public sector undertakings have a distinct character and role in the national economy The Constitutional command to the State to afford equal protection of its laws sets a goal not attainable by the invention and application of a precise formula Therefore classification need not be constituted by an exact or scien tific exclusion or inclusion of persons or things The <ORG> should not insist on delusive exactness or apply doctrinaire tests for determining the validity of classifi cation in any given case The principle underlying the guarantee of Article is not that the same rules of law should be applicable to all persons within the Indian territory or that the same reme dies should be made available to them irrespective of dif ferences of circumstances It only means that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike both in privileges conferred and liabilities imposed Equal laws would have to be applied to all in the same situation and there should be no discrimination between one person and another if as regards the subject matter of the legislation their position is substantially the same It can recognise even degree of evil but the classification should never be arbitrary artificial or evasive The classification must not be arbitrary but must be rational that is to say it must not only be based on some qualities or characteristics which are to be found in all the persons grouped together and not in others who are left out but those qualities or characteristics must have a reasonable relation to the object of the legislation In order to pass the test two conditions must be fulfilled namely that the classification must be rounded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others and that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Act These basic postulates have to be borne in mind while determining the constitutional validity of a taxing provision challenged on the ground of discrimination In view of the inherent com plexity of these fiscal adjustments courts give a larger discretion to the legislature in the matter of its prefer ences of economic and social policies and effectuate the chosen system in all possible and reasonable ways one which includes all who are similarly situated and none who are not A I SC as under The scope for classification permitted in taxation is greater and unless the classification made can be termed to be palpably arbitrary it must be left to the legislative wisdom to choose the yardstick for classification in the background of the fiscal policy of the <ORG> to promote economic equality as well <NAME> I wherein a similar question relating to validity of classification in another clause of section of the In come Tax Act arose for consideration There is no dispute that the impugned provision includes all employees of the public sector and none not in the public sector There is thus a clear distinction between the two In that decision for determining the question even affidavit on behalf of the <ORG> of the circumstances which prevailed at the time when the law there under consideration had been passed and which necessitated the passing of that law was relied on Not only this to sustain the presumption of constitu tionality consideration may be had even to matters of common knowledge the history of the times and every con ceivable state of facts existing at the time of legislation which can be assumed Strong reliance has been placed on behalf of the peti tioners on the Memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill wherein the explanatory note relating to clause a of the Bill proposing insertion of clause in Section of the Income tax Act appears under the heading Welfare Measures Under the proposed amendment any payment received by an employee of a public sector company at the time of his voluntary retirement in accord ance with any scheme which <ORG> ment may having regard to This amendment will take effect from st April and will accordingly apply in relation to the assessment year and subsequent years It is mentioned in paragraph of the explanatory memorandum that a number of public sector undertakings have formulated voluntary retirement schemes for their employees that under section of the Income Tax Act any com pensation received by a workman at the time of his retrench ment is exempt upto the specified limit and that this limit of exemption under section is however not ap plicable in respect of compensation received under certain schemes approved by <ORG> Ordinarily in the memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill both the sub clauses of clause should have been therefore mentioned under the same heading being of essentially the same nature If the proposal in sub clause of clause of the Finance Bill fell in this category there is no reason why the proposal in sub clause a of the same clause of the Bill both sub clauses relat ing to amendment of section can be treated differently merely because in the explanatory memorandum the two sub clauses are under different headings We see no reason why insertion of clause in section cannot also be described as incentive for growth and modernisation being a measure for improvement of the public sector This amendment shall come into force and will accordingly apply to assessment year and subsequent year The respondent submits that there were certain basic distinctions between the undertakings in the private sector and in the public sector as has been observed by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <ORG> SCR The respondent submits that the extension of the benefit of section of the Income Tax Act to the employees of the private sector is likely to be misused by way of fre quent payment to the employees in the garb of voluntary retirement benefits and it will not be possible to provide necessary safeguards in law to check such practices emphasis supplied The counter affidavit filed on behalf of respondent No disclosing the reasons which led to the insertion of clause in section of the Act confining the benefit granted thereby only to employees of the public sector indicates that the purposes of the legislation include reduction in the existing gap between the lower compensation package in public sector and the higher compensation package of the counterpart in private sector in addition to prevent ing misuse of the benefit in private sector which is not subject to the control of administration by Government like that in the public sector There is imperative need for substantial improvement in the working and profitability of public sector undertakings First whether the present level of <ORG> borrowing is sus tainable Unless there are adequate surpluses in the revenue account which can be utilised for debt servicing the budge tary deficit would widen We cannot overlook this well known though unfortunate fact It is therefore reasonable that same benefit be also extended in respect of any payment received by an employee of the public sector on his voluntary retirement under a scheme similarly approved by <ORG> This is not an irrelevant cir cumstances to indicate that according to the general percep tion there is a distinction between the public and private sectors As far as Government undertakings and companies are concerned it has to be held that they form a class by themselves since any profit that they may make would in the end result in the benefit to the members of <ORG> We shall now refer to some other clauses of section of the Act to which reference was made at the hearing in support of the rival contentions Once the impugned provision contained in the newly inserted clause of section of the Income Tax Act is viewed in the above perspective keeping in mind the true object of the provision there is no foundation for the argument that it is either discriminatory or arbitrary There is a definite purpose for its enactment With this perspective keeping in view the true object of the impugned enactment there is no doubt that employees of the private sector who are left out of the ambit of the impugned provision do not fall in the same class as employees of the public sector and the benefit or the fall out of the provision being available only to the public sector employees cannot render the classification invalid or arbitrary The object of this differentia tion between income accruing or received from a source in the specified areas and the income accruing or received from a source outside such areas is to benefit not only the members of the Scheduled Tribes residing in the specified areas but also to benefit economically such areas This further question does not arise in view of our conclusion that there is no discrimination made out We may however mention that the Finance Bill while inserting a new clause in section of the Income tax Act simultaneously inserted a new clause A in section of the Act with effect from defining public sector company which expression has been used in the newly inserted clause of section
