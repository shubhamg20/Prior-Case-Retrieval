the Authorised officer within whose jurisdiction such land holding of the major part thereof is situated may after notice to such person and other persons affected by such transfer or partition and after such inquiry as he thinks fit to make declare tho transfer or partition to be void if he finds that the transfer or the partition as the case may be defeats any of tho provisions of the Act It was also held that transactions entered into in anticipation of the Ceiling Act would not be hit by the provisions preventing such transfers except where they were mala fide or colourable and that tho the word defeat in should be taken as having been used to import a sinister motive Looking at the words of in the light of the scheme of prohibition of transfers to preserve the surplus land for distribution there is no justification for importing into more than its words convey The trichotomy is obvious There must be a transfer or other alienation it must have taken place during the period mentioned in the section it must have the effect of defeating any of the provisions of the Act There is no rule for importing a fourth principle that the transfer should be sham nominal or bogus nor is there any additional consideration that if the transfer is bona fide for family necessity or other urgency then it is good even though it defeats the provisions of the Act The provision seeks to provide social justice for the landless and it defeats the purpose if by the interpretative process soft justice to large land holders is brought about The judiciary in its sphere shares the revolutionary purpose of the constitutional order and when called upon to decode social legislation it must be animated by the goal oriented approach the <ORG> was delivered by <NAME> The short point of law decided in the long judgment under appeal may justly be given short shrift If the statutory construction which found favour with the High <ORG> be correct the risk of reform legislation being condemned to functional futility is great and so the State has come up in appeal by Special Leave challenging the High <ORG> interpretation of of the Tamil Nadu Land Reforms Fixation of Ceiling on land Act for short the Ceiling Act The judiciary in its sphere shares the revolutionary purpose of the Constitutional order and when called upon to decode social legislation must be animated by a goal oriented approach This is part of the dynamic of statutory intretation in the developing countries so that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those who seek to defeat agrarian justice by cute transac tions of many manifestations now so similar in the country and illustrated by the several cases under appeal This caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not a mere umpire as some assume but an activist catalyst in the constitutional scheme Before embarking on any further discussion of the project of interdicting transfers as spelt out in we may read the provision Where on or after tho date of commencement of this Act but before the notified date any person has transferred any land held by him by sale gift other than gift made in contemplation of death exchange surrender settlement or in any other manner except by request or has effected a partition of his holding or part thereof the Authorised officer within whose jurisdiction such land holding of the major part thereof is situated may after notice to such person and other persons affected by such transfer on partition and after such enquiry as he thinks fit to make declare the transfer or partition to be void if he finds that the transfer or the partition as the case may be defeats any of the provisions of this Act However now it is immune to attack having been included in the Ninth Schedule and there is no challenge to its vires before us that the surplus land with each landholder is required for a public purpose The concrete question is wether has the effect of rendering such transfers invalid ipso facto or whether there is need for further proof that such transfers are sham nominal and bogus If the Legislative intention is also to invalidate all bona fide transactions during the relevant period it would have made certain consequential provisions as to what are the rights of the transferor and the transferee in relation to the property conveyed and how the resultant equities between the transferee and the transferor have to be worked out The reason partly turns on semantics and the court argue with logical support The word defeat normally means overcome thwart evade frustrate circumvent bypass disappoint prevent the accomplishment of the word defeat in Section is one to be taken as having been used to import sinister motive There is not the slightest doubt that severally and cumulatively the provisions of the Act seek to make available the maximum extent of land in excess of the ceiling to be vested in <ORG> for fulfilment of its purposes This may cause hardship to some but every cause claims martyrs The current and correct view of the interpretative process is that words must be given their literal or ordinary meaning unless there are compelling reasons recognised by canons of construction to the contrary <NAME> of <ORG> has pointed out Whenever the judges support to depart from the literal or ordinary meaning and apply the mischief rule or the golden rule there is danger that in place of those irrelevant criteria the canons of construction they have more obviously substituted their own perhaps more harmful impressions views prejudices or predispositions SCI Those who have reflected on the meaning of meaning have said that words mean nothing by themselves Looking at the words of in the light of the scheme of prohibition of transfers to preserve the surplus lands for distribution we find no justification for importing into more than its words convey It must have taken place during the period mentioned in the Section It must have the effect of defeating any of the provisions of the Act There is no room for importing a fourth principal that the transfer should be sham nominal or bogus Obviously the provision seeks to provide social justice for the landless and it defeats the purpose if by the interpretative process soft Justice to large landholders is brought about I may perhaps be forgiven for saying that it appears to me that Lord <NAME> has acceded to the appeal of <NAME> in the Merchant of Venice But <NAME> retorted It must not be there is no power in Venice Can alter a decree established It will be recorded for a precedent And many an error by the same example Will rush into the <ORG> it cannot be Therefore we allow the appeal in the light of the interpretation we have adopted restore the tribunal holding and rule that if any transfer defeats the provisions of the Act by reducing the extent of surplus land in excess of the ceiling available from any person such transaction bona fide or not is void in the matter of computation of the permissible area and the surplus area The appeals are allowed but in the light of the earlier direction of the Court the State will pay the costs of the respondent
