The plaint in that suit was subsequently amended on December By the addition of all the heirs of <NAME> as defendants who it was alleged were claiming the property as their personal property and by adding a prayer for the declaration that the property in suit was wakf property and not the personal property of the defendants On September a petition of compromise was filed in that suit on behalf of plaintiffs Nos and i The first two paragraphs of the petition were as follows That your petitioners have on consideration of all the circumstances and facts as disclosed in the evidence produced in the case and which the parties may produce on their behalf have decided that it would be to their best interest and in the interest of public for whose benefit the plaintiffs brought this suit to compromise the suit on the following terms and conditions That out of the disputed property the portions shown in the plan herewith tiled and marked A measuring bigha cotta cbhattaks sq My previous order of September refers to a petition filed on behalf of ten defendants They entertained considerable doubt as to the maintainability of such a suit as this without the sanction of the Advocate General under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure having regard to Sub section which has been added to the corresponding Section of the Code of Civil Procedure but they considered it unnecessary to decide the point as they were of opinion that the plaintiffs were bound by the rule of res judicata and the suit should be dismissed on that ground It is urged broadly on behalf of the respondents that all Buits founded upon any breach of trust for public purposes of a charitable or religious nature irrespective of the relief sought must be brought in accordance with the provisions of Section Civil Procedure Code If it had so intended it would have said so in express words whereas it said on the contrary that only suits claiming any of the reliefs specified in Sub section shall be instituted in conformity with the provisions of Section Sub section The reliefs specified in Sub section a to do not cover any of the reliefs claimed in this suit unless the words further or other relief in Clause can be held to cover them It is a sound rule of interpretation to take the words of a statute as they stand and to interpret them ordinarily without any reference to the previous state of the law on the subject or the English law upon which it may hi founded but when it is contended that the <ORG> intended by any particular amendment to make substantial changes in the pre existing law it ie impossible to arrive at a conclusion without considering what the law was previously to the particular enactment and to see whether the words used in the statute can be taken to effect the change that is suggested as intended The <ORG> in adopt the former view and inserted Clause a expressly giving power to remove a trustee in addition to the power to appoint new trustees now Clause Such rights when claimed on behalf of the public or any section thereof had been held to be capable of enforcement by a suit under Section of those Codes now replaced by Order I Rule and it had also been held that private persons who had individual rights under such trusts could bring suits to enforce such individual rights by an ordinary suit without being obliged to bring a suit of a representative nature as above mentioned Their Lordships see no reason to consider that Section was intended to enlarge tho scope of Section by the addition of any relief or remedy against third parties i strangers to the trust The only other question is whether the suit is barred by the rule of res judicata i whether the compromise decree of September in Suit No of precludes the present from bringing this suit it is said that the previous Suit No of was instituted under the provisions of Section with the sanction of the Advocate General and therefore became a representative suit and the decree in that suit whether by adjudication of the <ORG> or by consent of parties is binding upon that section of the public which was represented by the plaintiffs that suit and therefore upon the plaintiffs in the present suit by virtue of Explanation of Section of the Code The learned Judges of <ORG> were of opinion that the consent decree of could not be questioned on the grounds stated by the Subordinate Judge as there was no want of jurisdiction of the Judge to entertain the suit or to order the amendment as prayed for or to direct a decree to be made on compromise of the suit It is extremely doubtful whether a decree passed under the circumstances of this case can be held to be res judicata as against any persons other than those who consented to that decree was based on Scottish law and as explained in the case of In re South American and Mexican Company Ex part Bank of England Ch appears to lay down broadly that persons instituting a suit on behalf of the public have no right to bind the public by a compromise decree though a decree passed against them on contest would bind the public by adding strangers to the trust as defendants and by prayers for relief not covered by Section the suit ceased to be one of a representative character and the decree based on the compromise such as it was viz
