of the Constitution challenging the constitutionality the said provisions on the grounds that they were ultra vires the <ORG> under Entry of the Federal Legislative List of the Government of India Act and that they contravened the provisions of Arts Thus interpreted there could be no doubt that Entry of the Federal Legis lative List must cover such legislation as the impugned provision intended to prevent the evasion of tax of the Constitution as held by this Court were that the classification must be founded on an intelligent differentia and that the differentia must be reasonably connected with the object of the legislation So judged it could not be said that the differentia on which the impugned provision founded its classification had no rational relation to its object namely the prevention of the evasion of tax It was not appropriate to apply American decisions dealing with evasion of taxes to similar cases in India where the conditions were entirely different Since the <ORG> cognisant of the widespread evasion of taxes in this country enacted the law for its prevention it would not be proper for this court in the absence of counterbalancing circumstances to hold on the analogy of American decisions that there was no need for such legislation of the Constitution raises the question of the constitutional validity of a i of the Indian Income tax Act Act XI of hereinafter called the Act On the basis of the partnership deed in respect of the assessment year the petitioner filed two applications before the Income tax Officer <NAME> one under A of the Act for recognizing the partition and the other under A for registration of the firm The disparity arose because while the assessee excluded from his total income the income of the partnership falling to the shares of his wife and three minor sons the Income tax Officer included the share income of his wife and three minor sons in the said bussiness in the total income of the petitioner The petitioner by the present petition challenges the constitutional validity of a i and ii of the Act and prays for a declaration that the said provisions are ultra vires the Constitution and for the issue of a writ of certiorari quashing the assessment order dated March and for the issue of a writ of prohibition restraining the respondents from including the share income of his wife and minor children from the partnership firm in his total income and taxing the same in his hands a distinction between the taxability of the income and the machinery for its collection and contend that though the income of the wife and the minor sons was only taxable there was nothing illegal in imposing the immediate incidence on the father as there was sufficient intimate nexus between the individual his wife and minor sons doing business in partnership leaving the ultimate liability inter se to be settled between themselves The short question therefore is whether a and ii is a provision made by the <ORG> to prevent evasion of tax The constitutional validity of the said provision was next questioned on the ground that it violated the doctrine of equality before the law enshrined in Art The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India But decisions of this Court permitted classification if there was reasonable basis for the differentiation Two conditions were laid down for passing the test of permissible classification namely i the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and ii that the differentia must have rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question if he carries on business in partnership with his wife or if he admits his minor sons to the benefits of the partnership whereas an individual if he carries on business in partnership with a third party whether a man or a woman or even with his major children or if he and his or children carry on business separately will be liable only to pay tax on his share of the partnership income that is for the purpose of this subsection the former is put in a category different from the latter It cannot be said that there is no differentia between the two groups but what is contended is that the said differentia has no rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question It was asked how from the standpoint of imposition of tax the difference between an individual and his wife doing business in partnership and between an individual and his wife doing business separately and an individual doing business hi partnership with his wife and an individual doing business in partnership with a third party male or female and between an individual who has admitted his minor children to the partnership business and an individual who is doing business in partnership with his major children or outsiders would have any reasonable basis It was then said that there might be genuine partnerships between an individual and his wife and therefore there is no reasonable relation between the classification and the object sought to be achieved at any rate to the extent of those genuine cases The learned Judge observed thus We have no doubt that because of the fundamental conceptions which underlie our system any attempt by a state to measure the tax on one person property or income by reference to the property or income of another is contrary to due process of law as guaran teed by the th Amendment There there was no question of any partnership between husband and wife and the income of the wife was added to that of the husband with the result that he had to pay not only increased rate on his income but also a portion of the tax otherwise payable by wife in the present case the impugned provisions do not impose any such general liability but confine it only to a case where the husband takes his wife in partnership There is a greater scope for fraudulent evasion by constituting fictitious With respect we give our full assent to the said observations We therefore reject this contention All citizens shall have the right to acquire hold and dispose of property and I It was argued that as the husband is statutorily made to pay certain amount as tax on the income of his wife to that extent he is deprived of his property by the State action and therefore his fundamental right under is infringed We cannot see any justification for this contention in any of the constitutional provisions In this Article unless the context other wise requires a law includes any Ordinance order bye law rule regulation notification custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law law in force includes laws passed or made by a <ORG> or other competent authority in the territory of India before the commencement of this Constitution and not previously repealed notwithstanding that any such law or any part thereof may not be then in operation either at all or in particular areas It cannot be denied that a law providing for levy and collection of taxes is a law within the meaning of Part III of the Constitution and therefore it must stand the test laid down by Art The same principle must necessarily apply even in a case where the law imposing a tax is void as offending the fundamental rights under the Constitution We cannot therefore accept broad contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General that a tax law cannot be questioned on the ground that it infringes Art Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that the restrictions are not reasonable for the following reasons the husband is made to pay tax on the income which his wife derived from the business that is a tax is levied on one person on the income of another such an imposition not only prevents a husband from taking his wife as a partner in his business but also prevents a wife who has got a business of her own from taking her husband as a partner in the business the husband has to pay a tax at a rate higher than that he would have to pay if the income of the wife was not added to his income the same situation is created inter se between a parent and his minor children vis a vis their joint business Learned counsel therefore contended that the provisions prevented the honest pooling of resources of the members of a family so intimately connected with each other to the detriment of the family prosperity and that it amounted to an unreasonable restriction on the said fundamental rights There is some plausibility in this argument but if an overall picture of the situation is taken the reasonableness of the restrictions will be apparent It is true that in computing the total income of an individual for the purpose of assessment their income in their capacity as partners shall be included in the income of the individual but the section doer not prevent the husband or the father as the case may be from debiting against them in the partnership accounts that part of the tax referable to the share or shares of their income In these circumstances we cannot say that the provisions of of the Act impose an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental rights of the petitioner under Art
