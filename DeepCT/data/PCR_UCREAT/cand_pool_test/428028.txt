The short question that falls for our consideration in this reference whether the bound and commission paid by the assessee to its employed during the accounting year ending on March is covered by the expression benefit or amenity or perquisite used in iii of the Act and therefore can be disallowed as a revenue expense under the Act The assessee is a private limited company carrying on business in dyes and chemicals Some of the employees were also paid commission and bound There was no written agreement for the payment of the bonus or commission and the percentage of commission paid to the employees varied from year to year and from employee to employee In the course of the assessment proceedings for the assessment year the relevant previous year being the year ending on March the <ORG> called for the details of the salary dearness allowance bound and commission paid to the employees who has been paid in all more than Rs Thereafter the department applied to the <ORG> for making a reference to this court and by its order dated the November the <ORG> referred the following question of law Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and on a proper interpretation of section iii of the Income tax Act the sum of Rs When the Finance Act for the first time added the said cl iii to which came into effect from April it ran as follows iii any expenditure which results directly or indirectly in the provision of any remuneration or benefit or amenity to an employee who is a citizen of India to the extent such expenditure exceeds the amount calculated at the rate of five thousand rupees per months for any period of his employment after the day of February Provided that in computing the aforesaid expenditure any payment by way of gratuity or any sums comprised in the transferred balance of an employee participating in a recognised provident fund referred to in clause vii of sub section of section or the amount of any compensation referred to in clause i or any payment referred to in clause ii of sub section of that section shall not be taken into account The said sub clause was substituted by the following sub clause by the Finance Act with effect from April iii any expenditure incurred after the day of February which results directly or indirectly in the provision of any benefit or amenity or perquisite whether convertible into money or not to an employee including any sum paid by the company in respect of any obligation which but for such payment would have been payable by such employee to the extent such expenditure exceeds one fifth of the amount of salary payable to the employee for any period of his employment after the aforesaid date Provided that in computing the aforesaid expenditure any payment by way of gratuity of the value of any travel concession or assistance referred to in clause of section or passage moneys or the value of any free or concessional passage referred to in sub clause i or any payment of tax referred to in sub clause vii of clause of that section or any sum referred to in clause vii of sub section of section or in clause of sub section of that section or the amount of any compensation referred to in clause i or any payment referred to in clause ii of sub section of that section or any payment referred to in clause iv or clause or any expenditure referred to in clause ix of sub section of section shall not be taken into account Provided further that nothing in this sub clause shall apply to any expenditure which results directly or indirectly in the provision of any benefit or amenity or perquisite to an employee whose income chargeable under the head Salaries is seven thousand five hundred rupees or less This court has taken this view of the said provisions consistently so far and it also appears that <ORG> has upheld the said view We may also point out that at least two other <ORG> have taken a similar view of the said provisions We are therefore of the view that the finding recorded by the <ORG> that the amount paid by way of bonus and commission to the employees was not covered by the provisions of sub cl In the circumstances we answer the question as follows That the said amount would be deductible since it is not covered by the provisions of iii of the Act
