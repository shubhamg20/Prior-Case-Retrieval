In a careful judgment in which he set out the history of these institutions Mr <NAME> then Subordinate Judge of Tanjore came to the conclusion that the Government had no right to resume or in any way interfere with the management of the temples after granting them in favour of <NAME> that they devolved as impartible property and that by the <ORG> grant restoring them <NAME> acquired heritable interestes in the properties There was an appeal to <ORG> which was heard by <NAME> and <NAME> JJ Those learned Judges dismissed the appeal holding that the estate taken by the Senior <NAME> was in the nature of self acquired property in her hands in the sense that her rights were derivative from Government and had no relation to inheritance on the death of the <NAME> The former brought No of in which they claimed the right to be declared entitled to the possession and management of the devasthanams and their endowments and also to share in the immoveable and moveable properties purchased by the widows of the late <NAME> which became accumulations and accretions to the private estate of the <NAME> to which they claimed to succeed either as his heirs or as heirs to the widows who acquired these properties as stridhanam The learned Subordinate Judge in disposing of these and other properties of the <NAME> held that the acquisitions of the various <NAME> having been purchased in their own names became their separate estates and as regards the devasthanam properties he held that the Government grant was to <NAME> by name as a single individual or sole trustee and that the endowments were therefore not capable of being made the subject of partition but would pass to the head of the family for the time being that individual at the time of suit being the st defendant and he accordingly dismissed the suit from which there was an appeal to <ORG> in <NAME>ramaswamiar Meru swamiar ILR MLJ PC it was made clear that the son of a legally married wife is a preferable heir to impartible property over the son of a sword wife or concubine where it was observed that if there are no emoluments attached to an office of trustee there was no reason to partition the property amongst junior members were also cited where <NAME> observed that the usage and custom in respect of religious trusteeships which were hereditary in a family was generally that the office could be divided by getting the duties discharged in rotation by each member of the family and that the exceptions to that rule would only be a few cases in which the hereditary office may be descendible only to a single heir was a case of family partition among Chetties of Sivaganga <ORG> confirmed the decree of <ORG> which provided for each member of the family taking one turn of management in succession the grounds of their Lordships decision being that there was an unbroken usage evidencing a family arrangement in this particular family and that that arrangement should hold good until altered by the <ORG> or superseded by a new scheme From the history of the case it appears that these kattalais were managed for some years by <ORG> and that they restored the management and the enjoyment of the lands to two members of the family representing the senior and the junior branches In this view the Subordinate Judge was right in recognising the st defendant as being the lawful trustee who should manage these properties for his lifetime in his capacity of head of the family and I consider that the appeal should be dismissed so far as these properties are concerned Whether the after purchases form accretions to the corpus of a deceased husband estate or stridhanam of the widow depends upon her intention which has to be gathered in every case from her manner of dealing with the property vide Issri Dutt Koer <NAME> ILR PC I am not satisfied that there are sufficient grounds to reconsider that statement of the law as it now stands The reason for giving an illegitimate son a half share of what a legitimate son of a <NAME> gets is morally justifiable on the ground that he has a legal right to be maintained by his putative father but there is no legal obligation to maintain illegitimate children of collaterals The costs of appellants and respondents and so far as the appeal relates to the <NAME> estate will be payable out of the income of the <NAME> estate as it was necessary to have the question of devolution of the trust finally settled but the appeal so far as accretions and accumulations are concerned is dismissed with costs of respondents and The plaintiffs sued for the trusteeship and possession of the devasthanam properties and for the recovery of possession of the stridhanatn properties left by the widows on the ground that they and the rd and th defendants are the sons of the sword wives of the late <ORG>ah and for a declaration that the st and nd defendants have no rights as the adoption of their father is invalid that the alienations by the widows in favour of the other defendants are invalid beyond the lifetime of the widows and that the plaintiffs as heirs are entitled to succeed The contesting defendants denied that the plaintiffs and the rd and th defendants have any right as the sons of sword wives to the devasthanam and other properties and stated that the alienations by the widows could not be questioned or set aside by the plaintiffs As regards the devasthanam properties he held that the grant by the <ORG> was to a single individual or sole trustee and there can be no claim for participation He dismissed the plaintiffs suit and hence the appeal The nd defendant filed a memorandum of objections against that portion of the decree which declared that the st defendant was entitled to be the sole trustee We also held that the adoption of the father of the st and nd defendants was valid and that the st and nd defendants as the adopted sons of the late <NAME> were entitled to inherit his properties and we ordered a partition of the private properties between the legitimate and the illegitimate branches The questions which arise for determination in this appeal are Whether under the terms of the grant by the Government the trusteeship of the devasthanam properties vests in all the heirs of <NAME> the last Ruler of Tanjore like ordinary partible property and has to be managed by turns by each of such branches or whether it vests in the senior male member of the eldest branch of the family for the time being whether the properties acquired by the widows of the late <NAME> were accretions to the estate and consequently divisible between such persons as would be entitled to a partition of the estate or whether they were the stridhanam properties of the widows who made the acquisitions and are descendible to the stridhana heirs and if the properties are stridhanam properties whether the plaintiffs and the rd and th defendants would be entitled to a share She petitioned the <ORG> for the restoration to her of the devasthanam and other trust properties and the <ORG> by their order dated the th of March put her in possession of such properties Against this judgment there was an appeal filed to <ORG> which is reported in <NAME> <NAME> ILR MLJ As however there were disputes between <NAME> on the one side and <NAME> on the other this proposal was not given effect to In cases of religious institutions the main question to be considered is what was the usage of the institutions and where from the date of the foundation of these charities up to the date of the present suit the trust was managed by a single individual who was the head of the family not in possession of any partible property I think it would require very strong evidence to show that there is anything in the grant by <ORG> which introduced a new course of devolution and would make it subject to all the incidents of a trusteeship held by a member of a joint and undivided family As I said before there is nothing in the grant of which either expressly or by implication changed the usage of these institutions They formed part of <ORG> and the <NAME> for the time being was the trustee As regards the private properties which were restored by the order of there are express words which make the grant subject to the ordinary <ORG> applicable to partible properties and the properties were to descend according to <ORG> There are no such words in the grant of the devasthanam properties to <NAME> It was of course open to the <ORG> to destroy that character and to grant the office on such terms as to succession as it thought fit It was then granted to the younger member of the family of the deposed <NAME> the Sivaganga Zamindari which was originally impartible was confiscated by the <ORG> and re granted and it was held by their Lordships of <ORG> that the regrant did not make the estate partible in the course of their judgment observe Except in the few cases in which the hereditary office may be descendible only to a single heir the usage and custom generally is that along with other properties the office also is divided in the sense that the office is agreed to be held and the duties thereof discharged in rotation by each member or branch of the family the duration of their turns being in proportion to their shares in the family property They think the unbroken usage for a period of nineteen years is as against the appellant conclusive evidence of a family arrangement to which the <ORG> is bound to give effect It is on this sole ground that they held that there was nothing improper in the arrangement The practice of many generations of the parties must be considered in settling the questions of impartibility and that practice is in this case against partition with one single exception of what took place in Where impartibility and management by a single individual who was the eldest member of the eldest branch of the family has been the rule from the foundation of the trust till the date of the present suit I find nothing either in <NAME> Murugappa Chetty ILR MLJ which compels us to hold that the office should be treated as partible property and that on partition of the other properties of the family this office should be held by turns I think the proper rule in such cases is to see whether there is any deed constituting the trust and regulating the course of devolution of the trust If there is such a document then the devolution will of course be regulated by the terms of the document constituting the trust If there is no such document the <ORG> has to see what was the usage of the institution and to give effect to such usage Where there is no uniform course of conduct the interests of the institution should be the first consideration There is no principle on which the office can be confined to the st and nd defendants to the exclusion of the <ORG> branch have in my judgment in the suit relating to the private properties of the late <NAME> given my reasons for holding that the estate was not strictly a Hindu widow estate but that the grant by the Government was on terms which were analogous to it The widows had their own properties and had also jewels and there is nothing to show that the properties now claimed were acquired with the income of the estate left by their husbands and not with the savings from their pensions or dealings with their own stridhanam properties There is no evidence that the acquisitions by the <NAME>s were treated as part of their husbands estate or mixed up with it but on the contrary we find that the <NAME>s were anxious to dispose of the properties which they had acquired So far as this Presidency is concerned the authorities are to the effect that there is no presumption that property acquired by a Hindu widow out of funds which were at her absolute disposal would form part of her husband estate their Lordships of <ORG> observe Their Lordships think the answer to this is that a widow may so deal with the income of her husband estate as to make it an accretion to the corpus But at the outside it is a presumption and it is a question of fact to be determined if there is any dispute whether a widow has or has not so dealt with her property There is an observation of their Lordships at page to the following effect Now there can their Lordships think be no doubt that whatever <NAME> she possessed was due to the accumulated savings from the income of the property which she received from her husband estate and though it is true that when that property had been received it would be possible for her so to deal with it that it would remain her own yet it must be traced and shown to have been so dealt with and in this case there is no sufficient evidence of this having been done Without examining the precise result of the decisions it is sufficient to say that in this case there is no room for any such presumption for the corpus of the estate never came to the widow but was taken away by <NAME> under the will and the income to which the widow succeeded was separated from it and became and was dealt with as an entirely separate fund I think the result of the authorities may be summed up as follows A Hindu widow has an absolute right of disposal over the income of the property which she inherits from her husband Where however a widow is not in possession of her husband estate there is no presumption that any of the properties which she gets are to be treated as accretions to her husband estate nor can an intention be inferred that she wants to treat them as part of her husband estate The claim to item by the present plaintiffs is therefore clearly barred by limitation even assuming that the plaintiffs are her heirs As regards the properties of jijamba Bai Saheba the last Rani she has left a will disposing of her properties and it follows that the plaintiffs can have no claim she in my opinion having had full disposing power over the savings from her husband estate her pension and her own stridhanam jewels It is now settled law that there is no distinction as to the nature of the estate taken between property inherited by a woman from a male and property inherited from a female But there is a long catena of cases beginning with <NAME> <NAME> Marshall Reports I agree to the order as to costs proposed by my learned brother Order In modification of our original order we direct that the st respondent do get his costs of the memorandum of objections out of the devasthanam estate and the second respondent will bear his own costs in his memorandum of objections
