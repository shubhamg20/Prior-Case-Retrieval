The appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging the competence of the State legislature to levy cess on royalty A learned Single Judge dismissed the writ petition holding that the cess levied under section of the Madras panchayats Act was a tax on land and as such fell under Entry of the State List of Schedule VII of the Constitution Before this <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the levy of cess on royalty in this case was nothing but a tax on royalty and was therefore ultra vires the State legislature It was further submitted that the cess having been realised on the basis of the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case if at all the <ORG> shall declare the said cess on royalty to be ultra vires prospectively per <NAME> <ORG>s of law are enjoined to gather the meaning of the Constitution from the language used and although one should interpret the words of the Constitution on the same principles of interpretation as one applied to an ordinary law but these very principles of interpretation compel one to take into account the nature and scope of the Act which requires interpretation A Constitution must not be construed in any narrow or pedantic sense and construction most beneficial to the widest possible amplitude of its powers must be adopted A broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret the Constitution but they are not free to stretch or pervert the language of the enactment in the interest of any legal or constitutional theory or even for the purposes of supplying omissions or correcting supposed errors The power to legislate is given by Article and other articles of the Constitution It is well settled that widest amplitude should be given to the language of these entries but some of these entries in different lists or in the same list may overlap and sometimes may also appear to be in direct conflict with each other There is a clear distinction between tax directly on land and tax on income arising from land Royalty which is indirectly connected with land cannot be said to be a tax directly on land as a unit The Act does not use dead rent as a basis on which land is to be valued The amounts of cess have been collected on the basis of the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case A When the <ORG> included royalty it went beyond its jurisdiction under Entry of List II and there fore clearly is without the authority of law Even if the lands where mines are situated and which are subject to licence and mining leases even for those lands there is a charge on the basis of the surface of the land which is Sometimes described as surface rent or sometimes also as dead rent This is the common question which falls for consideration and requires determination in these appeals and petitions a learned Single Judge of <ORG> Justice <NAME> dismissed the writ petition holding that the cess levied under of the act is a tax on land and as such falls under Entry of the State List of the Schedule VII of the Constitution and was within the competence of the State legislature In regard to of the Act the learned Single Judge held that the maximum limit had been prescribed by the <ORG> by rules flamed under the Act and therefore there was no arbitrariness about the levy In this section and in section land revenue means public revenue due on land and includes water cess payable to the Government for water supplied or used for the irrigation of land royalty lease amount or other sum payable to the Government in respect of land held direct from the Government on lease or licence but does not include any other cess or the sur charge payable under section provided that land revenue remitted shall not be deemed to be land revenue payable for the purpose of this section Sub section of of the Act provides that the local cess shall be deemed to be public revenue due on all the lands in respect of which a person is liable to pay local cess and all the said lands the buildings upon the said lands and their products shall be regarded as the security for the local cess Every panchayat union council may levy on every person liable to pay land revenue to the Government in respect of any land in the panchayat union a local cess surcharge at such rate as may be considered suitable as an addition to the local cess levied in the panchayat development block under section provided that the rate of local cess surcharge so levied shall not exceed two rupees and fifty paise on every rupee of land revenue payable in respect of such land There was an appeal from the said decision of the learned Single Judge to the division bench of <ORG> As mentioned hereinbefore there is an obligation of the lessee to pay rent and other charges mentioned in the said Clause and all other <ORG> dues except demands for land revenue The question therefore which arises is is cess on royalty a demand of land revenue or additional royalty For the appellants and or petitioners we have heard Mr <NAME> Dr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> and for the interven ers <NAME> <NAME> and Ms We have had the advantage of the submissions made by learned Attorney General on behalf of <ORG> The question involved in the appeals and the writ petition is about the constitutional validity of Section of the Act in so far as it sought to levy as local cess naya paise on every rupee of the land revenue payable to the <ORG> the meaning of land revenue being artificially expanded by the explana tion so as to include royalty payable under the mining lease In this connection it may be appropriate to refer to the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the amendment which stated inter alia as follows Under the Explanation to section of the Act land revenue means public revenue due on land and includes water cess payable to the <ORG> for water supplied or used for the irrigation of land but does not include any other cess or surcharge payable under section The Explanation does not cover royal ties lease amount or other sum payable to the <ORG> in respect of land held direct from the <ORG> on lease or licence which were included in the definition of land revenue under the Madras District Boards Act of the Act declares that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the develop ment of the minerals to the extent provided in the Act The holder of a mining lease granted before the commencement of this Act shall notwithstanding anything contained in the instrument of lease or in any law in force at such commencement pay royalty in respect of any mineral removed or consumed by him or by his agent manager employee contractor or sub lessee from the leased area after such commencement at the rate for the time being specified in the Second Schedule in respect of that mineral The holder of a mining lease granted on or after the commencement of this Act shall pay royalty in respect of any mineral removed or consumed by him or by his agent manager employee contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rate for the time being specified in the Second Schedule in respect of that mineral amend the Second Schedule so as to enhance or reduce the rate at which royalty shall be payable in respect of any mineral with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification Provided that <ORG> shall not enhance the rate of royalty in respect of any mineral more than once during any period of three years The Act was passed by virtue of the power of the <ORG> under Entry of list I of the th Schedule Courts of law are enjoined to gather the meaning of the Constitution from the language used and although one should interpret the words of the Constitution on the same princi ples of interpretation as one applies to an ordinary law but these very principles of interpretation compel one to take into account the nature and scope of the Act which requires interpretation The learned Chief Justice empha sised that a broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty it is to interpret the Constitution but they are not free to stretch or pervert the language of the enactment in the interest of any legal or constitutional theory or even for the purposes of supplying omissions or correcting supposed errors It is well settled that widest amplitude should be given to the language of these entries but some of these entries in different lists or in the same list may overlap and sometimes may also appear to be in direct conflict with each other None of the three lists of the th Schedule of the Constitution permits or authorises a State to impose tax on royalty Entry deals with land revenue which is a well known concept and has existed in India before the Constitution came into force There was an appeal from the said decision of <ORG> and this Court dismissed the appeal in State of A <NAME> Ors It was contended on behalf of the appellants that the impugned measure being a tax not on share of the produce of the land but on royalty royalty being the return received from the produce of the land revenue was payable for winning minerals from the land It has however to be borne in mind that Explana tion to Section was added and there was an amendment as we have noted before It is therefore recognised by the very force of that Explanation and the amendment thereto that the expression royalty in sections of the Act cannot mean land revenue properly called or conventionally known which is separate and dis tinct from royalty It was also contended on behalf of the respondent State of Tamil Nadu of Mr <NAME> that it could also be justified under Entry of List II of the th Schedule as taxes on lands and buildings Hence since the impugned Act imposed tax on land and build ing which was within the competence of <ORG> and its validity was beyond challenge but the <ORG> observed that as there was Entry in List which refers to taxes on agricultural income it is clear that agricultural income is not included in Entry But since it was not a tax on land and there is no Entry like Entry in the instant situation like the posi tion before this <ORG> in the aforesaid decision enabling the State to impose tax on royalty in the instant situation the State was incompetent to impose such a tax There is a clear distinction between tax directly on land and tax on income arising from land SCR this <ORG> had occasion to consider this and upheld the validity of the Wealth Tax Act on the ground that it fell within Entry of List I and not Entry of List II SCR at this Court reiterated the principles laid down in <NAME> case supra and held that entry of list II was confined to a tax that was directly on land as a unit Mr <NAME> is right that royalty which is indirectly connected with land cannot be said to be a tax directly on land as a unit If there is no show there is no tax It may be mentioned that the Act does not use dead rent as a basis on which land is to be valued Entry of List II deals with regulation of mines and mineral development subject to the provisions of list I with respect to regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> and entry in list I deals with regulation of mines and minerals under the control of <ORG> declared by the <ORG> by law to be expedient in public interest It was further argued that even in pith and substance the tax fell to entry of list II it would be controlled by a legislation under entry of list I On the other hand learned Attorney General submitted that if it be held to be a fee then the source of power of the state legislature is under entry read with entry of list II Here also the extent to which regulation of mines and mineral development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest to the extent such legislation makes provi sions will denude <ORG> of its power to override the provision under entry of list II declares that it is expedient in the public interest that <ORG> should take under its control the regu lation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent provided therein Our attention was drawn to the decision of the division bench judgment of <ORG> in There speaking for the court one of us <NAME> of <ORG> as the learned Chief Justice then was observed that a combined reading of entries and in list II and entry of list I establishes that as long as the <ORG> does not make any law in exercise of its power under entry the powers of the State Legisla ture in entries would be exercisable by <ORG> But when once the <ORG> makes a declara tion by law that it is expedient in the public interest to make regulation of mines and minerals development under the control of the <ORG> to the extent to which such regulation and development is undertaken by the law made by the Parlia ment the power of <ORG> under entries of List II are denuded Thus it was held that it could not therefore be said that even after passing of the Central Act the state legislature by enacting of the Act intended to confer power on <ORG> to levy tax on the mining activities carried on by the persons holding mineral concessions Mr <NAME> however referred to the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra There under the terms of a mining lease the lessee worked the mines and won iron ores in a tract of land in a village in Chittor district and bound himself to pay a dead rent if he used the leased land for the extraction of iron ore to pay a royalty on iron ore if it were used for extraction of iron and in addition to pay a surface rent in respect of the surface area occupied or used No doubt in a sense but in a very remote sense it has relationship to mining as also to the mineral won from the mine under a contract by which royalty is payable on the quantity of mineral extracted But that does not stamp it as a tax on either the extraction of the mineral or on the miner al right It is unnecessary for the purpose of this case to examine the question as to what exactly is a tax on mineral rights seeing that such a tax is not leviable by <ORG> but only by the <ORG> and the sole limitation on the <ORG> power to levy the tax is that it must not interfere with a law made by Parlia ment as regards mineral development Our attention was not invited to the provision of any such law created by <ORG> It seems therefore that attention of the <ORG> was not invited to the provisions of Mines and Minerals Development Regulation Act and thereof of the Act in terms states that royalties payable under the nd Sched ule of the Act shall not be enhanced more than once during a period of years In the premises it cannot be right to say that tax on royalty can be a tax on land and even if it is a tax if it falls within entry will be ultra vires the State legislature power in view of of the Central Act Mr <NAME> also further sought to urge that in entry of list II there is no limitation to the taxing power of the <ORG> Mr <NAME> further submitted that the Directive Principle of <ORG> Policy embodied in the Consti tution enjoined that the <ORG> should take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with power and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self Government and as the amounts have been realised on that basis if at all we should declare the said cess on royalty to be ultra vires prospectively In other words the amounts that have been collected by virtue of the said provisions should not be declared to be illegal retrospec tively and the <ORG> made liable to refund the same We see good deal of substance in this submission After all there was a decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and amounts have been collected on the basis that the said decision was the correct position In that view of the matter the appeals must therefore be allowed and the writ petitions also succeed to the extent indicated above <NAME> <NAME> While I agree with the conclusions reached by my learned brother Hon <NAME> <NAME> I have my own reasons for the same The entries which are relevant for the purpose of deter mining this questions are Entry List I reads Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Entry List II reads Taxes on mineral rights subject to any limi tations imposed by <ORG> by law relating to mineral development It was therefore contended on behalf of the <ORG> that in fact what is imposed under Section is not a cess on the mining rights or on royality but is a tax on land which clearly falls within the authority of the <ORG> legislature in Entry of List II Section of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act reads The holder of a mining lease granted before the commencement of this Act shall notwithstanding anything contained in the instrument of lease or in any law in force at such commencement pay royalty in respect of any mineral removed or consumed by him or by his gent manager employee contractor or sub lessee from the leased area after such commencement at the rate for the time being specified in the Second Schedule in respect of that mineral The holder of a mining lease granted on or after the commencement of this Act shall pay royalty in respect of any mineral removed or consumed by him or by his agent manager employee contractor or sub lessee from the leased area at the rate for the time being specified in the Second Schedule in respect of that mineral <ORG> may by notifica tion in the Official Gazette amend the Second Schedule so as to enhance or reduce the rate at which royalty shall be payable in respect of any mineral with effect from such date as may be specified in the notification It is clear that by this Act alongwith Schedule limits on royality has been fixed and the authority has been given to <ORG> alone to vary it and that too not more than once in a period of three years Explanation In this Section and in section land revenue means public revenue due on land and includes water cess payable to the Government for water supplied or used for the irrigation of land royalty lease amount for other sum payable to the Government in respect of land held direct from the Government on lease or licence but does not include any other cess or the surcharge payable under Section provided that land revenue remitted shall not be deemed to be land revenue for the purpose of this Section The local cess payable under this Sub section shall be deemed to be public revenue due on the lands in respect of which a person is liable to pay local cess and all the said lands the buildings upon the said lands and their products shall be regarded as the security for the local cess The provisions of the Madras Revenue Recovery Act Madras Act II of shall apply to the payment and recovery of the local cess payable under this Act just as they apply to the payment and recovery of the revenue upon the lands in respect of which the local cess under this act is payable Sub clause I provides for levy of naye paise for every rupee of land revenue payable to the <ORG> in the explanation a fiction is created thereby even the royalty payable have been included within the definition of land revenue This phraseology has been incorporated by an amendment in by the Madras Village Panchayat Amendment Act Section wherein the explanation to Section was substituted and substituted retrospectively wherein this royalty has also been included in the definition of land revenue and it is on this ground that it was mainly con tended that land revenue being a tax on land is within the authority of <ORG> under Item of List II and therefore the cess which is a tax on land revenue itself or an imposition on the land revenue and hence could not be anything else but a tax falling within the ambit of tax on land as provided by entry List II and it was therefore contended that it would not fall within the ambit of entry List II as if it falls within the ambit of entry of List II it would be beyond the authority of the State legislature as by passing Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act the <ORG> has denuded <ORG> of its authority to levy any tax on mining rights It is no doubt true that mineral is extracted from the land and is available but it could only be extracted if there are three things Land from which mineral could be extracted This cess levied under Section of the Madras Village Panchayat Act is levied for purposes indicat ed in the scheme of the Act and it was intended to be levied on all the lands falling within the area but as this cess on royalty is without the authority the result will be that the cess is levied so far as lands other than the lands in which mines are situated are concerned but lands where mines are situated this levy of cess is not in accordance with that law Even if the lands where mines are situated and which are subject to licence and mining leases even for those lands there is a charge on the basis of the surface of the land which is sometimes described as surface rent or sometimes also as dead rent It could not be doubted that if such a surface rent or dead rent is a charge or an impo sition on the land only and therefore will clearly fall within the purview of entry List and if a cess is levied on that it will also be justified as tax on land falling within the purview of entry and it will also be uniform as this cess would be levied in respect of the lands irrespective of the fact as to whether the land is one where a mine is situated or land which is only used for other purposes for which land revenue is chargeable
