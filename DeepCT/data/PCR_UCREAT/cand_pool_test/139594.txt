The defendants in a suit for ejectment on the ground of forfeiture have come up on appeal against the judgment and decree passed by a Subordinate Judge at Asansol <ORG> who we the respondents in this appeal gave a sub lease in respect of a coal mining area in the year to appellants to who carried on business in the name of a partnership firm named <ORG> which is appellant No in this appeal The defendants filed a joint written statement denying that any amount was due from them on account of arrears of rent or royalty the same having been paid to the plaintiff in due course The learned Subordinate Judge found that there was nothing to prove that the defendant paid any amount beyond what was admitted by the plaintiff Company and was credited to the account of the defendants in schedule of the plaint During the trial the defendants raised a plea that the plaintiff was not entitled to khas possession in view of the vesting of intermediary interests in mining rights in <ORG> under the provisions of the West Bengal Estates Acquisition Act of The learned Subordinate Judge considered this contention and found that considering the position of the parties at or about the time when the cause of action for the suit arose and without allowing extraneous matters to crop up it would appear that the defendants were already trespassers on the leasehold property before the Act of came into operation and that such unlawful possession of trespassers which kept the plaintiff out of khas possession of the property would not disentitle them to the relief claimed in the suit Against this decree the defendants have come up on appeal He contended that on the materials on record the trial court should have found that there was no service of notice under Section Act on defendants and and further that it should have been held that the plaintiff Company was not entitled to recover possession in view of the vesting of their intermediary interest in <ORG> under the provisions of the Estates Acquisition Act None of the defendants were examined in the suit and no evidence was adduced in support of the plea of payment that was raised in the written statement As a matter of fact no evidence was adduced to prove the payments alleged and on the evidence on record there is no escape from the conclusion that the amounts claimed in the suit as arrears of rent royalty etc There is no question that breach of the covenant in this regard did entail forfeiture of the lease in terms of Section Act It was held the personal tender or delivery may take place anywhere the vicarious tender or delivery must take place at the residence of the person intended to be bound by the notice In the case of joint tenants each is intended to be bound and it has long ago been decided that service of a notice to quit upon a joint tenant is prima facie evidence that it has reached the other joint tenants The statements above lay down a rule governing the mode of proof relating to service and says in effect that service by registered post of a notice directed to the correct address is prima facie proof if the acknowledgment receipt comes back with the signature of somebody thereon and further that service of such a notice upon one joint tenant is prima facie evidence of service on the others when similar notices on all the joint tenants are sent by post to the correct address The question involved does not appear to have been discussed in detail as it was not necessary in view of the fact that the learned Advocate concerned conceded the position but even apart from the broad proposition of law laid down in the case there is ample justification in the materials on record in the present case in support of the trial court finding in favour of the service of notice on defendants and The notices on these two defendants were sent by registered post to the address mentioned in the indenture of lease Exhibit I as per Clause IX iii thereof Further in view of the fact that the notices were sent by registered post as evidenced by postal receipts Exhibits and there would be a presumption of effective service and the further fact that the acknowledgements of the notices directed to the address given in the indenture Exhibit came back with the signature of somebody would provide prima facie evidence of service The principle that the <ORG> should not pass a decree which would be unexecutable would not be attracted to the case as in any case the decree confers on the decree holder some legal right of which he would otherwise be deprived But when the right to get <ORG> possession is substituted as a result of the subsequent change in the law by a right to get compensation which would be assessed by the Revenue Officers a refusal by the <ORG> to grant a decree for <ORG> possession would deprive the plaintiff of the right to get full compensation and this is an aspect of the matter which the <ORG> must consider while considering the change in the law pending the suit
