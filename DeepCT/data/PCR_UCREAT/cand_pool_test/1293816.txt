DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> A BENCH <NAME> A KRISHNAIYER FAZALALI SYED MURTAZA PATHAK KOSHAL A CITATION AIR SCR SCC CITATOR INFO RF SC SC SC SC RF SC RF SC ACT Sugar Undertakings Acquisition Act <ORG>s legislature if competent to enact a law on declared industry In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that since sugar is a declared industry under the Industries Development and Regulation Act in view of entry in <ORG> List read with entry in state list further read with Art Dismissing the appeals HELD Industry being a matter enumerated in entry of List II only the <ORG> legislature has the exclusive power to legislate in respect of it but this power is subject to the provisions of entries and of List I While under entry if a declaration is made by <ORG> that a particular industry is necessary for defence or for the prosecution of war <ORG> to the exclusion of the <ORG> legislature would be entitled to legislate in respect of that industry a declaration by <ORG> by law to assume control over any particular industry in public interest in a sine qua non to clothe <ORG> with power under entry List I to legislate in respect of that industry The declaration contemplated by this entry is a declaration by law A mere declaration unaccompanied by law is incompatible with entry of List I But that does not mean that once a declaration is made in respect of an industry that industry as a whole is taken out of entry List II Therefore <ORG> has made a declaration for assuming control in respect of the declared industries set out in the schedule of the Act only to the extent provided in the Act Therefore there is no conflict between the impugned legislation and the control exercised by the Central <ORG> under the provisions of the Central Act There is no force in the argument that the power of acquisition under Entry List II is incidental to the power to legislate in respect of various topic in the lists and therefore when the <ORG> assumed control over the declared industry such control comprehends the power to acquire and hence the power of the <ORG> to enact legislation for acquisition of properly of scheduled undertakings would be denude The power to acquire property can now be exercised concurrently by the <ORG> and the <ORG>s Therefore both the <ORG> and the state would have power of acquisition and requisition of property There is a long line of decisions which clearly establishes the proposition that power to legislate for acquisition of property is an independent and separate power and is exercisable only under Entry List III and not as an incident of the power to legislate in respect of a specific head of legislation in any of the three lists The argument that the <ORG> legislature lacked competence to enact the impugned legislation is without force Legislative power of the <ORG> under Entry List II is eroded only to the extent control is assumed by the <ORG> pursuant to a declaration made by the <ORG> in respect of a declared industry as spelt out by the legislative enactment and the field occupied by such enactment is the measure of erosion Subject to such erosion on the remainder the <ORG> legislature will have power to legislate in respect of declared industry without in any way trenching upon the occupied field <ORG> legislature which is otherwise competent to deal with industry under Entry List II can deal with that industry in exercise of other powers enabling it to legislate under different heads set out in Lists II and III and this power cannot be denied to the <ORG> The contention that the impugned Act is in violation of section of the Central Act has no merit If an attempt was made to take over the management or control of any industrial undertaking in a declared industry the bar of section would inhibit exercise of such executive power The inhibition of section is on the executive power but if as a sequel to an acquisition of an industrial undertaking the management or control of the industrial undertaking stands transferred to the acquiring authority section is not attracted It does not preclude or forbid a <ORG> legislature exercising legislative power under an entry other than Entry of List II and if in exercise of that legislative power the consequential transfer of management or control over the industry or undertaking follows as an incident of acquisition such taking over of management or control pursuant to an exercise of legislative power is not within the inhibition of section <NAME> Koshal JJ concurring in the result It is not necessary in this case to express any opinion on the question whether the declaration made by <ORG> in section of the Industries Development and Regulation ct in respect of the industries specified in the First schedule to that Act can be regarded as limited to removing from the scope of Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution only so much of the legislative field as is covered by the subject matter As a sequel to the serious problems created by the owners of certain sugar mills in the State of Uttar Pradesh for cane growers and labour employed in sugar mills having an adverse impact on general economy of the areas where these sugar mills were situated And with a view to ameliorating the situation posing a threat to the economy the Governor of Uttar Pradesh promulgated an ordinance on July to styled as Sugar Undertaking Acquisition ordinance The ordinance and the Act were challenged in <ORG> on the following grounds The State legislature had no legislative competence to enact it The Act violated Art Mr <NAME> learned counsel who led on behalf of the appellants confined his attack to two grounds a State legislature lacked legislative competence to enact the impugned Act and compensation awarded for acquisition in violative of Art as it stood prior to its amendment by the Constitution Twenty fifth Amendment Act which came into force on April The main thrust of the attack was that <ORG> lacked legislative competence to enact the impugned Act The first limb of the submission was that in exercise of legislative power flowing from Entry List I the <ORG> made the requisite declaration in of the Industries Development and Regulation Act IDR Act for short and in view of placitum of the first schedule to the IDR Act sugar being a declared industry that industry goes out pf Entry List II and hence <ORG> legislature was denuded of all legislative power to legislate in respect of sugar industry and as the impugned legislation is in respect of industrial undertaking in sugar industry the impugned legislation is void on account of legislative incompetence The learned Attorney General countered it by saying that the power to acquire property derived from entry in List III is an independent power and the impugned Act being in pith and substance an Act to acquire scheduled undertakings meaning thereby the properties of the scheduled undertakings the power of the State legislature to legislate in this behalf is referable to entry and remains intact irrespective of the fact that sugar is a declared industry control of which is taken over by <ORG> pursuant to the declaration made under of the IDR Act Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest Entry in List II State List reads as under Entry in List I and entry in List II conferred legislative power on the <ORG> and the States respectively for acquisition or requisitioning of property for its own purpose Having set out the historical background attention may now be turned to the scope and content of legislative power of Union and the <ORG>s flowing from entry in List I and entry in List II in respect of the topic of industry Industry as a head of legislation is to be found in entry List II with this limitation that it is subject to the provisions of entries and List I The difference in the language in which entries and are couched has a bearing on the interruption of entry A declaration by the parliament by law to assume control over any particular industry in public interest is a sine qua non to clothe <ORG> with power under entry List I to legislate in respect of that industry because otherwise industry as a general head of legislation is in the exclusive sphere of <ORG> legislative activity pursuant to entry List II provides that the <ORG> legislature has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List A fortiori industry being the matter enumerated in List II the <ORG> legislature has exclusive power to legislate in respect of it and keeping aside for the time being the words subject to the provisions of entries and of List I the <ORG> legislature alone can legislate in respect of the legislative head industry Ipso facto parliament would not have power to legislate in respect of industry as a legislative head Now entry List I on its own language does not provide a field of legislative activity for <ORG> unless and until a declaration is made by parliament by law to assume control over specified industries The embargo on the power of <ORG> to legislate in respect of industry which is in List II would be lifted once a declaration is made by <ORG> by law as envisaged by entry List I In the absence of a declaration as envisaged by entry List I it is incontrovertible that <ORG> has no power to legislate on the topic of industry Therefore the erosion of the power of the <ORG> legislature to legislate in respect of declared industry would not occur merely by declaration but by the enactment consequent on the declaration prescribing the extent and scope of control What is the effect of a declaration made in respect of mines and minerals as contemplated by entry has been succinctly laid down by a Constitution Bench of this Court in <NAME> <ORG> of Bihar Ors in the following terms Once this declaration is made and the extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by <ORG> Any legislation by the <ORG> after such declaration and trenching upon the field disclosed in the declaration must necessarily be unconstitutional because that field is abstracted from the legislative competence of the <ORG> Legislature The only dispute therefore can be to what extent the declaration by <ORG> leaves any scope for legislation by the <ORG> legislature If the impugned legislation falls within the ambit of such scope it will be valid if outside it then it must be declared invalid Sugar is a declared industry Is it however correct to say that once a declaration is made as envisaged by entry List I that industry as a whole is taken out of entry List II In respect of an identical entry List I in the passage extracted above it is said that to the extent declaration is made and extent of control laid that much and that much alone is abstracted from the legislative competence of the <ORG> legislature List I it was held Moreover power to acquire for purposes of development and regulation has not been exercised by Act of The existence of power of <ORG> to legislate on this topic as an incident of legislative power on another subject is one thing It is difficult to see how the field of acquisition could become occupied by a central Act in the same way as it had been in the West Bengal case even before <ORG> legislates to acquire land in a State These pronouncements demonstrably show that before State legislature is denuded of power to legislate under entry List II in respect of a declared industry the scope of declaration and consequent control assumed by the <ORG> must be demarcated with precision and then proceed to ascertain whether the impugned legislation trenches upon the excepted field The declaration made in of IDR Act reads as under It is hereby declared that it in expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the industries specified in the First Schedule The contention is that as there are no words of limitation to be found in in respect of the control assumed by the declaration by the <ORG> the necessary concomitant of such declaration is that the State legislature is totally denuded of any power to deal with such declared industry To buttress this argument reference was made to the declaration made by the <ORG> pursuant to entry List I as set out in of the Mines Minerals Act which reads as under It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided Absence of the expression to the extent hereinafter provided was pressed into service to point out that while in respect of mines ind minerals the <ORG> has assumed control to the extent provided in the Mines Minerals Act in the case of declared industries the control is absolute unlimited unfettered or unabridged and therefore everything that would fall within the connotation of the word control would be within the competence of the <ORG> and to the same extent and degree the <ORG> legislature would be denuded of its power to legislate in respect of that industry The words of limitation on the power to make declaration are by law It is open to <ORG> in view of entry List I to make a declaration in respect of industry or industries to the effect that the <ORG> will assume its control in public interest There is no such concept as abstract control The <ORG> legislature can be denied legislative power under entry to the extent <ORG> makes declaration under entry and by such declaration <ORG> acquires power to legislate only in respect of those industries in respect of which declaration is made and to the extent as manifested by legislation incorporating the declaration and no more Therefore even though the Act enacted under entry which is to some extent in pari materia with entry and in a parallel and cognate statute while making the declaration the <ORG> did use the further expression to the extent herein provided while assuming control the absence of such words in the declaration in would not lead to the conclusion that the control assumed was to be something in abstract total and unfettered and not as per various provisions of the IDR Act The lacuna if any is made good by hedging the power of making declaration to be made by law This is clearly borne out not only by the decision in <NAME> case supra where undoubtedly while referring to the control assumed by the <ORG> by a declaration made in of the Mines Minerals Act it was said that to what extent such a declaration would go is for <ORG> to determine and this must be commensurate with public interest and once this declaration is made and the extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid down becomes an exclusive subject for legislation by <ORG> It is not merely some abstract control but the extent of the control assumed by the <ORG> by the provisions of IDR Act pursuant to declaration made by <ORG> that the <ORG> Legislature to that extent that is to the extent the provisions of IDR Act occupies this field is denuded of its power to legislate in respect of such declared industry When validity of a legislation is challenged on the ground of want of legislative competence and it becomes necessary to ascertain to which entry in the three lists the legislation is referable to the <ORG> has evolved the theory of pith and substance Repelling this contention the <ORG> unanimously held that in pith and substance the impugned legislation was for acquisition of contract carriages and not an Act which deals with inter State trade and commerce Section provides for appeal and provides for constitution of a <ORG> to perform the functions assigned to it by the Act Section provides for powers and procedure of the <ORG> This deeming fiction enacted in respect of the concept of ownership clearly manifest the legislative intention that IDR Act treats that person to be the owner who has the ultimate control over the affairs of the under taking and if that ultimate control is entrusted to even a manager for the purposes of the IDR Act the manager would be the owner Therefore there is no conflict between the impugned legislation and the control exercised by <ORG> under the provisions of the IDR Act and there is not even a remote encroachment on the field occupied by IDR Act The main thrust of the submission was that the power of acquisition under entry List III is not an independent power but it is incidental to the power to legislate in respect of the various topics in various lists and therefore when by a declaration made by the parliament enacted in of the IDR Act the control over declared industry is assumed by the <ORG> such control will also comprehend the power to acquire and hence the power of the <ORG> legislature to enact legislation for acquisition of property of scheduled undertakings would be denuded as that power as an internal element of control would vest in the <ORG> Government Before the Constitution Seventh Amendment Act which came into force on November Entry in List I read Acquisition or requisitioning of property for the purpose of the <ORG> Accordingly the power to acquire property could be exercised concurrently by the <ORG> and the <ORG>s Even if prior to the deletion of Entry in List I and entry in List II an argument could possibly have been advanced that as power of acquisition of property was conferred both on <ORG> and the <ORG>s to be exercised either for the purpose of the <ORG> or for the <ORG> it was incidental to any other legislative power flowing from various entries in the three Lists and not an independent power but since the deletion of entry in List I and entry in List II and substitution of a comprehensive entry in List III it could hardly be urged with confidence that the power of acquisition and requisitioning of property was incidental to other power Therefore both the <ORG> and the <ORG> would have power of acquisition and requisitioning of property In <ORG> case the challenge was to the Madras Electric Supply Undertakings Acquisition Act on the ground that the Madras legislature was not competent to enact the legislation because at the relevant time there was no entry in the Government of India Act relating to compulsory acquisition of any commercial or industrial undertaking The challenge was that the <ORG> legislature had no power to enact a legislation for acquisition of an electrical undertaking After scrutinising the Act this Court came to the conclusion that in pith and substance the Act was one to provide for acquisition of electrical undertaking and therefore the <ORG> legislature lacked competence to enact the same Now in that case the Advocate General of Madras in his effort to save the impugned legislation advanced an argument before <ORG> that There was implicit in every entry in the legislative lists in the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act an inherent power to make a law with respect to a matter ancillary or incidental to the subject matter of each entry His further argument was that each entry in the list carried with it an inherent power to provide for the compulsory acquisition of any property land or any commercial or industrial undertaking while making a law under such entry This also becomes clear from Maharajadhiraja <NAME> case supra wherein <NAME> in his concurring judgment repelled the argument of the learned Attorney General appearing for the <ORG> contending that the Bihar Land Reforms Act was a law made with respect to matters mentioned in entry List II and not in entry List II It thus clearly transpires that the observation in <NAME> case supra extracted above that power to legislate for acquisition of property is exercisable only under entry of List III and not as an incident of the power to legislate in respect of a specific head of legislation in any of the three Lists is borne out from <ORG> case and Maharajadhiraja Sir <NAME> cases supra Power to acquire coal bearing land owned or possessed by the <ORG> of West Bengal was amongst others claimed as an integral element of control acquired by the <ORG> pursuant to a declaration made in of the IDR Act and Mines and Minerals Act enacted in exercise of the legislative power under entries and respectively as coal was both a declared industry and a specified mineral This contention was partly accepted to repel the contention that the <ORG> has no power to acquire the property vested in the <ORG> since the <ORG> itself is also a sovereign authority Pertinent observation may be extracted Power to acquire or requisition property may since the amendment be exercised concurrently by the <ORG> and the <ORG>s Article which deals with acquisition of all property requires two conditions to be fulfilled acquisition or requisitioning must be for a public purpose the law under which the property is acquired or requisitioned must provide for payment of compensation either fixed thereby or on principles specified thereby By cl of that Article if a law made by the legislature of a <ORG> is repugnant to any provision of a law competently made by <ORG> the <ORG> law is subject to cl void clause recognizes limited validity of a <ORG> law on matters in the Concurrent List if that law is repugnant to an existing or earlier law made by <ORG> only if such law has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent So too before the declaration a State legislature could have made a law in respect of an industry by virtue of entry of List II Reliance was however placed on the following passage in West Bengal case supra to urge that power of acquisition is an integral and inseparable concomitant of control assumed by the <ORG> By making the requisite declarations under entry of List I <ORG> assumed power to regulate mines and minerals and thereby to deny to all agencies not under the control of the <ORG> authority to work the mines Power to legislate for regulation and development of mines and minerals under the control of the <ORG> would by necessary implication include the power to acquire mines and minerals Therefore there is no inner conflict between <NAME> case supra and West Bengal case supra on the point that power of acquisition is an independent power referable to entry List III However even if there is a conflict between West Bengal case supra and <NAME> case on this point a later larger <ORG> judgment in <NAME> case would impliedly overrule the former to the extent of conflict This contention was repelled holding that the impugned legislation was in pith and substance one under entry of List II read with entry List III In reaching this conclusion the Court held as under It seems to us clear that the <ORG> has legislative competence to legislate on entry List II and entry List III The object of ss and seems to be to enable the <ORG> to acquire all the lands which do not fall within the categories a and of This conclusion was sought to be buttressed by reference to the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> Attorney General wherein it is observed as under The appellant <ORG> which owned and managed <ORG> in Victoria British Columbia while not denying that the regulation of hours of work was ordinarily a matter of property and civil rights in the province under head of of the British North America Act and accordingly within the legislative competence of the provincial legislature contended inter alia that the company activities had become such an extensive and important element in the national economy of Canada that the dominion <ORG> was entitled under the general powers conferred by the first part of of the Act of to regulate all the affairs of the company even where that involved legislating in relation to matters exclusively reserved to the provincial legislatures by It can therefore be said with a measure of confidence that legislative power of the <ORG>s under entry List II is eroded only to the extent control is assumed by the <ORG> pursuant to a declaration made by the <ORG> in respect of declared industry as spelt out by legislative enactment and the field occupied by such enactment is the measure of erosion Subject to such erosion on the remainder the <ORG> legislature will have power to legislate in respect of declared industry without in any way trenching upon the occupied field <ORG> legislature which is otherwise competent to deal with industry under entry List II can deal with that industry in exercise of other powers enabling it to legislate under different heads set out in Lists II and III and this power cannot be denied to the <ORG> Repelling the contention regarding legislative incompetence it was observed that it is difficult to see how the field of acquisition could become occupied by a Central Act in the same way as it had been in the West Bengal case supra even before <ORG> legislates to acquire land in a <ORG> At least until <ORG> has so legislated as it was shown to have done by the statute considered by this <ORG> in the case from West Bengal the field is free for <ORG> legislation falling under the express provisions of entry of List III It was further observed as under It seems difficult to sustain the case that the provisions of the Central Act would be really unworkable by mere change of ownership of land in which mineral deposits are found We have to judge the character of the Haryana Act by the substance and effect of its provisions and not merely by the purpose given in the statement of reasons and objects behind it There is thus a long line of decisions which clearly establishes the proposition that power to legislate for acquisition of property is an independent and separate power and is exercisable only under entry List III and not as an incident of the power to legislate in respect of a specific head of legislation in any of the three lists As already pointed out in pith and substance the impugned legislation is one for acquisition of scheduled undertakings and that field of acquisition is not occupied by the IDR Act which deals with control of management regulation and development of a declared industry and there is no repugnancy between the impugned legislation and the IDR Act Therefore the contention that the State legislature lacked legislative competence to enact the impugned legislation must be negatived A faint submission was made that nationalisation of industry as a national policy will have to be determined and enforced by the <ORG> keeping in view its Industrial Policy Resolution and such piece meal nationalisation would certainly encroach upon the control assumed by the <ORG> And there is no bar to a <ORG> owned company or <ORG> to set up sugar manufacturing undertaking under an appropriate licence If an attempt was made to take over management or control of any industrial undertaking in a declared industry indisputably the bar of would inhibit exercise of such executive power Section forbids executive action of taking over management or control of any industrial undertaking under any law in force which authorises <ORG> or a local authority so to do Section does not preclude or forbid a State legislature exercising legislative power under an entry other than entry of List II and if in exercise of that legislative power to wit acquisition of an industrial undertaking in a declared industry the consequential transfer of management or control over the industry or undertaking follows as an incident of acquisition such taking over of management or control pursuant to an exercise of legislative power is not within the inhibition of Therefore the contention that the impugned legislation violates has no merit as it stood at the relevant time Therefore Art as it stood on the relevant date may be noticed as it stood at the relevant time reads as under No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate On the application of the view expressed in <NAME> case or in <NAME> case the Act in our judgment is liable to be struck down as it fails to provide to the expropriated banks compensation determined according to relevant principles Section provides for payment of compensation for acquisition of the undertaking and the compensation is to be determined in accordance with the principles specified in the Second Schedule The science of valuation of property recognizes several principles or methods for determining the value to be paid as compensation to the owner for loss of his property there are different methods applicable to different classes of property in the determination of the value to be paid as recompense for loss of his property The question is whether the statement of law in <NAME> supra that the principle of awarding compensation on the basis of written down value for used machinery is a valid principle for determining compensation and whether the compensation so awarded was illusory is not overruled by any observation in <NAME> case Undoubtedly in <NAME> case supra it is reiterated by <NAME> <NAME> speaking for himself and <NAME> <NAME> that it will be for the aggrieved party to clearly satisfy the <ORG> that the basis adopted by the legislature has no reasonable relationship to the value of the property acquired or that the amount to be paid has been arbitrarily fixed or that the same is illusory return for the property taken observed as under The specific obligation to pay an amount and in the alternative the use of the word principles for determination of that amount must mean that the amount fixed or determined to be paid cannot be illusory But in the next breath it has been observed that the amount fixed for being paid to the owner is wholly beyond the pale of challenge that it is inadequate There was no scope for ploughing back the profits to rejuvenate the machinery because there was no profit There remain two minor and incidental points mentioned in passing With reference to <ORG> it was said that acres of agricultural land belonging to the company owning the scheduled undertaking was taken over without compensation Unless therefore it is specifically shown that while acquiring scheduled undertakings agricultural land belonging to the company or the owner owning scheduled undertaking was either acquired or taken over as part of the acquisition it is not possible to accept the submission that there was acquisition of agricultural land without providing compensation for the same Therefore in evaluating compensation of the scheduled undertakings there is no question of evaluating the good will in that selection of petitioners scheduled undertakings for acquisition is wholly arbitrary and there is no difference between those selected for acquisition and those left out through all such sugar undertakings in the State of Uttar Pradesh were similarly situated and similarly circumstanced It was pointed out that a close scrutiny was applied to this persistent default and where the situation in respect of sugar undertakings was desparate they were classified together and they were sought to be acquired These were all the contentions in these appeals and special leave petitions and as there is no merit in any of them the appeals and the special leave petitions fail and are dismissed with costs in one set PATHAK We have had the benefit of reading the judgment prepared by our brother <NAME> While we broadly agree with the final conclusions reached by him on the several points debated before us we would prefer to refrain from expressing any opinion on the question whether the declaration made by <ORG> in of the Industries Development and Regulation Act in respect of the industries specified in the First Schedule to that Act can be regarded as limited to removing from the scope of Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution only so much of the legislative field as is covered by the subject matter and content of that Act or it can be regarded as effecting the removal from that Entry of the entire legislative field embracing all matters pertaining to the industries specified in the declaration Whether the terms in which the declaration has been framed in of the Industries Development and Regulation Act a declaration not expressly limiting control of the specific indus tries to the extent provided by the Act can be construed as being so limited is a matter which we think we should deal with in some more appropriate case With this reservation we have no hesitation in agreeing with the ultimate conclusions reached by our learned brother on the remaining points of controversy and in concurring with the order proposed by him disposing of these appeals and special leave petitions
