Plaintiffs have filed this suit as mortgagors against the defendant who is the present mortgagee of an immoveable property situate at Chimna Butcher Street Bombay to restrain the defendant by an order and injunction of the <ORG> from selling the property on the ground that the proposed sale which was advertised for September last was wrongful and not in accordance with the terms of the mortgage By an indenture of transfer of mortgage dated January the mortgage debt which then amounted to Rs The due date for repayment was extended under the deed of transfer to January with a further option to the mortgagors to extend the same to January provided they paid interest regularly and otherwise observed and performed all the provisions and conditions of the mortgage After the deed of transfer the plaintiffs paid to the defendant Rs It is contended on behalf of the plaintiffs that the defendant was not entitled to have the property sold on two grounds that even if the due date of payment which was January had been under the circumstances contemplated by a clause in the mortgage deed which I will hereafter refer to accelerated the defendant had not intimated to the plaintiffs the exercise of his option to call in the mortgage amount and because no notice of sale in writing as required by Section a of the Transfer of Property Act and as also provided for in the mortgage deed was given to the plaintiffs In paragraph of his written statement he further contended that he was entitled to put up the mortgaged property for sale without the notice in writing required by Section but that contention was given up at the hearing by his counsel The application for interim injunction was made in terms of prayer of the plaint on September before recess but as the sale was advertised for the afternoon of the same day I ordered that notice of the application should be given immediately to the mortgagee i the defendant of the written statement do not form part of the final order made by the <ORG> on that date If that was so there was no meaning in ordering the written statement to be filed within ten days and expediting the suit without stating in so many words that the written statement was to be filed and the suit was to be expedited only if the sum of Rs That is nowhere alleged in the written statement and although as a point of procedure it can be taken at any time counsel for the defendant has not even raised an issue upon it He argued that as soon as the mortgagee became entitled to call in his moneys by reason of the acceleration of the date of payment the mortgagors right to redeem accrued simultaneously to them and as there was no prayer for redemption the whole suit was bad On the other hand plaintiff counsel argued that ordinarily a mortgagor suit for redemption could not be brought before the expiry of the stipulated period that is before the due date and that if in the event of the due date being accelerated defendant as mortgagee became entitled at his option to call in the mortgage amount he had not exercised that option by calling in the amount upon which the mortgagor right to redeem would accrue It has been held both in England and in India that the mortgagee cannot be restrained from exercising his power of sale merely by reason of the mortgagor filing a suit for redemption unless he pays the mortgage amount to the mortgagee or tenders the same No case was cited before me to show that if the right to redeem had not accrued to the mortgagor he could not bring in a suit for an injunction restraining a wrongful sale but that his only remedy was either to pay or tender the moneys and allow the property to be sold and then pursue his remedy in damages if any In my opinion the plaintiffs could not at the particular stage and under the circumstances of the case have asked for any other relief except an injunction and they could only succeed if they showed that the proposed sale was wrongful in the sense that it was against the terms of the mortgage Counsel however referred to the clause in the mortgage deed which provides that it is agreed that in the event of any damage happening to the mortgaged property in the manner specified whereby the security was impaired or in the event of interest for any three months being in arrears and remaining unpaid for three weeks after being due or if the mortgagors or any of them were adjudged insolvent or committed a breach of any one of the covenants provisions terms and conditions in the mortgage then notwithstanding anything contained in the mortgage to the contrary the whole of the mortgage debt shall at once at the option of the mortgagees become immediately payable as if the due date had then elapsed and in such cases all such rights and remedies shall be available to the mortgagees as would be available to them under the terms of these presents or by law upon default being made in payment of the principal money and interest hereby secured Under the circumstances the due date which was January was accelerated and the option to call in his moneys and all the rights of the mortgagee accrued to him that a proviso or clause in the mortgage deed of the nature which I have referred to above is exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagees and purports to give them an option either to enforce their security at once or if the security is ample to stand by their investment for the full term of the mortgage In an earlier <ORG> case <NAME> <NAME> I A the question was one of limitation under Article of the Limitation Act for an action by a mortgagee upon a breach of the clause which gave the mortgagee the power to enforce the mortgage by sale even if the time for repayment had not arrived He followed this up with a reminder on July and again on July Thereafter the defendant seems to have changed his mind In my opinion the mere fact that the defendant became entitled to call in the mortgage moneys immediately is not an exercise of the option given to him under the mortgage deed The mortgage moneys can only become due and payable as soon as the option is exercised upon an intimation on which the mortgagors could come to know their position for unless the mortgagee calls in the moneys the mortgagor cannot know that the due date has been accelerated Further or in any event it is admitted on behalf of the defendant that no notice was given to the mortgagors as required by Section a This power of sale in the mortgage deed is really an authority given to the mortgagee to defeat the mortgagor equity of redemption but it could only be exercised on the fulfilment of either of the two conditions mentioned in Section Sir <NAME> was of opinion that the construction of the covenant appeared to him to be one of some difficulty but upon consideration he was of opinion that the express proviso as to the remedy of the plaintiff by action for damages takes away the jurisdiction of this <ORG> the jurisdiction being the jurisdiction to grant an injunction The ruling embodied in <NAME> case and followed in <NAME> case has not been mentioned Sri any case in Bombay either before <NAME> case or after it I should like also to point out that the clause in the mortgage deed on which counsel relies begins by saying without pre judice to all rights conferred on the mortgagees by Section of the Transfer of Property Act etc Now the right conferred by Section on the mortgagee is the right to exercise his power of sale only upon fulfilment of one of the two conditions and as I have stated before giving the notice required by Section a is not only necessary but is imperative and even the period of three months cannot be curtailed by agreement of the parties It was lastly argued that it did not appear on the facts of this case that the plaintiffs would ever be able even if they were willing to redeem this property and that they were not even able to pay Rs Here there are two conditions which have not been fulfilled There is no intimation of the exercise of the mortgagee option and there is no notice in writing as required by the statute and the parties wish to stand upon their strict rights regardless of the consequences of any future action which may be taken by the mortgagee I cannot say that conditions exist in this case which entitle the mortgagee to exercise his power of sale or which prevent the mortgagors from applying to the <ORG> to restrain the exerrise of that power
