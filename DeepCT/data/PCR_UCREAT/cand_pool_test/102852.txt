Petitioners say that by attaching consequential seniority to the accelerated promotion the impugned amendment violates equality in Article read with Article A roster point promotee in the graduate stream would reach the th level by the time he attains the age of years On the other hand the general merit promotee would reach the rd level out of levels at the age of and by the time he gets eligibility to the th level he would have retired from service BROAD ISSUES IN WRIT PETITION No OF The broad issues that arise for determination in this case relate to the Implementation of i the Constitution Seventy Seventh Amendment Act the Constitution Eighty First Amendment Act the Constitution Eighty Second Amendment Act and the Constitution Eighty Fifth Amendment Act and ii Action taken in pursuance thereof which seek to reverse decisions of <ORG> in matters relating to promotion and their application with retrospective effect ARGUMENTS The substance of the arguments advanced on behalf of the petitioners briefly is as follows Equality is a part of the basic structure and it is impossible to conceive of the Constitution without equality as one of its central components In this connection reliance is also placed on the provisions of Part XIV to show that the Constitution makers had given importance to public employment by making a special provision in the form of Part XIV providing certain rights and protection to the office holders in the services of the Union and the States Special provisions have also been made in Article A which permits establishment of tribunals as special and adjudicatory mechanism These judgments also provide conclusions based on principles which gave meaning to equality both as an individual right and as group expectations As regards the words nothing in this article in Article it is urged that these words cannot wipe out Article and therefore they have a limited meaning It is urged that as an individual right in Article enforceability is provided for whereas group expectation in Article is not a fundamental right but it is an enabling power which is not coupled with duty On the question of balancing and structuring of equality in employment it is urged that quotas are subject to quantitative limits and qualitative exclusions that there is a distinction between quota limits example to SCs and ceiling limits maximum permissible reservation limits example which comes under the category of quantitative limits It is submitted that the th Amendment adding the words with consequential seniority in Article A has been made to nullify the decision in <NAME> Accordingly it is urged that the impugned amendments are violative of the basic structure and the fundamental values of the Constitution articulated in the preamble and encapsulated in Articles and that they violate the fundamental postulates of equality justice rule of law and secularism as enshrined in the Constitution and that they violate the fundamental role of <ORG> as interpreter of the Constitution The power of amendment under Article is a constituent power and not a constituted power that that there are no implied limitations on the constituent power under Article that the power under Article has to keep the Constitution in repair as and when it becomes necessary and thereby protect and preserve the basic structure That there are no implied limitations on the power of the <ORG> under Article when it seeks to amend the Constitution It is further submitted that amendments for giving effect to the directive principles cannot offend the basic structure of the Constitution That in <NAME> the focus was on Backward Classes and not on SCs STs and therefore there was no balancing of rights of three groups namely general category other backward classes and scheduled castes scheduled tribes It is next submitted that this <ORG> has taken care of the interests of the general category by placing a ceiling on filling up of vacancies only to a maximum of for reservation In this connection it was urged that Article applies to reservations under Article and therefore if reservation is found to be within reasonable limits the <ORG> would uphold such reservations depending upon the facts of the case and if reservation suffers from excessiveness it may be invalidated For the above reasons respondents submit that there is no infirmity in the impugned constitutional amendments The key issue which arises for determination in this case is whether by virtue of the impugned constitutional amendments the power of the <ORG> is so enlarged so as to obliterate any or all of the constitutional limitations and requirements STANDARDS OF JUDICIAL REVIEW OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS Constitution is not an ephermal legal document embodying a set of legal rules for the passing hour A Constitutional provision must be construed not in a narrow and constricted sense but in a wide and liberal manner so as to anticipate and take account of changing conditions and purposes so that constitutional provision does not get fossilized but remains flexible enough to meet the newly emerging problems and challenges Article of the Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The Supreme <ORG> by a majority held that procedure established by law means any procedure established by law made by the <ORG> or the legislatures of the <ORG> The right to life includes right to live with human dignity In India till recently there is no legislation securing freedom of information the basic structure concept was resorted to although no question of constitutional amendment was involved in that case Therefore it is important to note that the recognition of a basic structure in the context of amendment provides an insight that there are beyond the words of particular provisions systematic principles underlying and connecting the provisions of the Constitution They give coherence to the Constitution Therefore we may have a look at common constitutional provisions under German Law which deal with rights such as freedom of press or religion which are not mere values they are justiciable and capable of interpretation are overarching principles which provide linking factor for principle of fundamental rights like Articles and This is how the doctrine of basic structure stands evolved under the German Constitution and by interpretation given to the concept by <ORG> Judicial review of legislation enacted by the <ORG> within limited powers under the controlled constitution which we have has been a feature of our law and this is on the ground that any law passed by a legislature with limited powers is ultra vires if the limits are transgressed The framers conferred on <ORG> the power to issue writs for the speedy enforcement of those rights and made the right to approach <ORG> for such enforcement itself a fundamental right However there is a difference between formal equality and egalitarian equality which will be discussed later on WORKING TEST IN THE MATTER OF APPLICATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF BASIC STRUCTURE Once it is held that fundamental rights could be abridged but not destroyed and once it is further held that several features of the Constitution can not be destroyed the concept of express limitation on the amending power loses its force for a precise formulation of the basic feature of the Constitution and for the courts to pronounce on the validity of a constitutional amendment A working test has been evolved by <NAME> in the Election Case in which the learned Judge has rightly enunciated with respect that for determining whether a particular feature of the Constitution is a part of its basic structure one has per force to examine in each individual case the place of the particular feature in the scheme of the Constitution its object and purpose and the consequences of its denial on the integrity of the Constitution as a fundamental instrument of the country governance Basically Part III of the Constitution consists of the equality code the freedom code and the right to move the courts There is a different view which says that reservation is merely providing a right of access and that it is not a right to redressal Applying the above test we have to consider the word reservation in the context of Article and it is in that context that Article of the Constitution which provides for relaxation of the standards of evaluation has to be seen Therefore rights conferred on citizens and non citizens are not merely individual or personal rights Article guarantees the fundamental right to equality before the law on all persons Great social injustice resulted from treating sections of the Hindu community as untouchable and therefore Article abolished untouchability and Article permitted the <ORG> to make any law providing for throwing open all public Hindu religious temples to untouchables The difficulty is that there is no natural order of merit independent of our value system There is a conceptual distinction between a non discrimination principle and affirmative action under which the <ORG> is obliged to provide level playing field to the oppressed classes Whether there is any upper limit beyond which reservation is not permissible Whether there is any limit to which seats can be reserved in a particular year in other words the issue is whether the percentage limit applies only on the total number of posts in the cadre or to the percentage of posts advertised every year as well The question of extent of reservation is closely linked to the issue whether Article is an exception to Article or is Article an application of Article He relied on <NAME> <NAME> judgment in Rangachari and held that Article provides for adequate representation taking into consideration entire cadre strength The Constitution Eighty first Amendment Act added Article which in substance gives legislative assent to the judgment in <NAME> CATCH UP RULE IS THE SAID RULE A CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT UNDER ARTICLE One of the contentions advanced on behalf of the petitioners is that the impugned amendments particularly the Constitution Seventy Seventh Amendment and Eight Fifth Amendment Acts obliterate all constitutional limitations on the amending power of the <ORG> The key issue which arises for determination is whether the above catch up rule and the concept of consequential seniority are constitutional requirements of Article and of equality so as to be beyond the constitutional amendatory process It was contended by the general candidates that accelerated promotion may be given but the <ORG> cannot give consequential seniority to reserved category candidates in the promoted category It was argued on behalf of the general candidates that all top grades stood occupied exclusively by the reserved category members which violated the rule of equality underlying Articles and In <NAME> the controversy which arose for determination was whether after the members of <ORG> for whom specific percentage of posts stood reserved having been promoted against those posts was it open to the administration to grant consequential seniority against general category posts in the higher grade The appellant took a clear stand that he had no objection if members of <ORG> get accelerated promotions This Court opined that without catch up rule giving weightage to earlier promotion secured by roster point promotee would result in reverse discrimination and would violate equality under Articles and Accordingly this Court took the view that the seniority between the reserved category candidates and general candidates in the promoted category shall be governed by their panel position However in the later judgment of this Court in the case of <NAME> another three Judge bench took the view that under the general rule of service jurisprudence relating to seniority the date of continuous officiation has to be taken into account and if so the roster point promotees were entitled to the benefit of continuous officiation Accordingly in <NAME> three points arose for consideration i Can the roster point promotees count their seniority in the promoted category from the date of their continuous officiation vis vis general candidates who were senior to them in the lower category and who were later promoted to the same level ii Have Virpal and <NAME> I have been correctly decided and has <NAME> correctly decided iii Whether the catch up principles are tenable At the outset this <ORG> stated that it was not concerned with the validity of constitutional amendments and therefore it proceeded on the assumption that Article A is valid and is not unconstitutional They give a positive command to the <ORG> that there shall be equality of opportunity of all citizens in public employment Before concluding we may refer to the judgment of this court in Badappanavar The above contentions raised by the appellants were rejected by the tribunal In <NAME> the circular which gave seniority to the roster point promotees was held to be violative of Articles and The judgment in the case of <NAME> was mainly based on the judgment in <NAME> which had taken the view that the departmental circular which gave consequential seniority to the roster point promotee violated Articles and of the Constitution The Government felt that the judgment of this court in <NAME> adversely affected the interests of SCs and STs in services as they have not reached the required level In Article of the Constitution after clause the following clause shall be inserted namely A Nothing in this Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the services under the <ORG> in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which in the opinion of the <ORG> are not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> The said clause A was inserted after clause of Article to say that nothing in the said Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion to any class of posts in the services under the <ORG> in favour of SCs and STs which in the opinion of the <ORG>s are not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> It gives freedom to the <ORG> in an appropriate case depending upon the ground reality to provide for reservation in matters of promotion to any class or classes of posts in the services It gives freedom to the <ORG> to provide for reservation in matters of promotion Further in Ajit Singh II this court has held that apart from backwardness and inadequacy of representation the <ORG> shall also keep in mind overall efficiency Article It is also necessary to give retrospective effect to the proposed constitutional amendment to Article A with effect from the date of coming into force of Article A itself that is from the th day of June Reading the Constitution Seventy Seventh Amendment Act with the Constitution Eighty Fifth Amendment Act clause A of Article now reads as follows A Nothing in this article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion with consequential seniority to any class or classes of posts in the services under the <ORG> in favour of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which in the opinion of the <ORG> are not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> In <ORG> this court held that the number of vacancies to be filled up on the basis of reservation in a year including the carry forward reservations should in no case exceed the ceiling limit of Quoted hereinbelow is the Statement of Objects and Reasons with the text of the Constitution Eighty First Amendment Act THE CONSTITUTION EIGHTY FIRST AMENDMENT ACT Assented on th June and came into force STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONS Prior to August the vacancies reserved for the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes which could not be filled up by direct recruitment on account of non availability of the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes or the Scheduled Tribes were treated as Backlog Vacancies <ORG> of India in its judgment in the Indra Sawhney versus Union of India held that the number of vacancies to be filled up on the basis of reservations in a year including carried forward reservations should in no case exceed the limit of fifty per cent As total reservations in a year for the Scheduled Castes the Scheduled Tribes and the other Backward Classes combined together had already reached forty nine and a half per cent and the total number of vacancies to be filled up in a year could not exceed fifty per cent The <ORG> after considering various representations reviewed the position and has decided to make amendment in the constitution so that the unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause or clause A of Article of the Constitution shall be considered as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty percent reservation on total number of vacancies of that year Amendment of Article In Article of the Constitution after clause A the following clause shall be inserted namely Nothing in this Article shall prevent the State from considering any unfilled vacancies of a year which are reserved for being filled up in that year in accordance with any provision for reservation made under clause or clause A as a separate class of vacancies to be filled up in any succeeding year or years and such class of vacancies shall not be considered together with the vacancies of the year in which they are being filled up for determining the ceiling of fifty per cent reservation on total number of vacancies of that year This proviso was inserted keeping in mind the judgment of this court in <NAME> which took the view that relaxation in matters of reservation in promotion was not permissible under Article in view of the command contained in Article There is no fixed yardstick to identify and measure these three factors it will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case It was vehemently urged on behalf of the petitioners that the <ORG>ment of Objects and Reasons indicate that the impugned amendments have been promulgated by the <ORG> to overrule the decision of this court We do not find any merit in this argument Procedural limitations on the other hand are those which impose restrictions with regard to the mode of exercise of the amending power Applying the above tests to the present case there is no violation of the basic structure by any of the impugned amendments including the Constitution Eighty Second Amendment Act Article confers a personal right by enacting a prohibition which is absolute Therefore the basic principle underlying Article is that the law must operate equally on all persons under like circumstances Therefore there is a basic difference between equality in law and equality in fact See Affirmative Action by <NAME> In a given case where excessiveness results in reverse discrimination this <ORG> has to examine individual cases and decide the matter in accordance with law This proviso is also conferring discretionary power on the <ORG> to relax qualifying marks or standards of evaluation Moreover Article is to be read with Article which provides that the <ORG> shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and in particular of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and shall protect them from social injustice It is made clear that even if the <ORG> has reasons to make reservation as stated above if the impugned law violates any of the above substantive limits on the width of the power the same would be liable to be set aside There is a difference between formal equality and egalitarian equality It is only when these reasons are satisfied that a <ORG> gets the power to provide for reservation in matters of employment Backwardness and inadequacy of representation therefore operate as justifications in the sense that the <ORG> gets the power to make reservation only if backwardness and inadequacy of representation exist We are of the opinion that there is no constitutional or legal bar to a <ORG> categorizing the backward classes as backward and more backward We are concerned with the question if a <ORG> makes such a categorisation whether it would be invalid We think not It cannot reasonably be denied that there is no difference between these two sets of castes groups classes There is another way of looking at this issue A classification must be founded on intelligible differential which distinguishes those that are grouped together from others In <NAME> an opinion was expressed by this Court vide para that there is no constitutional or legal bar to making of classification There are numerous petitions pending in this <ORG> in which reservations made under <ORG> enactments have been challenged as excessive In our present judgment we are upholding the validity of the constitutional amendments subject to the limitations Justification needs each case to be decided on case to case basis The issue involved in the present case is concerning the width of the power As stated above we are bound by the decision in <NAME> It is made clear that even if the <ORG> has compelling reasons as stated above the <ORG> will have to see that its reservation provision does not lead to excessiveness so as to breach the ceiling limit of or obliterate the creamy layer or extend the reservation indefinitely Subject to above we uphold the constitutional validity of the Constitution Seventy Seventh Amendment Act the Constitution Eighty First Amendment Act the Constitution Eighty Second Amendment Act and the Constitution Eighty Fifth Amendment Act We have not examined the validity of individual enactments of appropriate States and that question will be gone into in individual writ petition by the appropriate bench in accordance with law laid down by us in the present case
