The investigation by the police revealed that there was evidence to the effect that even the passengers in the bus were alarmed of the enormous speed in which it was being driven and had cautioned the driver to stop even crying as they had seen the school children crossing the road in a queue In the light of the said evidence the investigating officer felt that there was real intention on the part of the appellant driver of the bus to cause death of persons to whom harm may be caused by reason of hitting the bus and he was charged with offence punishable under Section So the act committed by the appellant was culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under Section Part II <ORG> did not find any substance in the plea of the appellant that the accused had not caused death either with the intention of causing death or with the intention to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or with the knowledge that he is likely to cause such act to cause the death The respective stand taken before <ORG> was re iterated in this appeal This section obviously does not apply to cases where there is an intention to cause death or knowledge that the act will in all probability cause death It only applies to cases in which without any such intention or knowledge death is caused by what is described as a rash and negligent act A negligent act is an act done without doing something which a reasonable man guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs would do or act which a prudent or reasonable man would not do in the circumstances attending it For purposes of the criminal law there are degrees of negligence and a very high degree of negligence is required to be proved before the felony is established Section A applies to cases where there is no intention to cause death and no knowledge that the act done in all probability will cause death Criminal rashness means hazarding a dangerous or wanton act with the knowledge that it is dangerous or wanton and the further knowledge that it may cause injury but done without any intention to cause injury or knowledge that it would probably be caused As noted above Rashness consists in hazarding a dangerous or wanton act with the knowledge that it is so and that it may cause injury Vehicular accidents resulting in deaths and injuries are spiraling It is contended by the learned counsel for the <ORG> that in a case of this nature two years sentence is grossly inadequate There is substance in this submission considering the increasing number of vehicular accidents resulting in death of large number of innocent persons The appeal is allowed to the aforesaid extent
