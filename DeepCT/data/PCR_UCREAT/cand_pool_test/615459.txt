The defendants have come up in appeal feeling aggrieved by the order dated passed by a learned Single Judge of this Court Original Side confirming the ex parte order of injunction and rejecting the defendants application for vacation of the ex parte order of injunction dated in a trade mark case There are a good number of medicines already in the market associated with treatment of liver ailments disorders using the word Liv as suggestive of liver and prefixing or suffixing words or figures so as to confer a distinction on the name associated with the manufacturer or trader Before dealing with the contentions of the parties we may refer to a few statutory provisions and settled principles in the field of trade marks First we may refer to a few provisions of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act A trade mark is a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods for the purpose of indicating or so as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods and some person having the right to use the mark ii In a passing off action the issue is Is the defendant selling goods so marked as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that they are the plaintiff goods iii In an infringement action the issue is Is the defendant using a mark which is the same as or which is colourable imitation of the plaintiff registered trade mark iv The element of deception or confusion becomes irrelevant in the second issue as the same is implicit inherent or presumed to be present One need not place side by side the two to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so whether they are of such character as to prevent one from being mistaken for the other Marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant recollection of the whole In <ORG> case supra <NAME> said the eye of the judge is the final arbiter but the Judge must not use if the expression be allowed his own eyes he has got to look at the articles with the eyes of the public who may be expected to buy those articles especially when the people who buy those articles include people of all classes including many persons living in the jungle uneducated illiterate and who may be regarded as equivalent to the incautious ignorant or unwary up country purchasers In arriving at the conclusion of fact as to whether deception or confusion is likely the court will have regard to a the nature and extent of the reputation relied upon the closeness or otherwise of the respective fields of activity in which the plaintiff and the defendant carry on business the similarity of the mark name etc used by the defendant to that of the plaintiff the manner in which the defendant makes use of the name mark etc Evidence may be called on the point but is not essential except in cases of doubt and the assistance it gives to the <ORG> will be of a limited nature unless it includes evidence of actual deception The learned counsel for the defendant appellant submitted that there are two very important relevant considerations which must be kept in view in deciding the case at hand The learned counsel has cited a host of authorities in support of his submission that a word or its abbreviation having become public juris ceases to be subject matter of proprietorship also ceases to be source of deception ar confusion for the person likely to deal with such goods would ignore the public juris and go distinguishing the products by the prefixes and or suffixes It is not that airy man in the street would just reach the counter in a shop ask for the goods by spelling out the trade mark and the salesman would hand over one or the other of the two goods which would be carried away by the unwary customer unmindful of what he intended to purchase and what he in fact got into his hands We find merit in both the contentions so advanced A word or words used by a number of firms as part of their designation may be considered as words in common use See Law of Trade Mark and Passing Off Narayanan th Edn We would first deal with the cases generally associated with this aspect and then pass over to the medicinal cases arising in the field of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations Now it is well recognised principle that has to be taken into account in considering the possibility of confusion arising between any two trade marks that where those two marks contain a common element which is also contained in a number of other marks in use in the same market such a common occurrence in the market tends to cause purchasers to pay more attention to the other features of the respective marks and to distinguish between them by those features It was descriptive of the micro technology used for production of many electronic goods which daily come to the market There is not even the remotest chance of the buyers and users being misguided or confused by the two trade names and logos Their Lordships then concluded If it be viewed simply as a word mark consisting COCA and COLA joined by a hyphen and the fact be borne in mind that COLA is a word in common use in Canada in naming beverages it is plain that the distinctive feature in the hyphenated word is the first word Coca and not Cola The letters and in DROPOVIT and the corresponding letters and in PROTOVIT cannot possibly be slurred over in pronunciation and the words are so dissimilar that there is no reasonable probability of confusion between the words either from the visual or phonetic point of view It was held If the fact be borne in mind that the distinctive feature of the mark ALKASELTZER is the first word Alka and not Seltzer Alka rather than SELTZER is what would remain in the average memory Their Lordship held It is quite obvious that once you get a statutory regulation of the channels of supply is essential that the court in considering the possibilities of deception should be taken into account the extent to which such a possibility is minimised or perhaps obliterated altogether by the statutory regulations What we are concerned with are not unlikely cases which may happen once in one hundred years but reasonable probabilities and we have to ask ourselves in relation to those facts Is there such a risk that a doctor or a chemist or the two of them in combination by some carelessness in expression some obscurity in handwriting some slip of recollection or some careless mistake which you would not expect highly trained professional people to fail into will refer to the product in such a way as will lead the court to say that there is a reasonable probability of confusion It seems to me that if one is really to give weight to such a risk it involves attributing to those highly skilled experienced and careful people to whom the <ORG> has entrusted and to whom alone the <ORG> has entrusted the precautions necessary under the Poisons Act qualities of carelessness or incompetence which although may exist in a person here and there on occasions that of course cannot be denied are not usually found in that class of persons One of the relevant considerations kept in view by the DB vide para was that the goods being Schedule drugs were obtainable only on doctor prescription It was further held that there was no phonetic similarity and there was no cause for confusion there were several medicinal oils using THENNAMARAKKUDI a geographical name as part of trade mark We may briefly refer to several other cases throwing light on the point However a few additional considerations arise when dealing with cases of such drugs which cannot be sold except on prescription of a doctor and which are sold only by such persons who have special knowledge or expertise in the field If the two trade marks by two competing traders use a generic word or an expression public juris common to both the trade marks it has to be seen if the customers who purchase the goods would be guided by the use of such word expression or would ignore it and give emphasis to prefixes or suffixes or words used in association therewith Having examined the two cartons we are clearly of the opinion that there is no possibility of one being accused of deceptively similar with the other and the likely customer mistaking one with the other even by recollecting faint impressions Sufficient it to observe that it was in the facts and circumstances of each of the above said cases that the defendant trade name trade mark was found to be offending and hence restrained Therefore every case must depend on its own particular facts and the value of authorities lies not so much in the actual decision as in the tests applied for determining what is likely to deceive or cause confusion Their Lordships formed an opinion that the use of the word DHARA was not of itself decisive of the matter in the facts found in that case However we would like to deal with the plea raised on behalf of the defendant appellant before us just as it was raised before the learned Single Judge though unsuccessfully demanding instantaneous vacating of the ex parte order of injunction even without going into the merits of the case solely because the plaintiff respondent had failed to discharge its obligation mandatorily cast by the proviso to Rule of Order of <ORG> The injunction granted in favour of the plaintiff is liable to set aside on this ground alone Rule carves out an exception in favour of granting an injunction without notice to the opposite party where it appears that the object of granting injunction would be defeated by the delay Their Lordships have observed The imperative nature of the proviso has to be judged in the context of Rule of Order of the Code Before the proviso aforesaid was introduced Rule said the court shall in all cases except where it appears that the object of granting the injunction would be defeated by the delay before granting an injunction direct notice of the application for the same to be given to the opposite party The proviso was introduced to provide a condition where court proposes to grant an injunction without giving notice of the application to the opposite party being of the opinion that the subject of granting injunction itself shall be defeated by delay The condition so introduced is that the court shall record the reasons why an ex parte order of injunction was being passed in the facts and circumstances of a particular case In this background the requirement for recording the reasons for grant of ex parte injunction cannot be held to be a mere formality This requirement is consistent with the principle that a party to a suit who is being restrained from exercising a right which such party claims to exercise either under a statute or under the common law must be informed why instead of following the requirement of Rule the procedure prescribed under the proviso has been followed The party which invokes the jurisdiction of the court for grant of an order of restraint against a party without affording an opportunity to him of being heard must satisfy the court about the gravity of the situation and court has to consider briefly these factors in the ex parte order We are quite conscious of the fact that there are other statutes which contain similar provisions requiring the court or the authorities concerned to record reasons before exercising power vested in them But same cannot be said in respect of the proviso to Rule of Order Such ex parte orders have far reaching effect as such a condition has been imposed that court must record reasons before passing such order Proviso to Rule of Order of the Code attracts the principle that if a statute requires a thing to be done in a particular manner it should be done in that manner or not all We are of the opinion that if the court is satisfied of non compliance by the applicant with the provisions contained in the proviso then on being so satisfied the court which was persuaded to grant an ex parte ad interim injunction confiding in the applicant that having been shown indulgence by the court he would comply with the requirements of the proviso it would simply vacate the ex parte order of injunction without expressing any opinion of the merits of the case leaving it open to the parties to have a hearing on the grant or otherwise on the order of injunction but bi part only
