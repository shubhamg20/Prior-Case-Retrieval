JUDGMENT <NAME> In this writ petition the petitioners are challenging the validity and levy of excise duty in respect of Sliver which is obtained by them as an in process material in the manufacture of woollen yarn in its factory premises Thereafter the combed sliver is given a false twist and rolled into balls to form wool tops which are used in the manufacture of worsted yarn It is contended by the petitioners that this sliver which is not processed by combing false twisting or winding into balls is not traded in the market and in other wolds is not a marketable commodity The contention of the petitioners being that they were not liable to pay any excise duty inter alia for the reasons that sliver could not be described as being goods which are known to the market and there was no manufacture in respect thereof It was also contended that there was no removal of the goods within the meaning of Rules and of the <ORG> Rules Petitioners made representation against the said rejections but before any final decision could be taken or the representation disposed of the present writ petition was filed Before us three contentions have been raised on behalf of the petitioners It is contended that if the product is not removed from the factory and is only obtained at an intermediary stage within a process in the factory there is no removal and there can be no liability for the payment of excise duty If the product which is sought to be taxed is not goods as known to the market and in fact are not marketable then under the aforesaid entry of list I and also under section of the Act no excise duty can be levied It is contended that it is only such a marketable commodity which is produced as a result of manufacturing process which can be subjected to excise duty We however feel that it is not necessary to go into this aspect of the matter because in our opinion the writ petition is liable to be allowed on the third contention raised by the petitioner Section of the Act reads as under THEREshall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India and a duty on salt manufactured in or imported by land into any part of India as and at the rates set forth in the First Schedule Section of the said Act prescribes the mode of computing the value of the excisable goods Section a which is relevant to this case as well as sub section i read as under Where under this Act the duty of excise is chargeable on any excisable goods with reference to value such value shall subject to the other provisions of this section be deemed to be a the normal price thereof that is to say the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by the assessed to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale For the purposes of this section a place of removal means i a factory or any other place or premises of production or manufacture of the excisable goods It will thus be seen that reading sections and together the duty of excise is levied with reference to the value of the goods at the time and place of the removal and is to be collected in the manner which is prescribed in the Rules The relevant Rules in this behalf are Rules and the relevant portions of which read as under No excisable goods shall be removed from the place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the Collector this behalf whether for consumption export or manufacture of any other commodity in or outside such place until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed in these Rules or as the Collector may require and except on presentation of an application in the proper form and on obtaining the permission of the proper officer on the form Payment of duty shall not be required in respect of excisable goods made in a factory until they are about to be issued out of the place or premises specified under rule or are about to be removed from a store room or other place of storage approved by the Collector under rule Rule it will be seen makes it clear that payment of duty is required to be made only when the goods are removed from the place or premises specified under rule or from an approved place of storage Reading the aforesaid provisions together it is evident that duty can be charged only when excisable goods are removed from the place of manufacture in this case the factory and at the value which it may have at the time of removal from the place of manufacture The question which now arises is whether any duty can be levied when there is no removal from the place of manufacture We are of the opinion that in this view of the matter as there is no removal from the place of manufacture no duty of excise can be levied and recovered One plant manufactured Calcium Carbide which was used in the manufacture of acetylene gas in their acteylene gas plant It was held by this court that as Calcium Carbide is not removed from the factory the point of time at which the value of the product had to be determined under section was not reached and consequently the question of levy and collection of duty did not arise The definition covers the present case because the calcium carbide is manufactured in one part of the factory while the acetylene gas is manufactured in another part thereof It cannot be said therefore that the so called calcium carbide made by the petitioner is removed from the factory in which it is made Mr <NAME> on behalf of the respondents has referred to two decisions While construing rule it was observed as follows RULE which we have read earlier in terms lays down that no excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced or any specified premises appurtenant thereto whether for consumption export or manufacture of any other commodity in or outside such place until the excise duly leviable has been paid It obviously makes no reference to the plant or equipment The consumption of the product contemplated by rule is consumption of the product by itself and not for converting it into another product as in the case of Polymer Chips The integrated continuous process contemplated by Rule read with Rules in Chapter A comes to an end when no further processing is to be done of that particular product and thereafter if such product is utilised for consumption or what in excise parlance is known as home consumption or exported or used for manufacture of any other commodity in or outside the place of manuacuture the excise levy is attracted We understand the expression of the removal of the product from one stream of production into another stream of production as having reference to the place of manufacture or production as specified under rule of the said Rules as would be evident from the judgment itself when it was observed by the <ORG> that excise duty is attracted on all excisable goods which are produced as and when the same are removed within the meaning of rules and of the Excise Rules In the said case it was he that under rule excise duty must be paid before the goods are removed from the place where they are produced or manuactured It was however observed that unless the place was specified in the license it was not open to the manufacturer of any excisable goods to carry on manufacturing activity and for the purpose of rule it is the place specified in the license concerned that is the place where the goods are produced or manufactured and it is the removal from the place thus specified in the license in question that is the place referred to in rule Mr <NAME> also referred to Rule first proviso which reads as under Every assessed shall keep an account current with the Collector separately for each excisable goods falling under different items of the First Schedule to the Act in such form and manner as the Collector may require of the duties payable on the excisable goods and in particular such account and also the account in Form if the assessed is availing of the procedure prescribed in rule shall be maintained in triplicate by using indelible pencil and doublesided carbon and the assessed shall periodically make credit in such account current by cash payment into the treasury so as to keep the balances in such accounts current sufficient to cover the duty due on the goods intended to be removed at any time and every such assessed shall pay the duty determined by him for each consignment by debit to such account current before removal of the goods Provided that i the duty on the goods consumed within the factory in a continuous process may be so paid at the end of the factory day except that in the case of cotton yarn in respect of which duty is payable in accordance with the provisions of sub rule of rule the duty due may be paid by the manufacturer in accordance with the provisions of the said rule We have however held that the duty can be collected only if the goods are removed from the place of manufacture specified under rule It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the sliver which is obtained by them are not goods which are manufactured by them within the meaning of rule of the Excise Rules Parties to bear their own costs
