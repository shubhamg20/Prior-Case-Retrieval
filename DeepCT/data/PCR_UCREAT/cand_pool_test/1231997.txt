There is neither intendment nor equity in a taxing statute It should be interpreted and construed as per the words the legislature has chosen to employ in the Act or Rules There is no room for assumptions or presumptions The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Common questions of law arose for decision in these appeals need disposal by this judgment The appellants after filing their reply thereto and having had personal hearing by proceeding dated November the <ORG> Soap in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power or of steam for heating Soap household and laundry a Plain bars of not less than Rupees one pound in weight fives annas four per cwt Later it was amended in the year empowering the <ORG> The appellants too intially treated toilet soap as other sorts but later on legal opinion they claimed them as household soaps There is neither intendment nor equity in a taxing statute There is no room for assumption or presumptions Where the words of the statute are plain and clear there is no room for applying any of the principles of interpretation which are merely presumption in cases of ambiguity in the statute Strictly speaking there is no place in such cases for interpretation or construction except where the words of statute admit of two meanings Therefore one has to gather its meaning in the legal setting to discover the object which the Act seeks to serve and the purpose of the amendment brought about In <NAME> <NAME> AIR SC a Constitution bench held as follows The ordinary rule of construction is the provision of a statute must be construed in accordance with the language used therein unless there are compelling reasons such as where a leteral construction would reduce the provision to absurdity or prevent manifest intention of the legislature from being carried out It was contended that betal leaves are vegetable and therefore they are exempted from the payment of sales tax While construing item this court held that the words must be construed not in any technical sense nor from the botanical point of view but as understood in common parlance It has not been defined in the Act and being a word of every day use it must be construed in its popular sense meaning that sense which people conversant with the subject matter with which the statute is dealing would attribute SCR at this Court held that it is well settled that in interpreating items in statutes like the Excise Tax Acts or Sales Tax Act whose primary object is to raise revenue and for which purpose they classify diverse products articles and substances resort should be had not to the scientific anti technical meaning of the terms or expression used but to their popular meaning that is to say the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them AIR SC when the revenue contended that metalised yarn fell within general Tariff entry yarn and synthetic fibres this court held that entry A first schedule of Central Excise Salt Act specific entry relating to articles made of plastics of all sorts and metalised yam wax exigible to lessor tariff duty The contention of the <ORG> which finds favour with the tribunal that the legislative history and memorandum appended to the Finance Bill would furnish aid to the construction of the word household soap is not apposite to the fact situation When there is ambiguity in the word statement and objects the legislative history the memorandum appended to the Bill and the speech of the mover of the Bill are relevant material to discover the intention intention of the legislature SCC at para this Court held that for determining the purpose or object of the legislation it is permissible to look into the circumstances which prevailed at the time when the law was made the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill which actuated the step to provide a remedy for the then existing malady can be used for the limited purpose of appreciating the background and the antecedent state of affairs leading to the legislation The memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill which were not part of the Notes on Clauses appended to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Bill cannot be used to draw support therefrom as it is not an accurate guide of the final Act There is no quarrel with the proposition that in ascertaining the meaning of the word or a clause or sentence in the statute in its interpretation everything which is logically relevant should be admissible In this case also the question whether toilet soap is a household soap had arisen within a short period after the Amendment Act came into force Therefore the understanding by the executive and its interpretation in bringing toilet soap in sub item other sorts instead of item household being of formative period of statutory operation the doctrine became inapplicable We do not propose to go into the question of refund as it is a matter to be dealt with by the authorities concerned in accordance with the law The appellants shall have to apply for refund and the authorities shall be required to deal with it in accordance with law In the circumstances parties are directed to bear their own costs
