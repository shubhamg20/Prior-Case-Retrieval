<ORG> Ahmednagar and another are in appeal against an order of <ORG> Aurangabad Bench in Writ Petition No of wherein the Writ Petition filed by the respondent Nos to herein <NAME> and two others was allowed and <ORG> was directed to make over vacant possession of the land bearing CTS No A situated at Ahmednagar to the petitioners within a period of three months from the date of the Judgment <ORG> further directed the writ petitioners to refund the amount of compensation received by them for the acquired land within a period of four weeks from the date of handing over the possession of the land to them by the respondent <ORG> along with certain consequential orders Subsequent thereto however the Writ Petition was amended for issuance of a Writ of Certiorari for quashing and setting aside the notification dated th May issued under Section I of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act hereinafter referred to as the Act read with Section of the Land Acquisition Act While addressing on behalf of the petitioners herein Mr <NAME> learned Solicitor General severely criticised the judgment of <ORG> and contended that <ORG> should have taken note of the element of delay in moving the Court Mr <NAME> pointed out that whereas the notice for acquisition was issued in and the Award was passed and possession was taken in the year the Writ Petition was filed in the year i to say after expiry of years from the date of notification and years from the date of making over possession and the Award The Bombay High <ORG> in <NAME> case supra stated that the question is one of discretion to be followed in the fact arid circumstances of each case and further stated The real test for sound exercise of discretion by <ORG> in this regard is not the physical running of time such but the test is whether by reason of delay there is such negligence on the part of the petitioner so as to infer that he has given up his claim or where the petitioner has moved <ORG> the rights of the third parties have come into being which should not be allowed to disturb unless there is reasonable explanation for the delay In the Judgment Impugned in this appeal <ORG> stated It may be stated that in the instant case the respondent No not only failed to take steps even after passing of the Award in but attempted to change the public purpose even thereafter in and It is only in the additional affidavit in reply on and that too in reply to amendment made to the Writ Petition by the petitioners that for the first time a contention is raised as to the delay and laches in filing the petition Mr <NAME> the learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents contended that Since his is a continuing wrong the question of the claim being time barred or the conduct being barred under the laws of limitation does not and cannot arise <ORG> has in fact proceeded on the basis of the equitable principle as it appeared from the observations of <ORG> as set out hereinbelow In the present case the respondent No has in fact did nothing except by passing resolution for modification of the public purpose for which the land was acquired rather than actually making use of the land for which it was acquired or possession of which was taken after passing of the award On equitable principle me petitioners are entitled to reliefs even if there is delay in filing the Writ Petition It is now a well settled principle of law and we need not dilate on this score to the effect that while no period of limitation is fixed but in the normal course of events the period the party is required for filing a civil proceeding ought to be the guiding factor While it is true that this extraordinary jurisdiction is available to mitigate the sufferings of the people in general but it is not out of place to mention that this extraordinary jurisdiction has been conferred on to the law courts under Article of the Constitution on a very sound equitable principle Hence the equitable doctrine namely delay defects equity has its fullest application in the matter of grant of relief under Article of the Constitution <ORG> as a matter of fact lost sight of the fact that since the year the land was specifically reserved for public purposes of school playground and roads in the development plan and may reason therefore the notification to acquire the land has therefore been issued under the provisions of the Act as stated above The learned Single Judge and <ORG> have held that the acquired land having already vested in the <ORG> after receipt of compensation by the predecessor in title of the appellants they have no right to challenge the notification Incidentally the decision last noted was also on the land acquisition and requisition under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act and in paragraph of the report this Court observed It is well settled law mat when there is inordinate delay in filing me writ petition and when all steps token in the acquisition proceedings have become final the <ORG> should be loath to quash the notifications <ORG> has no doubt discretionary powers under Article of the Constitution to quash the notification under Section and declaration under Section When the award was passed and possession was taken the <ORG> should not have exercised its power to quash the award which is a material factor to be taken into consideration before exercising the power under Article The fact that no third party rights were created in the case is hardly ground for interference <ORG> of the High <ORG> was not right in interfering with the discretion exercised by the learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition on the grounds of laches The Writ Petition filed by the respondents in <ORG> is dismissed and as such the I A No filed in SLP No of also stands dismissed
