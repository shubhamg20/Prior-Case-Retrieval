The Trial Judge acquitted him by holding i that there was no motive for him to cause the murder ii that there were vital contradictions between the statement of the doctors who examined the deceased and that the conviction could not be based on the testimony of doctor before whom the dying declaration was made by the deceased and iii that the investigation was defective because a no one from the locality was produced the nurse and the compounder who took down the injury report on the dictation of the doctor was not examined and no incriminating material was found at the site The State preferred an appeal before <ORG> against the acquittal order which allowed the appeal set aside the order of acquittal passed by <ORG> and convicted the accused under Section of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment While caution is the watchword in appeal against acquittal as the Trial Judge has occasion to watch the demeanour of witnesses and interference should not be made merely because a different conclusion could have been ar rived the provisions contained in Sections and of the Code of Criminal Procedure do not Inhibit any restriction or limitation The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> In this appeal by grant of special leave under Article of Constitution of India the short ques tion that arises for consideration is if <ORG> committed any error of law in exercise of its powers under section read with section a of the Criminal Proce dure Code in allowing the appeal against acquittal and convicting the appellant under section of the Indian Penal Code and sentencing him to undergo life imprisonment It was further found by them that she did not die of accident nor she committed suicide There is thus little difference between the finding of the two courts on motive except for immediate cause He made an unsuccessful attempt to wash off its effect by stating that on his inquiry as to who burnt her she did not disclose name of anyone The Judge could not point out any contradiction on these important aspects but discarded the statement of Dr <NAME> and Dr <NAME> because there were contradictions as to how many persons were present during examination by these doctors and if even earlier such dying declaration was recorded in injury report and got endorsed by senior doctors and why the doc tors did not disclose it to anyone and why the report was written by compounder on dictation of Dr <NAME> and why was not he examined In this way there are vital contradic tions between the statements of Dr <NAME> and Dr <NAME> and on account of refutal by the statement of Dr <NAME> in my opinion prima facie it can be said that no reliance can be placed on the statements of Dr <NAME> and Dr <NAME> <ORG> after going into detail and examining the evidence of each of these witnesses has found that there was no material contradiction either on the question of presence of the two doctors of the sequence in which she was examined by them or in respect of recording of bed head ticket and the injury report <ORG> further was right in concluding that the statement made by her was correct and honest as apart from the statement of a dying person which is normally trustworthy there was no reason for her to disclose the name of <NAME> to Dr <NAME> or of brother in law to Dr <NAME> when her relations were strained with her in laws and the husband <ORG> has gone into this aspect in detail and has found that in fact the negligence if any was on the part of the investigating officer as despite having received the information he neither took care to preserve the site nor did he record the statement of any of the doctors before th August We also do not find any substance in it We per sued the injury report and we could not find any reason to doubt its authenticity Before parting with this case we consider it necessary to record that the judge was uncharitable in discarding the testimony of Dr <NAME> and doubting her truthfulness principally because she was a woman forgetting that she was a doctor of years standing and there was no reason for her to make the endorsement on the injury report other than stated that it was on request of Dr <NAME>
