<NAME> who first heard the matter considered that an authoritative decision was necessary on the point that had been raised and so referred the following question to a Bench The question that is raised in this petition is whether in view of Madras Act of which was introduced as an amendment to Section of the Opium Act Central Act of a confession made to a Prohibition Officer is admissible or not Section provides penalties for the contravention of Section and some other sections Section as it stood before it was amended in Madras conferred on certain categories of officers belonging to the departments of <ORG> <ORG> Customs Salt Opium and Revenue power of entry search seizure and arrest when they had reason to believe that opium liable to confiscation under the Act was kept or concealed in any building vessel or enclosed space It also confers powers of detention search and arrest It will be noticed that under the Act as it stood before it was amended though the officers of the <ORG> <ORG> and other departments were given powers to enter search seize and arrest they had no power to investigate There is no exhaustive definition of the expression Police Officer in any of our statutes Act of Indian Police Act merely says the word Police shall include all persons who shall be enrolled under this Act In the absence of a statutory definition and apart from all authority one would be tempted to say that a police officer is a person whom any statute or other provision of law calls such or on whom it confers all or substantially all the powers and imposes the duties of a police officer If he is expressly called a police officer there is no difficulty whatsoever If he is not so called then the next step is to ask what does the law require him to do What are the duties imposed on him and what are the powers conferred on him If these are substantially those of a police officer there need be no qualms in regarding him as one The material thing to consider would be not the name given to him nor the colour of the uniform he is required to wear tout his functions powers and duties A police officer does not cease to be such merely because he is put into a white <ORG> uniform instead of one in khaki drill a medicine will be just the same whether it is packaged in a glass jar or a plastic container The sub section of the ordinance ran as follows The Controller General and such Inspectors or other officers as may be empowered by <ORG> in this behalf shall within the respective areas for which they are appointed have power to investigate all offences punishable under this Ordinance and in conducting any such investigation Shall within the said areas have all the powers duties privileges and liabilities of an officer in charge of a police station under the Cr In Mahalakshmayya Emperor Mad WN Cr <NAME> ruled that a statement by an accused person to an Excise Inspector in answer to questions put by him is not a confession made to a police officer within the meaning of Section of the Evidence Act No doubt he went on to add It appears to me that as Section refers only to a police officer a court should not extend it to other classes of officers merely on grounds of similarity of function especially in view of the fact that the Evidence Act was introduced at a time when the methods of the police were much more open to attack than they are now In Mayilvahanam In re AIR Mad <NAME> had to consider the position of an Assistant Inspector of <ORG> and he took the same view that had been taken in the earlier decisions of this <ORG> It seems to me that none of these decisions are in point because they belong to a time before the Central Opium Act was amended by <ORG> in In AIR Bom FB the following question was formulated for the decision of the <ORG> Is an Abkari Officer who in the conduct of investigation of an offence punishable under the Bombay Abkari Act exercises the powers conferred by the Criminal Procedure Code upon an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence a police officer within the meaning of Section of the Evidence Act All the learned Judges there were five of them were unanimously of the opinion that the question should be answered in the affirmative It appears to me that they looked too narrowly to the appearance of things and declined to look at the substance behind the appearance I prefer the view taken by <ORG> in Bombay and in Calcutta and would say that in relation to an offence under the Opium Act a Prohibition Officer on whom <ORG> has conferred the powers of an officer in charge of a police station is a police officer for purposes of Section Cr The question to be answered by us is Is the Excise Officer who exercises the powers conferred by the Criminal Procedure Code in charge of police station in the conduct of an investigation of an offence against excise laws a police officer within the meaning of Section of the Evidence Act and Section Cr An objection was taken on behalf of the accused to the admissibility of the statement on the ground that the officer to whom the statement was made was a police officer within the meaning of Section Cr The question whether an excise officer was a police officer and the confession made to him in the course of investigation was to be excluded by virtue of the provisions of Section of the Evidence Act came up for consideration in a number of cases in this Court In Mad WN Cr Sundaram Chetty held that an admission made by an accused person to an excise inspector could not be ruled out as it could not be regarded as a confession made to a police officer coming under Section of the Evidence Act In AIR Mad <NAME> took the same view although there was no reference to the two earlier case Referring to a Calcutta case which will be alluded to presently and which expressed the opinion that an excise officer was a police officer within the ambit of Section of the Evidence Act the learned Judge distinguished that case on the ground that it was based on Special provisions of the Bengal Excise Act which made excise officers for purposes of excise offences police officers The scope of a statement made to an assistant inspector of customs by an accused person in the course of an investigation fell to be considered by <NAME> in AIR Mad Section of the Opium Act provided Every person arrested and thing seized under Section or Section shall be forwarded without delay to the officer in charge of the nearest police station and every person arrested and thing seized under Section shall be forwarded without delay to the officer by whom the warrant was issued and any other thing which he has reason to believe to be liable to confiscation under Section or any other law for the time being in force relating to opium and detain and search and it he thinks proper arrest any person whom he has reason to believe to be guilty of any offence relating to such opium under this or any other law for the time being in force Section confers on an officer of the said departments powers to seize in any open place or in transit any opium and detain search and arrest any person who is believed to be guilty of an offence against this or any other such law It is thus seen that any of the officers mentioned in Section of the Opium Act has only power to seize the articles involved in a crime whether they are in an enclosed place or an open place and detain search or arrest any person Suspected of having committed any offence against the statute He has no power to investigate into these crimes and he can only forward the person and the things seized without any delay to the officer in charge of the nearest police station That it does bring about a change in respect of powers to be exercised by those officers in the detection of crimes is beyond question Section of the Evidence Act says No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence enacts I No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this chapter shall if reduced into writing be signed by the person making it nor shall any such statement or any record thereof whether in a police diary or otherwise or any part such statement or record be used for any purpose save as hereinafter provided at any inquiry or trial in respect of any offence under investigation at the time when such statement was made The section of the Act which the learned Judges of <ORG> had to consider was Section which provided that every Abkari officer not below such rank as Government may prescribe shall within the area for which he is appointed have power to investigate all offences punishable under this Act Sub section provided that such officer shall in the conduct of such investigaton exercise the powers conferred by the Criminal Procedure Code upon an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence In that case the learned Judges decided that an Abkari Officer invested with powers of an officer in charge of the police station under Section of the Abkari Act was a police officer coming under the rule embodied in Section of the Evidence Act The ground for the decision was that as the <ORG> had deliberately conferred upon an Abkari Officer substantially all the powers of a police officer he had in effect become a police officer coming within the purview of Section of the Evidence Act For this reason it was held there that any confession made to such an officer under the Abkari Act or the Criminal Procedure Code was inadmissible in evidence All that was meant by the expression police officer in Section of the Evidence Act was an officer who exercises the powers of the police conferred on him by law by whatever name he is called The learned Chief Justice Courtney Terrell observes that he found himself in complete disagreement with the arguments which found favour in the Bombay case According to him there was a fallacy in the judgment of <ORG> which was attributable to two causes It does not appear to me that the Judges of <ORG> in any way misunderstood the scope of the dictum in Cal Reliance was placed by <NAME> in the Bombay case on Cal only for the purpose of showing that the term police officer was not used in a restricted sense but has a wider import Nor can I bring myself to agree with <ORG> that the Judges of <ORG> adopted an erroneous canon of construction It looks to me that the legislature must have used that expression in a larger sense than that attributed to it by <ORG> Subsequent to the ruling of <ORG> an identical point arose for consideration before a Full Bench of five Judges of <ORG> in AIR Pat FB The answer given by <ORG> by a majority was that the <ORG> in using the term police officer in Section of the Evidence Act did not intend to exclude from its meaning Excise officers exercising powers of detection and investigation of crimes committed against excise laws There is an exhaustive discussion of the topic and the opposing views expressed in AIR Bom FB and AIR Pat are also considered Discussing the connotation of the term police officer in the light of the relevant provisions of Police Act of he Stated that police officers were officers whose duty was to prevent and detect crimes The learned Judge also referred to one of the meanings given to that expression in the Oxford Dictionary viz The civil force to which is entrusted the duty of maintaining public order enforcing regulation for the prevention and punishment of breaches of the law and detecting crime construed as plural the members of a police force the constabulary of a locality as throwing light on the import of that term The statutory provision which formed the subject matter of inquiry before the Bench consisting of Sir <NAME> and <NAME> was Sub section of Section of the Hoarding and Profiteering Prevention Ordinance of Sub section of Section reads as follows The Controller General and such inspectors or other officers as may be empowered by <ORG> in this behalf shall within the respective areas for which they are appointed have power to investigate all offences punishable under this Ordinance and in conducting any such investigation shall within the said areas have all the powers duties privileges and liabilities of an officer in charge of a police station under the Criminal Procedure Code when investigating a cognizable offence within the limits of his station By virtue of this provision <ORG> gave certain officers of <ORG> power to investigate offences within their respective jurisdictions That he is a police officer within the meaning of the section we have no doubt whatever Therefore he has the full status of a police officer and his powers and duties must be limited to those of a police officer under the Criminal Procedure Code which means that he has no right in an investigation under the Ordinance to require a person to Sign a statement and where such a statement is reduced to writing it can only be used in accordance with the provisions of Section Cr This decision was distinguished by <NAME> in AIR Mad already referred to on the ground that it was based exclusively on the phraseology employed in Sub section of Section of the said Ordinance which specifically mentioned that the officers concerned should have all the powers duties privileges and liabilities of an officer in charge of a police station <NAME> as he then was in AIR Mad to which reference had been already made in distinguishing Calcutta and <ORG> decisions in AIR Cal FB and AIR Bom FB stated that an identical conclusion could be reached if there was a similar provision in any other enactment In the light of the above rulings and on a careful consideration of the relevant statutory provisions I have reached the conclusion that the term police officer is used in Section of the Evidence Act with reference to the functions exercised by the officer and not as an officer of the police department It only means an officer exercising certain powers and is not confined to an officer belonging to the police department I may add In recent times the need to pass laws intended to regulate social and economic life of the people and to add to the revenues of the country as well has indeed become very great This had led to the Legislatures investing the officers appointed for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of these enactments to check the evasion thereof and to prevent and detect crimes created under various enactments and to bring the offenders to justice with powers of investigation that deals with the investigations and when the power of an officer in charge of the police station for the purpose of investigation is conferred upon an officer under Section A of the Opium Act all the sections of that Chapter should be held applicable to such a case In these circumstances the conclusion I have reached is that an excise officer invested with the powers of an officer in charge of a police station for investigation of offences under Section A of the Opium Act is a police officer coming within the purview of Section of the Evidence Act and Section Cr and any confession made to him in the course of investigation is inadmissible under Section of the Evidence Act and the statements made to such an officer under Section Cr
