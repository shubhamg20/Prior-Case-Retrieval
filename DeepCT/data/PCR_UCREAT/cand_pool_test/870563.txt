This appeal is directed against the order in original dt He held that by their actions the goods are liable for confiscation and also they are liable for penalty under Section a of the <ORG> Act He imposed a penalty of Rs After the matter was decided by the <ORG> in favour of the <ORG> the appellants took the matter to Hon ble <ORG> of India This was said when the Counsel for the <ORG> emphasised on the circumstances that the importer had obtained the import of the goods free of duty relying on the Notification granting exemption from customs duty in terms of proviso to Section of the <ORG> Act and also demanded as to why the goods concerned should not be held liable to confiscation under Section of the <ORG> Act and why a penalty should not be imposed under Section a of the <ORG> Act The Learned Collector after dealing with the matter on the liability to pay the duty under Notification somehow has dealt with time bar aspect without keeping in view the previous proceedings and dropping of duty demand by the Collector <NAME> The first important aspect of the matter is as to whether the <ORG> can initiate the proceedings by issue of fresh show cause notice dt months after the earlier proceedings having culminated by the judgment of <ORG> rendered on As can be seen from the judgment of the Hon ble <ORG> the <ORG> had raised the arguments before <ORG> that the importer had obtained import of the goods free of duty by relying on the Notification granting exemption from the customs duty The Hon ble <ORG> after noting such arguments of the <ORG> proceeded to say that the intention is therefore relevant for the issue before the court to the limited extent that it lends support to the construction of List of Appendix in the manner the court interpreted it In view of the findings given on the time bar and the unsustainability of the proceedings the question of entering into the merits would not arise in the present case We notice that on this aspect of the matter <ORG> has very clearly held in para that although there is no express prohibition the re export as such of items of goods specified in List and imported into India is prohibited by necessary implication by the language of and the scheme underlying the grant of OGL in regard to them The Learned DR submitted that there is mis declaration and that the appellants were required to have declared in the Bill of Entry the purpose for which the imported goods are required that they would be used in India only or would be sold in India or would be exported outside India without any process of manufacture being carried out The expression home consumption has also in the context no clear or definite meaning and raised a lot of conundrums if literally interpreted to mean that imported goods should always be consumed in India The court raised question that is it home consumption if the importer does not use the goods himself but sells them At what point of time should the importer make up his mind whether he proposes to sell the imported goods in India or wishes to export them outside The Court again raised the question that is the condition infringed if a purchaser of goods from the importer sells it to buyer in a foreign country Will it be permissible for the importer to use the imported goods in the manufacture of other goods which he proposes to export <ORG> answered that all these uncertainties in the connotation of the expression home consumption preclude one from giving an interpretation to this expression that the imported goods cannot be at all exported and incline one to hold that in the context it is only used in contrast to the expression for warehousing The above general consideration apart there are other indications in the statute which show that the Act does not prohibit the export of imported goods Whether to deposit the goods in warehouse or not is an option given to the importer There is nothing in the provisions of the Act to compel an importer even before or when importing the goods to make up his mind whether he is going to use or sell them in India or whether he proposes to re export them The question raised by the <ORG> in the present case are also answered by <ORG> as can be clearly noted Member I am writing my separate order as under Proviso to Section of the <ORG> Act provides that where any duty has not been levied or has not been short levied or erroneously refunded by reason of collusion or any wilful mis statement or suppression of facts by the importer or the exporter the provisions of Sub section will have the effect as if for the words Proper Officer the words Collector of <ORG> and for the words One Year and Six Months the words Five Years were substituted Collector of <ORG> Kandla has jurisdiction only in regard to Port at Kandla and such other areas as are specified in the Notification issued by the Government Likewise Collector of <ORG> Bombay has jurisdiction in regard to matters pertaining to specified Bombay region There are of course a few officers appointed as Collectors with all India jurisdiction such as the Director of Revenue Intelligence but the Collector of <ORG> Cochin is not one among them In these circumstances we hold that the Collector of <ORG> Cochin had no jurisdiction to demand duty in the present case and consequently we set aside the demand dated as amended <ORG> in exercise of powers conferred by Sub section of Section of <ORG> Act have appointed officers mentioned in Column of the Table appended to the Notification to be Collectors of <ORG> In fact Collector of <ORG> <ORG> while dropping the demand himself admitted that he had no jurisdiction in relation to the matter pertaining to duty <ORG> held that the circumstances that these items are also exempt from customs duty at the time of import also lends support to the conclusion that the goods so permitted are not meant for re export <ORG> therefore held We are therefore of the opinion that although there is no express prohibition the re export as such of items of goods specified in List and imported into India is prohibited by necessary implication by the language of and the scheme underlying the grant of OGL in regard to them In the light of this it is obvious that the appellants when they imported goods and claimed duty free exemption already knew that they would be exporting the goods and they knew also that they could not export these goods without subjecting them to certain processes and therefore as was contended by the <ORG> before <ORG> they put up a facade of taking the goods to Ankleshwar after their import allegedly for being subjected to some processes <ORG> in case of <NAME> ECR SC held that extended period is applicable where there was wilful mis statement and suppression of facts by the importer There is nothing on the record to show that the appellant had informed the customs authorities that the machinery to be imported would be transferred by the appellant to the <ORG> and the <ORG> would install the same On the other hand the endorsement on the import licence submitted with the Bill of Entry which contained a declaration by a partner of the appellant and the statements contained in the application from for Registration dated November indicated that the appellant would be using the imported machinery for substantial expansion of its existing unit and on that basis the appellant was assessed for duty at a concessional rate under Head ing No of the Customs Tariff Since the appellant did not install the said machinery for the expansion of its existing unit but transferred it to the <ORG> after it had been cleared from the customs the appellant cannot claim the benefit of the concessional rate of duty under Heading No of the Customs Tariff and is liable to pay such duty at the normal rates prescribed in the Customs Tariff In Sub section of Section it is prescribed that a notice shall be served on the person chargeable with the duty requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice In the circumstances the Collector was justified in directing that the goods in question should be re assessed to duty on merits under the appropriate heading of the Customs Tariff without giving the benefit of the assessment under Heading and to collect the short levy from the appellant Considering goods had been contracted for export even prior to import and yet they claimed exemption when they knew such exemption could not be availed of in case goods were for re export as such extended period for demanding duty was sustainable In view of difference of opinion between the Members the following question arises for determination by Third Member on reference of the matter by Hon ble President Whether the appeal is required to be allowed in terms of findings given by Member <ORG> in his order The facts are set out in the first eight paragraphs of the order of the judicial member order and therefore I do not propose to repeat them Going by the plain meaning of the policy and the notification the appellant had every reason to believe that the goods were intended to be imported under OGL and were exempt from duty when they were imported The point if any in export has been wiped out and there is no reason to deny the importation There is no material to show this and the order itself says that he came to know from intelligence <ORG> in MJ Exports CEGAT in para itself noted that there nothing in the provisions of the <ORG> Act to compel an importer even before or when importing the goods to make up his mind whether he is going to use or sell them in India or whether he proposes to re export them In that situation obviously the extended period could not be invoked on the ground that there was suppression of facts or mis statement This would also lend support to the plea that there was no bar to export of such goods For the extended period provided in the proviso to Section to apply in the facts of this case it must be shown that the appellant while being aware that the benefit of the notification would not be available for the reason that export of goods subsequent to import under and clearance under the notification was not permissible suppressed from the department the fact that the goods were to be exported When once the Collector of <ORG> <NAME> admits that he has no jurisdiction and says so his subsequent observation that the demand for duty is unsustainable cannot be binding On this point I agree with the views expressed by the Member Technical There is therefore no difference of opinion on this aspect
