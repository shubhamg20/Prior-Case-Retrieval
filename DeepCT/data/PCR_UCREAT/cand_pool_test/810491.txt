Supreme Court can grant compensation for deprivation of a fundamental right HEADNOTE The petitioner who was detained in prison for over years after his acquittal filed a habeas corpus petition under Art Article confers power on <ORG> to issue directions or orders or appropriate writs for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution Article which guarantees the right to life and liberty will be denuded of its significant content if the power of this Court were limited to passing orders of release from illegal detention One of the telling ways in which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Article secured is to mulct its a violators in the payment of monetary compensation The right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the <ORG> as a shield Therefore the <ORG> must repair the damage done by its officers to their rights A In the circumstances of the instant case the refusal to pass an order of compensation in favour of the petitioner will be doing mere lip service to his fundamental right to liberty which the <ORG> Government has so grossly violated Therefore as an interim measure the <ORG> must pay to the petitioner a further sum of Rs Though the petitioner was acquitted by <ORG> Muzaffarpur Bihar on June he was released from the jail on October that is to say more than years after he was acquitted The relief sought by the petitioner for his release thus became infructuous but despite that we directed that a Notice to show cause be issued to the State of Bihar regarding prayers and of the petition That accused <NAME> was of unsound mind at the time of passing the above order But it discloses no data on the basis of which he was adjudged insane the specific measures taken to cure him of that affliction and what is most important whether it took years to set right his mental imbalance dated May which according to paragraph of the affidavit was sent to <ORG> by the Superintendent of <ORG> <NAME> is not produced before us There is nothing to show that the petitioner was found insane on the very date of his acquittal And if he was insane on the date of acquittal he could not have been tried at all for the simple reason that an insane person cannot enter upon his defence Under the Code of Criminal Procedure insane persons have certain statutory rights in regard to the procedure governing their trial That takes us to the question as to how the grave injustice which has been perpetrated upon the petitioner can be rectified in so far as it lies within our power to do in the exercise of our writ jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution That article confers power on <ORG> to issue directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III The right to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III is guaranteed that is to say the right to move <ORG> under Article for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution is itself a fundamental right It is true that Article cannot be used as a substitute for the enforcement of rights and obligations which can be enforced efficaciously through the ordinary processes of Courts Civil and Criminal A money claim has therefore to be agitated in and adjudicated upon in a suit instituted in a court of lowest grade competent to try it But the important question for our consideration is whether in the exercise of its jurisdiction under article this Court can pass an order for the payment of money if such an order is in the nature of compensation consequential upon the deprivation of a fundamental right The petitioner could have been relegated to the ordinary remedy of a suit if his claim to compensation was factually controversial in the sense that a civil court may or may not have upheld his claim But we have no doubt that if the petitioner files a suit to recover damages for his illegal detention a decree for damages would have to be passed in that suit though it is not possible to predicate in the absence of evidence the precise amount which would be decreed in his favour In these circumstances the refusal of this Court to pass an order of compensation in favour of the petitioner will be doing mere lip service to his fundamental right to liberty which <ORG> has so grossly violated Article which guarantees the right to life and liberty will be denuded of its significant content if the power of this Court were limited to passing orders to release from illegal detention One of the telling ways in which the violation of that right can reasonably be prevented and due compliance with the mandate of Article secured is to mulct its violaters in the payment of monetary compensation Administrative sclerosis leading to flagrant infringements of fundamental rights cannot be corrected by any other method open to the judiciary to adopt The right to compensation is some palliative for the unlawful acts of instrumentalities which act in the name of public interest and which present for their protection the powers of the <ORG> as a shield If civilization is not to perish in this country as it has perished in some others too well known to suffer mention it is necessary to educate ourselves into accepting that respect for the rights of individuals is the true bastion of democracy Therefore the <ORG> must repair the damage done by its officers to the petitioner rights It may have recourse against those officers Taking into consideration the great harm done to the petitioner by <ORG> we are of the opinion that as an interim measure the State must pay to the petitioner a further sum of Rs A full dressed debate on the nice points of fact and law which takes place leisurely in compensation suits will have to await the filing of such a suit by the poor <NAME>
