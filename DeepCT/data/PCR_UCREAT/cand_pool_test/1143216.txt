It was urged on behalf of respondent No that the suit had not been brought within one year as prescribed by of the Act and was as such barred by limitation and that since the notice prescribed by Of the Act had admittedly not been served on the respondent the suit was incompetent It was found that in an earlier suit brought with the sanction of the Advocate General against <ORG> for their removal and the framing of a fresh scheme a decree had been passed against the appellants on October and it directed them not to interfere with the affairs of the <NAME> as members of the said Committee and to comply with the direction removing them from office It was contended on behalf of the appellants that Of the Act had no application and even if it had the suit was within time by virtue of the provisions of of the Limitation Act Held that the contentions raised on behalf of the appellants must be negatived Where a literal construction defeats the object of the statute and makes part of it meaningless it is legitimate to adopt a liberal construction that gives a meaning to the entire provision and makes it effective Rules of limitation are arbitrary in nature and in construing hem it is not permissible to import equitable considerations and effect must be given to tile strict grammatical meaning of he words used <NAME> <NAME> I A held inapplicable The Judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR The suit from which this appeal arises relates to a shrine and tomb known as Darga Hazarat Syed Salar Mahsood Ghazi situated in the village of Singha Parasi and properties appurtenant to it It appears that respondent purported to exer cise its authority over the properties in suit under the provisions of the Act and that led to the present suit which was filed on October No It was urged that respondent I was a duly constituted <ORG> and it was authorised to exercise supervision over the management of the said waqf On the question of limitation the learned judge held that of the Act applied to the suit but according to him though the suit was filed beyond the period of one year prescribed by the said section it was within time having regard to the provisions of of the Limitation Act The plea raised by respondent under of the Act was partly upheld by the learned trial judge he took the view that the first three relief claimed by the appellants were barred but the fourth was not Against this decree respondent I preferred an appeal in <ORG> at Allahabad Lucknow Bench and the appellants filed cross objections <ORG> has also held that the suit filed by the appellants was barred by limitation and was also in competent in view of the fact that the statutory notice required by of the Act had not been given by the appellants prior to its institution It is believed that <NAME> was a nephew of <NAME> and he met his death at the hands of a local chieftain when he paid a visit to Bahraich It would appear that in or a <ORG> had been granted to <NAME> who was the head of the khadims in respect of rent free tenure of the village Singha Parasi Soon after this decision it was brought to the notice of the Chief Commissioner in that the khadims at the <NAME> were mismanaging the properties of the <NAME> and were not properly maintaining the <NAME> itself The members of the committee of management and the trustees with the exception of two persons held that the properties in suit did not constitute a <ORG> within the meaning of the Act and that respondent had no authority or jurisdiction to supervise the management of the said properties He contends that <ORG> was in error in coming to the conclusion that the properties in suit constituted a waqf over which respondent I can exercise its authority or jurisdiction and he argues that it was erroneous to have held that the appellants suit was <ORG>red by and was incompetent under of the Act Since we have reached the conclusion that <ORG> was right in holding that the suit was <ORG>red under and was also incompetent under of the Act we do not propose to decide the question as to whether the properties in dispute are waqf within the meaning of the Act Section deals with the establishment of two separate <ORG>s to be called <ORG> and <ORG> Section defines the functions of <ORG> and confers oil them general powers of superintendence over the management of the waqfs under their jurisdiction It is the notification issued by respondent under and the subsequent steps taken by it in exercise of its authority that have led to the present suit Mr <NAME> contends that the provisions of do not apply to the present suit and so the argument that the suit is barred by limitation under the said section cannot succeed But according to Mr <NAME> the present suit is outside altogether and so there is no question of invoking the shorter period of limitation prescribed by it Their case is that the properties in suit do not constitute a <ORG> under the Act but are held by them as proprietors and that the notification issued by respondent I and the authority purported to be exercised by it in respect of the said properties are wholly void The word <ORG> as used in this subsection must be given the meaning attached to it by the definition in of the Act and since the appellants totally deny the existence of such a <ORG> they cannot be said to be interested in the <ORG> The argument thus presented appears prima facie to be attractive and plausible but on a close examination of it would appear clear that the words any person interested in a <ORG> cannot be construed in their strict literal meaning If the said words are given their strict literal meaning suits for a declaration that any transaction held by the Commissioner to be a <ORG> is not a <ORG> can never be filed by a mutawalli of a <ORG> or a person interested in a <ORG> When <ORG> assumes jurisdiction over any <ORG> tinder the Act it proceeds to do so on the decision of three points by the Commissioner of <ORG> It assumes that the property is a <ORG> that it is either a Sunni or a Shia <ORG> and that it is not a <ORG> which falls within the exceptions mentioned in We must accordingly hold that the relevant clause on which Mr <NAME> has placed his argument in repelling the application of to the present suit must not be strictly or literally construed and that it should be taken to mean any person interested in a transaction which is held to be a <ORG> On this construction the appellants are obviously interested in the suit properties which are notified to be <ORG> by the notification issued by respondent and so the suit instituted by them would be governed by sub and as such it would be barred by time unless it is saved under of the Limitation Act This section provides that any party to an arbitration agreement desiring to challenge the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement shall apply to the court and the court shall decide the question on affidavits It would be noticed that the expression any party to an arbitration agreement used in the section poses a similar problem of construction It must be taken to mean a person who is alleged to be a party to an arbitration agreement in other words the clause must be construed to cover cases of persons who are alleged to be a party to an arbitration agreement but who do not admit the said allegation and want to challenge the existence of the alleged agreement itself We may also point out incidentally that in dealing with an application made under of the Arbitration Act it is incumbent upon the court to decide first of all whether there is a binding agreement for arbitration between the parties in other words the allegation by one party against another that there is a valid agreement of reference between them does not preclude the latter party from disputing the existence of the said agreement in proceedings taken under These decisions illustrate the principle that where the literal meaning of the words use in a statutory provision would manifestly defeat its object by making a part of it meaningless and ineffective it is legitimate and even necessary to adopt the rule of liberal construction so as to give meaning to all parts of the provision and to make the whole of it effective and operative In their replication filed by the plaintiffs an attempt was made to explain away the admissions contained in the plaint by alleging that if ever in any paper or document the word I waqf had been used as a routine or hurriedly then it is vague and of no specific meaning and its meaning or connotation is only trust or amanat and yet in the statement of the case by the appellants counsel we find an express admission that the subject matter of the suit is covered by the exemptions of cls The next question which calls for our decision is whether the appellants suit is saved by virtue of the provisions of of the Limitation Act That is the only provision on which reliance was placed before us by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellants It is plain that for excluding the time under this section it must be shown that the institution of the suit in question had been stayed by an injunction or order in other words the section requires an order or an injunction which stays the institution of the suit Whether the requirements of would be satisfied by the production of an order or injunction which by necessary implication stays the institution of the suit is open to argument We are however prepared to assume in the present case that would apply even to cases where the institution of a suit is stayed by necessary implication of the order passed or injunction issued in the previous litigation But in our opinion there would be no justification for extending the application of on the ground that the institution of the subsequent suit would be inconsistent with the spirit or substance of the order passed in the previous litigation The decision of the <ORG> in <NAME> case upholding the validity of <NAME> adoption no doubt led to a radical change in the accepted and current view about the Hindu widow power to adopt in the State of Bombay but this decision was of poor consolation to <NAME> because the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> case shows that <NAME> subsequent suit to recover possession of the properties in his adoptive family was dismissed as barred by time On November <NAME> had sued <NAME> and <NAME> for a declaration that he was in possession of the lands and for a permanent injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with his possession Two important issues which arose for decision in the suit were whether <NAME> had been duly adopted by <NAME> in fact and whether <NAME> was competent to make the adoption There was a further appeal by the said parties to <ORG> The <ORG> held that the adoption of <NAME> was valid and so the appeal was allowed and <NAME> suit was dismissed with costs throughout In dealing with the appellants argument that the injunction in the prior suit had been issued in wide terms and in substance it precluded the plaintiffs from filing their suit their Lordships observed that there was nothing in the injunction or in the decree to support their case that they were prevented from instituting a suit for possession in or at any time before the expiry of the period of limitation It appears from the judgment that Sir <NAME> strongly contended before <ORG> that since the title of the contending parties was involved in the suit it would have been quite futile to institute a suit for possession There is another decision of <ORG> to which reference may be made It is true that in <NAME> <NAME> their Lordships of <ORG> have observed that it would be an inconvenient state of the law if it were found necessary for a man to institute a perfectly vain litigation under peril of losing his property if he does not but this observation must be read in the context of facts with which I All of Limitation Act of a failure of the consideration which entitled him to retain it Thus it is clear that <ORG> was dealing with the appellants rights to sue which had accrued to him on the dismissal of his action to enforce the terms of the agreement It is in the light of this legal position that we must examine the appellants case that the institution of the present suit had been stayed by an injunction or order issued against them in the earlier litigation of Mr <NAME> contends that the order passed by the trial judge on October made it impossible for the appellants to file the present suit until the final decision of the appeal We have already held that the relevant words used in must be strictly construed without any consideration of equity and so construed we have no doubt that the order on which Mr <NAME> has placed reliance before us is wholly out side of the Limitation Act We must accord ingly hold that <ORG> was right in taking the view that did not apply to the present suit and that it was therefore filed beyond the period of one year prescribed by of the Act That takes us to the consideration of the next preliminary objection against the competence of the suit under of the Act They are made from time to time by the devo tees who visit the <NAME>ga and by their very nature they constitute the income of the <NAME>ga We must therefore reject the argument that any of the suit properties have riot been duly notified by respondent I under of the Act
