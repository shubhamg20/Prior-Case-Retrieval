It was not taken in the Lower Courts but as it is a question of law arising on the facts found we have allowed it to be raised In execution of that order he got possession of plots A and This was about Hi years ago The defendant pleaded that all the plots were included in the <ORG> sale and in his certificate and that he got possession of them all properly through court and that he was entitled to them Mr <NAME> for the defendant appellant contends that on the finding this is a claim by the judgment debtor under a mortgage decree for the recovery of property overdelivered in execution to the court auction purchaser and as such this is a case to which Section Civil Procedure Code applies even though the purchaser was a stranger to the mortgage suit In <ORG> case the question arose in three appeals two being between one <NAME> a stranger purchaser in execution of a money decree on one side and one <NAME> the decree holder purchaser of some of the items under the mortgage decree on the other side and the third appeal being one between the same <NAME> and one <NAME> a stranger purchaser of other items in execution of the same mortgage decree On the question of the representative character of these stranger purchasers there was a difference of opinion between the members of the Bench There was a considerable conflict of opinion on the point in <ORG> previously and it was to settle the question that the reference was made and we must take <ORG> decision as settling it It is however suggested by him that the Full Bench did not consider the question of the representative character of the mortgage decree purchaser which is the point berfore us but confined itself to that of the money decree purchaser and that there is a difference between the two kinds of purchasers in the matter The last question referred to the Full Bench specifically raised the question as to the <ORG> decree purchaser See page and though <ORG> has not answered the question the other Judges have dealt with it and have made no distinction between the two Section of the Transfer of Property Act under which the order absolute for sale was made in the present case declares that on such an order being made the right to redeem and the security shall both be extinguished Thereafter there is only a right to sell the property just as there is after attachment under a money decree See <NAME> <NAME> I All <NAME> put it thus What the courWhave to see is whether the issues arising for decision relate a to execution and to deciding rival rights of the decree holder and the judgment debtor in the subject matter If those conditions are satisfied the fact that others are interested in the result of the decision should not affect the jurisdiction and competency of the executing court to deal with the matter On this point the Full Bench were unanimous and it was I think on the application of this view that the case between the stranger money decree purchaser <NAME> and the stranger mortgage decree purchaser <NAME> was held to fall under Section the question of delivery of property purchased in court sale being evidently held to be one relating to execution and one in which the decree holder and the judgment debtor were adversely interested This is made further clear by the subsequent judgment of the referring judges reported in <NAME> <NAME> I Mad I am unable to accept the suggestion that Section was applied to that case by oversight In fact they gave an extended meaning to these words Does that make a difference I was at first inclined to think that it did and that the decree holder was not interested in the present controversy as it refers to property over delivered to the purchaser But on further consideration I have come to the conclusion that it is not correct The mistake in the boundaries in the present case is not merely in the delivery order but also in the mortgage deed and in the decree and in the sale certificate and if the decree or the sale certificate had been asked to be rectified on the point the question would clearly have arisen between the parties to the suit The fact that it is now raised against the purchaser should not make any difference as to whether it is to be done in execution or not I would therefore hold Section Civil Procedure Code applies to the present case and as the result I will allow the Second Appeal and dismiss the suit but in the circumstances without costs in any of the courts
