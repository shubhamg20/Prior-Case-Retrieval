In interpreting ss he had received and he may do so by a redemption suit that the relationship which comes into existence as a result of the mortgage of an occupancy holding and its possession being transferred to the mortgagee is analogous to that of a mortgagor and mortgagee and the action to recover possession is analogous to redemption and such a suit is maintainable suit in a civil court Respondents to filed a suit for possession of the land after depositing the mortgage money in court The suit was decreed in appeal by the <ORG> following the earlier <ORG> decisions Dismissing the appeal to this Court HELD in the matter of the interpretation of a local statute the view taken by the <ORG> over a number of years should normally be adhered to and not disturbed A different view would not only introduce an element of uncertainty and confusion it would also have the effect of unsettling transactions which might have been entered into on the faith of those decisions The doctrine of stare decisis can be aptly invoked in such a situation by a superior court riot strictly bound by the decision As respondents to were the occupancy tenants of the land and as they were declared to be the Bhumidars they had sufficient interest in the land to institute the suit under a of the Transfer of Property Act The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> whereby that Court re versed the decisions of the trial Court and the first appellate court and awarded a decree for the possession of the land in dispute in favour of the plaintiff respondents against the defendant appellants On January plaintiff respondents No to along with <NAME> plaintiff No filed the present suit for possession of the land in dispute against <NAME> and others on the allegation that <NAME> had transferred all his rights in the land with the consent and permission of the <NAME> the land lord in favour of plaintiffs to According to the plaintiffs they had a right to redeem the land from the mortgagee but as the mortgagee was not prepared to give back the land on receipt of the mortgage money the plain tiffs were depositing the amount in court When the matter was taken up in second appeal before <ORG> the learned Judge held that in plaintiffs to had acquired as a result of agreement with the <NAME> the same rights which had vested in plaintiff No before he surrendered those rights It was fur ther held that the plaintiffs were entitled to redeem the mortgage and recover possession of the land and that the suit of the plaintiffs was not barred by time Mr <NAME> in appeal before us has submitted on behalf of the defendant appellants that plantiff respondents to were not entitled to sue for possession of land on payment of the mortgage money and that their suit was barred by limitation Before dealing further with the matter we may refer to some of the statutory provisions which have been referred to by Mr <NAME> Further conditions are also prescribed in that section but we are not concerned with them The surrender by the th plaintiff preceding the aforesaid settlement could only be a surrender of such Tights as the th plaintiff still had at that time and similarly the settlement in favour of plaintiffs Nos to by the <NAME> could only be settlement of those very rights supra and found that the following five propositions had been laid down in the earlier case That the usufructuary mortgage of an occupancy holding by a tenant is void and not voidable <NAME> The relationship which comes into existence as a result of the mortgage of an occupancy holding and its possession being transferred to the mortgagee though not strictly speaking that of a mortgagor and a mortgagee is analogous to that relationship and the action which is raised by the mortgagor to recover possession of the holding on payment of the money due to the mortgagee though not strictly in the nature of a redemption is analogous to a redemption suit In the matter of the interpretation of a local statute the view taken by <ORG> over a number of years should normally be adhered to and not disturb Id A different view would not only introduce an element of uncertainty and confusion it would also have the effect of unsettling transactions which might have been entered into on the faith of those decisions The doctrine of stare decisis can be aptly invoked in such a situation As observed by Lord <NAME> in the case of <ORG> <ORG> there is well established authority for the view that a decision of long standing on the basis of which many persons will in the course of time have arranged their affairs should not lightly be disturbed by a superior court not strictly bound itself by the decision As plaintiff respondents to were the occupancy tenants of the land in dispute and as they were declared to be Bhumidars they had in our opinion sufficient interest in the land as clothed them with the right to redeem it from the mortgagees Clause a of section of the Transfer of Property Act provides inter alia that any person other than the mortgagee of the interest sought to be redeemed who has any interest in or charge upon the property mortgaged or in or upon the right to redeem the same may institute a suit for redemption of the mortgaged property The case of the plaintiffs who were the occupancy tenants and Bhumidars of the land in dispute is clearly covered by clause a of section of the Transfer of Property Act The fact that the present suit has been filed not by the occupancy tenant who mortgaged the property but by others in whom the occupancy rights were subsequently vested would in our opinion make no difference and would be no bar to the maintainability of the suit We see no cogent ground to disturb that view
