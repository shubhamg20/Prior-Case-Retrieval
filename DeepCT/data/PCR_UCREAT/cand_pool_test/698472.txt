In all these appeals the issue that falls for our consideration is the constitutional validity of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act for short the MCOCA or the Act on the ground that <ORG> did not have the legislative competence to enact such a law and also that the aforesaid law is unreasonable and is violative of the provisions of Article of the Constitution of India <ORG> held that the <ORG> alone has the power to make law in that regard as provided for under Entry of List I of Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and that already the Indian Telegraph Act a Central Act was holding the field Being aggrieved by the aforesaid common order the State of Maharashtra has filed the present appeals Learned senior counsel appearing for the parties advanced elaborate arguments on the aforesaid issues but before we deal with and discuss the same it would be necessary for us to refer to the relevant provisions of the concerned <ORG> and <ORG> The Indian Telegraph Act for short the Telegraph Act was passed as a <ORG> Act in and the said Act came into force on st October The power to grant a licence on such conditions and in considerations of such payments as it thinks fit to any person to establish maintain or work a telegraph in any part within India is also vested with <ORG> Section of the said Act gives power to <ORG> as well as to <ORG> or any officer specifically authorized in that behalf by the <ORG> or <ORG> to take temporary possession of any telegraph established maintained or worked by any person licensed under the Act provided there is an occurrence of any public emergency or there is a case of public safety and when such authority is satisfied that one such pre condition arises and that it is necessary to act in a case of public emergency or maintaining of public safety Section of the Act provides that on the occurrence of any public emergency or in the interest of public safety the <ORG> or <ORG> or any officer specially authorized in that behalf by the <ORG> or <ORG> may if satisfied that it is necessary or expedient to do so in the interest of the sovereignty and integrity of India the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign states or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of offence and for the reasons to be recorded in writing by order direct that any message or class of messages to or from any person or class of persons or relating to any particular subject brought for transmission by or transmitted or received by any telegraphs shall not be transmitted or shall be intercepted or detained or shall be disclosed to the Government making the order or an officer thereof mentioned in the order <ORG> enacted a State legislation under the name of Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act which came into force on th February The Statement of Objects and Reasons for enacting the said Act reads as under Organised crime has for quite some years now come up as a very serious threat to our society It knows no national boundaries and is fueled by illegal wealth generated by contract killings extortion smuggling in contrabands illegal trade in narcotics kidnapping for ransom collection of protection money and money laundering etc The illegal wealth and black money generated by the organised crime is very huge and has serious adverse effect on our economy It is seen that the organised criminal syndicates make a common cause with terrorist gangs and foster narco terrorism which extend beyond the national boundaries There is reason to believe that organised criminal gangs are operating in the <ORG> and thus there is immediate need to curb their activities It is also noticed that the organised criminals make extensive use of wire and oral communications in their criminal activities The interception of such communications to obtain evidence of the commission of crimes or to prevent their commission is an indispensable aid to law enforcement and the administration of justice Government has therefore decided to enact a special law with stringent and deterrent provisions including in certain circumstances power to intercept wire electronic or oral communication to control the menace of the organised crime According to its preamble the said Act was enacted to make specific provisions for prevention and control of and for coping with criminal activity by organised crime syndicate or gang and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto Section of the MCOCA contains the definitions Clause of sub Section defines the expression continuing unlawful activity to mean an activity prohibited by law for the time being in force which is a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment of three years of more undertaken either singly or jointly as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate in respect of which more than one charge sheets have been filed before a competent court within the preceding period of ten years and that court has taken cognizance of such offence Clause of sub Section defines the expression organised crime to mean any continuing unlawful activity by an individual singly or jointly either as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or any other person or promoting insurgency The term organised crime syndicate is defined under clause of sub Section to mean a group of two or more persons who acting either singly or collectively as a syndicate or gang indulge in activities of organised crime Section of the MCOCA deals with the power of <ORG> to appoint the competent authority Section requires constitution of a review committee to review every order passed by the competent authority under Section Section imposes certain restrictions regarding interception and disclosure of wire electronic or oral communication There is a power of forfeiture and attachment of property of the person convicted under MCOCA under Section Sub section of Section of the MCOCA lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure for short the Code or in any other law every offence punishable under MCOCA shall be deemed to be a cognizable offence within the meaning of clause of Section of the Code and cognizable case as defined in that clause would be construed accordingly Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant State of Maharashtra drew our attention to the abovementioned provisions of the Telegraph Act as also to the abovementioned provisions of the MCOCA in support of his submission that all the provisions of MCOCA the constitutional validity of which is challenged are valid He submitted that the provisions of Sections to facilitate the detection and investigation of the offence of organised crime and the State legislative competence to enact such provisions was traceable to Entry and in List II and Entry and in List III of Seventh Schedule of the Constitution He therefore contented that the constitutional validity cannot be questioned on the ground of want of legislative competence of <ORG> to enact such a provision The learned counsel for appellant drew our attention to the findings recorded in paragraph of the impugned judgment of <ORG> which contains a comparative chart on the basis of which <ORG> has come to the conclusion that there was repugnancy It was submitted by them that the subject and the area which is dealt by the <ORG> enacted by <ORG> are governed and covered exclusively by Entry of List I in regard to which parliament alone has exclusive competence and that being so the said provisions enacted by a state legislature are ultra vires the Constitution It was also submitted that the said provisions are not only beyond the legislative competence of the state legislature but they also infringe upon the fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution as the said provisions are violative of Articles and of the Constitution and therefore the said provisions are to be declared ultra vires the Constitution on both the counts But we find that no cross appeal was filed by any of the respondents against the order of <ORG> upholding the constitutional validity of provisions of section and and also that of Sections and of the MCOCA During the course of hearing Mr <NAME> the counsel appearing for one of the respondents herein tried to contend that the aforesaid provisions of Section and of the MCOCA are unconstitutional on the ground that they violate the requirement of Article of the Constitution and that they make serious inroads into the fundamental rights by treating unequals as equals and are unsustainably vague Since such issues were not specifically raised by filing an appeal and since only a passing reference is made on the said issue in the short three page affidavit filed by the respondent No it is not necessary for us to examine the said issue as it was sought to be raised more specifically in the argument stage only Even otherwise when the said definitions as existing in Section and of the MCOCA are read and understood with the object and purpose of the Act which is to make special provisions for prevention and control of organised crime it is clear that they are worded to subserve and achieve the said object and purpose of the Act There is no vagueness as the definitions defined with clarity what it meant by continuing unlawful activity organised crime and also organised crime syndicate As the provisions treat all those covered by it in a like manner and does not suffer from the vice of class legislation they cannot be said to be violative of Article of the Constitution As far as section of MCOCA is concerned the challenge was made before <ORG> on the ground that the words at any time in Section makes an act which was not a crime prior to coming into force of the MCOCA a crime thus making the provision retrospective being violative of Article of the Constitution After examining the impugned judgment in depth on the issue of constitutional validity of Section and and also Section and of MCOCA we are in accord with the findings arrived at by <ORG> that the aforesaid provisions cannot be said to be ultra vires the Constitution and we do not find any reason to take a different view that what is taken by <ORG> while upholding the validity of the aforesaid provisions In the light of the aforesaid we are required to answer the issues which are specifically raised before us relating to the constitutional validity of Sections to as also Section of MCOCA on the ground of lack of legislative competence and also being violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution or of any other constitutional provision Chapter of part XI of the Constitution deals with the subject of distribution of legislative powers of the <ORG> and the legislature of the States Article of the Constitution provides that the <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the <ORG> of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State Article of the Constitution relates to the subject matter of laws made by the <ORG> and State <ORG>s It declares that the <ORG> has the exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule The <ORG> of any State would have powers to make laws with respect to any of the matters mentioned in List II subject to the power of the parliament in regard to List I matters and the power of the <ORG> and the State <ORG> in respect of List III matters List III enumerates the matters in respect of which both <ORG> and State <ORG>s have power to enact laws It is a well established rule of interpretation that the entries in the list being fields of legislation must receive liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense Each general word should extend to all ancillary and subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended within it It is therefore clear and it is acknowledged by Chief Justice <NAME> that in construing an entry in a List conferring legislative powers the widest possible construction according to their ordinary meaning must be put upon the words used therein The cardinal rule of interpretation however is that words should be read in their ordinary natural and grammatical meaning subject to this rider that in construing words in a constitutional enactment conferring legislative power the most liberal construction should be put upon the words so that the same may have effect in their widest amplitude reported in which are as follows Where there is the possibility of legislative overlap courts have resolved the issue according to settled principles of construction of entries in the legislative lists Where the validity of a law made by a competent authority is challenged in a Court of law that court is bound to presume in favour of its validty In CST <NAME> SCC this <ORG> while dealing with the question of constitutional validity of a statute held that the presumption is always on the constitutionality and the burden is upon the person who attacks it to show that there has been transgression of constitutional principles It was held in that decision that for sustaining the constitutionality of an Act a <ORG> may take into consideration matters of common knowledge reports preamble history of the times object of the legislation and all other facts which are relevant and that it must always be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciate the need of its own people and that discrimination if any is based on adequate grounds and considerations One of the proven methods of examining the legislative competence of an enactment is by the application of doctrine of pith and substance This doctrine is applied when the legislative competence of the legislature with regard to a particular enactment is challenged with reference to the entries in various lists If there is a challenge to the legislative competence the courts will try to ascertain the pith and substance of such enactment on a scrutiny of the Act in question In this process it is necessary for the courts to go into and examine the true character of the enactment its object its scope and effect to find out whether the enactment in question is genuinely referable to the field of legislation allotted to the respective <ORG> under the constitutional scheme Where a challenge is made to the constitutional validity of a particular State Act with reference to a subject mentioned in any entry in List I the court has to look to the substance of the State Act and on such analysis and examination if it is found that in the pith and substance it falls under an entry in the State List but there is only an incidental encroachment on topics in the Union List the State Act would not become invalid merely because there is incidental encroachment on any of the topics in the Union List But then it must be remembered that we are construing a federal Constitution The scheme of distribution has varied with different Constitutions but even when the Constitution enumerates elaborately the topics on which the <ORG> and the States could legislate some overlapping of the fields of legislation is inevitable The British North America Act which established a federal Constitution for Canada enumerated in Sections and the topics on which the Dominion and the Provinces could respectively legislate Notwithstanding that the lists were framed so as to be fairly full and comprehensive it was not long before it was found that the topics enumerated in the two sections overlapped and <ORG> had time and again to pass on the constitutionality of laws made by the Dominion and Provincial legislatures That is to say if a statute is found in substance to relate to a topic within the competence of the legislature it should be held to be intra vires even though it might incidentally trench on topics not within its legislative competence The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond its competence may be an element in determining whether the legislation is colourable that is whether in the guise of making a law on a matter within it competence the legislature is in truth making a law on a subject beyond its competence But where that is not the position then the fact of encroachment does not affect the vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment This doctrine of pith and substance is applied when the legislative competence of a legislature with regard to a particular enactment is challenged with reference to the entries in the various lists i a law dealing with the subject in one list is also touching on a subject in another list On a scrutiny of the Act in question if found that the legislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature enacting that statute then that Act as a whole must be held to be valid notwithstanding any incidental trenching upon matters beyond its competence i on a matter included in the list belonging to the other legislature Though it is true that <ORG> would not have power to legislate upon any of the matters enumerated in the Union List but as per the doctrine of Pith and Substance there could not be any dispute with regard to the fact that if it could be shown that the area and subject of the legislation is also covered within the purview of the entry of the State List and the Concurrent List in that event incidental encroachment to an entry in the Union List will not make a law invalid and such an incidental encroachment will not make the legislation ultra vires the Constitution It is likely to happen from time to time that enactment though purporting to deal with a subject in one list touches also on a subject in another list and prima facie looks as if one legislature is impinging on the legislative field of another legislature This may result in a large number of statutes being declared unconstitutional because the legislature enacting law may appear to have legislated in a field reserved for the other legislature To examine whether a legislation has impinged on the field of other legislatures in fact or in substance or is incidental keeping in view the true nature of the enactment the courts have evolved the doctrine of pith and substance for the purpose of determining whether it is legislation with respect to matters in one list or the other Where the question for determination is whether a particular law relates to a particular subject mentioned in one list or the other the courts look into the substance of the enactment This principle came to be established by <ORG> when it determined appeals from Canada or Australia involving the question of legislative competence of the federation or the States in those countries This doctrine came to be established in India and derives its genesis from the approach adopted by the courts including <ORG> in dealing with controversies arising in other federations Where a law passed by <ORG> while being substantially within the scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and large the law falls within the four corners of the State List and entrenchment if any is purely incidental or inconsequential The question of repugnancy under Article will arise when a law made by <ORG> and a law made by <ORG> occupies the same field with respect to one of the matters enumerated in Concurrent List and there is a direct conflict in two laws In the background of the aforesaid legal position we may now proceed to examine the question of competence of <ORG> to enact a law of the nature of MCOCA Our attention was also drawn to the said chart and we find that the conclusion of <ORG> that there is repugnancy in view of the statutory provisions contained therein do not appear to be sound The proviso to Rule A deals with cases of emergency and provides that in cases of emergency the communication may be intercepted without the prior approval of the competent authority and the approval may be obtained within a period of days It is now well settled that though the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying a legislative Bill cannot be used to determine the true meaning and effect of the substantive provisions of a statute but it is permissible to refer to the Statement of Objects and Reasons accompanying a Bill for the purpose of understanding the background the antecedent state of affairs the surrounding circumstances in relation to the statute and the evil which the statute sought to remedy The Statement of Objects and Reasons was used by <NAME> for ascertaining the conditions prevalent at that time which led to the introduction of the Bill and the extent and urgency of the evil which was sought to be remedied in addition to testing the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the impugned provision The pronouncements of this <ORG> further establish amongst other things that there is always a presumption in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and that the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a clear violation of the constitutional principles The courts it is accepted must presume that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds It must be borne in mind that the legislature is free to recognise degrees of harm and may confine its restrictions to those cases where the need is deemed to be the clearest and finally that in order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality the <ORG> may take into consideration matters of common knowledge matters of common report the history of the times and may assume every state of facts which can be conceived existing at the time of legislation AIR para The legislature is the best judge of what is good for the community by whose suffrage it comes into existence This should be the proper approach for the court but the ultimate responsibility for determining the validity of the law must rest with the court AIR para also see the several decisions referred to therein These therefore constitute important factors which amongst others will be taken into consideration by the court in judging the reasonableness of any restriction imposed on the fundamental rights of the individuals The objects and reasons read with the contents of the Act would indicate that the subject matter of the Act is maintaining public order and prevention by police of commission of serious offences affecting public order and therefore as submitted it will be relatable to Entry and of List II As the main purpose of the Act is within the parameter of Entry and of <ORG> we find no reason to hold that the provisions of Sections to are constitutionally invalid because of legislative competence It was submitted that provisions contained under Section to of the impugned act authorizing interception of communication violates the Right to Privacy which is part of right to life and personal liberty enriched under Article No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law reported in that Right to Privacy is a right to be let alone and a citizen has a right to safeguard the privacy of his own his family marriage procreation motherhood child bearing and education among other matters The term privacy has not been defined and it was held in the case of <ORG>CITATION> reported in that as a concept it may be too broad and moralistic to define it judicially and whether right to privacy can be claimed or has been infringed in a given case would depend on the facts of the said case In the present case there is no unlawful or even irregular method in obtaining the tape recording of the conversation The question posed above was considered again in detail by this Court in the case of <ORG> supra wherein it was held as under We have therefore no hesitation in holding that right to privacy is a part of the right to life and personal liberty enshrined under Article of the Constitution The said right cannot be curtailed except according to procedure established by law Telephone tapping would thus infract Article of the Constitution of India unless it is permitted under the procedure established by law The interception of conversation though constitutes an invasion of an individual right to privacy but the said right can be curtailed in accordance to procedure validly established by law Having recorded our finding in the aforesaid manner we now proceed to decide the issue as to whether a person accused of an offence under MCOCA should be denied bail if on the date of the offence he is on bail for an offence under MCOCA or any other Act As discussed above the object of the MCOCA is to prevent the organised crime and therefore there could be reason to deny consideration of grant of bail if one has committed a similar offence once again after being released on bail but the same consideration cannot be extended to a person who commits an offence under some other Act for commission of an offence under some other act would not be in any case in consonance with the object of the act which is enacted in order to prevent only organised crime The provision of denying his right to seek bail if he was arrested earlier and was on bail for commission of an offence under any other Act suffers from the vice of unreasonable classification by placing in the same class offences which may have nothing in common with those under <ORG> for the purpose of denying consideration of bail We uphold the order of <ORG> to the extent that the words or under any other Act should be struck down from Sub section of Section In view of the aforesaid discussions we allow the appeals of <ORG> insofar as the constitutional validity of Sections to of MCOCA is concerned We uphold the validity of the said provisions The parties to bear their own cost
