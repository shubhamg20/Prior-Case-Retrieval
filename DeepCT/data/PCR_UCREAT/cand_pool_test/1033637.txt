<ORG> quashed the entire criminal proceedings holding that the allegations did not constitute a cognizable offence for commencing lawful investigation Aggrieved by the judgment of <ORG> the appel lants preferred the present appeal by special leave con tending that the allegations contained in the complaint either individually or collectively constituted a cogniza ble offence warranting the registration of a case as contem plated under Section Cr and a thorough inves tigation in compliance with various statutory provisions On behalf of the Respondents it was contended that on account of the deep rooted political animosity and rivalry entertained by the then Chief Minister he used the com plainant who was stooge in his hands to file the complaint containing false and scurrilous allegations against the First Respondent and hence the criminal proceedings rightly deserved to be quashed If any information disclosing a cognizable offence is laid before an officer in charge of a police station satisfying the requirements of Section of the Crimi nal Procedure Code the said police officer has no other option except to enter the substance thereof in the pre scribed form that is to say to register a case on the basis of such information Though a police officer cannot investigate a non offence he can investigate a non cognizable offence under the order of a Magistrate having power to try such non cognizable case or commit the same for trial within the terms under Section of the Code but subject to Sec tion of the Code Further under the newly introduced Sub section to Section where a case relates to two offences to which atleast one is cognizable the case shall be deemed to be a cognizable case notwithstanding that the other offences are non cognizable and therefore under such circumstances the police officers can investigate such offences with the same powers as he has while investigating a cognizable offence The core of the Sections and of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that if a police officer has reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence he must either proceed with the investigation or cause an investiga tion to be proceeded with by his subordinate that in a case where the police officer sees no sufficient ground for investigation he can dispense with the investigation alto gether that the field of investigation of any cognizable offence is exclusively within the domain of the investiga tion agencies over which the Courts cannot have control and have no power to stiffle or impinge upon the proceedings in the investigation so long as the investiga tion proceeds in compliance with the provisions relating to investigation and that it is only in a case wherein a police officer decides not to investigate an offence the concerned Magistrate can intervene and either direct an investigation or in the alternative if he thinks fit he himself can at once proceed or depute any Magistrate sub ordinate to him to proceed to hold a preliminary inquiry into or otherwise to dispose of the case in the manner provided in the Code The commencement of investigation by a police officer is subject to two conditions firstly the police officer should have reason to suspect the commission of a cognizable offence as required by Section and second ly the police officer should subjectively satisfy himself as to whether there is sufficient ground for entering on an investigation even before he starts an investigation into the facts and circumstances of the case as contemplated under clause of the proviso to Section of the Code The investigation of an offence is the field exclu sively reserved for the police officers whose powers in that field are unfettered so long as the power to investigate into the cognizable offences is legitimately exercised in strict compliance with the provisions falling under Chapter XII of the Code and the <ORG> are not justified in obliter ating the track of investigation when the investigating agencies are well within their legal bounds Further there are no specific averments that either Respondent No or his relations and friends had no source of income to accumulate the properties now standing in their names and that Respond ent No showed any favour to them by misusing his official position The question whether the relations and friends of Respondent No have independently purchased the properties out of their own funds or not also cannot be decided by the <ORG> at this stage on the denial statement of Respondent No alone In the exercise of the extra ordinary power under Article or the inherent powers under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure the following categories of cases are given by way of illustration wherein such power could be exercised either to prevent abuse of the process of any Court or otherwise to secure the ends of justice though it may not be possible to lay down any precise clearly defined and sufficiently channelised and inflexible guide myriad kinds of cases wherein such power should be exer cised a where the allegations made in the First Information Report or the complaint even if they are taken at their face value and accepted in their entirety do not prima facie constitute any offence or make out a case against the ac cused where the allegations in the First Information Report and other materials if any accompanying the I do not disclose a cognizable offence justifying an investi gation by police officers under Section of the Code except under an order of a Magistrate within the purview of Section of the Code where the uncontroverted allegations made in the FIR or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the same do not disclose the commission of any offence and make out a case against the accused where the allegations in the FIR do not constitute a cognizable offence but constitute only a non cognizable offence no investigation is permitted by a police officer without an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under Section of the Code where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so absurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which no prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the provisions of the Code or the concerned Act under which a criminal proceeding is instituted to the institu tion and continuance of the proceedings and or where there is a specific provision in the Code or the concerned Act providing efficacious redress for the grievance of the aggrieved party where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with mala fide and or where the proceeding is maliciously instituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the accused and with a view to spite him due to private and personal grudge A In the instant case the allegations made in the complaint do clearly constitute a cognizable offence justi on and this case does not call for the exercise of extraor dinary or inherent powers of <ORG> to quash the I itself At this stage when there are only allegations and recriminations but no evidence this <ORG> cannot anticipate the result of the investigation and render a finding on the question of mala fides on the materials at present avail This unprecedented overenthusiasm shown by the without disclosing the reasons for making an order entrusting the investigation to the SHO who is not a designated officer under Section A really shocks ones sense of justice and fair play even though the untest ed allegations made in the complaint require a thorough investigation A The granting of permission under Section A of the Preven tion of Corruption Act authorising an officer of lower rank to conduct the investigation is not to be treated by a Magistrate as a mere matter of routine but it is an exer cise of his judicial discretion having regard to the policy underlying and the order giving the permission should on the face of it disclose the reasons for granting such permission The Superintendent of Police or any police officer of higher rank while granting permission to a non designated police officer in exercise of his power under the second provision to Section A should satisfy himself that there are good and sufficient reasons to entrust the investigation with such police officer of a lower rank and record his reasons for doing so because the very object of the legislature in enacting Section A is to see that the investigation of offences punishable under Sections or A of Indian Penal Code as well as those under Section of the Act should be done ordinarily by the offi cers designated in clauses a to of Section A Section A of the Act is mandatory and not directory and the inves illegality but that illegality committed in the course of an investigation does not affect the competence and the juris diction of the Court for trial and where the cognizance of the case has in fact been taken and the case is proceeded to termination the validity of the proceedings with the preced ing investigation does not vitiate the result unless miscar riage of justice has been caused thereby Therefore the SHO who has taken up the investigation of the offences inclusive of those under Section and is not at all clothed with any authority to investigate these two offences registered under the IPC apart from the offence under Section of the Act
