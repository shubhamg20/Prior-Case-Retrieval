On the ground that disputes arose between the appellant and the respondent the matter was referred to the arbitration as provided in the agreement The respondent in the claim statement made various claims for refund of the amounts paid under various bills and for various losses suffered on account of various acts of commission and omission of the appellant details of which are set out therein <NAME> the learned Senior Advocate appearing for the appellant submitted that the award made by the arbitrators is not within the scope of the agreement entered into between the parties inasmuch as the claim for damages would arise except in the circumstances arising in the proviso to clause of the terms of agreement to which we have adverted to at the very outset Thus the principal contention addressed before us is that there is a guarantee of supply of electricity for hours of a day but under the circumstances set out in the proviso supply could be interrupted without liability of paying damages and this aspect was not considered by the arbitrators However as noticed by us there were reasons set out in the log books or as noticed earlier those reasons in the opinion of the arbitrators were either not relevant or where they were relevant they were untenable When the arbitrators have applied their mind to the pleadings the evidence adduced before them and the terms of the contract we do not think it is within our scope to re appraise the matter as if this were an appeal and it is clear that where two views are possible in this case there is no such scope the view taken by the arbitrators would prevail <NAME> further pointed out that the interruptions in the power supply if any were on account of the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulation of Supply Distribution Consumption and Use Order issued from time to time and therefore if there is any power cut effect at any time or staggering of the power supply it was the result of such order which falls within the scope of the proviso to clause of the agreement i In respect of electrical energy consumer by all large and heavy power industrial consumers receiving power at KV and above from <ORG> a cut of per cent in their highest maximum demand recorded in any month during the twelve months from August to July shall be exercised Provided that where any such industrial consumer has his own source of generation of energy which alone enables him to obtain per cent or more of his aforesaid highest maximum demand then a cut of per cent in the power supplied by the <ORG> shall be exercised Therefore we think <ORG> is justified in having dismissed the appeal filed by the appellant and we do not think that there is any justification for us to interfere with the award which was made the decree of the civil court and in appeal affirmed by <ORG> However in the circumstances of the case the parties shall bear their respective costs
