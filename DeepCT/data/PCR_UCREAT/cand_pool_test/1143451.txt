OLDFIELD observed that the word representative in Section Civil Procedure Code has no more extended meaning than heir devisee or executor Accordingly when a person purchased mortgaged property from the mortgagor after a decree had been obtained against him by the mortgagee for the enforcement of the latter right such purchaser was held by the Calcutta and Allahabad Courts to be within the meaning of Section a representative of the mortgagor defendant <NAME> <NAME> CAL Clearly it had not inasmuch as it was not the <ORG> which passed the decree The words of the Section absolutely confine the power to grant the sanction to <ORG>s which pass the decree The view taken by the District Judge on this point is right
