The facts leading to these petitions are as follows For all the four years covered by the two petitions the petitioner had created some development rebate reserve and claimed development rebate under section of the Income tax Act It is admitted that during these four years the petitioner had not created the development rebate reserve after taking into consideration the rolling mill rolls installed by it and it had not claimed any rebate in respect of the same One of the conditions prescribed by section of the Income tax Act for allowance of development rebate is that an amount equal to of the development rebate to the actually allowed should be debited to the profit and loss account of the relevant previous assessment year and credited to development rebate reserve account The said circular states that where there is no deliberate contravention of the conditions to creation of reserve fund equal to of the development reserve allowance and the assessee has made his own bona fide computation but the amount so provided is found by the Income tax Officer at the time of the assessment to fall short of the development rebate actually allowable the Income tax Officers are instructed to condone genuine deficiencies subject to the shortfall being made good by the assessee through creation of an additional adequate reserve in the current year books within the time allowed by the Income tax Officer The petitioner filed revised returns and the Income tax Officers granted it the additional development rebate for the four years In Miscellaneous Petition No of there is an additional point However March the petitioner received a rectification notice under section of the income tax Act for the assessment year stating that relief under section had been wrongly given to the petitioner as the dividend was adjusted the loan and neither treated as dividend nor included in the total income of the petitioner The second affidavits was made in the same petition under circumstances which we shall set out later in the judgment Mr <NAME> on behalf of the petitioner contended that there was no error or mistake apparent from the record at all and there is therefore no occasion for amending the original assessment orders in these two petitions We shall follow the test laid down by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> and by <ORG> in the two cases aforesaid in deciding this matter Mr <NAME> for the petitioner has informed us that there are appeals filed by the petitioner against the rectification orders and that the petitioner will withdraw any appeal that may be pending against the rectification order which is set aside by this judgment There are two observations in <ORG> judgment which have led to differences of opinion between various Indian High courts to which we shall refer presently We must bear in mind that <ORG> was dealing with a case where it came to the conclusion that no development rebate reserve had been created No development rebate was originally claimed in the return but when the attention of the assessee was drawn to the fact that it was entitled to development rebate it made the necessary entry creating development rebate reserve on July i after the end of the assessment year in which development rebate was claimed We must point out that was a case in which no development rebate was created during the assessment year although there was a profits far exceeding the amount of the development rebate of Rs The learned judges of <ORG> took the view that in the case of <ORG> <ORG> had decided that unless the reserve was created in the very same according year development rebate should not be granted agreeing with the view of <ORG> and overruling the decision of the Andhra Pradesh and <ORG> The learned judges of the Gujarat High court also took the view that section of the Income tax Act was attracted as there was a mistake apparent on the record of the case <ORG> however took the view that as the entries had been allowed to be made before the assessment was finalised by the Income tax Officer the assessee was entitled to the benefit of the rebate In the case of <ORG> held that it was not necessary that the entries about the development rebate should be made in the accounts on or before the last day of the accounting year or even before preparation of the profit and loss account it held that it was open to the assessee to make the entry at any time before the assessment is completed The question that fell for determination by their Lordships of <ORG> was whether a reserve under section of the Banking Companies Act was a reserve within the meaning of section vib proviso of the Income tax Act and their Lordships were of the opinion that such a reserve could not be treated as a reserve for development rebate under section vib proviso of the Act Even if the entries are made thereafter during the pendency of the assessment proceedings the Income tax Officer may take them into consideration and allow the development rebate With great respect to the learned Judges who have delivered that judgment we are unable to agree with the view taken by them But we have been unable to read those observation in the same light He said that in view of his second argument on the point to which we will come presently it was not necessary for us to put any construction on section as to the time of creation of reserve We however take the view that <ORG> has not decide the point and with respect we do not agree with construction placed by <ORG> on the judgment of <ORG> Mr <NAME> next argued that the question involved in this case is not regarding the interpretation of section of the Income tax Act but the manner of execution of that provision He contended that the instructions of <ORG> are binding on the Income tax Officer and they are bound in the execution of the Act to carry out those instructions We cannot accept this argument as in our opinion these circulars give administrative relief strictly beyond the terms of the relevant sections Mr <NAME> next argued that in this case there was no compliance with the circular of November exhibit to the petition as this was a case of non creation of development rebate reserves and not of insufficiency in the said reserves We are afraid we cannot accept this argument There is no provision in law for separate development rebate reserve created itemwise There is therefore no question of non creation of reserve in respect of rolling mill rolls Mr <NAME> invited our attention to section of the Income tax Act which provides that the <ORG> may from time to time issue such orders instructions and directions to other other than Appellate Assistant Commissioner in the exercise of his appellate functions income tax authorities as it may deem fit the proper administration to this Act and such authorities and all other persons employed in the execution of the Act shall observe and follow such orders instructions and directions of the <ORG> In the said case <ORG> itself gave effect to the circular Mr <NAME> contended that in that case <ORG> enforced the circular as it was issued pursuant to the assurance of a Minister given to <ORG> It is the circular that gives legal validity to the assurance While so holding we must however strike a note of caution that the binding nature of circulars issued by <ORG> must be confined to tax laws and that also for the purpose of giving administrative relief to the taxpayer and not for the purpose of imposing a burden on him In view of the above finding as to the binding nature of the circulars we hold that there is no mistake at all and in any event there is non apparent from the record and the income tax authorities are not entitled to rectify the assessment in respect of the development rebate allowed by them to the petitioner There remains one more point which arises only in Miscellaneous Petition No of On March however the petitioner received a notice under section whereby <ORG> sought to rectify the assessment order for that year on the ground that relief under section was wrongly given to the petitioner since the dividend adjusted in the deposit was not treated as dividend or included in the total income Under section dividend includes any payment by a company of any sum by way of advance or loan to a shareholder being a person who has a substantial interest in the company or any payment by any such company on behalf or for the individual benefit of any such shareholder to the extent to which the company in either case possesses accumulated profits There is therefore no dispute about the fact that the amount of Rs We do not accept this argument because to accept it would be to hold that what is not a dividend for the purpose of section is a dividend for the purpose of section in the same Act and we find no warrant for such a distinction There is therefore no question of the petitioner getting relief under section in respect of the said amount There will therefore be no relief given to the petitioner in respect of the amount of Rs
