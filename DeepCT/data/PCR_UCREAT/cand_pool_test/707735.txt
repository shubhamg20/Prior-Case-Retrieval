Assam Taxation on Goods Carried by Road or on Inland Water ways Act ss High Court Setting aside assessment order but refusing refund on triable issue of limitation Validity of Following the decision in <NAME> case the appeals filed by the <ORG> and others were allowed by this Court on April In November the appellants filed writ petitions before <ORG> seeking direction for refund of the tax paid under mistake relying on <ORG> Judgment in <ORG> Civil Rule No of dated July lO declaring the assessment as without jurisdiction It took the view that it was possible for the appellants to know about the legality of the tax sought to be imposed as early as when the Act in question was declared ultra vires In the appeals to this Court it was contended for the appellants that they had paid the tax under a mistake of law and were entitled to seek refund thereof and a writ petition seeking refund of tax realised without the authority of law cannot be rejected on the ground of limitation or delay unless such delay can be said to amount to laches or has caused some irreparable prejudice to the opposite party There is in such cases concomitant duty to refund the realisation as a corollary of the constitutional inhibition that should be respected unless it causes injustice or loss in any specific case or violates any specific provision of law In the instant case tax was collected without the authority of law The respondents therefore had no authority to retain the money so collected and as such the money was liable to refund In an application under Article of the Constitution the Court has power to direct the refund unless there has been avoidable laches on the part of the petitioner which indicate either the abandonment of his claims or which is of such nature for which there is no probable explanation or which will cause an injury either to respondent or any third party A petition of the former nature is not ordinarily maintainable for the simple reason that a claim for such a refund can always be made in a suit wherein it is open to the <ORG> to raise all possible defences to the claim defences which cannot in most cases be appropriately raised and considered in the exercise of writ jurisdiction In the instant case of the Assam Act provided for refund to a producer or a dealer any sum paid or realised in excess of the sum due from him under that Act The section thus applies only in a case where money is paid under the Act If there is no provision for realisation of the money under the Act the act of payment was ultra vires the money had not been paid under the Act <ORG> having found that the claim for refund was a consequential relief it could have directed the <ORG> to refund the amount in question There being a statement that the appellants came to know of that fact in October and there being no denial by the averment made on this ground <ORG> was in error in presuming that there was a triable issue on this ground and refusing to grant refund There was no unexplained delay There is nothing to indicate that had they been more diligent the appellants could have discovered the constitutional inhibition earlier The position is not clear even if there is a triable issue It is only on the delivery of the judgment in <NAME> case in the appellants realised the right to claim the relief of refund as a consequential relief setting aside the assessment and the assessment was set aside by the very order itself Section of the Act under which an appeal lay within thirty days from the date of service of an assessment order therefore had no application Similarly rule of the Rules framed under the Act barring claims of refund unless made within one year from the date of the original order of assessment being unconstitutional had no application The petitions filed in November were within the period of limitation prescribed in Article of the Limitation Act read with of the Assam Act There is nothing on record to show that the appellants had realised their mistake earlier <ORG> of Bhailal Bhai SCR referred to It was considered unnecessary therefore to consider the larger question whether the bar of limitation would be fatal to a writ petition for refund The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals arise out of the Judgment and order dated th June of <ORG> in Assam setting aside the order and notice of demand under the Assam Taxation on Goods carried by Road or Inland Waterways Act hereinafter called the Act but declining to order any refund of the taxes paid On th of April a new Act passed received the assent of the President Assessment orders were passed under section of the said Act The Division Bench on June passed judgment setting aside the orders and notices of demand but refused relief of refund claimed by the appellant Aggrieved thereby the appellant has preferred the present appeals The appellant petitioner claimed in all these petitions that the assessments were illegal and prayed that directions be given to the respondents to refund the tax collected in pursuance of those orders Thereafter the <ORG> passed the Act which received the assent of the President on Following the aforesaid decision of this Court the appeals filed by the State of Assam and others against the judgment of <ORG> were allowed by this Court on the st April In the judgment under appeal after elaborate discussion <ORG> came to the conclusion that when a petitioner approaches <ORG> with the sole claim for refund of money by writ of mandamus the same is normally not granted but where the refund is prayed as a consequential relief the same is normally entertained if there is no obstruction or if there be no triable issue like that of limitation which could not be conveniently tried in writ petition In this case indisputably it appears that tax was collected without the authority of law It appears that the assessment was made under section of the Act In the premises it is manifest that the respondents had no authority to retain the money collected without the authority of law and as such the money was liable to refund The only question that falls for consideration here is whether in an application under Article of the Constitution the <ORG> should have directed refund As mentioned hereinbefore the question that arises in this case is whether the <ORG> should direct refund of the amount in question Normally speaking in a society governed by rule of law taxes should be paid by citizens as soon as they are due in accordance with law A petition solely praying for the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the State to refund the money alleged to have been illegally collected by the State as tax was not ordinarily maintainable for the simple reason that a claim for such refund can always be made in a suit against the authority which had illegally collected the money as a tax and in such a suit it was open to the State to raise all possible defences to the claim defences which cannot in most cases be appropriately raised and considered in the exercise of writ jurisdiction On th March the petitioners in that case filed a writ petition in <ORG> and contended that section of the said Act was ultra vires the powers of the State Legislature and was violative of Articles and of the Constitution The single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the petition on the ground that the petitioners defrauded their customers and so were not entitled to any relief even if there was a violation of fundamental rights Thereafter it appears that on December the Collector attached the properties of the petitioners for recovering the amount as arrears of land revenue and the petitioners paid the amount in instalments between August and August On the assumption that section of the Act was also liable to be struck down on the same ground on February the petitioners therein filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution claiming a refund of the amount The petitioners contended that they did not know that the section was ultra vires on the particular ground on which this Court had struck it down and they had paid the amounts under coercion or mistake that the mistake was discovered on September the date of the judgment of this Court and that they were entitled to the refund under section of the Indian Contract Act It was held by the majority that the petition should be dismissed on the ground of laches <NAME> held that Article gave the right to move the <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of fundamental rights and the <ORG> cannot place any hindrance in the way of an aggrieved person The Chief Justice reiterated that this <ORG> had put itself in restraint in the matter of petitions under Article Similarly in inquiring into belated and stale claims this <ORG> should take note of evidence of neglect of the petitioner own rights for a long time or of the rights of innocent parties which might have emerged by reason of the delay The Chief Justice emphasised that it was not possible for this <ORG> to lay down any specific period as the ultimate limit of action and each case will have to be considered on its own facts Therefore for the matter of relief in each case this <ORG> had to exercise its description from case to case and where there was appearance of an avoidable delay and the delay affected the merits of the claim this <ORG> held the party disentitled to invoke its extraordinary jurisdiction In the facts of that case the majority Judges found that by his own conduct the petitioner had abandoned his own litigation years ago and the <ORG> would not apply the analogy of the Article in the Limitation Act in cases of mistake of law and give him relief <ORG> in a concurring judgment observed that the normal remedy for recovery of money paid to the <ORG> under coercion or mistake of law is by suit The right to move this <ORG> for enforcement of fundamental rights was guaranteed by Article and no period of limitation was prescribed for such a petition <ORG> emphasised that where the remedy in a writ application under Article or Article corresponded to a remedy in an ordinary suit and the latter remedy was subject to the bar of a statute of limitation the <ORG> imposed on analogy the same limitation on the summary remedy in the writ jurisdiction even though there was no express statutory bar of limitation on grounds of public policy and on the principle that the laws aid the vigilant and not those who slumber <NAME> allowed the appeal because he was of the opinion that the petitioners were under a mistake of law the mistake was discovered like all assessees when the <ORG> struck down section A of the Act and they came to this <ORG> within six months of that date and hence there was no delay He was of the opinion that in the facts of that case there was no delay It may be noted that in the instant case under section of the Act it was provided that the Commissioner shall in the prescribed manner refund to a producer or a dealer any sum paid or realised in excess of the sum due from him under this Act either by case or at the option of the producer or dealer be set off against the sum due from him in respect of any other period Section applies only in a case where money is paid under the Act If there is no provision for realisation of the money under the Act the act of payment was ultra vires the money had not been paid under the Act <ORG> in the instant case after analysing the various decisions came to the conclusion that where a petitioner approached <ORG> with the sole prayer of claiming refund of money by writ of mandamus the same was normally not granted but where the refund was prayed as a consequential relief the same was normally entertained if there was no obstruction or if there was no triable issue like that of limitation We agree that normally in a case where tax or money has been realised without the authority of law the same should be refunded and in an application under Article of the Constitution the <ORG> has power to direct the refund unless there had been avoidable laches on the part of the petitioner which indicate either the abandonment of his claims or which is of such nature for which there is no probable explanation or which will cause any injury either to respondent or any third party It is true that in some case the period of three years is normally taken as a period beyond which the <ORG> should not grant relief but that is not an inflexible rule In this case however <ORG> refused to grant the relief on the ground that when the section was declared ultra vires originally that was the time when refund should have been claimed But it appears to us it is only when the <NAME> case was decided by <ORG> in that the appellant became aware of his crystal right of having the assessment declared ultra vires and in that view of the matter in October when the judgment was delivered in July the appellant came to know that there is mistake in paying the tax and the appellant was entitled to refund of the amount paid There was no unexplained delay There was no fact indicated to <ORG> from which it could be inferred that the appellant had either abandoned his claims or the respondent had changed his position in such a way that granting relief of refund would cause either injury to the respondent or anybody else Similarly it appears to us that this was a tax realised in breach of the section the refund being of the money realised without the authority of law The realisation is bad and there is a concomitant duty to refund the realisation as a corollary of the constitutional inhabitation that should be respected unless it causes injustice or loss in any specific case or violates any specific provision of law There is nothing to indicate that had the appellant been more diligent the appellant could have discovered the constitutional inhibition in The position is not clear even if there is any triable issue Our attention was drawn on behalf of the respondents that under section of the Act an appeal lay in the prescribed manner within thirty days from the date of service of any order of assessment but the challenge to the assessment on the ground that the assessment was bad could not be made in an appeal under the Act because the right to appeal being a creature of the Act if the Act is ultra vires that right would not enure to the benefit of the appellant The respondents filed writ petitions under Article of the Constitution for the issue of writ of mandamus directing the refund of sales tax collected from them They contended that the impugned tax was violative under Article a of the Constitution and they paid the tax under a mistake of law and the tax so paid was refundable under section of the Indian Contract Act The appellant contended that there was no violation of Article of the Constitution and even if there was such violation the tax came within the special provision under Article a of the Constitution and <ORG> had no power to direct refund of tax already paid and in any event <ORG> should not exercise its discretionary power of issuing a writ of mandamus directing this to be done since there was unreasonable delay in filing the petition fundamental rights and statutory rights to grant consequential reliefs by ordering repayment of money realised by the <ORG> without the authority of law Even if there is no such delay in cases where the opposite party raises a prima facie issue as regards the availability of such relief on the merits on grounds like limitation the <ORG> should ordinarily refuse to issue the writ of mandamus Though the provisions of the Limitation Act did not as such it was further held apply to the granting of relief under Article the maximum period fixed by the legislature as the time within which relief by a suit in a Civil <ORG> must be claimed may ordinarily be taken to be a reasonable standard by which delay in seeking remedy under Article could be measured The <ORG> might consider the delay unreasonable even if it is less than the period of limitation prescribed for a civil action for the remedy In this case knowledge is attributable from the date of the judgment in <NAME> case on th July and there being a statement that the appellant came to know of that fact in October and there being no denial by the averment made on this ground <ORG> in our opinion in the instant case was in error in presuming that there was a triable issue on this ground and refusing to grant refund Learned counsel drew our attention to Rule of the Act where it was stated that no claim to any refund shall be allowed unless it was made within one year from the date of the original order of assessment or within one year of the final order passed on appeal or revision as the case may be in respect of such assessment It was contended on behalf of the respondents that here a fixed period of limitation was prescribed and by virtue of Article of the Constitution we should not allow to subvert that rule This principle in our opinion in view of the fact that the rule was unconstitutional will have no application There was no law of limitation especially for public bodies on the virtue of returning what was wrongly recovered to whom it belongs But the statesmen of America have shown an unrivalled skill in providing means for giving legal security to the rights declared by American Constitutions A I this principle was reiterated by <NAME> that it was well settled that the power of <ORG> to issue an appropriate writ under Article of the Constitution was discretionary and <ORG> in the exercise of its discretion did not ordinarily assist the tardy and the indolent or the acquiescent and the lethargic If there was inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner in filing a writ petition and such delay was not satisfactorily explained <ORG> might decline to intervene and grant relief in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction There may be cases where despite delay and creation of third party rights <ORG> may still in the exercise of its discretion interfere and grant relief to the petitioner In this case looked at from one point of view it is only on the delivery of the judgment in <NAME> case in the appellant realised the right to claim the relief of refund as a consequential relief setting aside the assessment and the assessment was set aside by the very order itself in this case We therefore set aside the judgment and order of <ORG> and direct refund of the tax illegally realised by the respondent We set aside the judgment and order to the extent that it refused refund of the tax illegally realised <NAME> I agree with the order proposed by my learned brother but would like to add a word of reservation The appellant contention is that they had paid the taxes under a mistake of law and are entitled to seek refund thereof the maximum period fixed by the <ORG> as the time within which relief by a suit in <ORG> must be claimed may ordinarily be taken to be a reasonable standard by which delay in seeking remedy under Art On the other hand it is contended for the appellants that a writ petition seeking refund of taxes collected without the authority of law cannot be rejected on the ground of limitation or delay unless such delay can be said to amount to laches or has caused some irreparable prejudice to the opposite party or some other like forceful reason exists There is nothing on record either to show that the appellants had realised their mistake even earlier at about the time when the writ petition in the <ORG> case was filed or at the time when the earlier decision of referred in the <ORG> case judgment was rendered On this finding of fact the writ petitions filed by the appellants in November were filed within the period of limitation prescribed in Article read with of the Limitation Act I think therefore that for the purposes of the present case it is unnecessary to consider the larger question whether the bar of limitation should be considered as fatal to a writ petition as to a suit for recovery or whether it is only a relevant but not conclusive factor that should be taken into account by the court in exercising a discretion
