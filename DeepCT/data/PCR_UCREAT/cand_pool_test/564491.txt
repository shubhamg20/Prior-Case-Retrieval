JUDGMENT <NAME> The first of the questions that was referred to this court under section of the Indian Income tax Act ran Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of this case the sums of Rs The claim of the assessee was that it incurred preliminary expenditure to promote a cement company to be known as <ORG> and in the three years of account in question expended large sums to explore possibilities for successfully launching that contemplated cement company The assessee claimed these sums as lawful admissible deductions in computing its profits in the relevant assessment years Certainly there is no scope for invoking section xi because neither when the moneys were expended nor at any time thereafter was there a contract between the assessee company and any other person that the assessee should get back the money in other words that there came into existence a debtor with a liability to pay the debt That the contemplated company was never formed and there was no occasion therefore to obtain the managing agency would not make any difference in principle or alter the character of the expenditure when the money was expended If however the assessee expended the moneys with the expectation even if there was no specific contract with anyone of recovering those moneys the position would obviously be different But there was no such evidence in this case We are referring to this aspect independent of the position whether the claim could be brought under section xi because we have already pointed out that on the material on record there is no scope for invoking section xi Though the <ORG> stated if the companies had in fact been formed following such investigations the advances in question are recoverable from the assets of such companies after formation there was really no material placed by the assessee either before the <ORG> or before us to justify the finding that that was the normal course of its business or even the finding that in expending monies for promoting <ORG> the assessee had every expectation of getting a reimbursement of the moneys so expended quite independent of the question whether the managing agency of the proposed company should be secured or not If the claim was that the money was expended in the usual course of its business with the hope of being reimbursed after the proposed company was formed there was really no material on which such a claim could be founded But that decision relied upon by the learned counsel does not help us to answer the question whether the expenditure incurred by the assessee in this case was expenditure on current repairs or was expenditure in effecting improvements which was of a capital nature The third of the questions referred of this court ran Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the sum of Rs On that submission the <ORG> was right in pointing out that there was no proof that the alleged waiver was for adequate business consideration But independent of what the <ORG> said the assessees claim has to fail because there was no material placed to show that the debt was in fact irrecoverable
