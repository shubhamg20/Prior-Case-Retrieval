The only question in second appeal is whether the plaintiff claim is unsustainable in consequence of a compromise entered into between the parties in a prior suit Original Suit No of That suit was instituted by the plaintiff against the present defendants and others for the recovery of another plot of land The parties entered into a compromise in that suit By the terms of that compromise it was settled inter alia that both the land sued for then and the lands which form the subject matter of this suit should be divided into two moieties and that the plaintiff should take one moiety and the defendants the other moiety The plaintiff being then a minor the compromise was submitted to the court under the provisions of Section of the then Civil Procedure Code and the court gave leave to the plaintiff next friend to enter into the compromise holding it to be beneficial to the minor A decree was afterwards passed in terms of the compromise in so far as it related to the property which was then sued for It is contended before us on behalf of the appellants that this view is wrong and reliance is placed on the decisions of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> I All As there is some conflict of judicial opinion on the point it is desirable to refer at some length to the rulings of <ORG> mentioned above The dispute between the parties was whether the plaintiff was entitled to recover as against the property the interest due to him on the mortgage amount after the date fixed for payment originally in the instrument of mortgage <ORG> observed Although in the view which their Lordships take the question whether those proceedings can be founded on without their having been registered in terms of the Act of does not necessarily arise in this appeal they think it right to add that having heard counsel fully upon the point they are satisfied that the provisions of Section of the Act do not apply to proper judicial proceedings whether consisting of pleadings filed by the parties or of orders made by the court Their Lordships observed the objection founded upon its non registration does not in their Lordships opinion apply to its stipulations and provisions in so far as they were incorporated with and given effect to by the order made upon it by the Subordinate Judge in the suit of But their Lordships are unable to find that any such course was taken either in the <NAME> or in the judicial order which gave effect to it There is no provision in the section that pleadings before a court which are mere statements of parties should be registered It has to be remembered that in one sense the whole of a compromise by which a suit is terminated is put before the court for being recorded though the court will pass a decree in terms thereof only in so far as it relates to the subject matter of the suit When it is placed before the court with a request to record it it becomes part of the pleadings and when the court records it it by implication refers to the whole of the compromise at there is a dictum there in appellants favour The learned judges who decided the case <NAME> and <NAME> JJ There a decree was passed against the defendant for the amount agreed upon as the proper rent by an unregistered compromise The plaintiff would be entitled to recover the amount from the defendant as for use and occupation though that was not the exact ground on which the decision was based The Second Appeal must be dismissed with costs
