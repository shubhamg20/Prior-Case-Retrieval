This appeal is preferred by the appellant questioning the judgment of <ORG> dated Lucknow Bench which reversed the Judgment of <ORG> Lucknow in claim No of TIII of dated The appellant was working in the respondent <ORG> as Senior Accountant from Thereafter on a simple order of termination was passed stating that the appellant had been appointed as Branch Manager by order dated and Condition No of the appointment order provided that the services of the appellant could be terminated at any time after giving one month notice or one month day in lieu thereof and that his services were being terminated with immediate effect in terms of the aforementioned Condition No of the appointment order That was why a simple order of termination was passed and it did not cause any stigma inasmuch as it did not refer to any disciplinary inquiry There was sufficient material to indicate the unsatisfactory work and conduct of the appellant There is no material to establish that the respondent No had outstanding or meritorious service record It further observed Further in view of the law laid down by Hon ble Supreme Court even if some parte preliminary inquiry has been conducted or disciplinary inquiry was initiated to inquire into some misconduct it is the potion of the competent authority to withdraw the disciplinary proceedings and take the action of termination of service under the terms of appointment and the same would not be by way of punishment Aggrieved by the Judgment of <ORG> the appellant has preferred this appeal It is contended by the learned senior counsel for the appellant Sri <NAME> that <ORG> had assumed that the inquiry was a preliminary inquiry report but it was in fact a final one which gave findings as to the quilt of the appellant in regard to the allegation of receiving a bribed of Rs and the said finding was arrived at by examining witnesses behind the back of the appellant and therefore there was a clear violation of principles of natural justice On the basis of the above contention the following point arises for consideration Whether the report of <NAME> was a preliminary report and whether it was the motive or the foundation for the termination order and whether it was permissible to go behind the order On this point the question is whether the contents of the report dated of <NAME> against the appellant were the motive or foundation for the termination order dated issued by the General Manager Now there are two lines of cases decided by this Court which deal with the question in issue In certain cases of temporary servants and probationers this Court has taken the view that if the experts inquiry or report are the motive for the termination order then the termination is not to be called punitive merely because principles of natural justice have not been followed there is another line of cases where this Court has held that the facts revealed in the inquiry are not the motive but the foundation for the termination of the services of the temporary servant of natural justice have not been followed and such orders are to be declared void This Court has held that for finding out whether a given case falls within either of these two categories it is permissible for <ORG> or <ORG> to go behind the order and look into the record of the proceedings the antecedent and attendant circumstances culminating in the order of termination He says Thus a person empowered or required to conduct a preliminary investigation with a view to recommending or deciding whether a formal inquiry or hearing which may lead to a binding and adverse decision should take place is not normally under any obligation to comply with rules of fairness Beetham vs <ORG> A <ORG> vs Byme College of Physicians ex Samuels ND Re Drummoyne The above principles stated in <NAME> are as we shall presently see very close to what is laid down in <NAME> case and other cases decided by this Court There are atleast seven Constitution Bench Judgments and Judgment of seven Judges of this Court on this issue In that case the employee was working in a higher post in an officiating capacity and that appointment was terminated and he was reduced in rank The Government had come to the conclusion on inquiry that the respondent was unsuitable for the post held on probation That case also related to a probationer but was governed by Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules which was a special provision and which stated that where it is proposed to terminate the employment of a probationer whether during or at the and of the period of probation for any specific fault or on account of his unsuitability for the service the probationer shall be apprised of the grounds of such proposal and given an opportunity for show cause against it before orders are passed by the authority competent to terminate the employment There was a report of the Settlement Officer about the misconduct of the employee and the termination was based on the said report It was therefore held that though the order of termination was an order simpliciter still the Court could go behind the same and further if thee foundation was the finding as to misconduct then the order was punitive <NAME> as he then was discussed the earlier cases and held that in every case the purpose of the inquiry was crucial If the inquiry was held only for the purpose of deciding whether the temporary servant should be continued or not it could not be treated as punitive and that the motive operating in the mind of the authority was not relevant But the from in which the order terminating the service is expressed will not be decisive The facts as gathered or revealed in the preliminary inquiry would be the motive and not the foundation since there was no inquiry as to their correctness made We finally come to the seven Judge Judgment rendered in <NAME> vs State of Punjab SCC to which we made a brief reference at the beginning of this Judgment So far as the termination order passed against Sri <NAME> was concerned it was quashed holding it to be punitive as it was based on the report of an Inquiry Officer appointed by the Director of Vigilance Even an innocupusly worded order terminating the service may in the facts and circumstances of the case establish that an inquiry into allegation of serious and grave character of misconduct involving stigma has been made in infraction of Article That is exactly what has happened in the case of <NAME> The learned Judge again referred to the criticism by <NAME> in this branch of law as to what was motive or what was foundation a criticism to which reference was made in <NAME> case The clarification given by the learned Judge is in our opinion very instructive It reads as follows at page Masters and servants cannot be permitted to play hide and seek with the law of dismissals and the plain and proper criteria are not to be misdirected by terminological cover ups or by appeal to psygnic by terminological cover ups or by appeal to psycnic reason for the order whether disclosed or undisclosed To put if slightly differently a termination effected because the master is satisfied of the misconduct and of the consequent desirability of terminating the service of the delinquent servant it is a dismissal even if he had the right in law to terminate with an innocent order under the standing order or otherwise Given an alleged misconduct and a live nexus between it and the termination of service the conclusion is dismissal even if full benefits as on simple termination are given and non inqurious terminology is used The order was innocuous put the case was preceded by an inquiry and it was held that the petitioner in his pleadings had not made out a case for calling for departmental records to examine if it was a case of punishment If on a reading of the two together the <ORG> reached the conclusion that the alleged finding of misconduct was the cause or basis of the order and that but for the report containing such a finding the order would not and could not have been passed the termination order would have to fall to the ground as having been passed without the officer being afforded a reasonable opportunity There was no prior inquiry Following the above case this court in <NAME> case stated that the position before them was similar to what happened in <NAME> case and concluded as follows the departmental inquiry did not proceed beyond the stage of submission of a chargesheet followed by the respondent explanation thereto Of course the above case i <NAME> case was one where there was an adverse entry and only a preliminary report and then a simple order of termination was issued The position is not different even if a preliminary inquiry is held because the purpose of a preliminary inquiry is to find out if there is prima facie evidence or material to initiate a regular departmental inquiry It has been so decided in <NAME> case That is what is held in <NAME> case and in <NAME> case But in cases where the termination is preceded by an inquiry and evidence is received and findings as to misconduct of a definitive nature are arrived at behind the back of the Officer and where on the basis of such a report the termination order is issued such an order will be violative of principles of natural justice inasmuch as the purpose of the inquiry is to find out the truth of the allegations with a view to punish him and not merely to gather evidence for a future regular departmental inquiry In view of the principles laid down in the cases referred to above this case is an obvious case where the report and its findings are the foundation of the termination order and not merely the motive For all the above reasons we set aside <ORG> Judgment and restore the <ORG> order
