There in the presence of <NAME> the accused went to the extent of saying that <NAME> may go to hell but he should get the money forthwith Thereafter the accused left <NAME> at their house and went to court at about a At a shrieks were heard from their house and when people rushed in they found <NAME> lying on the ground with extensive burn injuries <ORG> on appeal acquitted the accused holding that even though <NAME> had committed suicide on account of her unhappy married life there was nothing on the record to show that the appellant in any manner instigated the deceased to commit suicide On behalf of the accused it was contended that even if the prosecution evidence was accepted in full there was no material to show that the suicidal death of <NAME> was abetted in any manner by the accused A There is overwhelming evidence in the case to estab lish that <NAME> life was made intolerable by the accused by constantly demanding her to get him money and also beating her frequently Viewed in the background of <NAME> plight during the few days preceding her death and the events that took place on the morning of the tragedy the utterances by the accused to the effect that she can provide him relief quicker by dying on the very same day would have certainly been seen by <NAME> as an instigation to her to commit suicide Therefore in order to decide wheth er a person has abetted by instigation the commission of an offence or not the act of abetment has to be judged in the conspectus of the entire evidence in the case The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Appeal No of by Special Leave and Appeal No of by Special Leave arising out of Special Leave Crl <NAME> complained to her parents brother and brother in law about the cruel treatment meted out to her by the accused Again just one day before her death i she wrote to her mother PW Shanti Devi a pathetic letter as follows Yesterday I was to come to see <NAME> in the evening but there is a quarrel in the house After PW <NAME> woke up he made enquiries and <NAME> told him that the accused was demanding money from her and annoying her on that account in spite of her telling him that she had written letters to her brother and mother After things had gone to such a pitch the accused and <NAME> left the house of PW <NAME> at about a and went back to their house On receipt of an intimation from the hospital entries were made in the general diary and subsequently a case was registered on the basis of representations made to PW the Deputy Superintendent of Police by PW <NAME> and another relation He however stated that he had offered to repay the amount as soon as he received his amount The accused preferred an appeal to <ORG> and a learned single judge of <ORG> has acquitted the accused holding that even though <NAME> had committed suicide on account of her unhappy married life there is nothing on the record to show that the appellant in any manner instigated the deceased to commit suicide <NAME> learned counsel for the <ORG> and Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the father of <NAME> took us through the evidence in the case and the judgments of the Addl Sessions Judge and <ORG> and argued that <ORG> has completely erred in its appreciation of the evidence and in its application of the law and there fore the appeals should be allowed and the conviction and sentence awarded to the accused should be restored <NAME> learned counsel for the accused contended that even if the prosecution evidence is accepted in full there is no material to show that the suicidal death of <NAME> was abetted in any manner by the accused and hence the judgment of <ORG> does not call for any interfer ence We have considered the evidence and the arguments of the counsel in great detail There is thus overwhelming evidence in the case to establish that <NAME> life was made intolerable by the accused by constant ly demanding her to get him money and also beating her frequently Despite treatment she succumbed to her injuries by about a The autopsy revealed that her death was due to severe shock resulting from the burn injuries sustained by her To determine this question we must see the plight of <NAME> during the few days preceding her death and the events which had taken place on the morning of itself When <NAME> pleaded inability to make immediate payment the accused told her that he did not care even if she went to hell but he wanted immediate payment Yet another factor to be borne in mind is that there is no evidence as to what transpired between the accused and <NAME> after they had left the house of PW <NAME> The only two persons who could speak about it are the accused and <NAME> and since she is dead it is only the accused who can throw some light on the matter We may now look to the relevant provisions of the law If any person commits suicide whoever abets the commission of such suicide shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine Explanation I A person who by wilful mis representation or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose voluntarily causes or procures or attempts to cause or procure a thing to be done is said to instigate the doing of that thing The case of the accused would squarely fall under the first category viz Unless a serious quarrel had taken place the accused and <NAME> would not have gone to the house of PW <NAME> in the early hours of the morning itself to seek a solution to the problem Then again <ORG> has remarked that <NAME> was suffering from depression and a diseased mind and hence she would have committed suicide Far from there being any evidence to show that <NAME> was having a diseased mind PW <NAME> and PW <NAME> have stated that <NAME> was a woman of gentle and amiable disposition We are there fore more than satisfied that the judgment of <ORG> suffers from serious errors and infirmities and is therefore manifestly unsustainable We do not find any merit in the conten tion Though the Sessions Judge and <ORG> had held that <NAME> act would amount to abetment of the commission of the of fence of murder in terms of Explanation II to Section I this <ORG> held that apart from the words attribut ed to <NAME> there is nothing at all to show that she was aware of the nefarious design of <NAME> and his associates This principle will however have no application where the evidence does not afford scope for two plausible views being taken but still <ORG> or <ORG> acquits an accused for reasons which are patently wrong and the error leads to an element of perversity pervading the judgment Therefore in order to decide whether a person has abetted by instigation the commission of an offence or not the act of abetment has to be judged in the conspectus of the entire evidence in the case By reason of Section A the Courts can presume that the commission of suicide by a woman has been abetted by her husband or relation if two factors are present viz that the woman had committed suicide within a period of seven years from her marriage and that the husband or rela tion had subjected her to cruelty We are referring to these provisions only to show that the <ORG> has realised the need to provide for additional provisions in the Indian Penal Code and the Indian Evidence Act to check the growing menace of dowry deaths Taking all factors into consideration we think that the ends of justice would be met if we substitute the sentence awarded to the accused with the sentence of imprisonment for the period already undergone by him and enhance the sentence of fine from Rs to Rs with a direction that out of the fine amount if paid a sum of Rs The <ORG> judgment is accordingly set aside and the appeals are allowed and the conviction of the accused under Section I is restored but the sentence is modified to the period of imprisonment already undergone and fine of Rs in default thereof to suffer I for two years
