<ORG> dismissed the writ petitions filed by the appellants who were petitioners before the <ORG> appellants who were petitioners before the <ORG> who challenged the notification issued by the State of Uttar Pradesh on th January under Section of Land Acquisition Act hereinafter referred to as the Act and also the notification under Section of the Act whereby the writ petitioners lands situated at village Chhalera banger then situated in District Ghaziabad in the State of Utter Pradesh were sought to be acquired Before we deal with the main contentions canvassed by learned senior counsel <NAME> appearing for appellants in some of the appeals and <NAME> learned counsel for appellants in other appeals it will be necessary to note a few background facts leading to these proceedings <ORG> is an authority entrusted with the task of developing lands in the district of Ghaziabad in the Stat of Uttar Pradesh Thereafter again in the year further lands were acquired from the same village for the purpose of <ORG> by the State of Uttar Pradesh issuing notification under Section of the Act on th October After hearing the objections put forward against the acquisition by the objectors concerned ultimately the State of Uttar Pradesh issued notification under Section of the Act on th December It was thereafter that <ORG> submitted a proposal to acquire the lands under the present acquisition on th June Therefore it was requested that necessary notification under Section read with Section of the Act may be got issued immediately It was thereafter that on th January the impugned notification was issued by <ORG> in exercise of powers under sub section of Section of the Act It was stated therein that the lands mentioned in the Schedule to the notification were required for public interest that is for the planned industrial development of district Ghaziabad through <ORG> It was recited in the said notification that the Governor was of the opinion that sub clauses of sub section of Section of the Act shall apply to the aforementioned land because the said land was essentially urgently required for the planned industrial development in District Ghaziabad through <ORG> and in view of this urgency and essential requirement it was also necessary that possible delay for inspection under Section A may be condoned It was declared therein that the land mentioned in the notification was required in public interest i for the planned development of District Ghaziabad through <ORG> It was also stated that the Governor was satisfied that this matter was to be disposed of urgently therefore in exercise of power sunder sub section of Section of the Act he was also pleased to direct that though no decision had been given under Section the Collector of Ghaziabad could take possession of the aforesaid land mentioned in Schedule for public interest after days of the publication of the notice under sub section of Section Rival Contentions <NAME> learned senior counsel for the appellants in some of the appeals and <NAME> learned counsel for the other appellants contended that the impugned notification are null and void mainly on two grounds i that there was no relevant material before the State authorities to enable them to invoke Section of the Act and to dispense with the inquiry under Section A of the Act and that the grounds sought to be made out by the State authorities in this connection were legally unsustainable and therefore the direction contained in the impugned notification under Section invoking Section sub section of the Act and in dispensing with inquiry under Section A was liable to be set aside and consequently notification under Section also was required to be quashed <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for appellants in appeal arising from Special leave Petition No of submitted that these appellants had already filed a suit against <ORG> for permanently restraining <ORG> from acquiring the appellants land which is covered by the present acquisition proceedings on the ground that it was having Abadi thereon <NAME> learned senior counsel for the appellants in support of his submission that there was an existing Abadi on the land sought to be acquired invited out attention to the relevant evidence on the record and contended that in any view of the matter appellants land having Abadi in the light of the policy consistently followed by the contesting respondents could not have been acquired In support of the aforesaid contentions learned senior counsel for the appellants placed before us certain decisions of this Court to which we will refer at an appropriate stage in the latter part of this judgment It was contended by learned counsel for the appellants that <ORG> had erred in taking the view that the <ORG> was justified in involving the provisions of Section of the Act on the facts and circumstances of the cases He however fairly stated that if it is held that the <ORG> authorities could not have dispensed with Section A inquiry and if the appellants are to be given an opportunity to put forward their written objections before the acquiring authority under Section A of the Act then the second question regarding Abadi lands immunity from being acquired may not be decided at this stage Repelling these contentions <NAME> learned senior counsel for <ORG> and Dr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the state of Uttar Pradesh contended that no error was committed by <ORG> in upholding the applicability of Section sub section to the present proceedings as there was sufficient material before the authorities to come to that decision It was also submitted by them that the material relied upon by the State authorities for dispensing with inquiry under Section A of the Act was quite relevant and this Court would not sit in appeal over the subjective satisfaction of the authorities in this connection as it is well settled that if such subjective satisfaction for invoking section of the Act is found to be based on relevant material it cannot be challenged in a court of law by requesting the court to re appreciate such evidence especially when there was no challenge to the acquisition proceedings on the ground of mala ides That <NAME> is a term of art which connotes construction for residential purposes on village site lands and it has nothing to do with agricultural lands situate beyond village sites It was also submitted by <NAME> learned senior counsel for <ORG> that <ORG> judgment which is not final till date had loosely treated lands having construction as <NAME> lands and consequently it could not be urged by the appellants that their lands having some stray construction thereon could not have been acquired under the Act in the light of the policy decision of the State authorities of the contesting respondents not to acquire lands having <NAME> It was lastly contended placing reliance on some of the judgments of this <ORG> to which we will make a reference hereinafter that acquisition for the planned development of a township on a large scale would entitle the authorities to invoke urgency provisions of Section of the Act and that <ORG> has not erred in relying upon this legal position It was submitted that the appellants given an opportunity to have their written objections under section A of the Act will fully co operate in the proceedings and will abide by the appropriate directions regarding maintenance of time schedule for such an inquiry as may be fixed by this <ORG> <NAME> also sought to distinguish judgments of this <ORG> on which strong reliance was placed by learned senior counsel for contesting respondents In the light of the above rival contentions the following points arise for out determination In any case whether the appellants lands have to be treated as immune from acquisition proceedings on the ground that they were having <NAME> thereon and were therefore governed by the policy decision of the State of not to acquire such lands Whether this Court should refuse to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution of India in the facts and circumstances of the case Then follows section A Sub section thereof provides that any persons interested in any land which has been notified under section sub section as being needed or is likely to be needed for a public purpose may within days from the date of publication of the notification object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case maybe Sub section of Section A of the Act lays down the procedure in connection with such inquiry The objections under Section a are to be lodged in writing with the Collector and the Collector is required to give the objector an opportunity of being heard in person or by any persons authorised by him in this behalf or by pleader and shall after hearing all such objections and after making such further inquiry if any as he thinks necessary either make a report in respect of the land which has been notified under Section sub section or make different reports to the <ORG> and in the light of the said report the appropriate government has to come to its own decision on the objections and such decision is made final under the Act Then follows Section sub section which lays down that subject to the provisions of part vii of the Act when the appropriate <ORG> is satisfied after considering the report if any made under Section A sub section that any particular land is needed for a public purpose or for a company a declaration can be made by the appropriate <ORG> for acquiring such lands It is therefor obvious that under the normal scheme of land acquisition proceedings under the Act before any land can be acquired by issuing notification under Section the gamut of hearing of objections to such proposed acquisition as laid down by Section A has to be followed It is in this light that Section of the Act which permits dispensing with inquiry under Section A in appropriate cases has to be appreciated In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in Section sub section take possession of any land needed for public purpose In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under Section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under Section sub section It may be noted that prior to sub section of section could be invoked only in cases of lands which were waste and arable and qua acquisition of such lands if there was any urgency Section Sub section could invoked and accordingly even after issuance of notification of Section and before award is passed possession of such lands could be taken on expiry of days of the publication of notice under Section sub section The words Waste or arable however were deleted from the parent Act by Amending Act of with the result that now under the main Central Act for any type of lands even if they may be waste or arable or may not be so in cases of urgency provisions of section sub section can be invoked and equally for any type of lands sought to be acquired in cases of urgency the provisions of section sub section can be invoked meaning thereby the intermediate procedure under Section A sandwiched between sections and can be legitimately dispensed with and notification under Section can follow almost on the heels of section notification in cases of urgency when appropriate direction under Section sub section is issued by the appropriate <ORG> being subjectively satisfied about the requisite requirement about invoking these provision Pursuant to the said State amendment a new sub section A was added to Section of the parent Act in its application to Uttar Pradesh to the following effect The power to take possession under sub section may also be exercised in the case of other than waste or arable land where the land is acquired for or in connection with sanitary improvements of any kind or planned development Therefore so far as the <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh in concerned any type of land after th November even though not being waste or arable could be subjected to the provisions of Section sub section Even if the acquisition was for the planned development of any area and there was no material before the appropriate <ORG> for dispensing with inquiry under Section A on the touchstone of any urgency as found by the appropriate <ORG> the provisions of Section sub section as amended by the Amending Act VIII of could not have been invoked As we are concerned only with the applicability of Section sub section it will be necessary to find out whether there was any relevant material with the appropriate <ORG> namely respondent <ORG> of UP herein to enable it to arrive at its subjective satisfaction about dispensing with inquiry under Section A in connection with the present acquisition Before we deal with the judgments of this <ORG> on the point it will be necessary to quickly glance through the factual backdrop leading to the present proceedings By a notification dated th April the <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh exercising powers under sub section of section issued a notification in the name of the Governor of Uttar Pradesh to the effect that various plots of lands mentioned in the notification were needed for public purpose that is for the planned industrial development in the district which was then known as Bullandshahr and the said acquisition was through the <ORG> for that purpose We were informed by senior counsel <NAME> for <ORG> that even though in the earlier acquisition of pursuant to section notification inquiry under Section A was not dispensed with by the time Section notification came to be issued section was resorted to as urgency had developed at least by the end of December But curiously enough nothing happened urgently and Section notification which is impugned in the present case was issued on th January more than one year elapsed in the meantime Why this delay took place and why the <ORG> did not think it fit to urgency respond to the proposal of Noida has remained a question mark for which there is no answer furnished by the respondent authorities in the present cases and nothing is brought on the record by them to explain this delay It has therefore necessarily to be presumed that despite the emergency powers of the <ORG> <ORG> being invoked by <ORG> the <ORG> authorities in their wisdom did not think the matter to be so urgent as to immediately respond the promptly issue section notification read with Section The impugned notification of recites that for public interest i for the planned industrial development through <ORG> the lands mentioned in the schedule to the notification were required to be acquired It was further recited in he notification that because the lands were essentially required for the planned development in District Ghaziabad through <ORG> in exercise of powers under sub section of Section provisions of Section A of the Act were dispensed with The learned senior counsel for the appellants vehemently submitted that in the background of the aforesaid fact situation it appeared that when the <ORG> authorities invoked sub section of section on in connection with present acquisition in fact there was no urgency as even earlier in when from this very village for the very purpose lands were acquired the <ORG> authorities in their wisdom did not think it fit to apply urgency clause and to dispense the inquiry under Section A and in fact heard the objectors Even that apart despite proposal to acquire this land was moved by <ORG> as early as on th June and even thereafter when the request was sent in this connection on th December the <ORG> authorities did not think the situation to be so urgent as to respond quickly and could wait for more than one year When the appellants in the writ petitions before the High <ORG> raised their grievances regarding dispensing with inquiry under Section A being not backed up by relevant evidence and the subjective satisfaction of the <ORG> in this connection was brought in challenge all that was stated by <ORG> in its counter in para was to the effect that the contents of paras and of the writ petition were denied and that the petitioners were not able to point out any lacunae in the proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act When we turn to paragraphs and of the writ petition we find averments to the effect that the urgency of the acquisition was only for the purpose of depriving the petitioners of their rights to file objections under Section A and their right to hold the possession till they got compensation for which the respondents had issued notification under Section as well as notification under Section of the Act But so far as the process of the acquisition was concerned the respondents were taking their own time which would be evident from the fact that the notification under Section read with Section was issued on th January but was published in the newspaper on th March whereas the declaration under Section of the Act was made on th January and that on the one hand respondents had deprived the petitioners of filing their objections under Section A of the Act on the ground of urgency of acquisition but on the other hand they themselves had taken more than nine months in issuing the declaration under section of the said Act This conduct of the respondents falsified their claim of urgency of acquisition When we turn to these annexures we find that Annexure CA is a letter dated st April written by the District Magistrate Ghaziabad to the Joint Secretary <ORG> <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh It recites that on examination it was found that the land was immediately required in public interest so that the development work in the said land could be carried out smoothly What was the nature of urgency is not mentioned in the said letter When we turn to Annexure CA which is dated th June we find that the District Magistrate Ghaziabad wrote to the Joint Secretary <ORG> <ORG> of that as to how many farmers were going to be affected by the proposed acquisition It does not even whisper about the urgency of the situation which requires dispensing with Section A inquiry The last Annexure CA is the letter dated th December written by <ORG> to the Land Acquisition Officer proposing urgent acquisition of the lands in question We have already made a reference to the said letter It recites that if immediate action for acquisition of the aforesaid lands adjacent to Sector for development of which the acquisition was to be resorted to was not taken them there was possibility of encroachment over this area To say the least possibility of encroachment over he area cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered to be a germane ground for invoking urgency powers for dispensing with Section A inquiry Even if acquisition taken place urgently by dispensing with inquiry under Section A and the possession is taken urgently after Section notification within days of issuance of notice under Section sub section even then there is no guarantee that the acquired land would not be encroached upon by unruly persons It is a law and order problem which has nothing to do with the acquisition and urgency for taking possession Even that apart it is easy to visualise that if objectors are heard in connection with Section A inquiry and in the meantime they remain in possession of land sought to be acquired they would be the best persons to protect their properties against encroachers Consequently the ground put forward by <ORG> in its written requested dated for invoking urgency powers must be held to be totally irrelevant Even that apart if that was the urgency suggested by <ORG> on we fail to appreciate as to how the <ORG> authorities did not respond to that proposal equally urgently and why they issued notification under Section read with Section after one year in January If the urgency was of such a nature that it could not brook the delay on account of Section A proceedings it is difficult to appreciates as to why section notification in the present case could be issued only after one year from the issuance of Section notification This also shows that according to the <ORG> authorities there was no real urgency underlying dispensing with Section A inquiry despite <ORG> suggesting at the top of its voice about the need for urgently acquiring the lands for the development of sector no and other sectors So far as the present proceedings are concerned the situation was tried to be salvaged further in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> It has been averred in para of the counter to the effect that what necessitated application of emergency provisions was imminent possibility of unauthorised construction and or encroachment upon the suit land which would have hammered the speedy and planned industrial development of the area which was the purpose of acquisition proceedings We could have appreciated the stand of the <ORG> authorities for invoking urgency clause under Section of the Act on the ground that when about acres of land were to be acquired for further planned development of Sector and other sectors of Noida as mentioned in the impugned notification hearing of objectors who might have filed written objections when there are large number of occupants of these lands and who possess about plots of land under acquisition would have indefinitely delayed the acquisition proceedings and years would have rolled by before Section notification could have been issued In the light of the aforesaid factual position emerging on the record of the case it becomes clear that there was no relevant material before the <ORG> authorities when it invoked powers under sub section of section for dispensing with Section A inquiry while issuing the impugned notifications under Section followed by Section notification of <ORG> was constituted under the provisions of Urban Planning and Development Act for the purpose of tackling the problem of town planing and urban development <ORG> before which the acquisition proceedings were challenged took the view that because there was delay of one year between Section and Section notifications the urgency clause under Section was wrongly invoked Upturning the said decision of <ORG> this <ORG> held that the delay of one year was clearly explained on the facts of the case as there was a corrigendum to be issued to Section notification and when it was pointed out to the <ORG> authorities by the Collector the authorities issued the corrigendum and simultaneously issued section notification on which strong reliance was placed by <NAME> learned senior counsel for the appellants and observed that perhaps at the time to which the said decision related situation might have been that the schemes relating to development of residential areas in the urban centres were not so urgent and it was not necessary to eliminate the inquiry under Section A of the Act But even on this basis it has to be shown by the authority invoking such emergent action to satisfy the <ORG> when challenge is raised that the particular development of residential areas concerning the acquired lands in the then existing fact situation required dispensing with Section A inquiry The <ORG> in para of the Report noted that there was material before the <ORG> in the case upon which it could have acted when it formed the requisite opinion that it was a case calling for exercise of power under Section sub Section The material placed before the <ORG> disclosed that the <ORG> found on due verification that there was an acute scarcity of the land and there was heavy pressure for construction of houses for weaker sections and middle income group people that Housing Board had obtained a loan of Rs It was also noted that there was material on record to show that <ORG> had already appointed a large number of engineers and other subordinate staff for carrying out the said work and that holding an inquiry under Section A would have resulted in uncalled for delay endangering the entire scheme and time schedule of <ORG> It was also noted that satisfaction under Section sub section was a subjective one and that so long as there was material upon which the <ORG> could have formed the said satisfaction fairly the <ORG> would not interfere nor would it examine the material as an appellate authority We fail to appreciate as to how the said decision rendered in the peculiar facts of the case before this <ORG> could ever be pressed in the service in the peculiar facts of the present cases to which we have made a detailed reference earlier It is time for us now to refer to a few other judgments to which our attention was invited by learned senior counsel for the respective parties SCC a three Judge Bench of this Court speaking through <NAME> <NAME> had to consider the question whether invocation of powers under Section sub section of the Land Acquisition Act for dispensing with the inquiry under Section A in connection with acquisition of land for development of industrial areas and residential tenements could be justified on the facts of that case This in itself on the fact of it does not call for any such action barring exceptional circumstances as to make immediate possession without holding even a summary enquiry under Section A of the Act imperative On the other hand such schemes generally take sufficient period of time to enable at least summary inquiries under Section A of the Act to be completed without any the scheme Therefore the very statement of the public purpose for which the land was to be acquired indicated the absence of such urgency on the apparent facts of the case as to require the elimination of an enquiry under Section A of the Act Again the uniform and set recital of a formula like a ritual of mantra apparently applied mechanically to every case itself indicated that the mind of the Commissioner concerned was only applied to the question whether the land was waste or arable and whether its acquisition is urgently needed All schemes relating to development of industrial and residential areas must be urgent in the context of the country need for increased production and more residential accommodation yet the very nature of such schemes of development does not appear to demand such emergent action as to eliminate summary enquiries under Section A of the Act There is no indication whatsoever in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> that the mind of the Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry under Section A of the Act The recitals in the notifications on the other hand indicate that elimination of the enquiry under Section A of the Act was treated as an automatic consequence of the opinion formed on other matters The recital does not say at all that any opinion was formed on the need to dispense with the enquiry under Section A of the Act The burden therefore rested upon the <ORG> to remove the defect if possible by evidence to show that some exceptional circumstances which necessitated the elimination of an enquiry under Section A of the Act and that the mind of the Commissioner was applied to this essential question It seems to us that the High court correctly applied the provisions of Section of the Evidence Act to place the burden upon the <ORG> to prove those special circumstances although it also appears to us that <ORG> was not quite correct in stating its view in such a manner as to make it appear that some part of the initial burden of the petitioners under Sections and of the Evidence Act had been displaced by the failure of the <ORG> to discharge its duty under Section of the Act The correct way of putting it would have been to say that the failure of the <ORG> to produce the evidence of facts especially within the knowledge of its officials which rested upon it under section of the Evidence Act taken together with the attendant facts and circumstances including the contents of recitals had enabled the petitioners to discharge their burden under Sections and of the Evidence Act wherein <NAME> dealing with the question of exercise of emergency powers under section of the Act observed in para of the Report that save in real urgency where public interest did not brook even the minimum time needed to give a hearing land acquisition authorities should not having regard to Articles and burke an inquiry under Section of the Act We may now refer to decision of a three judge Bench of this <ORG> in the case of <NAME> and <ORG> SCR to which our attention was invited by learned counsel <NAME> appearing for appellants in some of the appeals It is to the effect whether on the facts of these cases there was any relevant material before the <ORG> authorities to invoke powers under Section sub section It is now time for us to refer to certain latter decisions of this Court to which strong reliance was placed by <NAME> learned senior counsel for <ORG> It will all depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case Another decision to which our attention was invited by <NAME> learned senior counsel for <ORG> is reported in SCC Ghaziabad Development Authority Vs <NAME> Sheopuri ghaziabad and Anr <NAME> examined an entirely different question as to whether notification under Section could be issued simultaneously with the notification under Section When Section A was dispensed with under Section sub section It was noted that this Court itself had issued earlier time bound directions for procurement of land for STP in various parts of Delhi We fail to appreciate as to how the aforesaid fact situation and the direction to the <ORG> to move quickly and urgently as issued by this Court which was binding on the <ORG> authorities could be legitimately pressed in service by <NAME> in the facts of this case which stand on an entirely different footing as noted earlier In the light of the aforesaid discussion therefore the conclusion becomes inevitable that the action of dispensing with inquiry under Section A of the Act in the present cases was not based on any real and genuine subjective satisfaction depending upon any relevant data available to the State authorities at the time when they issued the impugned notification under section of the Act and dispensed with Section A inquiry by resorting to Section sub section thereof Point No So far as this point is concerned <NAME> learned senior counsel for the appellants submitted that much prior to the issuance of Section notification and after the earlier acquisition of bighas of land from the appellants own Survey No as the appellant was apprehending further acquisition of a portion of land on which his construction stood the appellant was constrained to file a civil suit against <ORG> for a declaration that the appellant was the owner and in possession of land measuring bigha biswas comprising in Khasra No situated in village Chhalera Banger and abadi stood therein for about years After hearing the plaintiff and <ORG> the Civil court came to the conclusion on evidence that there was abadi in the disputed property <ORG> also noted the contention of <ORG> which was defendant in that case that if disputed land was abadi land of the plaintiff then he could file objections under Section A of the Land Acquisition Act against the proposed acquisition proceedings and if his abadi was proved on the disputed land then his abadi land could be left out Thus final court of facts came to the conclusion that there was abadi of the appellant on the land in question even prior to the date of Section notification in the present case Be that as it may the contention of <NAME> learned senior counsel for the appellants was that there was sufficient evidence on the record of this case to show that the disputed land under acquisition was having abadi since number of years and that was prior to the issuance of section notification dated th January he also invited our attention to the further fact that pending the proceeding before the high Court a site inspection report was prepared in connection with diverse lands under acquisition and the appellant Khasra No was one of them This report dated th March was submitted by Officer on Special Duty <ORG> <ORG> which clearly shows that at the time when the inspection was made of Khasra No belonging to the appellant on the extend of acres and bighas of land factory was located and the property was being used also for residential purpose Learned senior counsel for <ORG> submitted that the aforesaid inspection report was one sided and it did not indicated whether <ORG> authorities were also present at the time of the said report The learned counsel appearing for the appellants in the remaining appeals also submitted that there was abadi on the lands occupied by these appellants also It is submitted on behalf of the appellants by their learned counsel that there is a policy followed by the State of Uttar Pradesh not to acquire lands which are having abadi and consequently if Section A inquiry was held the appellants could have requested the appropriate authorities not to acquire these lands But according to him <ORG> decree which has not become final tries to equate construction with abadi but in the strict sense of the term it would not be abadi which would be covered by the State policy of not acquiring lands having such abadi as any stray construction made on agricultural lands outside the village sites reserved for putting up construction of residential quarters in villages would not be covered by the State policy of not acquiring such abadi lands It was also submitted by <NAME> learned senior counsel for <ORG> and Dr <NAME> learned senior counsel for <ORG> that what is necessary to be seen is whether there was any real abadi on the lands under acquisition on the date of Section notification dated th January as any subsequent construction put up thereafter by any of the occupants would not create any equitable rights in their favour and any subsequent construction and change of user of the land covered by Section notification cannot be of any avail In view of the aforesaid rival contentions therefore it appears to us that in the present proceedings arising out of petitions under Article of the Constitution of India it is not possible to come to a definite conclusion on these highly disputed questions of fact namely whether the lands in dispute were part of village site lands reserved for construction of residential houses and whether they were covered by the term abadi so as to subjected to any policy decision of the <ORG> for excluding such abadi lands from acquisition proceedings Not only that but <ORG> in the impugned judgment has referred to the set of evidence on record and has held that there is no evidence showing the extent of construction on the lands Consequently no direction can be issued to the <ORG> authorities straightaway to release these lands from acquisition by coming to a firm finding that there were existing old abadi on these lands and which were squarely covered by any <ORG> policy of not acquiring lands having abadi thereon We may also mention at this stage that apart from the appellants in Civil Appeal arising out of No of in cases of other appellants no civil suits were filed and therefore in their cases the question even about construction if any is totally at large That the moot question is whether the lands under acquisition in the present case were having abadi at the time of issuance of Section notification and whether such construction if any could be said to be abadi as covered by a policy decision of the <ORG> of not to acquire such lands Now remains the vital question as to whether in the light of our finding on point No the notification under Section so far as it dispenses with Section A inquiry by invoking powers under Section of the Act and the consequential notification under Section are required to be set aside or not That the disputed lands belonging to the appellants may have stray complex of lands sought to be acquired That if notification under Section read with Section is set aside qua these pockets of lands then the entire development activity in the complex will come to a grinding halt and that would not be in the interest of anyone It was also contended by learned senior counsel for the respondents that it was not the appellants contention that the proposed acquisition was not for public purpose nor any mala fides were alleged to the behind such acquisition Under these circumstances we find considerable force in the contention of learned senior counsel for the respondent that it is neither advisable nor feasible to interfere with the acquisition of such large tracts of lands when the occupants of th of the acquired lands have not thought it fit to challenge these acquisition proceedings and the occupants of only th of lands are agitating there grievance since more than six years firstly before the High court and then before this Court We may also keep in view the further alien fact that all the appellants have filed reference for additional compensation under Section of the Act Therefore without prejudice to their contentions in the present proceedings they have filed such references Under these circumstances for enabling the appellants to have their say regarding release of their lands on the ground that they are having abadi and that the <ORG> Policy helps them in this connection the appellants can be permitted to have their grievances voiced before the <ORG> authorities under Section rather than under Section A of the Act at such a late stage Point No Now remains the moot question as to what proper orders can be passed in the present proceedings in the light of our findings on the aforesaid points Except in the case provided for in Section the Government shall be at liberty to withdraw from the acquisition of any land of which possession has not been taken Whenever the Government withdraws from any such acquisition the collector shall determine the amount of compensation due for the damage suffered by the owner in consequence of the notice or of any proceedings thereunder and shall pay such amount to the person interested together with all costs reasonably incurred by him in the prosecution of the proceedings under this Act relating to the said land Our attention was invited to a possession receipt annexed to the counter affidavit filed on behalf of Respondent No Secretary <ORG> It is stated in the counter that <ORG> has been put in possession of the acquired lands from th March and the lands under acquisition now form a part of Sectors and of <ORG> i say and submit that a day prior to the date on which the interim order was passed the Petitioner had already lost possession and the th Respondent was put in actual physical possession of the land which is the subject matter of this petition Our attention was also invited to possession certificate at Page which mentions that for the elands detailed in the Certificate possession should be given to the Tehsildar Administrative officer <ORG> on th March It is difficult to appreciate as to how the possession Certificate for all these numbers of lands would necessarily include actual taking over of number of lands on which there were constructions on the spot at the relevant time It therefore appears to us that so far as the appellants lands are concerned only an effort was made to take paper possession on th March and actual possession does not seem to have been taken Consequently it is not possible to agree with the submission of learned senior counsel for the respondents that the possession of the acquired lands belonging to the appellants was actually taken on the spot on th March It was them contended that before this <ORG> could grant any interim relief possession appeared to have been taken of these lands at least on th November If the constructions on the disputed lands under acquisition were not to be distributed how it could be contended that still the possession of the constructions was with <ORG> and that they would not demolish the construction having taken their possession Even that apart the authority letter dated th November itself shows the details lands possession of which was given to <ORG> and the land of Survey No is not one of them For all these reasons therefore it must be held that possession of the lands under acquisition belonging to the present appellants has remained with the appellants till date It is of course true that the said provision gives liberty to the <ORG> to withdraw form acquisition of any land but if the appellants are in the position to convince the <ORG> authorities that their lands were having abadi on the date on which section notification was issued on th January and it was that abadi which had continued without any additional construction thereon till the date of Section notification and thereafter and such abadi was squarely covered by the <ORG> policy of not acquiring lands having abadi then it will be open to the <ORG> authorities to pass appropriate orders for withdrawing such lands from acquisition and give appropriate relief to the applicants concerned It is made clear that we express no opinion on the question whether the appellants lands had such abadi on the date of section notification which would attract the <ORG> policy of not acquiring such lands and whether such policy had continued thereafter at the stage of Section notification of th January and whether such policy is still current and operative at the time when the appellants representations come up for consideration of appropriate authorities of the state Government it will be for the Stat authorities to take their informed decision in this connection The <ORG> authorities will have to be satisfied on the following aspects in this connection i Whether there was any abadi on the acquired lands at the time of Section notification ii whether such abadi was a legally permissible abadi iii Whether such abadi has continued to exist till the date of representation iv Whether such abadi was covered by any Government policy in force at the time of issuance of Section notification and or section notification for not acquiring lands having such abadi whether such Government policy has continued to be in force till the date of representation We also make it clear that if the appellants file their written representation the aforesaid effect or before then the appropriate authorities of <ORG> shall consider their representations regarding the feasibility of releasing such lands from acquisition under Section of the Act on the ground that there were abadis on these lands at the relevant time and are governed by any existing state policy for releasing such lands from acquisition on that score as indicated hereinabove and for that purpose they may give hearing to the appellants either personally or through their counsel and permit them to lead whatever evidence they want to lead in this connection Subject to the aforesaid liberty given to the appellants these appeals will therefore stand dismissed We also make it clear that if the appellants do not file such representations on or before the State authorities will not be required to consider any such representation filed thereafter and the status quo order regarding possession as granted by us will stand recalled after qua the concerned appellants who do not file such representations within the time granted by us for the purpose Learned senior counsel stated that many serious objections are required to be considered against the acquisition of the eland of the intervener and it was his contention that lands were acquired for being allotted to persons closely related to the Chairman and other powers that be but as these contentions raise disputed question of fact and as Respondent No had not filed any writ petition in <ORG> he may be given liberty to file writ petition under Article of the Constitution of India before <ORG> In short we express no opinion on the merits of such writ petition that may be filed by the intervener Respondent No in <ORG>
