The Magistrate discharged the accused and his order was confirmed by the <ORG> on March on the ground that of the Act penalised only a contravention of an order made or deemed to have been made under the said Act but did not penalise the contravention of the conditions of licence issued under the Act or issued under a statutory order made under the Act The appellants filed an application under Art of the Constitution was maintainable because if on a true construction of the provisions of law under which the notice was issued the respondent had no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings in respect of the acts alleged to have been done by the appellants the respondent could be prohibited from proceeding with the same in the present case as the goods were imported tinder a valid licence they could not be considered as goods either prohibited or restricted within the meaning of of the Sea <ORG> Act and therefore the Collector of <ORG> had no jurisdiction to proceed with the enquiry tinder that section of the Constitution was not maintainable because the Collector had jurisdiction to decide what was a breach of an order and therefore whether the breach of a condition of a licence was breach of an order By another order made under of the Act and contained in Notification No ITC dated March it was provided that the licence to import electrical instruments might be issued subject to the condition that the goods would not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with without the written permission of the licensing authority On October a licence was granted to the appellant to import from the A a large quantity of electrical instruments namely fluorescent tubes and fluorescent fixtures One of them was a prosecution of various officers of the appellant company including the second appellant under read with of the Indian Penal Code on the allegation that the licence bid been obtained on false and fraudulent representations as there was no intention at any time to use the goods for any factory <NAME> who delivered the judgment of <ORG> said that it was difficult to hold that a condition of the licence amounted to an order under the Act and unless the penal section included the contravention of the condition as an offence it could not be held that such a contravention amounted to an offence under the section After the aforesaid proceedings had come to an end the Collector of <ORG> Calcutta on August served a notice on the appellant to show cause why the moneys lying with the Chief presidency Magistrate representing the imported goods should not be confiscated under of the Sea <ORG> Act read with of the Act of and why further penalty should not be imposed on them under these provisions Sub section of of the Act of provides that all goods to which any order under subsection applies shall be deemed to be goods of which the import or export has been prohibited or restricted under of the Sea <ORG> Act and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly The contention of learned counsel for the appellant is that under of the Sea <ORG> Act read with of that Act under which the Collector of <ORG> is proceeding he has jurisdiction only to decide whether goods have been imported contrary to the prohibition or restriction imposed by an order made under of the Act of but he has no jurisdiction under these sections to decide any question of confication of goods for breach of a condition of a licence issued under such an order It is said that it appeared from the notice served by the Collector that he was proceeding to decide whether the goods were liable to confiscation because they had been disposed of in breach of the condition of the licence under which they had been imported which he has no jurisdiction to do and hence the appellants were entitled to a writ of prohibition which they sought Even so it seems to me that there is no lack of jurisdiction in the Collector in the present case He has admittedly jurisdiction to decide whether there has been a breach of an order It follows that he has jurisdiction to decide what is a breach of an order and therefore whether the breach of a condition of a licence is breach of an order This is the view which all the learned Judges of <ORG> took and it seems to me to be the correct view Clearly the Collector has jurisdiction to decide the question raised by such an allegation Now the notice served by the Collector on the appellants contains a statement that an importation of goods would be illegal unless it was covered by a licence which has not been procured by fraudulent misrepresentation and that in the present case the licence had been obtained by fraudulent misrepresentation Even if it be assumed as the appellants contend that an importation under a licence fraudulently procured is not an importation without a licence that would only show that there has been no importation without a licence that is in breach of an order but it would not deprive the Collector of his jurisdiction to decide that question But it seems to me that the question does not arise for even if the decision of <ORG> was binding on the Collector that would not affect his jurisdiction Its only effect would be that the appellants would not have to establish independently as a proposition of law that a breach of a condition of a licence is not the breach of an order under which it had been issued but might for that purpose rely on the judgment of Sen <NAME> I think therefore that the Collector has jurisdiction in this case to decide whether the goods were liable to confiscation If he has this jurisdiction he has clearly also the jurisdiction to decide whether the appellants are liable to have a further pecuniary penalty imposed on them under of the Sea Customs Act Suppose as the appellants contend he had in this case no jurisdiction to decide whether the goods are liable to confiscation That would be because the breach of a condition of a licence is not a breach of an order under which it was issued and the Collector has no jurisdiction to decide whether it is so or not It has not been contended and indeed it cannot be that if the breach of a condition of a licence is the breach of an order under which it was issued the Collector would have jurisdiction to decide whether in the present case the goods are liable to confiscation That seems to me to be the clear intention of the legislature for otherwise the efficacy of the Act of would be largely destroyed Therefore the breach of a condition of a licence legitimately imposed in exercise of that power has to be read as a breach of the order by which the power was exercised and the condition imposed It follows that the Collector has jurisdiction to decide whether there has been a breach of a condition of a licence and whether therefore confiscation should be ordered under of the Sea Customs Act and further penalty imposed I observed that <NAME> <NAME> in dealing with the argument advanced on behalf of the customs authorities that a breach of a condition of a licence imposed under an order issued under the Act would be a breach of that order said that there might be some substance in it in the present case if notification No ITC which provided that electrical instrument could not be imported without a licence had itself provided that the licence might impose condition as to how the goods were to be dealt with after they had been brought into India but that that had not been done The latter provided that a licence to import might be issued subject to a condition like the one which we have in the present case That case received the full approval of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> where Viscount <NAME> said There is of course no doubt that when a statute like the Emergency Powers Defence Act enables an authority to make regu lations a regulation which is validly made under the Act i which is intra vires the regulation making authority should be regarded as though it were itself an enactment observed When a notification is issued by an executive authority in exercise of a power conferred by statue that notification is as much a part of the law as if it had been incorporated within the body of the statute at the time of its enactment It seems to me that this is taking too narrow a view of <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of a division Bench of <ORG> at Calcutta dated January confirming the order of a single Judge of that Court dismissing the petition filed by the appellants under Art <ORG> a company having its registered office in Calcutta and the Director of that Company In the application it was mentioned that the goods were required for the Company own use as industrial raw material or accessories but in the covering letter it was stated that the goods were required primarily for their mills at Ellore in the Madras Presidency where they where planning to arrange for an up to date lighting system On December the appellants filed an application before the Chief Presidency Magistrate Calcutta for the return of the seized goods whereupon the learned Magistrate called for a report from <ORG> New Delhi Two revisions were filed against that order in <ORG> one by the <ORG> and the other by the <ORG> Authorities On June the appellants filed an application before the Chief presidency Magistrate for the release of seized goods on the ground that they were deteriorating but that was dismissed He held that appellant No was neither guilty of the offence under of the Indian Penal Code as in his view there was no fraudulent or dishonest inducement at the time the appli cation for licence was made nor of any contravention of the provisions of the Act though the said appellant filed an application for payment of the same the learned Magistrate adjourned the said application till August But no revision was filed against the order of the Presidency Magistrate discharging appellant No of the offence under Indian Penal Code and the learned Judges by their judgment dated March dismissed the revision holding that there had been no contravention of the order made or deemed to be made under the Act The learned Judges construed a of the Act and held that the said section penalised only a contravention of an order made or deemed to have been made under the said Act but did not penalise the contravention of the conditions of licence issued under the Act or issued under a statutory order made under that Act and dismissed the revision On March the appellants filed an application before the Chief Presidency Magistrate for making over the sale proceeds to them and the said Magistrate issued a notice to the Assistant Collector of <ORG> and also to <ORG> to show cause on or before April On May the appellants filed a revision in <ORG> presumably against the order adjourning the application and the said revision was numbered as Revision Case No of and it was adjourned from time to time at the request of the respondent It was stated in the notice that the special licence was issued on the express condition that the goods covered by the said licence should be utilised for consumption as raw material or assessories in the factory of the licence holder and that no part thereof should be sold or permitted to be utilities by any other party that the appellants sold a portion of the goods imported under the said licence to others in Breach of the said condition and that as the appellants infringed the said condition the goods or the money substituted in its place were liable to be confiscated On June the appellant filed an application in <ORG> at Calcutta under Art The appellants preferred an appeal to a division Bench of of <ORG> consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> The learned Judges dismissed the appeal solely on the ground that it was within the jurisdiction of the Collector of <ORG> to ascertain whether there had been a contravention of the relevant provisions of the Act as would entail an order of confiscation and that therefore <NAME> was right in refusing to issue a writ but they made it clear that all the questions raised in the case were left open for decision by the Chief Controller of Imports that it penalizes only a contravention of an order made or deemed to have been made under the Act and not a contravention of a condition imposed by the licence issued under the Act or issued under a statutory order made under the Act and after that declaration which is binding on all the authorities and tribunals within the territorial juris diction of that court the respondent has no jurisdiction to ignore the said order and proceed with a fresh inquiry in direct contravention of the law so declared His argument may be summarized thus The Collector of <ORG> has jurisdiction to consider under if the Sea <ORG> Act whether the goods are imported contrary to the restrictions imposed under the Act and therefore <ORG> could not issue a writ of prohibition against the said authority from proceeding with the inquiry The <ORG> Authorities have a concurrent jurisdiction with the criminal Court to deal with matters entrusted to them under the Acts and therefore the findings of a criminal court or even of <ORG> on the same or similar matters could not bind them and they could come to a different conclusion of their own both on the question of law as well as on fact from those of criminal courts though the decision of <ORG> may have persuasive influence on them The condition imposed in a licence is under the relevant order issued by <ORG> in exercise of its power under of the Act and as the appellants infringed that condition the goods imported are liable to be confiscated under of the Sea <ORG> Act read with of the Act The <ORG> Collector has jurisdiction to confiscate goods after they have left the customs barrier and as the money in deposit in court is the proceeds of the sale directed to be held by <ORG> in the interest of both the parties it represents the said goods and in any view as the order of <ORG> is binding on both the parties it is not open to the appellants to plead that the goods are not represented by the said money The first question is whether the petition filed by the appellants under Art The argument of learned counsel for the appellants is that on the face of the notice dated May issued by the respondent the latter has no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings under a of the Sea <ORG> Act read with of the Act Learned counsel for the respondent argues that the said notice is not a statutory notice but only a memorandum informally sent to the appellants intimating them that proceedings have been started against them that the said notice is neither full nor exhaustive and that jurisdictional facts could be ascertained only by the <ORG> Collector in the course of the said proceedings on full inquiry We do not see any justification for this argument The respondent proposed to take action under of the Sea <ORG> Act read with of the Act In the present case in our view the respondent rightly issued such a notice wherein specific acts constituting contraventions of the provisions of the Acts for which action was to be initiated were clearly mentioned was contravened the respondent would have no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings pursuant to that notice To state it differently if on a true construction of the provisions of the said two sections the respondent has no jurisdiction to initiate proceedings or make an inquiry under the said sections in respect of certain acts alleged to have been done by the appellants the respondent can certainly be prohibited from proceeding with the same We therefore reject this preliminary contention All goods to which any order under sub section applies shall be deemed to be goods of which the import or export has been prohibited or restricted under section of the Sea Customs Act VIII of and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly except that section thereof shall have effect as if for the word shall therein the word may were substituted or abets a contravention of any order made or deemed to have been made under this Act he shall without prejudice to any confiscation or penalty to which he may be liable under the provisions of the Sea Customs Act VIII of as applied by sub section of section be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine or with both The offences mentioned in the first column of the following schedule shall be punishable to the extent mentioned in the third column of the same with reference to such offences respectively Section of this Offences Act to which Penalties offences has reference If any such goods shall goods the be liable to con importation fiscation and any or exporta person concerned tion of which in any such offen is for the and ce shall be liable time being to a penalty not prohibited or exceeding three restricted by times the value of or under the goods or not Chapter IV exceeding one of this Act thousand rupees The essence of the offence is a contravention of any order made or deemed to have been made under the Act All orders under this Act can only be made by <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred upon it by of the Act and all orders made under of the Defence of India Rules or that rule as continued in force by the Emergency Provisions Continuance Ordinance XX of and in force immediately before the commencement of this Act shall continue in force and be deemed to have been made under this Act We shall now proceed to deal with that question As we have already noticed in the earlier stage of the judgment the notice issued by the respondent charges the appellants thus One of the conditions of the special licence was that the goods would be utilized for consumption as raw material or accessories in the factory of the licence holder and no part thereof would be sold to other parties but in contravention of that condition the appellants sold a part of the goods imported to a third party and as the goods had been caused to be issued by fraudulent misrepresentation they were liable to be confiscated under of the Sea Customs Act This raises the question whether an administrative tribunal can ignore the law declared by the highest court in the State and initiate proceedings in direct violation of the law so declared <ORG> shall be a court of record and shall have all the powers of such a court including the power to punish for contempt of itself it has a plenary power to issue orders or writs for the en forcement of the fundamental rights and for any other purpose to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any <ORG> within its territorial jurisdiction it has jurisdiction over all courts and tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which it exercise jurisdiction It would be anomalous to suggest that a tribunal over which <ORG> has superint endence can ignore the law declared by that court and start proceedings in direct violation of it If a tribunal can do so all the sub ordinate courts can equally do so for there is no specific provision just like in the case of <ORG> making the law declared by <ORG> binding on subordinate courts We therefor hold that the law declared by the highest court in the State is binding on authorities or tribunals under its supreintendence and that they cannot ignore it either in initiating a proceeding or deciding on the rights involved in such a proceeding If that be so the notice issued by the authority signifying the launching of proceedings contrary to the law laid down by <ORG> would be in We shall now proceed to consider the merits Sub section of of the Act clearly lays down that all goods to which an order under sub thereof applies shall be deemed to be goods of which the export or import has been prohibited or restricted under of the Sea Customs Act Therefore a of the Sea Customs Act can be attracted only if there was a contravention of the order issued under of the Act xiii any goods of the descriptions spe cified in the schedule which are covered by a special licence issued by any officer specially authorised in this behalf by the Central Government It is not disputed that the goods imported in the present case were specified in the schedule The relevant part of it reads In exercise of the powers conferred by subsection and sub section of section of the Imports and Exports Control Act XVIII of <ORG> is pleased to make the following order namely a any officer issuing a licence under clauses viii to xiv of the Notification of the Government of India in the late Department of Commerce No ITC dated the st July may issue the same subject to one or more of the conditions stated below i that goods covered by the licence shall not be disposed of or otherwise dealt with without the written permission of the licen sing authority or any person duly authorised by it that such other conditions may be imposed which the licensing authority considers to be expedient from the administrative point of view and which are not inconsistent with th provisions of the said Act It will be seen from this order that it does not provide for a condition in the licence that subsequent to the import the goods should not be sold It cannot be suggested that the condition with which we are now concerned is a condition imposed from an administrative point of view but it is a condition which affects the rights of parties Learned counsel for the respondent argues that a public notice issued by the <ORG> on July is an order made in exercise of the power conferred on the Central <ORG> under a of the Act and that the order directs the imposition of a condition not to sell to a third party the goods permitted to be imported and that that condition was contravened Paragraph says that no time limit has been fixed for receiving applications from importers who are actual consumers of industrial raw material and accessories and who have imported the commodities concerned during any financial year between and inclusive and that it is hoped to deal with these applications chronologically as and when received A perusal of this notice shows that it is intended to give information to the public as regards the procedure to be followed in the matter of filing of applications by different categories of applicants Learned counsel for the respondent asserts that the said public notice is an order made in exercise of the power conferred on <ORG> under a of the Act On the other hand learned counsel for the appellants contends that public notices are not such orders but only information given to the public for their guidance Firstly the said notice does not purport to have been issued under of the Act whereas the orders referred to earlier that is notifications Nos ITC and ITC and similar others were issued by <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred on it by sub of of the Defence of India Rules or of the Act as the case may be Secondly while the notifications issued under of the Act are described as orders the notices are described as public notices while the notifications under of the Act regulate the rights of parties the public notices give information to the public regarding the principles governing the issue of import licences for specified periods It is also clear that the orders issued under of the Act having statutory force have to be repealed if the new order in any manner modifies or supersedes the provisions of an earlier order public notices are issued periodically without repealing or modifying the earlier notices or notifications For instance on December <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred by ss and A of the Act made an order and under el To put it differently orders made under a of the Act have statutory force whereas public notices are policy statements administratively made by the <ORG> for public information We have no hesitation in holding that public notices are not orders issued under of the Act On May <ORG> issued an order in exercise of the power conferred on it by of the Act to provide for licences obtained by misrepresentation among others and it reads The authorities mentioned in the Schedule hereto annexed may under one or other of the following circumstances cancel licences issue by any officer authorised to do so under clauses viii to xiv of the notification of <ORG> in the late <ORG> No ITC dated st July or take such action as is considered necessary to ensure that the same in made ineffective namely i when it is found subsequent to the issue of a licence that the same has been issued inadvertently irregularly or contrary to rules fraudulently or through misleading statement on the part of the importer con cerned or iii when it is found that the licensee has not complied with any one or more of the conditions subject to which the licence may have been issued We need not consider the question whether the Chief Controller of Imports or <ORG> as the case may be can cancel a licence after the term of the licence has expired for no such cancellation has been made in this case In the circumstances we must hold that when the goods were imported they were imported under a valid licence and therefore it is not possible to say that the goods imported were those prohibited or restricted by or under Ch IV of the Act within the meaning of cl of of the Sea Customs Act It follows that on the assumption that the allegations made in the notice are true the tribunal has no jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry under of the Sea Customs Act But we do not propose to express our opinion on this question as it does not arise in view of our findings on other questions raised in the case Before closing we may briefly notice one more contention raised by learned counsel for the appellants It is said that as the goods imported were converted into money the <ORG> Collector has no jurisdiction to confiscate the same and that he can at the best only trace the goods in whosesoever hands they may be In the result the order of <ORG> is set aside and the appeal is allowed with costs By COURT In view of the majority opinion of the <ORG> the appeal is allowed with costs
