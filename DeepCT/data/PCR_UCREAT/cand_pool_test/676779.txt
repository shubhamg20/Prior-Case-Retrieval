lakhs was lying blocked in the contract and the assessee overdraft with its bankers had reached the maximum limit and there was no alternative for the assessee but to obtain the said loan from the United Kingdom Being aggrieved the assessee preferred an appeal and contended before the <ORG> inter alia that the loan in question was not raised for acquiring any capital asset and the extra amount of Rs The assessee preferred further appeal to the <ORG> It was contended on behalf of the assessee in the appeal that the said amount should have been allowed as a deductible expenditure under Section of the I Act as a loss incidental to the business It was contended further that although the loan had not been repaid during the year in question as the assessee accounts were kept according to the mercantile system the liability having arisen in the year by reason of the devaluation it was in the nature of an expenditure incurred by the assessee and therefore allowable under Section The revenue on the other hand contended that the alleged expenditure and or loss was not allowable inasmuch as a no expenditure had been incurred even if such expenditure was incurred it had not been laid out or expended wholly or exclusively for the purpose of the assessee business and the expenditure and or loss was capital in nature inasmuch as it went to increase the amount of loan which the assessee was required to pay to its principal There was no change in the amount of loan and the provision for a higher amount for repaying the loan could not be called a revenue expenditure as it was related to capital and was connected with the return thereof The <ORG> held further that the liability to pay the extra amount if any was a contingent liability The Tribunal held that as no repayment was made to the principal company in the assessment year there was no question of claiming any loss in that year On the application of the assessee under Section of the I Act and also Section of the Companies Profits Surtax Act the <ORG> has drawn up a statement of case and has referred the following questions for the opinion of this court as questions of law arising from its order Under the Income tax Act It also appeared from the said letter that the subject of the loan was broached prior to the th June and prior to the taxation liability of Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the revenue contended on the other hand that the finding of the <ORG> that the major requirement of the assessee was to meet the taxation liabilities was a finding of fact which had not been challenged in these proceedings as perverse or based on no evidence The moment devaluation took place the liability for the extra amount was incurred by the assessee and had to be debited in the assessee profit and loss account in that year Mr <NAME> lastly submitted that even if it was admitted that the object of the assessee in obtaining the loan was to meet its income tax liabilities the extra expenditure incurred in connection with such loan would also come within the ambit of the expression purpose of the assessee business in Section of the Act In any event assuming that the assessee suffered a loss the same was a capital loss and not a revenue loss and the assessee was not entitled to any deduction thereof This decision of <ORG> was cited on behalf of the assessee for the following observations of Bhagwati at page on mercantile system of accounting The mercantile system of accounting or what is otherwise known as the double entry system brings into credit what is due immediately it becomes legally due and before it is actually received and it brings into debit expenditure the amount for which a legal liability has been incurred before it is actually disbursed This decision of <ORG> was also cited on behalf of the assessee for the following observations at page Thus in finding out what profits there be the normal accountancy practice may be to allow as expense any sum in respect of liabilities which have accrued over the accounting period and to deduct such sums from profits It was held in this case that an estimated liability amounting to a contingent liability and not a debt under the Act if it could be properly ascertainable and its present value could be fairly discounted would be deductible from the gross receipts while preparing the profit and loss account This English decision was cited on behalf of the revenue On these facts it was held on a reference that loss plaimed was only an apprehended future loss and not one suffered during the accounting period and therefore the deduction claimed was inadmissible This decision was also cited on behalf of the revenue It is conceivable such things sometimes happen that there may be cases in which a thing might fall alternately But none the less I do think that there is a distinction to be drawn between the two This decision was cited on behalf of the revenue This decision was cited on behalf of the assessee The relevant observations in the judgment of <ORG> at pages and are set out as follows The sum paid is a deposit It is not however a payment in advance It has the character of a loan in that it is repayable at the determination of the agency by the company and also in that it has to carry interest at a fixed rate per cent It is to be available during the period of the agency for making good the agent defaults in the event of any default by him but otherwise it remains as I see it simply as a loan owing by the company to the agent and repayable on the termination of the agency and I do not see how the fact that the purpose for which it is given is to provide a security against any possible default by the agent can invest it with the character of a trading receipt The facts in this case cited by the revenue were that the assessee who carried on business in yarns received from its customers sums which they claimed to be borrowed money within the meaning of the Excess Profits Tax Act and as such not chargeable to excess profits tax Ultimately unless there was adjustment against liability the amount had to be returned The assessee admittedly maintained its accounts on mercantile basis On such facts the instant case is clearly distinguishable from the decisions cited by the revenue i <ORG> TC and <ORG> TC and the principles laid down in the said decisions have no application in the instant case The enquiry as to whether by reason of the devaluation the assessee has incurred an expenditure or has suffered a business loss is in our view of little relevance Mr <NAME> for the assessee has contended in the course of his submissions that a loss has to be considered in a different way from a gain in computing business profits There may be cases where a loss de hors the business is allowed as a business loss whereas a gain arising in similar circumstances will never be a business gain In our view this distinction again is of little significance as the gain or the loss as the case may be has to be connected with the business before the same can enter into the computation of profits On a scrutiny of the facts of the instant case it appears to us that as a result of the devaluation which befell the assessee it became immediately liable to an extra liability in terms of its rupee assets for repayment of its debts This extra expenditure deemed or otherwise or this loss is inextricably connected with the assessee indebtedness and did not arise de hors the indebtedness nor was it incurred for the purposes of the loan and it was as if from the date of the devaluation the dues from the assessee to its creditors in rupees were increased We are unable to accept the contentions of Mr <NAME> that the extra amount which the assessee had to provide for as a result of the devaluation is to be considered as extra expenditure to be incurred for meeting the debt just as postal expenses or bank charges or this extra expenditure which would result in a business loss of a revenue nature In our view the propositions laid down in the case of <ORG> ITR Supp TC CA apply on all fours to the instant case If there would have been a devaluation in favour of the rupee as a result of which the assessee had to pay less to its creditors the surplus arising would have been of capital nature and could not have been assessed in the hands of the assessee as a business profit It was decided in that case that any expenditure incurred for securing the use of money for a certain period i for the purpose of obtaining a loan which was not an asset or advantage of an enduring nature was a revenue expenditure and that the purpose for which the loan was obtained was irrelevant in deciding whether such expenditure would be a capital expenditure or a revenue expenditure In the instant case it is not contended by the assessee that it had incurred the extra expenditure in order to secure the loan It is at the point of repayment that the assessee has to provide an extra amount in rupees by reason of the devaluation For the reasons given above We answer question No in the affirmative and in favour of the revenue A large number of decisions were cited and extensive submissions were made on the aspect whether an expenditure incurred or a loss suffered in respect of money borrowed for the purpose of payment of income tax would be deductible as a business expenditure or a business loss By reason of the answer given to question No we answer this question also in the affirmative and in favour of the revenue
