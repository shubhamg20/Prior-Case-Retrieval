Several applications for the grant of fresh leases as well as for the renewal of leases for quarrying black granite belonging to <ORG> were submitted to <ORG> some prior to the introduction of rule and some after the rule came into force The respondents filed writ petition questioning the vires of Rule on various grounds <ORG> struck down Rule on the ground that it exceeded the rule making power given to <ORG> and held that it was not open to the appellant <ORG> to keep the applications pending for a long time and then to dispose them of on the basis of a rule which had come into force later The appellant contended that I The approach of <ORG> was vitiated by its failure to notice the crucial circumstance that the minerals belonged to the <ORG> II The respondents had no vested or indefeasible right to obtain a lease or a renewal to quarry the minerals III There were good reasons for banning the grant of lease to quarry black granite to private parties and IV The <ORG> could not be compelled to grant leases which would result in the destruction of the mineral resources of the country On behalf of the respondent it was submitted that I the question of ownership of the minerals was irrelevant II It was not open to the appellant to exercise its subordinate legislative function in a manner to benefit itself as owner of the minerals nor was it open to the appellant to create monopoly by such means III There was violation of articles and of the Constitution IV Rule had no application to renewals and That in any event it would not have the effect of affecting applications made more than days before it came into force <ORG> has declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals But if a decision is taken to ban private mining of a single minor mineral for the purpose of conserving it such a ban if it is otherwise within the bounds of the authority given to the <ORG> by the Statute cannot be said to involve any change of policy If in the pursuit of the avowed policy of the Act it is thought exploitation by the public sector is best and wisest in the case of a particular mineral and in consequence the authority competent to make the subordinate legislation makes a rule banning private exploitation of such mineral which was hitherto permitted There is no change of policy merely because that was previously permitted is no longer permitted The restrictions freedom from which is guaranteed by Art would be such restrictions as directly and immediately restrict or impede the free flow or movement of trade which enables <ORG> by law to impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one <ORG> and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest also furnishes an answer to the claim based on the alleged contravention of Art Rules made under the Statute must be treated for all purposes of construction or obligation exactly as if they were in the Act and are to be of the same effect as if contained in the act and are to be judicially noticed for all purposes of construction or obligation No one has a vested right to the grant or renewal of a lease and none can claim a vested right to have an application for the grant or renewal of a lease dealt with in a particular way by applying particular provisions In the absence of any vested rights in any one an application for a lease has necessarily to be dealt with according to the rules in force on the date of the disposal of the application despite the fact that there is a long delay since the making of the application Entry of List of the Seventh Schedule is Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest By of the Act it is declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent thereafter provided These provisions as well as Sections to are made inapplicable to minor minerals by prohibits all prospecting or mining operations except under a licence or a lease granted under the Act and the rules made thereunder prescribes the period for which prospecting licences may be granted or renewed prescribes the period for which mining leases may be granted or renewed empowers <ORG> to make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases In particular we may mention that a empowers <ORG> to make rules providing for the persons by whom and the manner in which applications for prospecting licences or mining leases in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the <ORG> may be made and the fees to be paid therefor we may add empowers <ORG> to make rules providing for the procedure for obtaining a prospecting licence or a mining lease in respect of any land in which the minerals vest in a person other than the <ORG> and the terms on which and the conditions subject to which such a licence or lease may be granted or renewed empowers the <ORG> <ORG> to make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases and other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and purposes connected therewith The Central <ORG> may also declare that no prospecting licence or mining lease shall be granted in respect of any land specified in the notification Rule prescribes the procedure for the lease of quarries to private persons Rule A which was introduced by way of an amendment in provides for a special procedure for the sanctioning of leases in favour of applicants who require the minerals for their existing industries or who have an industrial programme for the utilisation of the mineral in their own industry Lease of quarries in respect of black granite to private persons Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in rules and A the authority competent to grant leases in respect of quarrying black granite shall be <ORG> Leases can only be granted in favour of a <ORG> wholly owned by the State Government Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in these rules on and from th December no lease for quarrying black granite shall be granted to private persons Provided that in respect of any land belonging to any private person the consent of such person shall be obtained for such quarrying or lease Every application for renewal shall be made to Collector sixty days prior to the date of expiry of the lease Provided that a lease the period of which exceeds ten years shall not be renewed except with the sanction of the Director of Industries and Commerce There were also some applications for the grant of fresh leases for quarrying black granite It was also argued that in any event in those cases in which the applications for renewal had been made prior to the coming into force of Rule their applications should have been dealt with without reference to Rule <ORG> while not accepting some of the contentions raised on behalf of the applicants struck down Rule on the ground that it exceeded the rule making power given to <ORG> under which it was said was only to regulate and not to prohibit the grant of mining leases It was also held that it was not open to the Government to keep the applications pending for a long time and then to dispose them of on the basis of a rule which had come into force later The learned Attorney General who appeared for <ORG> submitted that the approach of <ORG> was vitiated by its failure to notice the crucial circumstance that the minerals belonged to the <ORG> and the applicants had no vested or indefeasible right to obtain a lease or a renewal to quarry the minerals There were good reasons for banning the grant of leases to quarry black granite to private parties and in the light of those reasons the <ORG> could not be compelled to grant leases which would result in the destruction of the mineral resources of the country It was claimed that there was violation of Articles and of the Constitution It was further claimed that of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act enabled the <ORG> <ORG> to make rules to regulate the grant of leases and not to prohibit them In any case it was said that Rule had no application to renewals and that in any event it would not have the effect of affecting applications made more than days before it came into force <ORG> has declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals We have already referred to its salient provisions The reasons that prompted <ORG> to make Rule were explained at great length in the common counter affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> before <ORG> We find no good reason for not accepting the statements made in the counter affidavit It was said there I submit that the leases for black granite are governed by the Tamil Nadu Minor Mineral Concession Rules under which originally there was scope for auctioning of quarries of minor minerals However it was found that there were several cases where lessees who obtained the black granite areas on lease by auction were not quarrying in a systematic and planned manner taking into consideration the welfare and safety measures of the workers as well as the conservation of minerals Therefore <ORG> issued a further amendment as Rule wherein the competent authority to grant leases in respect of the quarrying black granite was transferred from the Collector to the <ORG> level At the same time in the issued along with amendment it was stated that if any of the <ORG> Organisations like <ORG> Tamil Nadu small Industries Development Corporation Limited <ORG> is interested to obtain a lease for black granite in a particular area preference will be given to <ORG> undertaking over other private entrepreneurs for granting the leases applied for by them However in spite of these amendments to regulate the grant of mining lease there were a large number of lessees exceeding who were engaged in mining without proper technical guidance or safety measures etc We are satisfied that Rule was made in bonafide exercise of the rule making power of <ORG> and not in its misuse to advance its own self interest The argument was that the <ORG> or a <ORG> owned or controlled by the <ORG> could carry on a trade business industry or service to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens only if the <ORG> made a law relating to it The argument was repelled by the <ORG> in these words The plea sought to be founded on the phraseology used in Art Under entry No of the Concurrent List the <ORG> being competent to legislate for creating commercial or trading monopolies there is nothing in the Constitution which deprives it of the power to create a commercial or trading monopoly in the constituent <ORG>s The right of the <ORG> to carry on trade or business to the exclusion of others does not arise by virtue of Art The right of the <ORG> to carry on trade or business is recognised by Art authority to exclude competitors in the field of such trade or business is conferred on the <ORG> by entrusting power to enact laws under entry of List III of the Seventh Schedule and the exercise of that power in the context of fundamental rights is secured from attack by Art The argument that legislative sanction was necessary to enable <ORG> to carry on the business of printing and publishing text books was repelled and it was held that no fundamental right of the petitioners who had invoked the jurisdiction of the <ORG> had been infringed We do not agree with the submission But if a decision is taken to ban private mining of a single minor mineral for the purpose of conserving it such a ban if it is otherwise within the bounds of the authority given to the Government by the Statute cannot be said to involve any change of policy If in the pursuit of the avowed policy of the Act it is thought exploitation by the public sector is best and wisest in the case of a particular mineral and in consequence the authority competent to make the subordinate legislation makes a rule banning private exploitation of such mineral which was hitherto permitted we are unable to see any change of policy merely because what was previously permitted is no longer permitted of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act authorised the making of rules for regulating the grant of mining leases and not for prohibiting them as Rule sought to do and therefore Rule was ultra vires Act We have no doubt that the prohibiting of leases in certain cases is part of the regulation contemplated by Sec Now the restrictions freedom from which is guaranteed by Art And regulatory measures or measures imposing compensatory taxes for the use of trading facilities do not come within the purview of restrictions contemplated by Art which enables <ORG> by law to impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest also furnishes an answer to the claim based on the alleged contravention of Art Rules made under the Statute must be treated for all purposes of construction or obligation exactly as if they were in the Act and are to be of the same effect as if contained in the Act and are to be judicially noticed for all purposes of construction or obligation which while declaring that the rules would have the force of law stopped short of declaring that they would become part of the Act Another submission of the learned counsel in connection with the consideration of applications for renewal was that applications made sixty days or more before the date of Ms No should be dealt with as if Rule had not come into force It was also contended that even applications for grant of leases made long before the date of Ms No should be dealt with as if Rule had not come into force The submission was that it was not open to the <ORG> to keep applications for the grant of leases and applications for renewal pending for a long time and then to reject them on the basis of Rule notwithstanding the fact that the applications had been made long prior to the date on which Rule came into force In the absence of any vested rights in anyone an application for a lease has necessarily to be dealt with according to the rules in force on the date of the disposal of the application despite the fact that there is a long delay since the making of the application In the view that we have taken on the several questions argued before us all the appeals arising out of applications for the grant or renewal of leases for quarrying black granite in <ORG> lands are allowed and the Writ Petitions filed in <ORG> are dismissed There are however a few appeals in which the applications were not for the grant or renewal of leases to quarry black granite in <ORG> lands but were for permission to quarry black granite in Patta lands in which the right to minerals belonged to the applicants private owners themselves
