In the wake of the judgment in <NAME> case supra the <ORG> of Bihar first issued directions to stay further appointments from the panels prepared on district wise basis on and subsequently vide <ORG> circular letter dated issued further instructions regarding the appointment of primary teachers The aggrieved parties namely those who were not appointed in spite of being on the panel and some others filed various writ petitions in <ORG> which came to be disposed of by different judgments against which civil appeals have have been filed by special leave in this court Taking note of the aforesaid background we shall now consider the individual cases The appellants who were persons before <ORG> had apparently pleaded before <ORG> for the quashing of the entire panel on the ground that it was unconstitutional and in the alternative to be treated at par with the appointed teachers In substance the submission of Mr <NAME> is that all the persons whose names had figured in the panels had acquired a vested right to be appointed as and when the vacancies arose and the cancellation of the panel took away the accrued rights of the panelists which is not permitted He submitted that the panel prepared was no more than arrangement of the particulars of the candidates who had received training and such a list could not be equated with even a fixed term panel which under certain conditions may create some right in those empanelled to seek appointments during the life of the panel Mr <NAME> fairly conceded that the appointments made after the judgment in <NAME> case and till Government Order dated was issued were against the law as laid down in <NAME> case but went on to say that those appointments were not to be disturbed because some equities had come in favour of those wrongly appointed candidates and asserted that non interference with their appointments cannot form the basis of an argument based on Article as the appointed and non appointed candidates formed two distinct classes In <NAME> case supra where the validity of the advertisement dated issued by the District Superintendent of Education Hazaribagh inviting applications for preparation of a panel of candidates for appointment to the posts of Assistant teachers in the primary schools of the districts and order dated issued by the Special Secretary <ORG> Government of Bihar laying down the requisite qualifications and conditions for being considered for appointment to the aforesaid posts was put in issue <ORG> frowned upon district wise selection and held that reservations made on the basis of residence in a district were unconstitutional and consequently the advertisement dated and order dated as also the panel prepared on district wise basis were quashed It acquired finality The question however which immediately comes up for our consideration is whether the persons who had been brought on the panel had acquired any indefeasible right of appointment on that account and incidentally the other question would be whether the Government Order dated and the concession made by Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the State of Bihar discriminates between the persons appointed and not appointed out of the panel declared to be unconstitutional in <NAME> case thereby violating Article of the Constitution of India Let us first consider the nature of the panel and the rights if any which could flow from it The Government of Bihar issued directions based on a policy statement that in the primary schools of any district in Bihar the residents of that district alone shall be entitled eligible for appointment as a teacher Did the persons on such a panel acquire any indefeasible right to appointment Out of the selection list only who had secured more than marks were appointed in the serial order of the list according to merit Candidates who ranked at and respectively in the list but had not been appointed filed a writ petition under Article for Mandamus claiming that since there were vacancies and they had the necessary qualifications for appointment and had been brought on the select list the State Government was not entitled to pick out only out of them for appointment The advertisement that there are vacancies to be filled does not also give him a right to be appointed The position in that case was that the matter of selection had been referred to <ORG> which recommended to the <ORG> names of candidates belonging to the general category for appointment on the assumption that only posts were to be filled up and accordingly appointments were made It was held by this Court that it was not for <ORG> to take a decision of recommending only names and that <ORG> was obliged to prepare a complete list of all successful candidates and communicate the same to the <ORG> the appointing authority It was in this background that the Court directed the <ORG> of Haryana to include the name of the petitioner in the list of candidates selected for appointment of Subordinate Judges and grant her due place in the seniority list of that batch It would thus be seen that it was in the peculiar facts and circumstances of that case that relief was granted to the petitioner therein and it was not laid down in that judgment that a candidate acquires any indefeasible right by merely being brought on to the select list even where a vacancy exists He then approached this Court by special leave to appeal against the judgment of <ORG> and for a direction to be appointed to the <ORG> being on the top of the merit list as a vacancy did exist On behalf of the appellant it was asserted before <ORG> that since several vacancies in the general category of the <ORG> had remained unfilled he was entitled to be appointed against one of those vacancies as his name figured in the list and was now at its top and the authorities were not justified in rejecting his representation Unless the relevant recruitment rules so indicate the State is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies The panel prepared therefore was not even the product of any selection process unlike in <NAME> case supra where a process of selection had been undergone as is apparent from the following observation of the <ORG> It is no doubt true that the Act was amended by Act of which came into force on August taking away the power of the Director to make an appointment under Section of the Act in the case of minority institutions Nor do we find any words in it which by necessary intendment would affect such pending proceedings At every stage in that process certain rights are created in favour of one or the other of the candidates But it is equally well settled that no retrospective effect should be given to any statutory provision so as to impair or take away an existing right unless the statute either expressly or by necessary implication directs that it should have such retrospective effect Although the Director in the present case exercised that power subsequent to August on which date the amendment came into force it cannot be said that the selection made by him was illegal since the amending law had no retrospective effect It did not have any effect on the proceedings which had commenced prior to August We do not therefore find any substance in the contention of the learned Counsel for the appellant that the law as amended by the Act of should have been followed in the present case It was therefore in the context of the peculiar facts of that case that this court declined to interfere with the judgment of <ORG> and it has no application to the situation existing in the present case Mr <NAME> then placed strong reliance on <NAME> <ORG> and Ors We find force in the submission of Mr <NAME> that the purpose of the panel prepared in the instant case was only to finalise a list of eligible candidates for appointment The mere fact that the candidates who had been brought on the panel had been sent for training at the Government expense would also not imply that any indefeasible right had been created in their favour for appointment after they had completed their training and their names were entered in the panel because the training was merely intended to confer eligibility on the candidates for being brought on the list Mr <NAME> learned senior advocate appearing for the <ORG> of Bihar did not dispute that as a result of the judgment in <NAME> case the entire panel had been rendered unconstitutional but submitted that there is a clear distinction between those who out of the panel had been appointed and those who had not been appointed It was urged that while those who had been appointed could be said to have acquired some vested right to continue in service no right whatsoever was created in the non appointees by merely being brought on the list He submitted that though the appointments made between were against the law as laid down in <NAME> case yet some equities had developed in favour of the appointees by their continuing in service and it was but fair not to interfere with their appointments particularly when they were not even parties before <ORG> In our opinion there is force in the submission of Mr <NAME> that some equities had come into existence in favour of the appointees and since the judgment in <NAME> case itself had protected the appointment of those teachers out of the panel who had been appointed but were not before the court it was a fair exercise of discretion on the part of the <ORG> not to oust those who had been appointed and were serving Those who had been appointed out of the panel as and when the vacancies arose and had continued in service did acquire some right to so continue and the action of the <ORG> Government in protecting their services cannot be said to infringe Article which even though all pervasive has to be considered in the facts and circumstances of each case In saving the appointments of those who stood already appointed and were serving there was no arbitrariness whatsoever on the part of the respondents We must therefore reject the charge of arbitrariness in view of the peculiar facts of this case more particularly since we have already found that the persons on the panel had not acquired any indefeasible right to appointment merely by being placed on the panel This view also accords with the judgment in <NAME> case supra and the law laid down by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra We must therefore reject the argument of discrimination between the two classes of teachers namely those who stood appointed and the others who were waiting be appointed and in whose favour no indefeasible right accrued only by being brought on the panel to be appointed This appeal by special leave has been filed by the appellants who had been appointed out of the panel in various schools in District Gopalganj but have been ousted as a result of the judgment of <ORG> in CWJC No decided on even though they were not parties before <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants while questioning that part of the judgment raised various pleas based both on law and in equity and pointed out what he considered to be the merits of District wise selection of teachers for primary schools Pursuant to an advertisement issued in October by the District Superintendent of Education Nalanda inviting applications in the prescribed form from eligible candidates of the District the appellants herein who posses the requisite qualifications made applications through <ORG> Mr <NAME> with utmost fairness submitted that some hardship had been caused to the appellants by the action of the <ORG> and conceded that the <ORG> would consider the cases of all such candidates whose juniors had been appointed by leaving them out and if found eligible would be prepared to relax the age bar in their favour and appoint them against the existing vacancies Recording the submission of Mr <NAME> we make an order accordingly and allow CA No and direct the consideration of the cases of the appellants for appointment as primary school teachers wherever persons figuring below them in the panel have have appointed and if necessary in Civil Appeal No This civil appeal is directed against the judgment of <ORG> in CWJC No decided on It has been filed by some of the teachers belonging to District Siwan whose names had been included in the pane but who had not been appointed Prior to also there was no departmental provision to make separate waiting lists of the applicants of the matric arts and science and one combined waiting list was prepared Having prepared the waiting list on the basis of marks obtained there was no provision for making appointment on the basis of seniority A combined panel of all the candidates of matric Art and science has to be prepared on the basis of the sessions and marks obtained and there is departmental rule for making appointment on seniority wise It has been found during the enquiry that there are such candidates in approved waiting list who are seniors to the teachers who have been recently appointed in the light of the departmental rules Therefore it is directed in the light of the order of the Government that the appointments of all such senior candidates should necessarily be made within a month and compliance report may be sent Mr <NAME> appearing for the State of Bihar submitted that there is no material on the record to establish conclusively that the appellants were senior to those appointed teachers or placed above them in the panels or were even otherwise fully qualified to be appointed as teachers Should <ORG> find after hearing both sides that any or all of the appellants in this case are senior to the ones who had been appointed and are continuing in service as a result of the orders made in the aforesaid appeals and are otherwise qualified in all respects according to the scheme existing prior to Rules it shall direct the <ORG> Government to appoint such teachers in relaxation of the age bar wherever applicable
