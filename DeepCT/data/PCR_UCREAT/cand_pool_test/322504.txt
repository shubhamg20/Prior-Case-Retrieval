amendments to the Constitution made on or after th April by which the Ninth Schedule was amended from time to time by inclusion of various Acts regulations therein were open to challenge on the ground that they or any one or more of them are beyond the constituent power of <ORG> since they damage the basic or essential features of the Constitution or its basic structure were also noted and it was observed that the judgment in Waman Rao needs to be reconsidered by a larger Bench so that the apparent inconsistencies therein are reconciled and it is made clear whether an Act or regulation which or a part of which is or has been found by this Court to be violative of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred by Articles and can be included in the Ninth Schedule or whether it is only a constitutional amendment amending the Ninth Schedule which damages or destroys the basic structure of the Constitution that can be struck down Development of the Law First we may consider in brief the factual background of framing of the Constitution and notice the developments that have taken place almost since inception in regard to interpretation of some of Articles of the Constitution The independence struggle and intellectual debates in <ORG> show the value and importance of freedoms and rights guaranteed by Part III and <ORG> welfare obligations in Part IV For enforcement of these rights unlike Constitutions of most of the other countries the Supreme <ORG> was vested with original jurisdiction as contained in Article The parties aggrieved had filed appeals before the Supreme <ORG> It was at this stage that <ORG> amended the Constitution by adding Articles A and to assist the process of legislation to bring about agrarian reforms and confer on such legislative measures immunity from possible attack on the ground that they contravene the fundamental rights of the citizen Article inter alia provides that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III and any law made in contravention thereof shall to the extent of the contravention be void Saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates etc Notwithstanding anything contained in article no law providing for a the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights or the taking over of the management of any property by the <ORG> for a limited period either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of the property or the amalgamation of two or more corporations either in the public interest or in order to secure the proper management of any of the corporations or the extinguishment or modification of any rights of managing agents secretaries and treasurers managing directors directors or managers of corporations or of any voting rights of shareholders thereof or the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease or licence for the purpose of searching for or winning any mineral or mineral oil or the premature termination or cancellation of any such agreement lease or licence shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article or article Provided that where such law is a law made by <ORG> the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent Provided further that where any law makes any provision for the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation it shall not be lawful for the <ORG> to acquire any portion of such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land building or structure provides for payment of compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in article A none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this Part and notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent <ORG> to repeal or amend it continue in force The Constitution Bench held that to make a law which contravenes the Constitution constitutionally valid is a matter of constitutional amendment and as such it falls within the exclusive power of <ORG> The Constitutional validity of the Acts added to the Ninth Schedule by the Constitution Seventeenth Amendment Act was challenged in petitions filed under Article of the Constitution It was noted that Articles A and were added to the Constitution realizing that State legislative measures adopted by certain States for giving effect to the policy of agrarian reforms have to face serious challenge in the courts of law on the ground that they contravene the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizen by Part III The <ORG> observed that the genesis of the amendment made by adding Articles A and is to assist the State Legislatures to give effect to the economic policy to bring about much needed agrarian reforms The <ORG> further noted that the impugned act does not purport to change the provisions of Article and it cannot be said even to have that effect directly or in any appreciable measure It was held that the constitutional amendment is law within the meaning of Article of the Constitution and therefore if it takes away or abridges the rights conferred by Part III thereof it is void It was declared that the <ORG> will have no power from the date of the decision th February to amend any of the provisions of Part III of the Constitution so as to take away or abridge the fundamental rights enshrined therein By Constitution th Amendment Act Article was amended and after clause the following clause was inserted as Article Nothing in this article shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution made under article Saving of laws giving effect to certain directive principles Notwithstanding anything contained in article no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article or article and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy Provided that where such law is made by <ORG> the provisions of this article shall not apply thereto unless such law having been reserved for the consideration of the President has received his assent The decision in <NAME> case was rendered on th April by a Judges Bench and by majority of seven to six <NAME> case was overruled However the second part of Article that no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy was declared unconstitutional Another important development took place in June when <ORG> set aside the election of the then Prime Minister Mrs <NAME> to the fifth <ORG> on the ground of alleged corrupt practices Sub clauses and of Article A read as under No law made by <ORG> before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act in so far as it relates to election petitions and matters connected therewith shall apply or shall be deemed ever to have applied to or in relation to the election of any such person as is referred to in Clause to either House of <ORG> and such election shall not be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on any ground on which such election could be declared to be void or has before such commencement been declared to be void under any such law and notwithstanding any order made by any court before such commencement declaring such election to be void such election shall continue to be valid in all respects and any such order and any finding on which such order is based shall be and shall be deemed always to have been void and of no effect Any appeal or cross appeal against any such order of any court as is referred to in Clause pending immediately before the commencement of the Constitution Thirty ninth Amendment Act before <ORG> shall be disposed of in conformity with the provisions of Clause It inter alia inserted by Section of the Amendment Act in Article after clause the following clauses and No amendment of this Constitution including the provisions of Part III made or purporting to have been made under this article whether before or after the commencement of section of the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act shall be called in question in any court on any ground Section inter alia omitted sub clauses of Article with the result the right to property ceased to be a fundamental right and it became only legal right by insertion of Article A in the Constitution The fundamental rights received enlarged judicial interpretation in the post emergency period In <NAME> a Bench of Seven Judges held that the procedure established by law in Article had to be reasonable and not violative of Article and also that fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III were distinct and mutually exclusive rights The developments that had taken place post Kesavananda Bharati case have been noticed in this decision The principle of constitutionalism underpins the principle of legality which requires the <ORG> to interpret legislation on the assumption that <ORG> would not wish to legislate contrary to fundamental rights Principles of Constitutionality There is a difference between <ORG>ary and constitutional sovereignty Articles represent the foundational values which form the basis of the rule of law These are the principles of constitutionality which form the basis of judicial review apart from the rule of law and separation of powers Chief Justice <NAME> observed that to destroy the guarantees given by Part III in order to purportedly achieve the goals of Part IV is plainly to subvert the Constitution by destroying its basic structure Fundamental rights occupy a unique place in the lives of civilized societies and have been described in judgments as transcendental inalienable and primordial The observations made in the context of Article have equal and full force for deciding the questions in these matters The developments made in the field of interpretation and expansion of judicial review shall have to be kept in view while deciding the applicability of the basic structure doctrine to find out whether there has been violation of any fundamental right the extent of violation does it destroy the balance or it maintains the reasonable balance This would undoubtedly damage the basic structure of the Constitution because there are two essential features of the basic structure which would be violated namely the limited amending power of <ORG> and the power of judicial review with a view to examining whether any authority under the Constitution has exceeded the limits of its powers In Minerva Mills while striking down the enlargement of Article through nd Amendemnt which had replaced the words of or any of the principles laid down in Part IV with the principles specified in clause or clause and Article Justice <NAME> said Section of the Constitution nd Amendment Act is beyond the amending power of the <ORG> and is void since it damages the basic or essential features of the Constitution and destroys its basic structure by a total exclusion of challenge to any law on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Article or Article of the Constitution if the law is for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV of the Constitution Analysing this decision <NAME> in Constitutional Law of India Fourth Edition says that the judgment in the election case break new ground which has important effects on <NAME> case itself <NAME> For determining whether a particular feature of the Constitution is part of its basic structure one has per force to examine in each individual case the place of the particular feature in the scheme of our Constitution its object and purpose and the consequences of its denial on the integrity of the Constitution as a fundamental instrument of the country governance Chief Justice <NAME> in <NAME> case This ratio was applied in <ORG> case The Court observed in <NAME> case The law must therefore now be taken to be well settled that Article does not exclude Article and that even if there is a law prescribing a procedure for depriving a person of personal liberty and there is consequently no infringement of the fundamental right conferred by Article such law in so far as it abridges or takes away any fundamental right under Article would have to meet the challenge of that article Now if a law depriving a person of personal liberty and prescribing a procedure for that purpose within the meaning of Article has to stand the test of one or more of the fundamental rights conferred under Article which may be applicable in a given situation ex hypothesi it must also be liable to be tested with reference to Article It was held In fact equality and arbitrariness are sworn enemies one belongs to the rule of law in a republic while the other to the whim and caprice of an absolute monarch Article strikes at arbitrariness in State action and ensures fairness and equality of treatment The principle of reasonableness which legally as well as philosophically is an essential element of equality or non arbitrariness pervades Article like a brooding omnipresence and the procedure contemplated by Article must answer the best of reasonableness in order to be in conformity with Article Any procedure which permits impairment of the constitutional right to go abroad without giving reasonable opportunity to show cause cannot but be condemned as unfair and unjust and hence there is in the present case clear infringement of the requirement of Article Be that as it may the law is now settled as I apprehend it that no article in Part III is an island but part of a continent and the conspectus of the whole part gives the directions and correction needed for interpretation of these basic provisions Individuals possess basic human rights independently of any constitution by reason of the basic fact that they are members of the human race These fundamental rights are important as they possess intrinsic value Part III of the Constitution does not confer fundamental rights It confirms their existence and gives them protection Its purpose is to withdraw certain subjects from the area of political controversy to place them beyond the reach of majorities and officials and to establish them as legal principles to be applied by the courts Every right has a content Every foundational value is put in Part III as fundamental right as it has intrinsic value A right becomes a fundamental right because it has foundational value Apart from the principles one has also to see the structure of the Article in which the fundamental value is incorporated A Constitution and in particular that of it which protects and which entrenches fundamental rights and freedoms to which all persons in the <ORG> are to be entitled is to be given a generous and purposive construction The <ORG> must interpret the Constitution in a manner which would enable the citizens to enjoy the rights guaranteed by it in the fullest measure Article of the Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The Supreme <ORG> by a majority held that procedure established by law means any procedure established by law made by the <ORG> or the legislatures of the <ORG> The Supreme <ORG> refused to infuse the procedure with principles of natural justice The expression life in Article does not connote merely physical or animal existence The right to life includes right to live with human dignity This <ORG> has in numerous cases deduced fundamental features which are not specifically mentioned in Part III on the principle that certain unarticulated rights are implicit in the enumerated guarantees Interpretation of the Constitution has to be such as to enable the citizens to enjoy the rights guaranteed by Part III in the fullest measure Again there is no liberty if the judicial power be not separated from the legislative and executive By a limited Constitution I understand one which contains certain specified exceptions to the legislative authority such for instance that it shall pass no bills of attainder no ex post facto laws and the like <NAME> finds tyranny pervades when there is no separation of powers There would be an end of everything were the same man or same body whether of the nobles or of the people to exercise those three powers that of enacting laws that of executing the public resolutions and of trying the causes of individuals The power to make any law at will that transgresses Part III in its entirety would be incompatible with the basic structure of the Constitution It is also submitted that the constituent power under Article does not include judicial power and that the power to establish judicial remedies which is compatible with the basic structure is qualitatively different from the power to exercise judicial power The impact is that on the one hand the power under Article is removed and on the other hand the said power is exercised by the legislature itself by declaring in a way Ninth Schedule laws as valid On the other hand the contention urged on behalf of the respondents is that the validity of Ninth Schedule legislations can only be tested on the touch stone of basic structure doctrine as decided by majority in <NAME> case which also upheld the Constitution th Amendment unconditionally and thus there can be no question of judicial review of such legislations on the ground of violation of fundamental rights chapter This would also show counsel for the respondents argued that there is no exclusion of judicial review and consequently there is no violation of the basic structure doctrine Further it was contended that the constitutional device for retrospective validation of laws was well known and it is legally permissible to pass laws to remove the basis of the decisions of the <ORG> and consequently nullify the effect of the decision The contention is that there is no judicial review in absolute terms and Article only restricts that judicial review power It is contended that after the doctrine of basic structure which came to be established in <NAME> case it is only that kind of judicial review whose elimination would destroy or damage the basic structure of the Constitution that is beyond the constituent power It was further contended that Justice <NAME> in <NAME> case held that subject to the retention of the basic structure or framework of the Constitution the power of amendment is plenary and will include within itself the power to add alter or repeal various articles including taking away or abridging fundamental rights and that the power to amend the fundamental rights cannot be denied by describing them as natural rights The contention is that the majority in <NAME> case held that there is no embargo with regard to amending any of the fundamental rights in Part III subject to basic structure theory and therefore the petitioners are not right in the contention that in the said case the majority held that the fundamental rights form part of the basic structure and cannot be amended It is contended that the test for judicially reviewing the Ninth Schedule laws cannot be on the basis of mere infringement of the rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution The correct test is whether such laws damage or destroy that part of fundamental rights which form part of the basic structure The only area where such laws get immunity is from the infraction of rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution Further mere possibility of abuse is not a relevant test to determine the validity of a provision The people through the Constitution have vested the power to make laws in their representatives through <ORG> in the same manner in which they have entrusted the responsibility to adjudge interpret and construe law and the Constitution including its limitation in the judiciary Validity of There was some controversy on the question whether validity of Article was under challenge or not in <NAME> In <NAME> it was held by a majority of that the power to amend the Constitution was not located in Article <NAME> case The contention urged on behalf of the respondents that all the Judges except Chief Justice <NAME> in <NAME> case held that th Amendment was valid and applied <NAME> case is not based on correct ratio of <NAME> case The other six learned Judges Chief Justice <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and Reddy <NAME> upheld the th Amendment subject to it passing the test of basic structure doctrine The other six held th Amendment valid subject to it passing the test of basic structure doctrine Thus while upholding the Twenty ninth amendment there was no mention of the test that is to be applied to the legislations inserted in the Ninth Schedule This Court unanimously upheld the validity of the th Amendment Act On the issue of how th Amendment in Kesavananda Bharati case was decided in Minerva Mills Bhagwati has said thus The validity of the Twenty ninth Amendment Act was challenged in <NAME> case but by a majority consisting of <NAME> <NAME> and the six learned Judges led by <NAME> <NAME> as he then was it was held to be valid In <NAME> supra <NAME> made it clear that he never opined that fundamental rights were outside the purview of basic structure and observed as follows There was a controversy during the course of arguments on the point as to whether I have laid down in my judgment in <NAME> case that fundamental rights are not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution I also dealt with the matter at length to show that the right to property was not a part of the basic structure of the Constitution <NAME> page But while the clarification in the Election Case simplifies one problem the scope of amending power it raises complicated problems of its own footnote This is clear from the provision of Article that such laws are subject to the power of any competent legislature to repeal or amend them that no <ORG> legislature has the power to repeal or amend the Constitution nor has <ORG> such a power outside Article except where such power is conferred by a few articles If <ORG> exercising constituent power cannot enact an amendment destroying the secular character of the <ORG> neither can <ORG> exercising its constituent power permit the <ORG> or the <ORG> Legislatures to produce the same result by protecting laws enacted in the exercise of legislative power which produce the same result We are unable to accept the contention urged on behalf of the respondents that in <NAME> case Justice <NAME> and in <ORG> case Justice <NAME> have not considered the binding effect of majority judgments in <NAME> case On the issue of equality we do not find any contradiction or inconsistency in the views expressed by Justice <NAME> in <NAME> case by Justice <NAME> in <NAME> case and Justice <NAME> in <ORG> case In the four different opinions six learned judges came to substantially the same conclusion Justice <NAME> also opined that there was implied limitation in the shape of the basic structure doctrine that limits the power of <ORG> to amend the Constitution but the learned Judge upheld th Amendment and did not say like remaining six Judges that the Twenty Ninth Amendment will have to be examined by a smaller Constitution Bench to find out whether the said amendment violated the basic structure theory or not This gave rise to the argument that fundamental rights chapter is not part of basic structure True it may reduce the efficacy of Article but that is inevitable in view of the progress the laws have made post Kesavananda Bharati case which has limited the power of the <ORG> to amend the Constitution under Article of the Constitution by making it subject to the doctrine of basic structure There is no constitutional control on such nullification That balance can be tilted in favour of the public good Under Article which is also part of Part III <ORG> has been vested with the power to ensure compliance of Part III It is also contended for the respondents that Article A excludes judicial review of certain laws from the applications of Articles and and that Article A has been held to be not violative of the basic structure Some of the rights in Part III constitute fundamentals of the Constitution like Article read with Articles and which represent secularism etc The <ORG> has power to amend the provisions of Part III so as to abridge or take away fundamental rights but that power is subject to the limitation of basic structure doctrine If Article a is sought to be amended so as to abrogate such right which we hope will never be done the acceptance of respondents contention would mean that such amendment would fall outside the judicial scrutiny when the law curtailing these rights is placed in the Ninth Schedule as a result of immunity granted by Article The impact of such an amendment shall have to be tested on the touchstone of rights and freedoms guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution The secular character of our Constitution is a matter of conclusion to be drawn from various Articles conferring fundamental rights and if the secular character is not to be found in Part III it cannot be found anywhere else in the Constitution because every fundamental right in Part III stands either for a principle or a matter of detail In the United Kingdom adopted the Human Rights Act which gave explicit affect to <ORG> We may also recall the observations made in Special Reference No SCR as follows hether or not there is distinct and rigid separation of powers under the Indian Constitution there is no doubt that the constitution has entrusted to the <ORG> in this country the task of construing the provisions of the Constitution and of safeguarding the fundamental rights of the citizens When a statute is challenged on the ground that it has been passed by a <ORG> without authority or has otherwise unconstitutionally trespassed on fundamental rights it is for the courts to determine the dispute and decide whether the law passed by the legislature is valid or not Extent of Judicial Review in the context of Amendments to the Ninth Schedule We are considering the question as to the extent of judicial review permissible in respect of Ninth Schedule laws in the light of the the basic structure theory propounded in <NAME> case The scope and content of the words constituent power expressly stated in the amended Article came up for consideration in <NAME> case <NAME> and <NAME> cases have to be read together and if so read the position in law is that the basic structure as reflected in the above Articles provide a test to judge the validity of the amendment by which laws are included in the Ninth Schedule There can be no rule of law if there is no equality before the law It gives practical content to the objectives of the Constitution embodied in Part III and other parts of the Constitution Application of doctrine of basic structure In <NAME> case the discussion was on the amending power conferred by unamended Article which did not use the words constituent power Even after the words constituent power are inserted in Article the limitations of doctrine of basic structure would continue to apply to the <ORG> It is in this context that we have to examine the power of immunity bearing in mind that after <NAME> case Article is subject to implied limitation of basic structure It would remove the golden triangle of Article read with Article and Article in its entirety for examining the validity of Ninth Schedule laws as it makes the entire Part III inapplicable at the will of the <ORG> It confers right to life as well as right to choose When this triangle of Article read with Article and Article is sought to be eliminated not only the essence of right test but also the rights test has to apply particularly when <NAME> and <NAME> cases have expanded the scope of basic structure to cover even some of the Fundamental Rights The doctrine of basic structure contemplates that there are certain parts or aspects of the Constitution including Article Article read with Article and which constitute the core values which if allowed to be abrogated would change completely the nature of the Constitution There is also a difference between the rights test and the essence of right test When in a controlled Constitution conferring limited power of amendment an entire Chapter is made inapplicable the essence of the right test as applied in <NAME> case supra will have no applicability We are considering the situation where entire equality code freedom code and right to move court under Part III are all nullified by exercise of power to grant immunization at will by the <ORG> which in our view is incompatible with the implied limitation of the power of the <ORG> The authority to enact law and decide the legality of the limitations cannot vest in one organ Thus validity of such laws can be challenged on the touchstone of basic structure such as reflected in Article read with Article and Article Article and the principles underlying these Articles It has to be borne in view that the fact that some Articles in Part III stand alone has been recognized even by the <ORG> for example Articles and Article provides for suspension of the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III during emergencies Fictional validation based on the power of immunity exercised by the <ORG> under Article is not compatible with the basic structure doctrine and therefore the laws that are included in the Ninth Schedule have to be examined individually for determining whether the constitutional amendments by which they are put in the Ninth Schedule damage or destroy the basic structure of the Constitution Every time such amendment is challenged to hark back to <NAME> upholding the validity of Article is a surest means of a drastic erosion of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III In conclusion we hold that i A law that abrogates or abridges rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution may violate the basic structure doctrine or it may not iii All amendments to the Constitution made on or after th April by which the Ninth Schedule is amended by inclusion of various laws therein shall have to be tested on the touchstone of the basic or essential features of the Constitution as reflected in Article read with Article Article and the principles underlying them To put it differently even though an Act is put in the Ninth Schedule by a constitutional amendment its provisions would be open to attack on the ground that they destroy or damage the basic structure if the fundamental right or rights taken away or abrogated pertains or pertain to the basic structure iv Justification for conferring protection not blanket protection on the laws included in the Ninth Schedule by Constitutional Amendments shall be a matter of Constitutional adjudication by examining the nature and extent of infraction of a Fundamental Right by a statute sought to be Constitutionally protected and on the touchstone of the basic structure doctrine as reflected in Article read with Article and Article by application of the rights test and the essence of the right test taking the synoptic view of the Articles in Part III as held in <NAME> case We answer the reference in the above terms and direct that the petitions appeals be now placed for hearing before <ORG> for decision in accordance with the principles laid down herein
