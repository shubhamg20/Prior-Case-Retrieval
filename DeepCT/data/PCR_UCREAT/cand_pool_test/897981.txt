the Service reservation for Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes and Other Backward Classes Act for short the Act that came into force with effect from December It has provided for the first time reservation to the Other Backward Classes Rules provided that if sufficient number of suitable candidates belonging to Dalits and Tribes were not available against reserved vacancies at the time of selection and if the vacancies were required to be filled up in the public interest general category employees could be appointed on ad hoc basis For ad hoc promotion also the above principle was made applicable There is a distinction between the conclusions and directions It being inconsistent with and contrary to the scheme of the Constitution in exercise of the power of judicial review the <ORG> cannot postpone the operation of the judgment to a future date which violates there fundamental rights After the judgment in <ORG> case however the Constitution th Amendment Act was enacted by the parliament which was come into force June for which date Article A was brought into the Constitution It provides that nothing in this Article shall prevent the <ORG> from making any provision for reservation in matters of promotion of any class or classes of posts in the services under <ORG> in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which in favour of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes which in the opinion of the <ORG> are not adequately represented i the services under the <ORG> Article and of constitution has provided them with the right to equality of opportunity is all post of classes of posts in the services under the <ORG> There is no dichotomy or distinction between the conclusion and directions That contemporaneous understanding of the operation of law is in accordance with the law laid in para of <NAME> case The impugned judgement of <ORG> was rendered on August while the Constitution th Amendment Act of came into force on June To adjust the competing rights of the general and Dalit and <ORG> employees there is no prohibition for this Court to postpone the operation of the judgment in <ORG> case or to so prospectively over rule <NAME> ratio as to be operative from expiry of five years from the date of judgment The ratio of <NAME> case has no application Therein the appellant <NAME> was meted out with a hostile discrimination denying him the normal trial and right of appeal and he was subjected to special trial by <ORG> depriving him of the statutory appeal violating his fundamental right to equality Therefore this <ORG> had held that the direction given under Article to constitute a separate <ORG> presided over by a <ORG> Judge was inconsistent with the fundamental right to equality guaranteed by Article The directions issued in exercise of the power under Article therefore was not in violation of the fundamental rights of the employees belonging to the general category SCC this <ORG> held that the Constitution th Amendment Act has given effect to the law laid down in <NAME> case as enshrined in Articles and of the Constitution <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for private respondents while adopting the arguments of <NAME> argued that the prospective over ruling of <NAME> ratio the distinction of stare decisis and the constitutional invalidation of a legislative enactment may be kept in view The Constitutional has provided in their favor protective and positive discrimination by providing for reservation in promotions are part of equality of opportunity status social and economic justice dignity of person which were given effect to by the Constitution th Amendment Act The right to reservation in promotion is required to be balanced with competing right to equality of the general employees There was no need for four other learned Judges to express their concurrence with <NAME> as they felt that the reservation in promotion is void from the inception by operation of Article Article therefore does not save its voidity nor can the void order be given effect to or saved by Article SCC in paras another Bench of three judges had held that no one has a vested right to promotion or seniority but an officer has an interest to seniority acquired by working out the rules were members following the above ratio held that no one has a vested right to promotion or seniority but an officer has an interest to seniority acquired by working out the rules SCR a Constitution Bench had held that Rule of the Andhra Pradesh Engineering Service Rules which confers a right of actual promotion or a right to be considered by promotion is a rule prescribing conditions of service <NAME> Krishna Reddy SLR another Bench of three Judges had held that any rule which affects that promotion of a person relates to conditions of service SCC a Bench of three judges following the above ratio with approval had held at page para that no employee has a right to promotion but he has only the right to be considered for promotion according to rules Democracy governed by rule of law brings about change in the social order only through rule of law Every citizen or group of people has right to a share in the governance of the <ORG> Article which is part of the scheme of equality of opportunity in governance of the <ORG> in chapter XVI by a special provision enjoins the <ORG> that the claims of the members of the Dalits and the Tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the efficiency of administration in the making of the appointment to service and post in connection with the affairs of the Union of a <ORG> Article A enjoins that it shall be the day of every citizen to strive towards excellence in all spheres of individual and collective activities so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement Equality of status and dignity of the individual will be secured when the employees belonging to Dalits and Tribes are given an opportunity of appointment by promotion in higher echelons of service so that they will have opportunity to strive towards excellence individually and collectively with other employees in improving the efficiency of administration It is not the object of the authority making the law impairing the right of the citizen nor the form of action taken that determines the protection he can claim it is the effect of the law and of the action upon the right which of the action upon the right which attract the jurisdiction of the court to grant relief In <NAME> case it was held that different articles in the chapter of fundamental rights of the Constitution must be read as an integral whole with possible overlapping of subject matter of what is sought to be protected by its various provisions particularly by articles relating fundamental rights of the Constitution must be read as an integral whole with possible overlapping of the subject matter of what is sought to be protected by its various provisions particularly by articles relating to fundamental rights contained in Part III of the Constitution do not represent entirely separate streams of rights which do not mingle at many points Fundamental rights are necessary means to develop one own personality and to carve out one own life in the manner one likes best subject to reasonable restrictions imposed in the paramount interest of the society and to a just fair and reasonable procedure All matters relating to employment include the right to continue in service till the employee reaches superannuation or his service is duly terminated in accordance with just fair and reasonable procedure prescribed under the provisions of the Constitution or the rules made under proviso to Article of the Constitution or the statutory provision or the rules regulations or instruction having statutory favour made thereunder But the relevant provisions must be conformable to the rights guaranteed in Parts III and IV of the Constitution Article guarantees the right to live which includes right to livelihood to a many the assured tenure of service is the source the deprivation thereof must be in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law conformable to the mandates of Articles and as be fair just and reasonable nut not fanciful oppressive or at vagary Facilities and opportunities as enjoined in Article are required to be provided to them to achieve the equality of representation in real content It is therefore necessary to take into account de facto inequalities which exist in the society and to take affirmative action by way of giving preference to the socially and economically disadvantaged persons or inflicting handicaps on those more advantageously placed in order to bring about reals equality The <ORG> must Therefore resort to compensatory <ORG> action for the purpose of making people who are factually unequal in their wealth education or social environment equal in which exist in the society and to take affirmative action by way of giving preference and reservation to the socially and economically disadvantaged persons or inflicting handicaps on those more advantageously placed in order to bring about real equality The question of reservation in promotion was non issue as conceded in that case itself and across the bar but the learned judges with all due respect and deference to their learned view decided a non issue though objected to on the ground that counsel appearing for the parties had put their heads together and formed the issue and reference was made to a larger <ORG> so that the issue was decided on that premise though it is settled constitutional law that constitutional issues cannot be decided unless the issues directly arises for decision with due respect the <ORG> decided a non issue on a constitutional law affecting of the national population and held that Article read with Article provides right to reservation in initial recruitment <ORG> si an admitted case that as there was no issue nor was any evidence adduced to prove whether efficiency of administration was deteriorated due to reservation in promotion nor was it pointed out from the facts of any case There can be no inferences unless there are objective facts direct or circumstantial from which the other fact which is sought to establish an be inferred It there are no positive proved facts oral documentary or circumstantial from which the inferences can be made At page he states that heredity is fixed by parentage but it is not an ideal environment There is nothing like a born genius There is neither statistical basis nor expert evidence to support these assumptions that efficiency will necessarily be impaired if reservation exceeds if reservation is carried forward or if reservation is extended to promotional posts The rules may provide for no appropriate method of selection If so The rules may prescribe a high minimum qualifying standard and an appropriate method of selection We are afraid we have to rid our minds of many cobwebs before we arrive at the core of the problem Every one of our ninety four hundred million people must have equal right to opportunities and blessings that freedom of India has to offer When the authorities have a power coupled with constitutional duty the doctrine of full faith and credit under Article gets due acceptance when done truly and sincerely with an honest objective and dispassionate assessment by the appropriate authority Thereby the efficiency of administration would automatically get improved and the nation constantly rises to higher levels of achievement The appellants petitioners have sought amendment of the pleadings challenging the vires of Article A of the Constitution and in fairness on the part of the learned counsel they did not press for consideration thereof obviously for the reason that it objects are mentioned in the statement of Objects and Reasons as under The Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes have been enjoying the facility of reservation in promotion since <ORG> in its judgment dated th November in the case of India Others however observed that reservation of appointments or posts under article of the Constitution is confined to initial appointment and cannot extent to reservation in the matter of promotion This ruling of <ORG> will adversely affect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Since the representation of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes in services in the States have not reached the required level it is necessary to continue the existing dispensation of providing reservation in promotion in the case of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes In view of the commitment of the Government to protect the interests of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes the Government have decided to continue the existing policy of reservation is promotion for the Scheduled castes and the Scheduled Tribes Unless adequate representation is given to the employees belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in promotions also the adequacy of representation in all classes and grades of service where there is no element of direct recruitment cannot be achieved So the policy of reservation is part of socio economic justice enshrined in the Preamble of the Constitution the fundamental rights under Articles A and and the other related Articles to give effect to the above constitutional objectives Article A read with Articles and guarantees a right to promotion to Dalits and Tribes as fundamental right where they not have adequate representation consistently with the efficiency in administration SCC <ORG> was called upon to consider whether the reservation in promotion as per the roster was correct in law and therefore constitutional and whether the employees belonging to Scheduled Castes have right to be considered for promotion in their own merits if so how they are required to be adjusted in the roster prescribed by the <ORG> The candidates belonging to the general category are not entitled to be considered for the reserved posts The fact that considerable number of members of the backward classes have been appointed promoted against the general seats in the <ORG> may be a relevant factor for the <ORG> <ORG> to review the question of continuing reservation for the said class but so long as the instructions rules providing certain percentage of reservations for the backward classes are operative the same have to be followed The promotions given in excess of the quota prior to the judgment in <NAME> case should not be disturbed Equally there was absence of concurrence by other learned Judges They have also drawn our attention to the dictionary meaning of those words The same do support our conclusion that <ORG> equally understood that the directions contained in paragraph constituted majority judgment Otherwise <ORG> in <NAME> case would not have proceeded to consider the right to promotion of the Dalits and question of giving effect to the roster system and the question of percentage of reservation provided in promotions would not have been give effect It is true that there is no positive indication or a finding to that effect in <NAME> case but the fact that the presiding Judge therein was one of the members of the nine judge Bench in <NAME> case and that <ORG> considered and upheld the right to reservation in promotion and upheld the right to reservation in promotion to the Dalits and Backward Classes and applied the roster points to such promotions Therefore the judges should adopt purposive interpretation of the dynamic concepts of the Constitution and the Act with its interpretative armoury to articulate the felt necessities of the time The Union of India SCR at it was held by another Constitution Bench thus It must be borne in mind that the Constitution must be interpreted in a broad way and not in a narrow and pedantic sense On the other hand the <ORG> must interpret the Constitution in a manner which would enable the citizen to enjoy the rights guaranteed by it in the fullest measure subject of course to permissible restrictions It is really a pragmatic solution reconciling the two conflicting doctrines namely that a <ORG> finds law and that it does make the law So there is no acceptable reason as to why the <ORG> in dealing with the law in supersession of the law declared by it earlier could not restrict the operation of law as declared to the future and save the transactions whether statutory or otherwise that were effected on the basis of the earlier law <NAME> had held that benefit of the decisions would be given only to the parties to the cases pending before the authorities from the date of the judgment but not to the actions already taken by the date of that judgment Therefore evolving of the appropriate rule to give effect to the decision of the <ORG> over ruling its previous precedent is one of judicial craftsmanship with pragmatism and judicial statesmanship as a useful outline to bring about smooth transition of the operation of law without unduly affecting the rights of the people who acted upon the law operated prior to the date of the judgment over ruling the previous law It is true that Article deals with pre constitutional law and if it is inconsistent with fundamental rights it becomes void from January the date on which the Constitution of India came into force and if a post constitutional law governed by Article violates fundamental rights it becomes void from its inception We agree with <NAME> that the power of the court under Article insofar as quashing of criminal proceedings are concerned is not exhausted by Section or or Cr That would convey the idea that statutory provisions override a constitutional provision It was held that the failure to exercise the power with such situations when it is invested specifically for the purpose is a failure to discharge the duty The first case deals with a case when the judicial officer in Gujarat was assaulted by the police and in the latter when a practising advocate assaulted a Judge of <ORG> this <ORG> took suo motu action and passed appropriate orders in spite of absence of specific power to deal with or despite the disciplinary power available under the Advocates Act The imposition of the punishment it was held does not denude the power of <ORG> it could issue directions to remedy the wrong done by the contemner including directions to refund the amounts wrongfully derived by the contemner to the rightful persons It would be seen that there is no limitation under Article on the exercise of the power by this <ORG> Before exercise of the power under Article and we find no limiting words to mould the relief or when this <ORG> takes appropriate decision to met out justice or to remove injustice At the same time this <ORG> upheld the power to remove hereditary trustees who mismanaged the endowment or committee for acts of misfeasance or malfeasance as valid Therein the distinction between the post constitutional and pre constitutional law which violated the fundamental rights and the effect thereof under Article and was considered The doctrine of eclipse was pressed into service and explaining the circumstances in which the voidity of the pre constitutional law and the validity of the post constitutional law was declared this <ORG> held that the post constitutional law violating the fundamental rights was still born and that therefore was void from its inception while the pre constitutional law is effective from inception but its voidity supervened when the Constitution came into force The ratio therein therefore has no application to the facts in this case Therein it was held that a law violating the fundamental rights was void but it remained valid under the protective umbrella of Schedule IX of the Constitution and therefore though it was void it cannot be declared to be void and remained to be valid law Therein though this <ORG> had directed under Article trial of the appellant by a High <ORG> Judge it was held that such direction was inconsistent with fundamental rights of equality under Article read with Article with the trial of other similarly circumstanced offenders by a properly constituted <ORG> with a right of appeal while the order passed under Article denied him of the equality of trial process The ratio also is inapplicable to the facts in this case as we have already held that the direction in <ORG> case postponing the operation of the judgment of reservation in promotions for a period of five years is a part of the scheme of judicial review being an innovative device to mete out justice to the Dalits and Tribes giving breathing time to the executive to bring about suitable legislative measures if they so desired and if no action was taken by amending the law on expiry of five years the judgment in <ORG> case would become operative In <NAME> case also a Constitution Bench has upheld the validity of the promotions given in excess of the roster otherwise also those promoted on their own merit were held to be validly promoted Therefore we hold that the promotions of the respondents are legal and valid and they do not become void or unconstitutional as contended Both the appeal and the writ petition are accordingly dismissed with no order as to costs
