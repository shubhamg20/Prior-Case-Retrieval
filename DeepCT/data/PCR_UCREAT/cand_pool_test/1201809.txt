In order to appreciate the points in controversy a few facts may be set out It is carrying on the business of manufacturing pharmaceutical and nutritional products and antibiotic and other products An application was therefore made by the assessee under section of the Act to the Commissioner of Sales Tax for the determination of the question whether on the sales of those products it was liable to pay any tax and if so the rate of tax The assessee feeling aggrieved by the said determination preferred an appeal before the <ORG> It is apparent that if entries and of Schedule I apply then the sales of the products in question would be free from all taxes in view of the exemption granted under section In the Oxford English Dictionary Volume IV at page various meanings of the word feed are given and out of them only the following meanings appear to be relevant Food for cattle fodder provender A meal a sumptuous meal a feast Besides in entry there are words of inclusion as well as of exclusion following upon the word cattle feed Besides the above there are certain substances known as vitamins which are considered to be essential for the proper nutrition of farm stock Reference may also be made in this connection to <ORG> Volume page where the subject Feeds Animal has been dealt with Concentrates include a large variety of feeds that have a high value because they are rich in easily digested nutrients such as starch fat and protein and are low in fibre or woody material which is not well digested Next to vitamin A attention is given to vitamin in live stock feeding This analysis of animal feeds also establishes two things first that amongst the materials on which animals are fed are included concentrates which include a wide variety of feeds that have a high value and secondly that in order that animals are able to maintain health and produce satisfactory amounts of milk eggs meat wool or work they require sufficient amounts inter alia of vitamins including vitamins A and some of which are lacking in the traditional live stock feed The word poultry has many meanings In <NAME> New Twentieth Century Dictionary Unabridged the following meaning is given to the word poultry at page Domestic fowls which are propagated and fattened for the table and for their eggs feathers etc When we construe the words poultry feed therefore we cannot overlook that the ration to be supplied to the birds must consist of two constituents namely that for maintenance and that for production that is to say for growth or fattening and for production of eggs meat or feathers These observations clearly indicate that poultry farming has assumed the proportion of an important industry and that apart from the chicken which are raised domestically to meet one own requirements there are large scale commercial operations of poultry raising in which the most modern of food marketing and distribution systems are involved In modern times cattle feed and poultry feed include a large variety of concentrates in addition to roughages that have a high value because they are rich in easily digested nutrients and feed supplement Amongst the feeds which are considered essential for the proper nutrition of animals and birds which are to be kept in a state of efficient production are included vitamins and more particularly vitamins A and which have been found to have a profound effect upon live stock farming by increasing the efficiency of animal production and preventing serious nutritional diseases Vitamin A which is required for growth reproduction production and even for maintenance and vitamin which is needed to enable the animal to assimilate and use other important elements of its feed are most apt to be lacking in natural live stock feeds and that they are included as additives in mixed feeds so as to make good the deficiency Whichever way one looks at the matter therefore whether one looks at it from the angle of the etymological meaning of the word in the context in which it is used here along with fodder and concentrates or whether one looks as it from the angle of a person conversant with the industry or trade of live stock farming or poultry raising the words cattle feed and poultry feed cannot any longer be considered as meaning only that conventional food which is necessary for the bare maintenance of cattle or birds as the case may be Such feed must consist of both the elements namely ration for maintenance and ration for production purpose It also appears to have been stated that the products do not constitute food in the conventional sense of ration for maintenance and that they constitute ration for production in the sense that they supply nutrients for nourishing the body It requires to be noted at this stage that the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax has observed that on studying the literature in respect of all the four items it clearly appeared that the products in question were not such as could be given to cattle or poultry without any addition This view of the <ORG> was based on the narrow meaning which it assigned to the word feed which according to it meant in substance ration for maintenance It was in terms observed as under It the word has not been defined in the Act and being a word of everyday use it must be construed in its popular sense meaning that sense which people conversant with the subject matter with which the statute is dealing would attribute to it Applying this test in the interpretation of the words foodstuff or food provision this Court took the view in those terms because when one demands foodstuff or food provision what one really demands is the satisfaction which one gets from eating a particular food article However beyond that no assistance can be derived from this decision for determining the meaning of the word cattle feed or poultry feed Ordinarily on the basis of the aforesaid reasoning both the questions would have been answered in favour of the assessee We have pointed out earlier that cattle feed which is mechanically produced is specifically excluded from the coverage of entry of Schedule I The essential question which will require to be determined in each case concerning the said entry therefore is whether the goods in question even if they be cattle feed are mechanically produced We find in the instant case that the <ORG> has not at all applied its mind to this aspect of the case presumably because it was of the view that the products in question are not cattle feed Having regard to this concession made on behalf of the assessee no useful purpose will be served by declining to answer the question and leaving it to the <ORG> to adjust its decision after determining the said question In the result the questions referred to us are answered as follows Question No In the negative that is to say against the assessee and in favour of the revenue
