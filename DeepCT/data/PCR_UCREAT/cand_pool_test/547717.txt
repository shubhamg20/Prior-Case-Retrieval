It was urged on behalf of the appellant that coal wag a mineral while charcoal was manufactured from products like wood and other things by human agency and therefore the dictionary meaning ought not to have been relied upon In interpreting items in statutes like the Sales Tax resort should be had not to the scientific or technical meaning of the terms used but to their popular meaning or the meaning attached ter them by those dealing in them that is to say in their commercial sense Viewed from this angl both a merchant dealing in coal and a consumer wanting to purchase it would reaard coal not in its geological sense but in the sense as ordinarily understood and would include charcoar in the term coal At the instance of the Commissioner of Sales Tax the <ORG> referred the following question to <ORG> Whether charcoal is covered under Entry I of Part III of Sch Consequently it answered the question in favour of the respondent According to <ORG> charcoal would be covered by Entry I of Part III of Sch Firewood The meaning given to the word Coal in Blackies Concise Dictionary New Edition page relied on by the <ORG> reads as follows Coal Kol A piece of wood or other combustible substance burning or charred charcoal a cinder now usually a solid black substance found in the earth largely employed as fuel and formed from vast masses of vege table matter deposited through the luxurious growth of plants in former epochs of the earth history Counsel for the <ORG> however raised three contentions that coal and charcoal are different products one being a mineral product and the other prepared from wood and other articles by human agency and therefore the term coal would not cover charcoal that while construing such entries the dictionary meaning should not be preferred to the popular meaning or the meaning in the commercial sense and that the <ORG> policy in reference to the term coal shows that it is not used by the <ORG> in India so as to include charcoal Now there can be no dispute that while coal is technically understood as a mineral product charcoal is manufactured by human agency from products like wood and other things But it is now well settled that while interpreting items in statutes like the Sales Tax Act resort should be had not to the scientific or the technical meaning of such terms but to their popular meaning or the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them that is to say to their commercial sense Section provided that articles mentioned in that Schedule were exempt from gales tax and articles not mentioned were taxable There were two items in the Schedule namely item vegetables and item betel leaves but subsequently item It also held that what constitutes a fruit or vegetable within the meaning of the Excise Tax If a statute uses the ordinary words in every day use such words should be construed according to their popular sense fruit or vegetable which must govern the interpretation to be placed on the words but rather what would ordinarily in matters of Botanically oranges and lemons are berries but otherwise no one would consider them as such Our attention was drawn to the decision in <NAME> Agricultural Income Tax and Rural Sales Tax Officer <NAME> and others where green leaves plucked from tea bushes were held to fall under the word tea II the test that would be applied is what would be the meaning which persons dealing with coal and consumers purchasing it as fuel would give to that word A sales tax statute is being one levying a tax on goods must in the absence of a technical term or a term of science or art be presumed to hive used an ordinary term as coal according to the meaning ascribed to it in common parlance from that angle both a merchant dealing in coal and a consumer wanting to purchase it would regard coal not in its geological sense but in the sense as ordinarily understood and would include charcoal in the term coal There is another aspect also from which Entry I of Part III may be considered As Lord <NAME> stated in <NAME> Chislett it would be a new terror in the construction of Acts of Parliament if we were required to limit a word to an unnatural A sense because in some Act which is not incorporated or referred to such an interpretation is given to it for the purposes of that Act alone Nor can we infer that there is a Legislative policy consistently followed by the <ORG> merely because the word coal has been used as meaning a mineral product in the context of these statutes It would not therefore be possible to discard the meaning of the word coal in this statute as understood in its commercial or popular sense and to adopt its connotation from other statutes passed for dif ferent purposes or in context of different objects The appeal is consequently dismissed with costs
