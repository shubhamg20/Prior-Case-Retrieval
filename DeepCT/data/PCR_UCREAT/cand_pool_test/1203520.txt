Kapur dis senting that the question must be answered in the affirmative The term business was of wide import and each case had to be determined with reference to the particular kind of acti vity or occupation of the person concerned There was undeniably a difference between the wording of the schedule and the Act and the tendency of the schedule was to widen the definition of business so as to include letting of property for earning rents It owns a six storeyed building where its offices are located on the ground floor and a part of the th floor while the rest of the building is let out to tenants On a further appeal by the respondent to the Appellate <ORG> the <ORG> held that there was no doubt that the premises were built with a view partly to housing the head office of the company and partly for the purpose of being let out to tenants and that it was an investment by the <ORG> in immovable property It made a particular reference to sub Thereupon the respondent got the <ORG> to state the case to <ORG> and the following question was accordingly referred to <ORG> under of the Income tax Act Whether in this case the rental income from immovable property is part of the business income taxable under section read with rule of Schedule I attached to the Excess Profits Tax Act There is no doubt that excess profits are not chargeable under the Act unless the income falls within the ambit of business profits Section of the Act defines profits as follows I profits means profits as determined in accordance with the First Schedule Section defines standard profits as follows Standard profits means standard profits as computed in accordance with the provisions of Section Section of the Act provides as follows This Act shall apply to every business of which any part of the profits made during the chargeable accounting period is chargeable to income tax by virtue of the provisions of sub clause or sub clause ii of clause of sub section of Section of the Indian Income tax Act or of clause of that sub section Provided that this Act shall not apply to any business the whole of the profits of which accrue or arise without British India where such business is carried on by or on behalf of a person who is resident but not ordinarily resident in British India unless the business is controlled in India Provided further that where the profits of a part only of a business carried on by a person who is not resident in British India or not ordinarily so resident accrue or arise in British India or are deemed under the Indian Income tax Act so to accrue or arise then except where the business being the business of a person who is resident but not ordinarily resident in British India is controlled in India this Act shall apply only to such part of the business and such part shall for all the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a separate business Provided further that this Act shall not apply to any business the whole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and where the profits of a part of a business accrue or arise in an Indian State such part shall for the purposes of this provision be deemed to be a separate business the whole of the profits of which accrue or arise in an Indian State and the other part of the business shall for all the purposes of this Act be deemed to be a separate business of as follows In the case of a business which consists wholly or partly in the letting out of property on hire the income from the property shall be included in the profits of the business whether or not it has been charged to income tax under Section of the Indian Income tax Act or under any other section of that Act Having set out the relevant provisions of the Act the first question that arises for consideration is whether the letting out of the promises in question can be said to be a business of the assessee bank Can it be said that realization of income from its investments which may be either in shares securities or in immovable properties is not a part of the business of a banking corporation In my opinion it will be taking a very narrow view of the functions of a bank to hold that such activities are not within the ambit of the business activities of a bank <ORG> answered the question referred to in the negative on the ground that though the income was derived from the holding of property the fuilctions of the assessee company did not consist wholly or mainly in the holding of investments or other property as required by the proviso to of the Act of could arise and even if such a question could arise the word business in that sub rule must take its colour from the main provisions of the section This conclusion was reached by the learned Chief Justice who delivered the opinion of the <ORG> by starting with the premise that for determining the nature of the income of the company it was not necessary to consider the provisions of the definition of business contained in the main clause of which was also assumed to be parallel to the connotation of the term business under the Indian Income tax Act The conclusion of the learned Chief Justice may better be stated in his own words as follows It appears to me that the first matter to which we must address ourselves in answering the question before us is are the functions of the assessee company such that the holding of the building in question or buildings or other property and investments in general must be deemed to be its business for the purposes of the Excess Profits Tax Act under the first proviso to section In order that question may be answered in favour of the <ORG> it is necessary that the holding of investments or other property should be the only or the principal function of the assessee company The question of the application of the first proviso which it is common ground is in the nature of an additional provision which brings within its ambit certain types of income to use a neutral term which would not otherwise have come within the terms of the main clause of the definition can arise only if the <ORG> first comes to the conclusion that the main clause of the definition is out of the way The learned Master of Rolls considered the question and made the following observations which apply with full force to the arguments which found favour in <ORG> The first argument is based on the language of Section of the Finance No That seems to me to be the real and sole object of Sub section It has therefore to be considered whether the main definition clause in can come into play in giving the answer to the question referred for the opinion of <ORG> It has rightly been observed in judicial decisions of high authority that it is neither practicable nor desirable to make any attempt at de limiting the ambit of its connotation Each case has to be determined with reference to the particular kind of activity and occupation of the person concerned It was held by <ORG> that the <ORG> was carrying on a trade or business and was therefore liable to Corporation Profits Tax was not a finding of pure fact but was an inference of law derived from the specific facts found in the case and that consequently the decision was open to review In that case a <ORG> was registered in as a <ORG> for the purposes of acquiring and working concessions and turning them to account and of investing and dealing with any moneys not immediately required But it has been contended that the words wholly or partly in the Rule are in excess of the provisions of where in tile first proviso the words are wholly or mainly In this connection a reference to the second proviso is also relevant in so far as it implies that a person may carry on businesses of different kinds and all those different lines of business have for the purposes of the Act to be treated as one business But it had been found as a fact that the <ORG> had been selling shares and secu rities not only for the purpose aforesaid but also for augmenting its reserve funds In the background of those facts it was held by a Bench of five Judges of this <ORG> that the profits made from the sale of investments and the making of fresh investments were assessable to income tax In my opinion there is a fallacy in this argument In this connection another argument advanced by the learned counsel for the respondent as an additional reason for not treating rental income as Coming within the purview of the Act may now be considered This proviso was perhaps inserted out of abundant caution to repel arguments like those advanced in the case of <ORG> <ORG> In that case <ORG> was incorporated in with the I That case does not throw any light on the interpretation of the term business The appeal must therefore be allowed with costs here and below <NAME> I have read the judgment prepared by my learned brother <NAME> but I respectfully disagree with it and my reasons are these The sole question for decision is whether a sum of Rs The object of the Act was to impose a tax on excess profits which as the very name implies must have reference to and be the result of a business activity In order to determine whether income received during a chargeable accounting period is for the purposes of the Act profits arising out of Business or not it becomes necessary to examine what these words i Business and profits mean The word profits in of the Act means profits as determined in accordance with the First Schedule which provides the method of computation of profits Rule of this Schedule deals with income from investments and is as follows SEE SECTION Rules for the computation of profits for purposes of Excess Profits Tax Income received from investments shall be included in the profits in the cases and to the In the case of a business part of which consists in banking insurance or dealing in investments not being a business to which sub rule of this rule applies the profits shall include all income received from investments held for the purpose of that part of the business being income to which the persons carrying on the business are beneficially entitled Therefore the respondent qua the holding of investments of this kind was carrying on business under proviso to of the Act but it is not that kind of business which is the subject matter of controversy in this appeal Two arguments were addressed in favour of the contention that such income was profits of business within the Act that the laying out of money in a multi storeyed building was itself an investment and that even if the business consisted partly in letting out of property the income from that property was profit within the Act Now this argument loses sight of the fact that the <ORG> has chosen to use two words investments and other property with a disjunctive or in between To both these words a meaning must be assigned because it cannot be said that one or the other of them is redundant or they mean the same thing The question whether or not a particular piece of income is income received from an investment must in my view be decided on the facts of the case If <ORG> as in the present case constructs a multi storeyed building used a part of it and lets out the rest it cannot be said to carry on business unless its main function is the holding of property and we have already seen that the main function of <ORG> is dealing in money or credit and for that purpose it holds investments in the form of easily realisable securities As the Excess Profits Tax is a taxing measure and the object of the Act also is to tax excess profits it is reasonable to say that the words investment and property as used in the case of a Banking Company are used So read can it be said that the activities appropriate to the business of a banking company consists wholly or mainly in the holding of a multi storeyed building or such other property for the purpose of letting out the unused portion on hire Under the Income tax Act it falls under and there is nothing to indicate in the definition of the word business as given in the main portion of of the Act that it has a different complexion there Sub rule of is as follows In the case of a business which consists wholly or partly in the letting out of property on hire the income from the property shall be included in the profits of the business whether or not it has been charged to income tax under section of the Indian Income tax Act or under any other section of that Act It only means that when the functions of a company i the activities appropriate to any business consist wholly or mainly in the holding of other property then in the case of that portion of the business which wholly or partly consists in the letting of property for hire the income from the property shall be included in profits in spite of the fact that the income has been assessed under of the Income Tax Act The judgment of <ORG> is therefore sound and I would dismiss this appeal with costs <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the judgments of my learned brothers <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> I agree with <NAME> that the appeal must be allowed with costs here and below In my opinion the question must be answered in the affirmative for the following reasons According to another definition I profits mean profits as determined in accordance with the First Schedule of the Act In the schedule which is enacted as part of the Act to which reference has been made in the question reads as follows In the case of a business which consists wholly or partly in the letting out of property on hire the income from the property shall be included in the profits of the business whether or not it has been charged to income tax under section of the Indian Income tax Act or under any other section of that Act The difference between the definition of I business and the rule above quoted is that while the former mentions that the business must be wholly or mainly holding of investments or other property the rule says that if the business consists wholly or partly of letting out of property the income of the property shall be included in the profits The definition mentions the holding of investments or other property and the words other property must necessarily take their colour from what precedes that is to say investments only for the purpose of computing the profits as laid down in the definition and as the heading the Schedule shows That there is a difference between the Schedule and the Act is not to be denied and the question that naturally falls for consideration is whether the Schedule should be given effect to independently in the circumstances of the case The rule to be applied was stated by Lord <NAME> <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> in the following words It seems to me there are two principles or rules of interpretation which ought to be applied to the combination of Act and schedule shows that the legislature was defining the term business as and when necessary as it laid down the rules for calculation of profits of a business For these reasons and those given by my brother <NAME> I hold that this appeal should be allowed with costs here and below In accordance with the judgment of the majority the decision under appeal is set aside and the appeal is allowed with costs here and below
