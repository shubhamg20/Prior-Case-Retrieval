The disputes were referred for arbitration of a <ORG> consisting of five men <NAME> had previougly been a member of the <ORG> but was not a member at the time when the occurrence took place The five Panchas met on to settle the disputes between <NAME> and <NAME> but did not succeed on the other hand there is evidence that some hot words were exchanged between <NAME> and two of the nominees of <NAME> On at about when there was moon in the sky <NAME> and <NAME> went to the house of <NAME> and asked him to go to the house of <NAME> to settle the dispute between him and <NAME> about the cutting of the paddy crop The police reached the spot on th December for investigation The first three deposed that the occurrence took place in the manner stated above and that <NAME> stabbed <NAME> on being prompted by the other two appellants and that they all ran away together There is further the evidence of the Magistrate who proved the dying declaration of <NAME> made on th December There was no suspicious delay in the lodging of the report it was quite natural for <NAME> and <NAME> to carry <NAME> first to the hospital where his wound could be attended to and then think of going to the police station to lodge a report There is absolutely nothing suspicious in <NAME> getting the report scribed by <NAME> even if he himself was literate In the report it was written at first that the occurrence took place at but the figure was altered to the figure in different ink I do not know what advantage the prosecution would have got by shifting the time of occurrence from to It is nobody case that the occurrence took place at and not at Therefore putting down the time as originally must have been an innocent mistake which was probably detected when the written report was handed over at the police station <NAME> was cross examined on behalf of the accused with a view to show that <NAME> could obtain arus leaves from a place nearer his house than the place behind <NAME> house This cross examination was against the law because no evidence could be produced by the accused to contradict the evidence of Sheikh <NAME> about the reason for his being at the place of occurrence at the time when it took place He gives the reasons on which the rule is founded in para It is the contention of the prosecution itself that his evidence would have gone against it and there is no sense in saying that this should be presumed Witnesses essential to the unfolding of tie narrative on which the prosecution is based must of course be called by the prosecution whether in the result the effect of their testimony is for or against the case for the prosecution The prosecutor has a discretion as to what witnesses should be called for the prosecution and the Court will not interfere with the exercise of that discretion unless perhaps it can be shown that the prosecutor has been influenced by some oblique motive I therefore attach no importance to the fact that the prosecution did not examine him as its witness He was in his senses when he made the dying declaration before the Magistrate in the hospital On <NAME> made a report of an offence under Sections and against <NAME> and <NAME> these witnesses might have given evidence against him on account of it but there is no certainty that they have given false evidence on account of it Though there was not much evidence and the case was very simple the trial took eleven days Witness after witness was cross examined about certain statements made by him in the deposition but not to be found in his statement under Section Criminal A statement recorded by the police under Section can be used for one purpose and one purpose only and that of contradicting the witness Therefore if there is no contradiction between his evidence in <ORG> and his recorded statement in the diary the latter cannot be used at all If a witness deposes in <ORG> that a certain fact existed but had stated under Section either that that fact had not existed or that the reverse and irreconcilable fact had existed it is a case of conflict between the deposition in the <ORG> and the statement under Section and the latter can be used to contradict the former But if he had not stated under Section anything about the fact there is no conflict and the statement cannot be used to contradict him In some cases an omission in the statement under Section may amount to contradiction of the deposition in <ORG> they are the cases where what is actually stated is irreconcilable with what is omitted and impliedly negatives its existence If the statement under Section can be reconciled with the deposition in <ORG> and can stand with it there is absolutely no conflict Unless therefore a deposition in <ORG> cannot be reconciled with what is stated under Section the statement under Section cannot be used to contradict the witness He went on to say Whether it is considered as a question of logic or of language omission and contradiction can never be identical I would not go as far as <NAME> to say that an omission can never be a contradiction bat I certainly agree with him that it is not synonym cms with contradiction and that generally it does not amount to contradiction Closely connected with this question when does an omission amount to a contradiction is the question of the proper way of using a statement made under Section for the purpose of contradiction The section itself does not lay down the manner in which the statement can be used for contradiction Under Section Evidence Act a witness may be contradicted by a previous statement made by him and reduced to writing but before the statement is proved the witness attention must have been drawn to it When under Section a statement can be used only for the purpose of contradicting the witness when in the witness box it means that out of the whole statement made by him under Section only the particular assertion which contradicts his deposition in <ORG> can be used The test to find out whether an omission is a contradiction or not is to see whether one can point to any sentence or assertion which is irreconcilable with the deposition in the <ORG> Similarly in the other example he may be confronted with his statement under Section that and were the eye witnesses and asked how he omitted the name of If there is nothing to indicate that he meant to give an exhaustive list of assailants or witnesses that itself is the explanation for his omitting to mention the name of as an assailant and that of as an eye witness and there would be no sense in confronting him with his statement under Section and calling upon him to explain I have dealt with this matter at length because many Ses It is quite wrong for a Sessions Judge to make a note when a witness denies or does not remember having made a certain statement before the Sub Inspector that such a statement exists or does not exist There was no dispute about <NAME> being stabbed in the abdomen yet there was unnecessary cross examination of <NAME> about his not stating in the report that the stabbing was done in the abdomen There was no sense in asking <NAME> who was not an eye witness of the crime whether anyone chased the assailants whether he himself made any attempt to catch any of them and wheher he told anyone to catch any of them <NAME> could not explain why the witnesses had given evidence against him while the other two appellants pleaded enmity with them I have not the slightest doubt that <NAME> was murdered by being stabbed in the abdomen with a knife at the door of <NAME> in the evening of It seems to me that <NAME> did not have the courage to speak falsehood and go against the clear evidence and also did not want to admit the facts and thereby help the placing of the noose round the neck of one or more of his friends The words used in the obligatory part of Section are question generally on the case they do not mean that the accused should be questioned specifically about every circumstance appearing in the evidence against him In the present case there is no question of relying upon the appellant failure to explain why <NAME> named them in the dying declarations the evidence consists of the dying declarations themselves and not of any failure of the appellants to offer any explanation for them <NAME> had no enmity with <NAME> and when one has regard to his character one would find it impossible to imagine that he falsely accused him of the crime As regards the other two appellants there is the evidence of the eye witnesses and of the dying declaration of <NAME> at the spot But there is no mention of them at all in the dying declaration made in the hospital There were four occasions on which <NAME> could have referred to them in the latter dying declaration but failed on every occasion Under Section Evidence Act it is the statement actually made by the deceased as to the cause of his death or of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death which is relevant and not what he omits to state This follows from what I said above namely that what is relevant is what he has said and not what he has not said If <NAME> and <NAME> sitting there with <NAME> instigating him to strike <NAME> and running away with <NAME> is inconsistent with what <NAME> mentioned in his dying declaration it means that the dying declaration contradicts the evidence given by the witnesses about the part played by <NAME> and <NAME> I think in this particular case it is not easy to say that there is no inconsistency between the two I agree with my learned brother <NAME> that the appeal of <NAME> be dismissed and that the appeal of <NAME> and <NAME> be allowed There is ample evidence against <NAME> who is alleged to have stabbed <NAME> with a knife There is no particular reason for any of these witnesses to depose falsely against <NAME> There is no reason to doubt the presence of <NAME> at the time of the incident The incident took place at about <NAME> in his dying declaration before the Magistrate gave the time of the incident as <NAME> statement that he saw the incident on his way back to his house after answering the call of nature is open to question Ordinarily he would not be expected to be re turning at about when he had left the house at about I would therefore give the benefit of doubt to <NAME> and <NAME> We maintain the conviction and sentence of <NAME> dismiss his appeal accept the reference and direct that the sentence of death be carried out according to law We allow the appeal of <NAME> and <NAME> set aside their conviction and sentence and acquit them
