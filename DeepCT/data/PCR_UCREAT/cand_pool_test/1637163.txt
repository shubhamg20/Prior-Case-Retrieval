JUDGMENT JUDGMENT <NAME> The instant appeal arises out of a judgment and order passed by <ORG> dismissing the Election Petition No of preferred by the appellant challenging the election of the respondent herein <NAME> the returned candidate to <ORG> It appears that some objections were raised regarding the nomination of the respondent <NAME> on the ground that he does not belong to Scheduled Caste community rather he is Kurmi by caste which falls in the category of Other Backward Classes As indicated above the petitioner filed an election petition challenging the election of the respondent amongst other on the ground that he was not entitled to contest from a reserved constituency as a Scheduled Caste candidate since he is Kurmi by caste The oral evidence led on behalf of the petitioner is to the effect that <NAME> the father of <NAME> is Kurmi by caste and his wife <NAME> is also a Kurmi Some residents of village Adai have also been examined by the petitioner to state that there was no person by the name of <NAME> in that village and they denied the fact that the respondent was borne of <NAME> in village Adai After observing that the petitioner appellant could not produce any direct evidence about the caste of the respondent <NAME> it is found As the election petitioner is not from the family of the respondent or his relation so it cannot be possible to have any special knowledge regarding the caste but he could not produce any person from the family of <NAME> or <NAME> himself who can prove that <NAME> the Respodnent is a Kurmi by caste through a Kurmi mother i <NAME> There is no denial of the fact that <NAME> is a Kurmi as well as <NAME> wife of <NAME> There was no occasion for the appellant to examine <NAME> or any member of his family once it was given out by the appellant that <NAME> and his wife <NAME> both are Kurmi by caste The facts of which special knowledge is with the respondent he alone had to prove those facts by adducing the best evidence on the point of his being a Pasi by caste In the light of the above observations it is only to be decided on the basis of the evidence adduced by both the parties as to who has been able to prove one case Surprisingly the court looses sight of the fact that despite such an averment made in the written statement <NAME> has been cited as witness of the respondent Further so far mother is concerned she is with the respondent and there is no reason of any kind of bad relations between the respondent and his mother <NAME> to not to produce her There was no occasion to state further in the election petition that the respondent was borne of <NAME> out of her wedlock with <NAME> who are husband and wife and Kurmis by caste unless it is proved by the other side by any evidence that the petitioner had knowledge of the alleged marriage of <NAME> with a Pasi lady namely <NAME> in another village namely Adai where <NAME> never resided nor <NAME> was ever brought to reside with <NAME> in his village Strangely enough we again find yet another fragile and strange observation as follows The election petitioner himself in his evidence had not denied categorically that the respondent had not been born to the womb of <NAME> But here the respondent could make out a special case that although he has been born of a Kurmi father but mother being a Pasi he is a Scheduled Caste and as such a competent person to contest from the Reserved Constituency We have already observed that there was no occasion for the petitioner appellant to examine either of them But there is no such cogent reason for the respondent not to examine them We may consider a few cases on the point of drawing adverse inference in the event of withholding of a witness it has been held that a party who is in possession of best evidence which would throw light on the issue in controversy withholds such evidence an adverse inference under Section of the Evidence Act ought to be drawn against such a party notwithstanding that the onus of proof may not lie on him A case which has been set up by the respondent through his witnesses as well that his father had taken a fancy for <NAME> a resident of village Adai who is Pasi by caste and married her who gave birth to two children including the respondent would normally be not in the knowledge of people in general particularly when according to the case of the respondent himself <NAME> lived in another village and she was never brought from there by <NAME> These facts clearly make out a case for drawing an adverse inference that in case they had been produced they would not have supported the case of the respondent On the other hand the onus to prove facts within the special knowledge of respondent no would lie upon him alone to prove those facts If there is anything contrary to the normal course of events as pleaded in this case of another marriage of <NAME> in some other village namely Adai with <NAME> who never came to live with <NAME> in his village nor <NAME> ever lived there When the persons concerned are not coming forward to the court to depose about the alleged relationship and an adverse inference has been drawn that if they had come to the Court to depose their evidence would have gone against the respondent in such circumstances there is no occasion to act upon the statement of DW the brother of <NAME> or other witnesses Reliance has also been placed on two decisions reported in AIR SC Samant Balakrishna etc These are the material facts relating to the plea raised by the appellant that the respondent is not a Scheduled Caste We don think if the respondent means to say that the petitioner should have stated in the petition that the respondent is not born of <NAME> said to be married to <NAME> in Village Adai In this connection a reference may be made to a decision of this Court reported in AIR SC <NAME> Vs <NAME> and <NAME> The learned counsel for the respondent then submits that in fact the issue framed by <ORG> was not to the effect as to whether the respondent is a Kurmi or Pasi by caste We may however consider the argument of the learned counsel for the respondent from the angle as sought to be canvassed as well namely the nomination paper of respondent was improperly and illegally accepted by the Returning Officer or not on the basis of the evidence on the record She has stated that on after she had lodged the report there was lot of opposition in respect of the nomination paper of the respondent In the result the appeal is allowed with costs and the judgment and order passed by <ORG> is set aside as well as the election of the Respondent to Fatua Assembly Constituency of State of Bihar
