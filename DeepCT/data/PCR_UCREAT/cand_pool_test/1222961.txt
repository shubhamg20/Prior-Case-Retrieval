Section as it stood before its amendment by Madras Act I of reads No person who is not a registered dealer shall collect any amount by way of tax under this Act nor shall a registered dealer make any such collection except in accordance with such conditions and restrictions if any as may be prescribed Every person who has collected or collects any amount by way of tax under this Act on or after the st day of April shall pay over to <ORG> within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed all amounts so collected by him if they are in excess of the tax if any paid by him for the period during which the collections were made At page <NAME> observed thus What Section requires of every person is that he should pay over to <ORG> all amounts so collected by him that is all amounts collected by way of tax Section was re enacted in the following terms Every person who has collected or collects any amount purporting to be by way of tax under this Act on or after the st day of April whether or not any tax is due from him under this Act in respect of the transaction in which he has collected or collects such amount shall pay over to the State Government within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed all amounts so collected by him if they are in excess of the tax if any paid by him for the period during which the collections were made The newly introduced words are any amount purporting to be by way of tax instead of the words as they were prior to the amendment any amount by way of tax under this Act The intendment of the legislation is that any amount collected in the name of tax should be paid over to <ORG> by the person collecting the amount independently of his liability to be assessed to tax The working of the Act manifested at least four evils consequent upon the abuse of the provisions of the Act by dealers and other persons registered dealers collected taxes from their purchasers properly leviable under the Act but some of them failed to pass on the collections to the <ORG> as they were not within the charging section being persons with less than the minimum turnover of Rs dealers collected tax from their purchasers at a higher rate than that prescribed by the Act and paid to the <ORG> only at the proper rate and pocketed the difference dealers collected amounts from their purchasers under the guise of tax when their transactions were not within the Act and appropriated the amounts for themselves as they could not be and were not assessed by the <ORG> and persons who were not dealers at all and who were only commission agents and brokers collected tax from others who transacted with them and got the benefit themselves as they were not inside the Act We may also refer to a passage from the judgment of the Australian court bringing out the same idea in <NAME> <ORG> CLR at which runs thus The Constitution marks the outlines of the powers or the national legislature but does not undertake as a code of laws would to enumerate the sub divisions of those powers as to specify all the means of executing them In <ORG> <NAME> AIR FC at Sir <NAME> laid down the same doctrine in the following words None of the items in the List is to be read in a narrow or pedantic sense and each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary and subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it In a statute falling within the enumerated topic of legislation provisions enacted to ensure and achieve the effectiveness of the Act should not be treated as alien to the subject matter of the legislation In <NAME> <NAME> CLR it was held by <ORG> that the forfeiture imposed by the Customs Act was incidental for the purpose of vindicating the Customs Laws and was not an acquisition of property in respect of which the <ORG> was empowered to make laws These matters of incidental powers are largely questions of degree but in considering them we must not lose sight of the fact that once the subject matter is fairly within the province of the <ORG> legislature the justice and wisdom of the provisions which it makes in the exercise of its powers over the subject matter are matters entirely for the <ORG> and not for the <ORG> We have to consider the question whether the conferment of right in favour of <ORG> to compel payments of amounts collected by persons taking advantage of the machinery of the Act is the result of the exercise of ancillary power of <ORG> attached to the power to enact a law in respect of tax on sale and purchase The <ORG> has undoubtedly no power by which it can enact a law to connive at or be a party to illegal collection of amount purporting to be tax Surely the <ORG> has not empowered any person whether a registered dealer or not to collect amounts not leviable as tax under the Act The object of the amendment to Section under Madras Act I of as revealed by the plain words of the amendment is only to put a check upon persons misusing the Act to their own advantage we can use a familiar expression and say that the pith and substance of the amendment is not to levy an ad hoc tax on transactions which are not sales or purchases but to introduce a measure in the nature of forfeiture or confiscation of the unlawful gains made by persons who found themselves in a position to take undue advantage of the Act We shall now refer to the decisions cited on behalf of the petitioners The proviso reads thus Provided that if any dealer collects any amount by way of tax in contravention of the provisions of this section or the conditions and restrictions prescribed thereunder the amount so collected shall without prejudice to any punishment to which the dealer may be liable for an offence under this Act be forfeited to <ORG> and such dealer shall pay such amount into the Government treasury in accordance with a direction issued to him by the Commissioner or any officer appointed under Section to assist him and in default of such payment the amount shall be recovered as an arrear of land revenue The headnote correctly sets out the ratio of the decision The true effect of Section of the Madras General Sales tax Act and the Madras General Sales tax Turnover and Assessment Rules is that a a registered dealer is enabled to pass on the tax an unregistered dealer cannot do so and the amount collected by way of tax is to be shown separately for it has to be paid over to Government Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioners relied on this case mainly to emphasise the fact that the dealer who collects the tax from his purchaser and upon which a liability is fastened to pay over the proceeds to the <ORG> is not the agent ex contracts or statutory of the <ORG> In support of this contention he referred us to the decision in <NAME> Attorney General AC At page Lord <NAME> observed I agree with <NAME> in thinking that the words fiduciary relationship in this setting are used in a wide and loose sense and include inter alia a case where the servant gains from his employment a position of authority which enables him to obtain the sum which he receives It applies to every person who collects any amounts by way of tax under this Act It is not necessary for us to go into the question as to the jural relationship between the <ORG> and an unregistered or a registered dealer in respect of transactions where such dealers have collected amounts from other persons purporting to be by way of tax but not really tax due and payable as the question of the competency of the legislature cannot depend upon that relationship In American Law Reports Annotated the following observation occurs at page To prevent the unjust enrichment of a manufacturer who had collected from the purchasers the tax assessee under the Agricultural Adjustment Act but who because of the subsequent invalidation of that Act had either not paid such tax to <ORG> or having paid it had recovered it back but had not turned it over to the persons upon whom the burden of tax had ultimately fallen Truly the tax is as named a tax on unjust enrichment and enrichment not at the expense of an individual but at the expense of a buying public and the <ORG> which imposed the tax A tax so conceived has none of the ear marks of the arbitrariness which would bring it under interdict of the fifth amendment they applied for refund under Section of the Act of tax paid in respect of goods despatched for consumption outside the State of Orissa contending that according to the lavy expounded by <ORG> the transactions of sales outside the State were not taxable under the Act The amendment is in these terms Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act where any amount is either deposited by any person under Sub section of Section or paid as tax by a dealer and where such amount or any part thereof is not payable by such person or dealer a refund of such amount or any part thereof can be claimed only by the person from whom such person or dealer has actually realised such amounts whether by way of sales tax or otherwise and the period of limitation in the proviso to Section shall apply to the aforesaid claims It was however contended that the Act was beyond the competence of <ORG> and that in any event it was void because it imposed an unreasonable restriction upon the assessee fundamental right guaranteed under Article of the Constitution Dealing with the question of competency of the legislature <NAME> observed thus at page of <ORG> at of AIR The power to legislate with respect to a tax comprehends the power to impose the tax to prescribe machinery for collecting the tax to designate the officers by whom the liability may be enforced and to prescribe the authority obligations and indemnity of those officers If competence to legislate for granting refund of sales tax improperly collected be granted is there any reason to exclude the power to declare that refund shall be claimable only by the person from whom the dealer has actually realised the amounts by way of sales tax or otherwise We see none The question is one of legislative competence and there is no restriction either express or implied imposed upon the power of the legislature in that behalf There is another decision of <ORG> Messrs The assessee in that case was a firm carrying on business as building and works contractors In the appeal filed by the assessee against the order of <ORG> holding that a portion of refund claimed was barred by limitation under Section of the Act the provisions of Section of the Act were challenged as ultra vires of <ORG> The contention urged on behalf of the assessee was that <ORG> had no power to restrict We right to obtain refund of tax illegally collected by imposing a period of limitation <ORG> quoted the passage extracted above from their decision in and observed thus If the power to legislate in respect of tax comprehends the power to legislate in respect of refund of tax improperly or illegally collected imposition of restrictions on the exercise of the right to claim refund will not be beyond the competence of the legislature There is another view of the matter tending to uphold the legislative competence The petitioner in these three tax revision cases is an incorporated company carrying on business in aluminium metal and its alloys at Calcutta The goods despatched from Calcutta were delivered at Madras for consumption in the Madras State There is really no substance in the contention that the property in the goods passed outside the State and that therefore the transactions were not taxable events under the Madras General Sales tax Act The petitioner prays for the issue of a writ of prohibition or other appropriate writ under Article of the Constitution to forbear the respondent the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer <NAME> from collecting the sum of Rs The petitioner is a firm of partnership carrying on business as publishers and sellers of law books We have already held that Section is intra vires and it is therefore clear that the petitioner must submit to the demand of the <ORG> to pay over this sum of Rs Learned counsel for the petitioner argued that there was no separate demand under Form in respect of this amount and that therefore the amount could not be recovered The claim of the <ORG> to compel the petitioner to pay over this amount squarely falls within the specific provisions of Section and there are certainly no grounds for resisting the claim The petitioner prays for the issue of a writ of certiorari or other appropriate writ under Article of the Constitution to quash the order of the Assistant Commercial Tax Officer <ORG> Madras dated in A under the following circumstances The petitioner is a firm of partnership carrying on business as building contractors at Madras The petitioner contended that building contracts were not within the Act and that the taxing authorities had no jurisdiction to levy tax under the Madras General Sales tax Act It cannot be said that there was no case for the authorities to act under Rule of the Madras General Sales tax Rules The Assistant Commercial Tax Officer in his original order of assessment dated held that the taxable turnover of the petitioner was nil and he also stated in that order of assessment that there was no demand under Section of the Act clearly overlooking the fact that the petitioner had collected a sum of Rs It is urged on behalf of the petitioner that the original assessment order became final and could not be reopened if there are grounds for the authorities to act under Rule and we have held that there are grounds for so acting the previous order of assessment cannot be said to have become indefeasibly final He shall pay in full the amount or amounts collected by him by way of tax or taxes to <ORG> on or before the th April of the year succeeding in which such collection is made If the assessing authority is satisfied that any amount or amounts collected by the dealer by way of tax or taxes have not been paid by him to <ORG> in any year as required by condition in Sub rule the assessing authority shall issue a notice to the dealer in form specifying therein the total sum so withheld by the dealer and the dealer shall pay such sum at the time and in the manner specified therein Apart from the fact that different forms have been prescribed one for recovery of demand resulting from regular assessment and the other for collection of the amount due and payable under Section of the Act there is enough indication even in the language of Section to show that the liability of the dealer is independent of his liability under the charging section of the Act The words whether or not any tax is due from him under this Act in respect of the transaction in which he has collected or collects such amount in Section quite clearly make out that the liability to pay over the collected amount is de hors the liability as dealer under the other provisions of the Act The petitioner in these two writ petitions prays for the issue of a writ of certiorari or other appropriate writ under Article of the Constitution to quash the order of the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer Mylapore dated in A relating to the assessment year The petitioner is a firm of partnership carrying on business as building contractors and the sum of Rupees for the two years from the petitioner on We ground that the petitioner was liable to pay the amount to the <ORG> under Section of the Act The petitioner challenged the vires of the provision and resisted the collection After some abortive proceedings by way of appeal and revision the petitioner has approached this court under Article of the Constitution Section of the Act has been held valid by us The petitioner in all these three writ petitions is a private limited company carrying on business as building contractors in the City of Madras In consequence of the judgment of <ORG> there was a revised assessment by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer It was further contended on behalf of the petitioner that there is really no excess available in the hands of the petitioner which can enable the <ORG> to claim the right of payment under Section of the Act In all these years the petitioner paw the tax which certainly included the amount collected from the constituents There is really no substance in the plea urged on behalf of the petitioner that the ingredients of Section are not present to warrant the action taken by the taxing authorities
