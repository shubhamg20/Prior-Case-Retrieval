The plaintiff instituted this suit on against the defendant It is alleged in the plaint as filed that on or about it was agreed by and between the plaintiff and the defendant by means of letters exchanged between the parties that the plaintiff would sell and the defendant would purchase tons of imported continental paper upon certain terms specified in the plaint It is then stated that the plaintiff had supplied the defendant and the defendant had accepted tons lbs In the alternative the plaintiff stated that he had supplied the said goods to the defendant not intending to do so gratuitously and that the defendant was liable to compensate the plaintiff for the benefits enjoyed I shall proceed on the footing that the plaintiff wishes to introduce an alternative cause of action and for that purpose requires fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent In <NAME> <NAME> Bom it was held that the leave granted under Clause of the Letters Patent was confined to the cause or causes of action set forward in the plaint at the time when leave was granted hence the plaint could not be amended so as to alter the original cause of action or to introduce a different cause of action which would require leave under Clause of the Letters Patent The defendant took the defence that he had not entered into any transaction with the firm but individually with one of the partners It was held that the Court had no jurisdiction to try the suit inasmuch as the leave originally granted related to a cause of action which had been completely changed <NAME> said as follows The cause of action which is a right to sue vested in six persons alleged to be doing business together is not the same as the right which exists in one individual The two causes of action being thus entirely different and no leave having been obtained when <NAME> the individual desired to carry on the suit this issue must be found against the plaintiff and the suit should therefore tie dismissed with costs Leave was obtained under Clause of the Letters Patent at the time of the institution of the suit The learned Judge said as follows The wording and meaning of Clause of the Letters Patent is clear namely that the <ORG> leave shall previously be obtained before it has jurisdiction to receive a suit for which leave is required An amendment to a plaint raising a new cause of action upon which a claim is made is not a fresh suit but is an additional claim made in an existing suit The <ORG> leave is previously required in respect of a cause of action before the <ORG> can have jurisdiction to receive the suit in which it is alleged In my opinion the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to receive try and determine the claims upon the causes of action in the amendment to the plaint since leave was not previously obtained in respect of those causes of action before the suit in which those claims are made was instituted in this <ORG> The learned Judge was no doubt referring to the fact that leave had not been asked for although required in respect of the amendment but he also distinctly held that an amendment to a plaint raising a new cause of action upon which a claim was made was not a fresh suit but was an additional claim made in an existing suit so that leave under Clause could not be granted at any stage subsequent to the institution of the suit In this case the plaintiff sued the defendant for partition joint family properties a part of which was situated outside jurisdiction so that the suit required leave under Clause which had been obtained It is now established that leave originally obtained at the time of the filing of a suit does not cover an amended plaint It is contended that there was no change in the cause of action Even so if new parties are joined against whom it intended to proceed in the suit and to obtain a decree the obtaining of the leave is imperative because it is the foundation of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> The <ORG> gets jurisdiction to decide the suit against the parties only if it grants leave which is condition precedent No leave was obtained to proceed against the newly added defendants and it follows that the <ORG> never get any jurisdiction to make any decree or order against them in the suit There is no doubt that according to the learned Judge when fresh parties are added it is permissible to the <ORG> to grant fresh leave According to Section Limitation Act where after institution of a suit a new plaintiff or defendant was substituted or added it not being a case of the assignment or devolution of interest during the pendency of the suit or transposition of a party the suit is to be regarded as against the added party to have been instituted when he is made a party Therefore the case of the addition of a party during the pendency of the suit stands on quite a different footing to the addition of a different cause of action against the same party The suit had been filed without any leave under Clause of the Letters Patent on Where leave under Clause of the Letters Patent is necessary the granting of such leave is the condition precedent to the <ORG> having jurisdiction to entertain the suit In such a case no amendment can be ordered if it requires leave to be granted under Clause of the Letters Patent at the time of the amendment It follows that leave under Clause of the Letters Patent cannot be granted in such a case at any stage after the institution of the original suit But where a new party is added the suit as regards the added party must be deemed to have been commenced on the date when he was so added In fact if such leave has not been asked for or obtained in such a case the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain the suit against such an added defendant
