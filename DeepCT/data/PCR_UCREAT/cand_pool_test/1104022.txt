No of are that the assessee had entered into an agreement with <NAME> Basle st Jan The assessee entered in another supplementary agreement on th July for manufacturing cyanuric chloride Under this agreement the assessee had to pay certain amounts in five equal instalments to <NAME> for acquiring technical know how The first payment in respect of which was made in financial year The assessee claimed deduction thereof as business expenditure of manufacturing cyanuric chloride commencing from financial year as a revenue expenditure However the amount claimed in each case is different We have heard the learned counsel for the parties The plant for manufacturing cyanuric chloride would not be discontinued even after the expiry of the period but continue to manufacture the same under the process already made known to the assessee inasmuch as there was no stipulation under the agreement either principal or supplementary that on termination of the agreement the assessee would discontinue the manufacture of cyanuric chloride On the other hand it was contended by the learned counsel for the assessee <NAME> that the technical know how acquired under the said agreement was operational cost for the running the business and the amount paid to the collaborator of technical know how was only paid for the use of the process developed by <ORG> or <ORG> for manufacturing cyanuric chloride in India and acquisition of right to use is distinct from acquisition to the right itself Mere right to use technical know how without having proprietary right therein cannot be considered capital in the hands of the assessee We have given careful consideration to the rival contentions Under of the IT Act all expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business or profession are to be allowed as deduction while computing the income provided the same are not in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee apart from the condition that the same may not be governed by any other express provision of the Act In the present case the only question that arises for consideration is other condition being satisfied that the expenses are wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business and are not governed by any other express provision whether the expenses claimed are of capital nature Test which was laid by Viscount <NAME> in the case of <ORG> Tax Cases I think that there is good reason in the absence of special circumstances leading to an opposite conclusion for treating such expenditure attributable not to revenue but to capital What is meant by expression once and for all The expression once and for all is used to denote an expenditure which is made once and for all for procuring an enduring benefit to the business as distinct from recurring expenditure in the nature of operational expenses If on the other hand it is made not for the purpose of bringing into existence any such asset or advantage for but for running the business or working it with a view to produce the profit it is a revenue expenditure <ORG> said that when dealing with cases of this kind where the question is whether expenditure incurred by an assessee is capital or revenue expenditure the question must be viewed in the larger context of business necessity or expediency If the outgoing expenditure is so related to the carrying on or the conduct of the business that it may be regarded as an integral part of profit earning process and not the acquisition of asset or right of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of carrying on business the expenditure may be regarded as revenue expenditure Under an agreement the <ORG> undertook to deliver to the assessee all processes formulae scientific data working rules and prescriptions pertaining to the manufacture or processing products discovered and developed in the <ORG> laboratories and to forward to the assessee as far as possible all scientific and bibliographic information pamphlets or drafts which might be useful to introduce the licensed preparation and to promote their sale in India it granted to the assessee full and sole rights and licence under patent listed in the agreement to make use of the same and also a licence to use certain specified trade marks in the territory subject to any existing licence to third parties held at the date of the agreement or the <ORG> may grant to third party thereafter The assessee acquired under the agreement merely the right to draw for the purpose of carrying on its business as a manufacturer and dealer of pharmaceutical products upon the technical knowledge of <ORG> for a limited period by making that technical knowledge available <ORG> did not part with any asset of its business nor did the assessee acquire any asset or advantage of an enduring nature for the benefit of its business Assessee claim for deduction of the sum paid to the Japanese company as revenue expenditure was disallowed by the <ORG> holding that the expenses were capital in nature Reversing the decision of <ORG> Hon ble Supreme Court observed that there was no material before the <ORG> to come to the finding that the appellant had obtained under the agreement a completely new plant with a completely new process and completely new technical know how There was no material before the <ORG> that the area of improvisation was not part of the existing business There was no material to hold that it amounted to a new or fresh venture Under the principal agreement clause the assessee was though free to purchase raw materials and intermediaries from any source but the purchase of products manufactured by <ORG> or from those who produce and manufacture raw material and intermediaries under the <ORG> patent there was a prohibition to purchase such raw material from any source manufacturing the intermediary products in violation of <ORG> patent Cyanuric chloride was one of the raw materials used in the manufacture of Tinopal which was consumed in large quantities If therefore applying the test laid down in <ORG> case supra which in our opinion does apply to the facts of the present case the assessee existing business was the business of manufacturing Tinopal the product which the assessee intended to manufacture namely cyanuric chloride was one of the raw materials which until it started manufacturing was being purchased in large quantities from the market the purpose of production of cyanuric chloride was found by the <ORG> to be the manufacture of raw material or production of Tinopal that is to say the purpose was in the area of existing business of the assessee for carrying on the existing business with more profitability and was not for the purposes of entering into a new adventure for operating in a new area of business If that be so the expenses incurred for acquiring the technical know how to manufacture raw material necessary for the principal product of the assessee to cut down the cost of producing raw materials from the market was the operational cost of the existing business incurred for the purpose of cutting down the day to day cost of the business and not for the purpose of installing a new business the expenses had to be held to be revenue in nature and not capital though we observe that the <ORG> was not correct in observing that there would be no useful knowledge left which would help the assessee in manufacturing cyanuric chloride after the agreement is concluded As a result of operation of clause which required the assessee to return <ORG> all documents put at the assessee disposal and relating to manufacturing of engineering plants designs etc The principle fully applies to the facts found by the <ORG> in the present case according to which the assessee had entered into an agreement on th July for manufacturing raw material for the purpose of production of Tinopal It had right only to use that knowledge for the purpose of manufacturing cyanuric chloride within India But it cannot be said that by such acquisition of knowledge the assessee has acquired any capital asset So far as question as to whether it amounts to acquisition of advantage benefit of enduring nature is concerned as we have already discussed it depends upon the object with which such advantage or benefit has been acquired As in the present case the finding of the <ORG> reveals that the advantage was acquired for the purpose of manufacturing raw material for production of Tinopal which was the existing business of the assessee we have no hesitation in coming to conclusion that the expenditure incurred was rightfully held to be on revenue account Accordingly we answer the question referred to us in affirmative in all the four cases in favour of the assessee and against the <ORG>
