They were also promoted to Junior Administrative Grade with effect from by reckoning their services from as one who has completed years of service is eligible for consideration for promotion to Junior Administrative Grade Aggrieved by this seniority list Respondent made a representation to the Chief Personnel Officer <ORG> Kapurthala Jullundur There was no challenge either to grant of increments in timescale to appellants and to and to a similar date to appellant who was to get Rs whereas appellants and to get Rs in Junior Scale Grade A If one looks at the Principles as approved by the President principle i is the seniority of officers appointed to various <ORG> Class shall be determined on the basis of the date for increment on time scale to be specifically determined in each case in accordance with these principles It is not an invariable rule that seniority should be determined only on the basis of the respective dates of appointment to the post and that any departure from it would be unreasonable and illegal Besides principle vii which is the relevant principle may be extracted for understanding its scope Principle vii In the case of Class II Officers permanently promoted to Class Services if two or more than two officers are promoted on the same date their relative seniority will be in the order of selection Subject to the aforesaid provisions the seniority of officers permanently promoted from Class to Class services shall be determined by giving weightage based on a the year of service connoted by the initial pay on permanent promotion to Class Service or half the total number of years of continuous service in Class II both officiating and permanent whichever is higher subject to a maximum weightage of five years Once this position becomes clear there is no difficulty in applying principle vii It will be noticed that there was no principle like principle vii in the service which this <ORG> was dealing with in that matter It is settled law that the appointing authority or the appropriate <ORG> can frame rules governing seniority which are reasonable keeping in mind the divergent claims that can be put forward by the various categories of the members of the service It is however necessary that there should be no discrimination that is persons placed in the same group must be treated similarly and further that any principle which is made the basis of determination of seniority should if applicable to others be applied to them also In other words if seniority is to depend purely upon the date of confirmation or the date of appointment that rule should be applicable to all but if the promotees and special recruits are being given weightage the principles applicable to the members of the service should be kept in mind while determining the weightage to be given or while laying down rules for determination of seniority This Court took the view that the rule contained in clauses and of Rule was a mean between these extreme views and was regarded to be just and fair There are similar principles for determination of seniority between promotees and direct recruits to <ORG> Those rules also contemplate an order of allotment being given to a promotee which may be much earlier to his actual induction in <ORG> when he was still in <ORG> and weightage was given to the year of allotment for purposes of seniority Learned counsel for respondent submitted that these very appellants had earlier appeared in the present Class Service but had not qualified and were selected only for Class Service and when Respondent was selected for Class Service the appellants were still in Class Service We are afraid this argument has no merit once we uphold first the principle of seniority and second the provision for grant of weightage For the aforesaid reasons the appeal is allowed and the impugned order of <ORG> Principal Bench New Delhi dated is set aside
