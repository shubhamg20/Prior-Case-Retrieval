Whether Reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the Judgment No Whether the judgment should be reported in the digest Yes JUDGMENT <NAME> The present appeal is filed by an unsuccessful defendant in a suit for possession and mesne profits filed by the two respondents herein in respect of House no Pocket Block Sector Rohini Delhi hereinafter referred to as the suit property for setting aside the judgment and decree dated th March passed by the Additional District Judge whereby she has been directed to vacate the first floor of the suit property and also to pay mesne profits Rs The relevant facts as culled out from the pleadings and evidence of the parties documents on record as well as the submissions made before this Court by the counsel for the parties may first be noticed According to the plaintiffs the defendant had no legal right to stay in the suit property which was their exclusive property having been acquired from <ORG> by plaintiff no <NAME> from his own funds and constructed also from his own money and the loan taken by him from his employer and that it was only out of love for his wife that he had got her name also included in the perpetual lease deed executed by <ORG> It was further pleaded that the defendant in their absence took possession of the ground floor and second floors also taking advantage of their having shifted to Gurgaon Hence the suit was filed by the plaintiffs on against the defendant for getting back the possession of the suit property from her Regarding the claim of the plaintiffs that they were the exclusive owners of the suit property her stand was that the suit property belonged to an Hindu Undivided Family <ORG> and her husband being one of the members of that <ORG> she and her children had a right to reside in the property in their occupation She denied the allegation that she had unauthorisedly occupied the ground and second floors also She claimed that the ground floor had been locked by the plaintiffs themselves and as far as second floor is concerned she stated that since entry to that floor was through the first floor portion she was going to the second floor only to keep that portion clean In the replication the plaintiffs while reiterating their case set out in the plaint pleaded that even the children born out of the wedlock between their son <NAME> and the defendant had no right to remain in the suit property PW was in the joint names of the plaintiffs and it shows that the plaintiffs had been given the land on perpetual lease for a sum of Rs The Court also relied upon the admission made by the defendant regarding the ownership of the plaintiffs in respect of the suit property in a civil suit for injunction which she had filed before the filing the present suit by the plaintiffs I heard the arguments advanced by <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant and <NAME> learned counsel for the respondents and during the course of hearing of the appeal both of them also took me through the evidence adduced by the parties during the trial of the suit oral as well as documentary On the other hand <NAME> learned counsel for the respondents while not disputing the fact that the plaintiffs alongwith their two sons two daughters in law and two grand children were living in the suit property as a joint family when there were no disputes between the defendant and their son <NAME> but simply for that reason it could not be inferred that the suit property was a joint family property It was submitted that there was no presumption that if members of a joint Hindu family reside together in some property which stands in the name of one of the family members would automatically become the joint family property of each member of the joint family It was also submitted that in order to shift the burden to the plaintiffs to show that the suit property was their self acquired property the defendant had to show that there was some joint family nucleus with the aid of which the plot of land in question could be purchased or construction thereon could be raised with that nucleus but the defendant had miserably failed to establish that It was also contended that if at all the defendant wanted the Court to take notice of that legislation as a subsequent development taking place after the filing of the written statement by her and before the disposal of the suit that could be done only if there was necessary foundation laid in the written statement by alleging facts therein which according to her entitled her to get some benefit available under the said Act of but shes did not lay any foundation in her written statement by seeking necessary amendment in the written statement and so she cannot be allowed to make any submissions based on the provisions of the said Act In these circumstances it was rightly submitted by the learned counsel for the plaintiffs that the burden rested on the shoulders of the defendant to show to the contrary that despite the perpetual lease deed being in the names of the plaintiffs the suit property in fact belonged to the joint family of the plaintiffs and their two sons Whether the evidence adduced by the plaintiff was sufficient to shift the burden which initially rested on him of establishing that there was adequate nucleus out of which the acquisitions could have been made is one of fact depending on the nature and the extent of the nucleus On the other hand a running business in which the capital invested is comparatively small might conceivably produce substantial income which may well form the foundation of the subsequent acquisitions In cross examination of plaintiff no who is the only witness from the side of the plaintiffs it could be extracted from him that before the construction of the suit property he was residing in a house in Gurgaon which belonged to his father and he also stated that that was the only house which his father had left He further stated that he and his brothers and sisters had given that house to the widow of one of their brothers However there is no evidence adduced by the plaintiffs except the ipse dixit of plaintiff no that he had acquired the suit land and constructed the suit property with his own money to discharge the burden which stood shifted on their shoulders because of the admission of existence of an ancestral property in which the plaintiff no had a share PW to the effect that he had been given loan of Rs in the year but its contents cannot be said to have been established in the absence of anybody from this Company coming to the Court to prove its correctness and to be cross examined by the defendant There is no doubt that in her suit for permanent injunction the defendant had claimed that the suit property was owned by her in laws the two plaintiffs here but that admission cannot come in her way in getting justice in this case because of her having been able to establish in the present suit the facts which show that the suit property was a joint family property even though it was recorded in the perpetual lease deed in the names of the two plaintiffs only and which fact appears to have led her earlier to believe that they were the only owners It is held that the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the suit property was their self acquisition in which their sons had no right or interest and in view of the foregoing discussion the conclusion of this <ORG> is that the same was a joint family property in the hands of the plaintiffs It was suggested to the defendant in her cross examination on behalf of the plaintiffs that her husband also had no right to stay in their house and even their children had no right to remain in occupation of their property During the course of arguments this <ORG> asked the learned counsel for the plaintiffs as to why the defendant husband had not been sued by his parents to get back the possession of the portion of their house which they had permitted him to occupy as a permissive user and when the plaintiffs themselves were claiming that even he had no right to stay in their property Counsel reply was that this aspect need not be gone into because the defendant had not taken any objection regarding the non joinder of her husband in her written statement and even in appeal no such objection was raised on her behalf by her counsel during the course of arguments and secondly the plaintiffs were not required to implead him since he had already vacated the first floor had shifted to <ORG> before the filing of the present suit and only his wife and two minor children had continued to stay there and had become unauthorised occupants and suit could be filed against the defendant alone as the children were minors they also need not have been impleaded separately when their mother was a party It was also submitted that a plaintiff being dominus litus can sue someone against whom he has to claim any relief through the process of law and he cannot be compelled to sue anybody whom he does not wish to sue or against whom no relief is to be claimed as is the position in the present case where the plaintiffs do not want any relief against their son <NAME> because of his having already vacated the house and shifted to a separate house Unless the plaintiffs get a declaration against their own son <NAME> that he having failed to put them in possession of their property by moving out of the first floor of their property alongwith his family despite revocation of the permission which they had given to him to stay on the first floor they were entitled to get him and his family evicted through a decree of the Court they cannot claim that the occupation of their daughter in law <NAME> was unauthorised In my view the defendant husband was certainly a necessary party and in fact the suit should have been filed only against him and if an order of eviction had been passed against him that would have bound his wife also because she is not claiming any independent right In that case one of the points under consideration was as to what is meant by the expression matrimonial home and it was observed that In other words the matrimonial home is the domicile where persons live together actually or constructively as man and wife I however do not find any substance in this submission also of the learned counsel for the plaintiffs that since the husband of the defendant had shifted to <ORG> before the filing of this suit he was not required to be sued Any precedent much less of a binding authority from any Court in India and dealing with a situation as we are called upon to deal with is not available Lord <NAME> states in The Due Process of Law London <ORG> at page A wife is no longer her husband chattel She is beginning to be regarded by the laws as a partner in all affairs which are their common concern Thus the husband can no longer turn her out of the matrimonial home Moreover it has been held that the wife right is effective not only as against her husband but also as against the landlord RFA Page of As in this case he left the house in a dispute with his wife and his wife and child remained in occupation of the house with the use of his furniture and he continued to pay rent that where a husband had deserted his wife and the wife remained in the matrimonial home she was lawfully there and the husband remained in occupation through her RFA Page of Having been deserted by the tenant husband she cannot be deprived of the roof over her head where the tenant has conveniently left her to face the peril of eviction attributable to default or neglect of himself We are inclined to hold and we do so that a deserted wife continuing in occupation of the premises obtained on lease by her husband and which was their matrimonial home occupies a position akin to that of an heir of the tenant husband if the right to residence of such wife has not come to an end The tenant having lost interest in protecting his tenancy rights as available to him under the law the same right would devolve upon and inhere in the wife so long as she continues in occupation of the premises A suitable amendment in the legislation is called for to that effect And so long as that is not done we responding to the demands of social and gender justice need to mould the relief and do complete justice by exercising our jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution We hasten to add that the purpose of our holding as above is to give the wife right to residence a meaningful efficacy as dictated by the needs of the times we do not intend nor do we propose the landlord right to eviction against his tenant to be subordinated to wife right to residence enforceable against her husband Since <ORG> conclusion holding the defendant to be an unauthorised occupant of the st floor of the suit property is not being sustained the decree passed against the defendant holding her liable to pay mesne profits for her continuing to occupy the st floor also has to be set aside Where an inquiry is directed under clause or clause a final decree in respect of the rent or mesne profits shall be passed in accordance with the result of such inquiry With regard to the past <ORG> profits a plaintiff has an existing cause of action on the date of the institution of the suit in view of Order The plaintiff must plead this cause of action specifically claim a decree for the past <ORG> profits value the claim approximately and pay court fees thereon With regard to future <ORG> profits the plaintiff has no cause of action on the date of the institution of the suit and it is not possible for him to plead this cause of action or to value it or to pay court fees thereon at the time of the institution of the suit But in a suit to which the provisions of Order apply the <ORG> has a discretionary power to pass a decree directing an enquiry into the future <ORG> profits From the foregoing it is clear that as far as the grant of mesne profits damages for use and occupation for the period prior to the institution of a suit for possession is concerned the <ORG> may either pass a decree for mesne profits damages which have already accrued prior to institution of the suit provided the plaintiff has brought on record sufficient material to enable the <ORG> to ascertain the damages And in case there is no sufficient material available with the <ORG> for calculating the mesne profits damages the <ORG> has the discretion to direct an enquiry for that purpose and thereafter depending upon the result of the enquiry final decree for mesne profits damages can be passed
