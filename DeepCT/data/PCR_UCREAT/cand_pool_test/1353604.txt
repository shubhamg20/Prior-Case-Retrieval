There was also a prayer in the writ petition for a direction to the State of Maharashtra to comply with the provisions of Article of the Constitution in appointing judge of <ORG> Prior to the qualifications of a person to be appointed as a judge to of <ORG> under the Industrial Disputes Act as laid down in Section were as follows a that he was or had been a judge of <ORG> or that he ad for a period of not less than three years been a District Judge or an Additional District Judge or that he had held the office of the Chairman or any other Member of <ORG> or of any <ORG> for a period of not less than two years of that he had held any judicial office in India for not less than seven years or that he had been the Presiding Officer of <ORG> constituted under any provincial Act for not less than five years The amended sub section of Section provides as follows A person shall not be qualified for appointment as the presiding officer of <ORG> unless a he had held any judicial office in India for not less than five years or he had practised as an Advocate or Attorney for not less than seven years in <ORG> or any Court subordinate thereto or in any Industrial Court constituted under any law for the time being in force or he holds a degree in law of a University established by law in any part of India and is holding or has held an office not lower in rank than that of Deputy Registrar of any such <ORG> or of Assistant Commissioner of Labour under <ORG> in both cases for not less than five years There is not much difficulty in holding that <ORG> performs judicial functions and is a <ORG> It had the power of ordering discovery inspection etc and forcing the attendance of witnesses Applying the test laid down in the case of <NAME> <NAME> at this Court said that a true judicial decision presupposes an existence of dispute between two or more parties and then involves for requisites the presentation of their case by the parties ascertainment of facts by means of evidence adduced by the parties often with the assistance of argument if the dispute relates to a question of law submission of legal arguments the parties an decision which disposes of the whole matter by findings on fact and application of law to facts so found judged by the same tests <ORG> would undoubtedly be a court in the true sense of the term The structure of civil courts exercising original jurisdiction is no longer monolithic The judge of <ORG> heading the concerned set of courts under him an exercising that jurisdiction can also fall in the category of a District Judge by whatever name called Learned single judge and learned Judges of <ORG> have therefor held hat and Industrial Court is a civil court exercising civil original jurisdiction and the person presiding over it could well be termed as a District Judge Under the Higher Judicial Service Rules Judicial Officers were eligible for appointment as District Judges and the expression was meant to cover members of the executive department who discharged some revenue and magisterial duties also In so interpreting judicial service in contra distinction to executive service where some executive officers may also be performing judicial or quasi judicial functions this <ORG> was at pains to emphasis the Constitutional scheme for independence of the judiciary This <ORG> therefore defined judicial officers discharging entirely judicial duties AIR SC this Court observed that the intention of the <ORG> in framing Section prior to amendment of the Industrial Disputes Act was that men who could be described as independent and with sufficiency judicial experience must be selector as <ORG> Judges We need not refer at length to various other judgment which have dealt with the question whether a <ORG> set up under different Acts which were before the <ORG> in each case was a judicial body or a court and whether it was a court subordinate to the High <ORG> AIR Bombay the term courts was held to cover all tribunals which were basically courts performing judicial functions giving judgments which were binding and exercising sovereign judicial power transferred tot hem by the <ORG> In <NAME> case supra his <ORG> was primarily concerned with excluding from judicial service persons who held posts in services which were not exclusively judicial When the service is exclusively judicial there is no reason to exclude such judicial service from that term under Article The High <ORG> in the present case is justified in rejecting the narrow view taken in that judgment Therefore in order to qualify for appointment as judge of <ORG> a person must hold a judicial office which must be a part of the judicial service of the <ORG> supra this court said that the term judicial office in its generic sense may include a wide variety of offices which are connected with the administration of justice in one way or the other Officers holding various posts under the executive are often vested with magisterial power to meet a particular situations The Court said Did the framers of the Constitution have this type of officers in mind when they provided a source of appointment to the high officer of a judge of <ORG> from amongst the holders of a judicial office The answer has to be in the negative The <ORG>s have also been held as subject to <ORG> power of superintendence under Article Thus Article which deals with appointment of District judges requires that such appointments shall be made by the Governor of the <ORG> in consultation with <ORG> Article which deals with recruitment of persons other that District Judges to the judicial service requires that their appointments can be made only in accordance with the Rules framed the Governor of the <ORG> after consultation with the <ORG> Public Service Commission and with <ORG> Article provides that he control over district courts and courts subordinate thereto shall be vested in <ORG> and Article defines the expression District Judge extensively as covering judges of a city civil court etc as earlier set out and the expression judicial service as meaning a service consisting exclusively of persons intended to fill the post of the District Judge and other civil judicial posts inferior to the post of District judge <ORG> has rightly come to the conclusion that the persons presiding over <ORG> would constitute a judicial service so defined
