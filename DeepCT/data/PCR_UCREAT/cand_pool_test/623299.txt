The company did not appeal but the appellants came to this <ORG> by special leave The following contentions were raised on behalf of the appellants The tribunal had no jurisdiction to proceed with the proceedings on the petition presented by the <ORG> without the leave of the <ORG> in view of of the Companies Act the <ORG> having been ordered to be wound up the <ORG> on November In view of a of the I Act none of the provisions of the Act applied to the company and therefore the <ORG> could not proceed on the application of the <ORG> subsequent to the company being wound up The transfer of Rs It is in view of the exclusive jurisdiction conferred upon the company court in sub of of the Companies Act to entertain and dispose of any suit or proceeding by or against a company which is being wound up that provision has been made in subs of that section that no suit or proceeding shall be filed or if pending proceeded with against such a company without permission having been taken from the <ORG> It could not be disputed that the <ORG> was empowered to try the <ORG> application under and the <ORG> <ORG> therefore had no jurisdiction to entertain or decide it But the question of the applicability of the Act to a particular insurer is to be considered in relation to facts existing at the time when the Act came into force i July or on the appointed day i September when the assets and liabilities of the controlled insurer of the company stood transferred and vested in the <ORG> There was no such surplus in <ORG> at the time when the sum was transferred from it <ORG> It had to maintain <ORG> in connection with its life insurance business in view of subject to the condition that <ORG> would not be liable to pay any interest thereon and that no repayment of the lcan would be made except out of the valuation surplus of <ORG> There was thus a surplus as Rs It came into force from that day which was called the appointed day Section provides that the <ORG> may apply for relief to the <ORG> in respect of a transaction which is made by the insurer whose controlled business had been transferred to and vested in the <ORG> under the Act at any time within years before January and by which the composite insurer has transferred any property from his life department to his general department without consideration or for an inadequate consideration and the transfer was not reasonably necessary for the purpose of the controlled business of the insurer or was made with an unreasonable lack of prudence on the part of the insurer regard being had in either case to the circumstances at the time Section provided for the payment of compensation to the insurer whose Controlled business had been transferred to and vested in the <ORG> under the Act Section provided for the constitution of <ORG>s which were empowered by sub to regulate their own procedure and decide all matters within their competence Section provided that no civil <ORG> would have jurisdiction to entertain or adjudicate upon any matter which a <ORG> was empowered to decide or determine under the Act Section inter alia provided that nothing contained in the Act would apply in relation to any insurer whose business was being voluntarily wound up or was being wound up under orders of the <ORG> It was therefore that it prayed inter alia for a decree against the respondents for a sum of Rs The fourth point sought to be urged was that the provisions of of the LIC Act were ultra rites as they contravened the provisions of Arts inter alia that the <ORG> which is winding up the company shall notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force have jurisdiction to entertain or dispose of any suit or proceeding and any claim made by or against the company In this connection reference may be made to of the LIC Act which provides that no civil Court shall have jurisdiction to entertain or adjudicate upon any matter which a <ORG> is empowered to decide or determine under that Act It is not disputed that the <ORG> had jurisdiction to entertain the application of the <ORG> and adjudicate on the matters raised thereby It is in view of the exclusive jurisdiction which sub of of the Companies Act confers on <ORG> to entertain or dispose of any suit or proceeding by or against a company or any claim made by or against it that the restriction referred to in sub has been imposed on the commencement of the proceedings or proceeding with such proceedings against a company after a winding up order has been made In view of of the LIC Act <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate upon any matter which the <ORG> is empowered to decide or determine under that Act It is not disputed that the <ORG> has jurisdiction under the Act to entertain and decide matters raised in the petition filed by the <ORG> under of the LIC Act It is however contended for the appellants that in view of a of the LIC Act will not apply to the company whose business was being wound up under orders of <ORG> and that therefore the provisions of of the Companies Act will affect the proceedings before the <ORG> The question of the applicablity of the Act to a particular insurer is to be considered in relation to facts existing when the Act came into force In view of of the LIC Act it will not apply to an insurer whose business is being wound up under orders of <ORG> at the time when that Act came into force in or on the appointed day i September The company was not being wound up under orders of the <ORG> on July when the Act came into force or on the appointed day mentioned earlier We now come to the third point raised for the appellants We agree with the <ORG> that the amounts of Rs Section hewever deals with any deposit and provides that where a deposit is made in respect of life insurance business the deposit made in respect thereof shall not be available for the discharge of any liability of the insurer other than liabilities arising out of policies of life insurance issued by the insurer It makes no difference to the company how it distributed its funds so long as its statutory liabilities were satisfied The expression valuation surplus has a technical meaning under the Act The abstract is to be certified on behalf of the insurer to the effect that full and effective particulars of every policy under which there is a liability either actual or contingent have been furnished to the actuary for the purpose of investigation Reliance in this connection is placed on behalf of the appellants on the letter of the actuary dated July Thus there is a surplus of Rs being the amount of appreciation on investments taken into account by you in the past two years There is nothing on the record to show that any abstract in Form I Fourth Schedule was prepared and submitted to the Controller
