Notice was issued to his son under of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act and after hearing him the Deputy Custodian declared the house to be evacuee property The respondent who was the wife of the evacuee and on whom the notice under of the Act was not served started proceedings before the Custodian claiming that the owner of the house had executed a will bequeathing the property to her and so the property could not be declared evacuee property When she failed before the authorities constituted under the Act she filed a suit in the civil court basing her case on the will and prayed for a permanent injunction restraining the authorities under the Act from evicting her from the house On the question whether the suit in the civil court was maintainable <ORG> held that the question whether a certain person had or had not become an evacuee was determinable only by the authorities under the Act but the determination of a complicated question of law relating to title by such authorities if such a question arose was not final and could be reopened in the civil court that the suit in the present case did raise such a question and therefore the civil court had jurisdiction to entertain it In appeal to this Court HELD Two questions will arise in every case where the authority has to declare under of the Act whether a property is evacuee property namely i whether a particular person has or has not become an evacuee and ii whether the property in dispute belongs to him There is nothing in the section which shows that the authority under the Act being a quasi judicial authority cannot enter into all questions whether of fact or law simple or complicated in deciding whether certain property belongs to an evacuee nor does his jurisdiction depend upon a correct finding on a collateral fact The power to decide all these questions could not be denied on the ground that the authority under may not be an experienced judicial officer because his decision is not final and is open to appeal under and to revision under by authorities who are experienced judicial officers The question whether the civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure not decided The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> In this appeal by special leave the only ques tion that arises is the interpretation of of the Administration of Evacuee Property Act No of hereinafter referred to as the Act Thereafter notice was issued under of the Act to <NAME> son of <NAME> to show cause why the house be not declared as evacuee property No notice was however issued to respondent <NAME> No appeal was taken against this order which thus became final However on March the respondent filed an application before the <NAME> claiming that by virtue of a will made in her favour by <NAME> in he had bequeathed the house to her and therefore she was the owner of the entire property It seems that thereafter the respondent made some representations to the then <ORG> but it is not known what happened thereto He therefore held that only seven eighths share of the house became evacuee property and one eighth share of the respondent was not evacuee property In the meantime the suit out of which the present appeal has arisen was filed by the respondent on March The suit was dismissed on December by the trial court holding that the civil court had no jurisdiction to decide the matter in the face of of the Act The respondent then went in appeal to the Additional District Judge The Additional District Judge held relying on certain decisions of <ORG> that civil courts had no jurisdiction to entertain a suit of this nature and therefore dismissed the appeal The respondent then went in second appeal to <ORG> The learned Single Judge who first heard the appeal referred it for decision to a larger Bench The matter then went before a Division Bench which noticed that there was some conflict between certain decisions of <ORG> and therefore referred the matter to a larger Bench In consequence a Bench of three Judges was constituted to decide whether civil courts had jurisdiction in such a case question they were of the view that it might involve a simple question of fact or a complicated question of law i a question of title The limited the above decision by observing that a mere assertion of claim to any property did not raise a question of title for such assertion might rest on a simple allegation of fact which could be finally determined by the Custodian and that the question whether in a particular case a question of title did or did not properly arise had to be decided on the facts of each case and no general rule about it could be usefully laid down On this view of the law they held that in the particular case before them a complicated question of law arose and therefore the suit was competent and the civil courts had jurisdiction to entertain it Thereupon the appellant obtained special leave from this Court and that is how the matter has come before us That is the reason why <ORG> three Judges was constituted to go into the matter and we have already set out their decision of the Constitution and jurisdiction of civil courts about entertaining civil suits in matters of this kind Whatever may be the interpretation of to which we shall address ourselves presently the jurisdiction As is well known the Act had to be passed in order to deal with the enormous problem which arose on the division of the Punjab and large scale migration that took place from one side of the Punjab as it was before to the other side It was to deal with this problem that the Act was passed though we may add that there were earlier laws dealing with the same matter which were all repealed by the Act wherever it was extended Section of the Act which is important provides that the provisions of this Act and of the rules and orders made thereunder shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any such law Sections and provide for appointment of Custodian General Deputy Custodian General and Assistant Custodian General Custodian Additional Custodian Deputy Custodian and Assistant Custodian whose duty it is to administer the Act It is clear in view of the definition of evacuee property to which we have already referred that two questions will arise in every case where the Custodian has to declare whether a property is evacuee property Section gives power to the Custodian to take possession of evacuee property vested in him Section provides for powers and duties of the Custodian generally Then follow certain sec tions which give special powers to the <NAME> with respect to the management of the property to which it is unnecessary to refer Section inter alia gives a right to a person aggrieved by an order made under by the <NAME> to appeal Section gives power of revision to the <NAME> General either on his own motion or on application made to him to call for the record of any proceeding in order to satisfy himself as to the legality or propriety of any order passed therein and to pass such order in relation thereto as he thinks fit Sec tion which is also important reads thus Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Chapter every order made by the Custodian General Custodian Additional Custodian Authorised Deputy Custodian Deputy Custodian or Assistant Custodian shall be final and shall not be called in question in any court by way of appeal or revision or in any original suit application or execution proceeding Section thus clearly bars the jurisdiction of any court to entertain an original suit with respect to an order passed by the authorities mentioned therein Section with which we are particularly concerned is in these terms Save as otherwise expressly provided in this Act no civil or revenue court shall have jurisdiction a to entertain or adjudicate upon any question whether any property or any right to or interest in any property is or is not evacuee property or to question the legality of any action taken by the Custodian General or the Custodian under this Act or in respect of any matter which the Custodian General or the Custodian is empowered by or under this Act to determined A bare reading of shows how widely it is worded and how clearly it bars the jurisdiction of civil and revenue courts in matters specified therein The Act itself provides a machinery for determining what properties are evacuee properties Section is that provision which gives power to the <NAME> to determine what properties are evacuee properties Then we have the provision of appeal under and revision under of the Act so that any person aggrieved by the order of the <NAME> has two forums open to him to ventilate his grievance Thus all persons interested get a hearing under and all persons aggrieved have a right of appeal under and can go in revision under That is why provides that every order made by the authorities indicated therein shall be final and shall not to be called in question in any court by way of appeal revision or in any original suit application or execution proceeding The legislature was not however satisfied merely by giving finality to the orders of the authorities mentioned in it went on to bar specifically the jurisdiction of civil and revenue courts in three matters indicated in If he comes to the conclusion that the property belongs to that person he declares the property to be evacuee property Now there is nothing in which shows that the <NAME> cannot enter into all questions whether of fact or of law in deciding whether certain property belongs to an evacuee There is no reason to hold that under the <NAME> cannot decide what are called complicated questions of law or questions of title If he has the power to decide ques tions of fact which the learned Judges in the order under appeal seem to concede we do not see why he should not have the power of deciding questions of law also His power under is to decide whether certain property is evacuee property or not and there is nothing in which restricts that power to deciding only questions of fact If he makes a mistake the two higher authorities who we are told have always been recruited from experienced judicial officers can correct him It is after the matter has been decided under and if an appeal is filed and under if a revision is filed that gives finality to orders of the authorities mentioned therein and lays down that such orders shall not be called in question in any court by way of appeal or revision or in any original suit application or execution proceeding It may be added that the only question to be decided under is whether the property is evacuee property or not and the jurisdiction of the Custodian to decide this question does not depend upon any finding on a collateral fact Therefore there is no scope for the application of that line of cases where it has been held that where the jurisdiction of a tribunal of limited jurisdiction depends upon first finding certain state of facts it cannot give itself jurisdiction on a wrong finding of that state of fact This conclusion is reinforced by the provision contained in of the Act which provides that the Act overrides other laws and would thus override of the Code of Civil Procedure on a combined reading of ss At however <NAME> made the following observations There is however one thing about which I am not quite clear But does the finality amount to an I adjudication on title in case there is any dispute Take for instance the case where a property is declared to be evacuee property on the assumption that it be That was a case which arose on a writ petition and observed that it was well settled that even if jurisdiction of courts is excluded civil courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal has not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure We do not think it necessary to go into that question in the present appeal for no such facts have been alleged in the present suit which would bring it within the ratio of the decision in <NAME> Co case Normally jurisdiction of civil courts to entertain or adjudicate upon such question relating to evacuee property would be barred under the question whether in some extreme circumstances civil courts may have jurisdiction inspite of need not be decided just now <NAME> as he then was rightly held that under the whole matter has to be decided by the Custodian and there was no question of the decision of any collateral fact as a condition precedent to assumption of jurisdiction by the Custodian We therefore allow the appeal and hold that in the view we have taken the suit was not maintainable in the civil court
