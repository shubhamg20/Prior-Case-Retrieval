This decree was reversed by the Subordinate Judge on the ground that under Section Sub section of the Bengal Tenancy Act the defendants must be presumed to be ryots with a right of occupancy and therefore under Section Sub section the right had merged in their superior right as proprietors and that no rent could be claimed by the plaintiff therefor and he accordingly allowed the appeal and dismissed the plaintiff suit It is contended in second appeal that <ORG> is wrong in law in its interpretation of Sections and of the Bengal Tenancy Act and in reply to that the respondent has endeavoured to support the decree of <ORG> by showing that there is no legal evidence of the purchase of the jote by the defendants and of their possession in pursuance of it We think it is impossible to say that there is absolutely no evidence of the purchase although in our opinion that evidence is extremely slight and had we to decide the point upon the evidence we might have come to a different conclusion but there being some sort of evidence the lower <ORG> were justified in finding as a fact that the defendants had purchased the jote and we cannot interfere with that finding of fact Then as regards the other point raised by the appellant it appears to us that whether or not the jote was an occupancy holding Section Sub section of the Bengal Tenancy Act does not operate to prevent the landlord from recovering the rent of the holding Sub section runs as follows If the occupancy right in land is transferred to a person jointly interested in the land as proprietor or permanent tenure holder it shall cease to exist but nothing in this sub section shall prejudicially affect the rights of any third person The third person mentioned in the clause must be held to include every person interested other than the transferor and transferee That being so the decree of <ORG> must be reversed and that of the first <ORG> restored with costs in both the Appellate <ORG>s
