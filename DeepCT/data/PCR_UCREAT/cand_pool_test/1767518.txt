We need only say that there is a preponderance of evidence including that of an European Sergeant whom we have no reason for distrusting to the effect that the <ORG> in proceeded so far as to take out the plaintiff clothe from the shelves of his shop and began to measure them when the plaintiff who had heard by then of what had happened paid the amount of the claim No doubt there was not in our opinion a completed attachment by seizure of any of the plaintiff property but that is not material For the claim as stated in the plaint is generally in respect of the acts done and not expressly or exclusively in respect of a completed attachment and there is in our opinion no doubt that the plaintiff may be entitled to compensation even though the attachment was not completed if notwithstanding that he sustained injury by what was actually done It is not shown that the defend ants choice of the <ORG> in which they brought their suit was in any way unreasonable The plaintiff resort to the <ORG> instead of to the defendants for a loan is explained by the admitted fact that the defendants had refused to advance him more than they had already done The sixth defendant witness no doubt speaks to the purchase of property by the plaintiff in his wife name and it may be true that he did so or that even though he purchased the property in his wife name it was intended to be at his own disposal In these circumstances there is nothing to justify the allegation in Exhibit XV and it was as the plaintiff must have known clearly untrue There is also a statement in Exhibit XV that plaintiff in consequence of his knowledge of the preparation of the plaint executed documents in respect of which properties in the names of others also although there is no evidence whatever and no sort of attempt has been made to justify this It is a fair presumption whish there is nothing to rebut that the defendants actually did what they did in order to secure for the satisfaction of their own debt the money of whish the plaintiff had become possessed Taking that as their motive and having regard also to the unjustifiable character of the allegations in the affidavit we have no hesitation in finding differing on this point from the lower Court that they acted not merely without reasonable and probable cause of setting the law in motion but also maliciously Before dealing with the question of damages we consider an argument advanced by Mr <NAME> that the plaintiff bad no cause of action because he did not allege in his plaint that the proceeding by which he was aggrieved had ended in his favour and because it never in fast did so end The fasts are that the proceeding or the application for and the lower <ORG> conditional order of attachment under Order XXXVIII Rule came to an end as the plaintiff paid the amount of fie defendant claim and the warrant wag returned to the <ORG> with the endorsement by the first defendant that the matter of the plaint having now been settled there is no necessity for attachment It does not appear from the record what happened to the suit but as the amount of the defendants had been paid it either has been or should have been dismissed As regards the failure to mansion the result of the proceedings in the plaint it need only be said that no objection was taken with reference to it at the trial and that if such an objection were pressed before us in appeal we should meet it by allowing an amendment As regards the more substantial objection that the proceedings are not shown to have terminated in plaintiff favour and that they could not be regarded as having so terminated so long as the order for conditional attachment was not discbarged at his instance or otherwise we observe first that it would be quite useless for him to obtain such a discharge when his creditor himself had informed the <ORG> as he did by the endorsement on Exhibit XVI and elsewhere that the attachment need not be processed I with because the matter had been settled On the broad question whether the termination of the proceedings in the plaintiff favour is essential there is no doubt abundant authority that it is so but such authority is applicable only to eases in whish a distinct termination in favour of one party or other is possible and not to a case such as that before us in whish the proceedings cannot end by their nature in any judicial disposal and in fast have been terminated by an act of the first defendant himself There is practically no evidence of value as to any detriment to his credit or position generally owing to the defendants action Lastly there is the evidence of an apparently respectable gentleman plaintiffs fifth witness that the plaintiffs credit had suffered with costs thereon throughout The plaintiff will pay the defendants their costs throughout not on the whole amount in respect of which the suit was filed but in the circumstances of the case on Rs
