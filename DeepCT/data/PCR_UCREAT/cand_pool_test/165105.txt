<ORG> however in exercise of its power conferred upon it under Section of the said Act directed that the said undertakings shall instead of continuing to vest in <ORG> vest in <ORG> a <ORG> An appeal thereagainst was filed before this Court marked as Civil Appeal No of and by an order dated the judgment of <ORG> was set aside and the matter was remitted to <ORG> on the ground that several other contentious issues have been raised Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant and Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the <ORG> inter alia raised the following contentions i Having regard to the scheme of the Act if a public purpose is established the declaration made would be conclusive in terms of Section of the Act in respect of both the need and the public purpose ii In view of the provision contained in Section iv of the Act the Respondents could not contend that the purpose for which the notification under Section of the Act was issued was not public purpose iii Once the owner of the land has been given an opportunity to file his objections which were considered by the Collector and if the recommendation made by him is accepted by the Government the owner is not entitled to be afforded any further opportunity of hearing vi Even if the acquisition has the effect of nullifying a decree passed by a civil court the same would not be a ground for quashing the acquisition proceedings Dr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the First Respondent would on the other hand submit i Although the Act is an imperial legislation it has essentially three broad components a The acquisition for a public purpose The main question which fell for its consideration before <ORG> was whether the objections raised by the Appellant objecting to the acquisition of land on various grounds have been considered by the Government Indisputably the definition of public purpose is of wide amplitude and takes within its sweep the acquisition of land for a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> as envisaged under Sub clause iv of Clause of Section of the Act But when the decision making process itself is in question the power of judicial review can be exercised by the court in the event the order impugned suffers from well known principles viz Moreover when a statutory authority exercises such enormous power it must be done in a fair and reasonable manner It is trite that hearing given to a person must be an effective one and not a mere formality At this stage it is relevant to notice that the limited right given to an owner person interested under Section A of the Act to object to the acquisition proceedings is not an empty formality and is a substantive right which can be taken away for good and valid reason and within the limitations prescribed under Section of the Act The legislature has therefore made complete provisions for the persons interested to file objections against the proposed acquisition and for the disposal of their objections It is only in cases of urgency that special powers have been conferred on the appropriate Government to dispense with the provisions of Section A Such an opportunity of being heard is necessary to be granted with a view to show that the purpose for which the acquisition proceeding is sought to be made is not a public purpose as also the suitability of land therefor Indeed natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular law where a spiritual touch enlivens legislation administration and adjudication to make fairness a creed of life It has many colours and shades many forms and shapes and save where valid law excludes it applies when people are affected by acts of authority It is the hone of healthy government recognised from earliest times and not a mystic testament of judge made law Indeed from the legendary days of <NAME> and of <NAME> <NAME> the rule of law has had this stamp of natural justice which makes it social justice We need not go into these deeps for the present except to indicate that the roots of natural justice and its foliage are noble and not new fangled Today its application must be sustained by current legislation case law or other extant principle not the hoary chords of legend and history Our jurisprudence has sanctioned its prevalence even like the Anglo American system Reference in this connection may also be made to an interesting article by <NAME> titled Judicial Review Appeal and Factual Error published in Public Law Upon receipt of objections the Collector is required to make such further enquiry as he may think necessary whereupon he must submit a report to the appropriate <ORG> in respect of the land which is the subject matter of notification under Section of the Act The said Report would also contain recommendations on the objections filed by the owner of the land It is now well settled in view of a catena of decisions that the declaration made under Section of the Act need not contain any reason As and when a person aggrieved questions the decision making process the court in order to satisfy itself as to whether one or more grounds for judicial review exists may call for the records whereupon such records must be produced In view of the fact that the action required to be taken by <ORG> is distinct and different from the action required to be taken by the Collector when the ultimate order is in question it was for the <ORG> to satisfy the court about the validity thereof and for the said purpose the counter affidavit filed on behalf of a Collector cannot be held to be sufficient compliance of the requirements of law The job of the Collector in terms of Section A would be over once he submits his report Furthermore the <ORG> is required to apply its mind not only on the objections filed by the owner of the land but also on the Report which is submitted by the Collector upon making other and further enquiries therefor as also the recommendations made by him in that behalf The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Appellant herein accepted that the satisfaction required to be arrived at is not a subjective one but based on objective criteria When an order is passed by a statutory authority the same must be supported either on the reasons stated therein or the grounds available therefor in the record Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to affect the actings and conduct of those to whom they are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself We may here draw attention to the observations of <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> A declaration contained in a notification issued under Section of the Act need not contain any reason but such a notification must precede the decision of the appropriate Government SCR observed that in such a case the provisions of the statute should be strictly construed as it deprives a person of his land without consent In view of our findings aforementioned it is not necessary for us to go into the other questions raised by the parties
