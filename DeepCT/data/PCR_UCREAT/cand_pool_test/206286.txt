This appeal is against an order of <ORG> dismissing an application for execution of the decree of <ORG> in Original Suit No of There were several intermediate applications for execution presented on the plaintiff behalf during his minority by his next friend The application has been dismissed by the lower <ORG> on the ground that it is barred by limitation under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure it having been presented more than twelve years after the date of the decree although within three years after the attainment of majority by the plaintiff The first question for consideration is whether the plaintiff is entitled to the benefit of Section of the Limitation Act and to reckon the period of limitation for execution of the decree from the date of attainment of majority and whether apart from that section there is any general principle of law entitling him to the same benefit on account of his disability arising from minority Article of the Limitation Act which lays down the general rule of limitation applicable to execution of decrees exempts from its operation cases coming within the purview of Section of the Civil Procedure Code Section of the Act enacts that where a person entitled to institute a suit or make an application for the execution of a decree is at the time from which the period of limitation is to be reckoned a minor he may institute the suit or make the application within the same period after the disability has ceased as would otherwise have been allowed from the time prescribed therefor in the third column of the first schedule and as Article of the schedule is inapplicable to the case Section enacting the rule of exemption during the period of minority must also be held to be inapplicable The District Judge Mr <NAME> has dealt with the question in a remarkably able and lucid judgment but the question really does not admit of any serious doubt on the language of the section It is unnecessary to consider whether the other general provisions of the Limitation Act contained in Sections to would be applicable or not where the period of Limitation is prescribed by some special Act and not by the general code of limitation It is strenuously contended by Mr <NAME> the learned vakil for the appellant that apart from that section minority is a well recognised ground of exemption in law from the operation of the law of limitation He relies in support of this contention mainly on <NAME> <NAME> I Bom <NAME> <NAME> observed The question referred to us must be decided by the general principle of law as to the disability of minors to which the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code must in the absence of anything to the contrary be deemed to be subject The general principle is that time does not run against a minor and the circumstance that he has been represented by a guardian does not affect the question No authority has been cited in support of the enunciation of the rule that there is a general principle of law that time does not run against a minor After full consideration we have come to the conclusion that the authority relied on in the passage cited does not show that according to the English law infancy is an answer to a plea of limitation Strictly infants were not prevented by the letter of the custom they were not bound by other customs like this there was no necessity to construe them to be within the custom Lord <NAME> says that the limitation of actions was by force of diverse Acts of Parliament although at a very remote time in England there was undoubtedly a stated time for the heir of the tenants to claim after the death of his ancestor and in case of non claim before the expiration of the time a year and a day the claimant was without remedy He states that under the common law the presumption arose alter a long time in respect to a legal claim that it had been satisfied Section says I think truly Prescription although it be by positive law founded upon utility more than upon equity the introduction whereof the Romans ascribed to themselves yet hath it been since received by most nations but not so as to be counted amongst the laws of nations because it is not the same but different in diverse nations as to the matter manner and the time of it It is both fair and expedient that there should be provisions to enlarge the time when the true owners are under disabilities or for any other reason are not to be considered guilty of laches in not using their right within the specified period and such provisions there were in the lioman law and commonly are in modern Statutes of Limitations but I take it that these are positive laws founded on expedience and varying in different countries and at different times <NAME> in his work On Limitation observes although says <NAME> there was no other reason to justify the introduction and use of prescription than that of public policy it would be just to prevent the property of things from being constantly in a state of uncertainty He goes on to say The true rule on this subject is laid down by Sir <NAME> in his opinion in <ORG> on the case of Earl of Buckinghamshire <NAME> Wilm Accordingly we find that in the great case of <NAME> Lord <NAME> Plowden upon the Statute of Fines of Henry the Seventh where the question was whether when the bar by five years non claim had begun to run in the time of the ancestor of lull age it should continue to run against his infant heir although there was great difference of opinion among the Judges upon that question the whole argument turns upon the true construction of the statute itself with reference to all the parts of it and to the object it had in view and not upon any supposed inherent equity by which infants were to be excepted out of the operation of the Statutes of Limitation On the contrary it is laid down in that case and laid down without any contradiction For as much as they intended that is the <ORG> intended to avoid universal trouble fas the preamble speaks and to make peace which is to be preferred before all other things and for as much as they have made the provision general viz We have no hesitation in saying that the same view must be held in this country also The earliest statutes of limitation in India therefore made express provisions in favour of minors We cannot therefore uphold the argument that there is any fundamental rule of law or justice entitling the appellant to claim that the limitation should run only from the date of his attaining majority It is next contended for the appellant that the application is not barred in so far as the claim for <ORG> profits is concerned even if Section of the Civil Procedure Code would be a bar so far as partition is concerned Section enacted that with regard to <ORG> profits prior to the institution of the suit the <ORG> may either determine the amount by the decree itself or may pass a decree for the property and direct an enquiry into the amount of <ORG> profits and dispose of the same on further orders It is argued that the expression the <ORG> executing the deoree merely designates the <ORG> which is to hold the enquiry into <ORG> profits and that the provision in Section does not make the enquiry a matter relating to the execution of the decree Where the <ORG> profits relate to the period before the decree it may be said that the decree should strictly speaking determine all the rights of the plaintiff including the claim to <ORG> profits up to the date of the decree but it is doubtful whether this argument can apply to <ORG> profits subsequent to decree The language of Clause of that section any other question relating to the execution shows that the enquiry into the amount of <ORG> profits was also to be regarded as a question relating to execution It may be right to hold that within the meaning of Section of the repealed Code the twelve years prescribed therein for the execution of a decree for money would run only from the date when the <ORG> profits are ascertained for it may be said that until that is done it cannot be said that there is a decree for money There although there was a declaration that the original defendants were liable for <ORG> profits the decree did not determine the important question whether the defendants were liable jointly or severally in respect of wrongful occupation There was no adjudication upon any of these matters until a long time after the original decree and until after the death of the defendants whose representatives were sought to be made liable Their Lordships did not decide any question of limitation The <ORG> had no power to give such a direction According to Section of the present Code the execution of all decrees except a decree granting an injunction will be barred after the expiration of twelve years But it is contended that this case must be decided according to the provisions of the present Procedure Code which by Order XX Rule directs that in a suit for the recovery of immoveable property and mesne profits the <ORG> may direct an enquiry as to the mesne profits and should pass a final decree in accordance with the result of the enquiry In this view an application for the ascertainment of mesne profits would not be one for execution of the decree though the question might then arise whether Article would not apply to such an application The effect to be given to a document and to the proceedings of a <ORG> must be decided by the law in force when the document was executed or the proceedings were passed Lastly it is contended that the application is not barred at any rate so far as the recovery of out standings is concerned inasmuch as they had not been collected by the defendants at the time of the decree according to which the plaintiffs are entitled to recover their share when the out standings are collected In the result the appeal is dismissed with costs
