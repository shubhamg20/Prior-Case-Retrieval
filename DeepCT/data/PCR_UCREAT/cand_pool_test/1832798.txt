pending and there is no court which could be said to be the court winding up the company and therefore the claim petition on behalf of the company which is not being wound up could not be instituted as contemplated by Sec In reaching this conclusion <ORG> gave a restricted meaning to the expression court which is winding up the company in sub sec The Appellate Bench appeared to be of the view that where the official Liquidator has been appointed as the provisional Liquidator which implies that no winding up order has been made jurisdiction under Sec To accelerate the process of winding up

has neither been quashed set aside cancelled revoked nor recalled Now if the winding up order was merely held in abeyance i it was not operative for the time being but it had not ceased to exist the winding up proceedings are in fact pending and the court which made the winding up order would be the court which is winding up the Company If the winding up order is subsisting the court which made that order or the court which kept it in abeyance will have jurisdiction to give necessary directions to the provisional Liquidator to take recourse to Sec In passing it was stated that the Company sought the direction from the Appellate Bench and not from the Court which was winding up the Company i the court of the Learned Company Judge which made the winding up order Having thus examined the matter from all angles we are of the view that <ORG> was in error in rejecting the application made on behalf of the appellant Company for directing the provisional Liquidator to prefer claims petitions on the materials and expenses to be furnished by the Company The amounts realised by the provisional liquidator on filing claim petitions shall be handed over to the Company and the appellant Company is under an obligation to use spend and appropriate them in the implementation of the scheme under the supervision of the court
