Thereupon the respondents filed writ petitions in <ORG> contending that pensionary benefit with the right to superannuation pension were property to which the officers by reason of their service were entitled as a matter of right and therefore they could not be deprived of any part of that property without notices to show cause why the cut should not be imposed But it was contended that the order of the State government in applying the cut was an administrative order under rule of the Pension Roles and therefore the State government was not liable to issue a notice to show cause against the proposed cut It was pointed out that <ORG> had in its possession the confidential records of the officers and on consideration of the same it was open to it reduce the pens ion in its discretion Dismissing the appeals HELD The State government could not have applied a cut in the pensions of the officers without giving them a reasonable opportunity to make their defence Where a body or authority is characteristically administrative the principle of natural justice is also liable to be invoked if the decision of that body or authority affects individual rights or interests and having regard to the particular situation it would be unfair for the body or authority not to have allowed a reasonable opportunity to be heard The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals raise a common question of law as to whether <ORG> is entitled to reduce the amount of pension and gratuity legally payable to its officers on their superannuation without giving a reasonable opportunity to the officers to show cause against the proposed reduction In November he retired from service on reaching the age of superannuation It is an admitted fact that before this cut was applied <NAME> had not been furnished the grounds nor had he been given an opportunity to show cause against the proposed cut On he attained the age of superannuation It is admitted that while applying the cut to the pension no opportunity was given to Shri <NAME> to show cause against the proposed cut He was confirmed in the post of the District Agriculture Officer with effect from In this case also it is admitted that <NAME> had not been given any notice to show cause why his pension should not be reduced or death cum retirment gratuity forfeited They could not be deprived of any part of that property without notice to show cause why the cut should not be imposed It was also contended that the order imposing the cut was an administrative order and the <ORG> was not therefore bound to give notice to the officers about the proposed cut <ORG> held by majority that the right to superannuation pension was a right vested in the <ORG> servant and before that right is prejudicially affected he is entitled to a notice to show cause against the proposed cut The Writ Petition filed by <NAME> came on for hearing before a single Judge of <ORG> on December The learned Judge held that the case was covered by the decision of the full bench in the above two cases and the only order he could pass was to quash the order by which the State <ORG> had imposed the cut in his pension This Court held that the right of a Govern ment servant to receive pension is property under Article and by a mere executive order the <ORG> did not have the power to withhold the same In coming to this decision a number of cases of <ORG> were referred to and the view taken by that court in <NAME> case which is now in appeal before us was affirmed Mr <NAME> who appeared before us on behalf of the <ORG> conceded that in view of the decision in <NAME> case it was no longer open to him to contend that pension was a bounty It was pointed out that <ORG> had in its possession the Confidential records of the officers and on a consideration of the same it was open to it to reduce the pension in its discretion It was conceded that these officers earned promotions and increments in due course of their service but it was submitted that did not prevent <ORG> from applying the cut to the pension if on a consideration of the official career as a whole the officers were not entitled to unqualified approbation There are five notes appended to this rule The construction was entrusted to <NAME> Superintending Engineer Bhakra Main Line and his allegation was that it was a constructional defect which caused loss to the Government and not the design Were these matters taken into account as <ORG> claims to have done before the imposition of the cut it would have beer fair to have given an opportunity to the officers to put forward their defence before depriving them of a large share in their pensionable benefits which He was confirmed in that post and also officiated for sometime as the Deputy Director of Agriculture It is not necessary for us to deal with this point here except to suggest that this aspect of the case could well have been urged by the officers before the Government if notice had been issued to them to show cause against the proposed cut and <ORG> would have had necessarily to apply its mind to that question <ORG> held that the order had to be set aside because <NAME> was not afforded an opportunity to defend himself though the statute itself did not require any such opportunity being given The question for our consideration now is whether the orders imposing a cut in the pension should be set aside for the reason that the officers were not given reasonable opportunity to show cause With the proliferation of administrative decisions in the welfare State it is now further recognised by courts both in En land and in this country especially after the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> that where a body or authority is characteristically administrative the principle of natural justice is also liable to be invoked if the decision of that body or authority affects individual rights of interests He is however under a duty to give the person against whom in enquiry is held an opportunity to set up his version or defence and an opportunity to correct or to controvert any evidence in the possession of the authority Sup The rule that a party to whose prejudice an order is intended to be passed is entitled to a hearing applies alike to judicial tribunals and bodies of persons invested with authority to adjudicate upon matters involving civil conse quences It is one of the fundamental rules of Our Constitutional set up that ever citizen is protected against exercise of arbitrary authority by the <ORG> or its officers Duty to act judicially would therefore arise from the very nature of the function intended to be performed it need not be shown to be super added If there is power to decide and determine to the prejudice of a person duty to act judicially is implicit in the exercise of such power If the essentials of justice be ignored and an order to the prejudice of a person is made the order is nullity That is a basic concept of the rule of law and importance thereof transcends the significance of a decision in any particular case These observations were made with reference to an authority which could be described as characteristically administrative page it was observed It is true that the order is administrative in character but even an administrative order which involves civil consequences as already stated must be made consistently with the rules of natural justice after informing the first respondent of the case of the <ORG> the evidence in support thereof and after giving an opportunity to the first respondent of being heard and meeting Or explaining the evidence The rule which declares that even an administrative authority has to act fairly after giving an opportunity to the person rights and interests are affected by its decision is no more than an extension of the well known rule which courts in England had recognised in the th century <ORG> the <ORG> which had under the Act of the authority to demolish any building constructed if the owner thereof had failed to give proper notice was held bound to give the owner an opportunity of being heard before the demolition It was contended in that case by the <ORG> that their discretion to order demolition was not a judicial discretion Therefore it was quite essential in all fairness and elementary justice that they should have been given reasonable opportunity to show cause against the proposed action Reference was made on behalf of the <ORG> to <NAME> The <ORG> of Mysore and particularly the following observations at page It has nothing to do with reduction of pension which is specifically provided for in Art There is a Note under this article which says that he full pension admissible under the Regulations is not to be given as a matter of course but rather to be treated as a matter of distinction It is enough to say that the question did not arise in the case as to whether pension is bounty or property In that case the appellant <NAME> had been charged in respect of seven irregularities committed by him when he held the post In the meantime he reached the age of superannuation and the <ORG> passed an order directing that he be retired from service from the date on which had reached superannuation and given a reduced pinion of two thirds to which he would be ordinarily entitled in view of the irregularities committed by him
