The appellant also reserved the right to sue later for the amount found due The respondent contested the suit on the ground that the suit was not maintainable in the form in which it was framed and disputing the correctness of the interpretation of the clause suggested by the appellant stated that it was ever ready and willing and was still willing to pay the legitimate dues of the appellant or such other amount as may be found due on proper account being taken then made by the appellant on the ground that the claim for money was time barred long before the petition for amendment was made and because there were no special circumstances justifying the grant of the amendment i If there was any case where the respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the law of limitation the instant case was that one It was a case in which the claim for money was in substance in the plaint from the beginning though it had not formally been made and so the respondent could not legitimately claim that the amendment would prejudicially affect his right under the law of limitation for really he had no such right A A party is not allowed to set up a new case or a new cause of action by amendment but it is well recognised that where the amendment does not constitute the addition of a new cause of action or raise a new case but amounts to no more than a different or additional approach to the facts already on the record the amendment will be allowed even after the expiry of the statutory period of limitation The expression new cause of action in this context means a new claim made on a new basis constituted by new facts and new case means a new set of ideas The respondent had notice of the amount of claim was fully aware that the ultimate object of the appellant in filing the suit was to obtain payment of that amount and had specifically expressed in the written statement its willingness to pay the appellants legitimate dues Per <NAME> Dissenting An amendment which would enable a plaintiff to make a claim which has become time barred is as a rule to be refused and the Court would exercise its special power to allow such amendment only when there are special circumstances in the case When the plaintiff could not get the relief of the amended claim on the facts mentioned in the plaint as originally filed the cause of action for a decreefor Rs was different from the cause of action on which thesuitordeclaration was founded The fact that he reserved his right to sue for the amount indicates that he did not intend to sue for the amount and the fact that the trial court gave him leave to sue later does not justify the amendment because leave can be given by the court under A ii Per <NAME> <ORG> was not in error in allowing the respondent to raise the objection as to the maintainability of the suit on account of the appellant not asking for further relief <NAME> The question raised in this appeal is whether <ORG> was in error in refusing permission to the appellant to amend its plaint per cooly but if there is increase of labour rate of more than in any particular month the proportionate increase in rate will be charged Subsequent to the making of the contract there was an increase in the labour rate per cooly by There was no other dispute either concerning the quantity or quality of the work done or otherwise howsoever The respondent then went up in appeal to <ORG> at Patna The correctness of this view is not challenged in this Court Now the appellant bad in view of <ORG> decision as to the maintainability of the suit sought its leave to amend the plaint by adding an extra relief in the following words That a decree for Rs or such other amount which may be found due on proper account being taken may be passed in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant That expression for the present purpose only means a new claim made on a new basis constituted by new facts Such a view was taken in <NAME> <ORG> and it seems to us to be the only possible view to take Now how does the present case stand on these principles Does the amendment introduce a new cause of action or a new case We do not think it does In the written statement the respondent specifically expressed its willingness to pay the appellant legitimate dues which could only mean such amount as might be Ch I Bom The respondent was fully aware that the ultimate object of the appellant in filing the suit was to obtain the payment of that amount If there was any case where the respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the law of limitation the present is that one In <NAME> case an amendment adding a claim for possession after a suit for such claim had become barred was allowed in a suit which originally had only claimed a declaration of a right to pre empt We would for these reasons allow the appeal The appellant will get the costs in this Court <NAME> This appeal on certificate granted by <ORG> Patna is against the judgment and decree dismissing the appellant suit for a declaration on the ground that the plaintiff had not asked for consequential relief The plaintiff sued for a declaration that it was entitled to enhancement of over the tender rates for the different categories of excavation work as detailed in para of the plaint in connection with the work of excavation in foundation of the Tilaiya Dam at Katni Koderma in the district of Hazaribagh per cooly but if there is increase of labour rate of more than in any particular month the pro portionate increase in rate will be charged The plaintiff reserves the right to sue later on for the amount found due to him Paragraph said that the plaintiff claimed i leave under and ii that it be declared that the plaintiff is entitled to enhancement of over the tendered rates for the different categories of excavation work as detailed in paragraph of the plaint in connection with the work of excavation in foundation of the Tilaiya Dam Paragraph of the written statement filed by the defendant stated that the defendant did not admit the later part of the statement in para of the plaint which related to the plaintiffs reserving his right to sue later for the amount found due at the enhanced rate The defendant inter alia contested the suit on the ground that the suit was not maintainable in the form in which it had been framed Issue No of the issues framed in the case was Is the suit maintainable in its present form <ORG> stated in its judgment The defendant also pleaded that the plaintiff has no cause of action the suit is not maintainable in the present form and the court fees paid is insufficient On appeal <ORG> accepted the respondent conten tion that in view of the proviso to of the Specific Relief Act the suit for mere declaration was not maintainable and that <ORG> was not right in granting permission under of to the plaintiff to institute another suit for the amount to which the plaintiff be entitled after the declaration sought for in the suit had been granted barred long before the prayer was made during the arguments before <ORG> and as there existed no special circumstances to justify the grant of the amendment against the interest of the defendant respondent It however granted leave to appeal as the requirements of art Learned counsel for the appellant has contended that there exists such special circumstances in the case which would have justified in the interests of justice the grant of the application for amendment of the plaint and in the alternative contended that <ORG> should not have allowed the respondent to object to the maintainability of the suit on the basis of the proviso to of the Act and if the Court had allowed such an objection it should have as a matter of course allowed the application for amendment It was incumbent on the <ORG> to comply with this requirement of law even if not raised by the party when it was clear that further relief could be claimed in the suit I therefore do not consider the High <ORG> in error in allowing the respondent to raise the objection to the maintainability of the suit on account of the plaintiff not having asked for the further relief It does not however follow that the appellant must have been allowed as a matter of course to amend the plaint by adding a claim for recovery of the amount found due Neither the question of limitation arose in that case nor did the Court consider it necessary for the plaintiff to have asked for consequential relief The real dispute between the parties is whether the circumstances of the case come within the principle laid down in the various cases This necessarily leads to a consideration of the circumstances and the amendments sought in those cases <NAME> Before referring to the cases I may set out the provisions of the Code which empower the <ORG> to allow amendment of pleadings Section reads The <ORG> may at any time and on such terms as to costs or otherwise as it may think fit amend any defect or error in any proceeding in a suit and all necessary amendments shall be made for the purpose of determining the real question or issue raised by or depending on such proceeding reads The <ORG> may at any stage of the proceedings allow either party to alter or amend his pleadings in such manner and on such terms as may be just and all such amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties These indicate that the amendment should be in such manner as may be just and that as a rule all such amendments shall be made as be necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties Earlier after referring to the provisions of he had said at From the imperative character of the last sentence of the rule it seems to me clear that at any stage of the proceedings all amendments ought to be allowed which satisfy the two conditions a of not working injustice to the other side and of being necessary for the purpose of determining the real questions in controversy between the parties The amendments do not really introduce a new case and the application filed by the appellant himself showed that he was not taken by surprise nor did he have to meet a new claim set up for the first time after the expiry of the period of limitation I think therefore that the Subordinate Judge would have been well advised if he had paid more attention to the substance of the suit before him and taken command of it himself rather than handed over the conduct of the suit to a manifestly inexpert pleader had he taken this view of his duty as presiding Judge the slight technical difficulty which stood in his way would have been easily removed was dismissed and therefore he filed a suit under for a declaration that he was entitled to recover possession of the suit properties from defendant No He did not specify how he had a right to that property as against defendant No who was said to have no right to refuse delivery of possession to him Before dealing with <NAME> case reference may be made to the case reported as <NAME> <NAME> which has been referred to in <NAME> case In this ease the plaintiff brought a suit against several persons on the allegations that defendant No had borrowed certain money on a simple money bond executed on August and that the other defendants claimed her property and that therefore the suit be decreed against defendants and the property mentioned in the plaint with interest to date of realisation A plaintiff cannot be entitled to relief upon facts or documents not stated or referred to by him in his pleadings and the only thing that can be rightly insisted on by the plaintiff here is a decree for payment against <NAME> <ORG> however considered whether inasmuch as the suit was wholly misconceived whether the proper course was not to dismiss the appeal altogether without prejudice to the right of the plaintiff appellant to bring a new suit against defendant No upon the first point and decided that would not be the proper course as the fresh suit might be resisted on the ground of being barred by limitation and as in the circumstances of the case such a defence in the fresh suit would be inequitable <ORG> therefore allowed the plaintiff to amend his plaint so as to make it a plaint against defendant No alone for the recovery of money due on a bond In <NAME> case the plaintiff sued for a declaration of his right to pre empt certain property The appeal against the dismissal of the suit was allowed and the suit was remanded for decision upon merits with I A But if once it be accepted that they were attempting to establish those rights there is no sufficient reason shown for disturbing the judgment of the Judicial Commissioner who thinks they should be at liberty to express their intention in a plainer and less ambiguous manner It was these considerations which according to <ORG> outweighed the consideration that the power of amendment should not as a rule be exercised where its effect be to take away from a defendant a legal right which had accrued to him by lapse of time and brought the case within the principle laid down in <NAME> case In That case the plaintiff had filed a suit for damages for conversion I A The application was opposed on the ground that it introduced a new cause of action and a suit on that cause of action would be barred by imitation This <ORG> considered there was force in the objection but after giving due weight to it was of the opinion that it was a fit case in which the amendment should be allowed as the new claim was based on a clause of the same agreement on which the suit had been founded and therefore could not be said to be foreign to the scope of the suit and as the prayer in the plaint was itself general and merely claimed damages Here again the amendment allowed related to the form of relief which could be claimed on the basis of the facts alleged in the plaint and a clause of the document on the basis of which the suit was founded It would appear from the various cases discussed above that an amendment which would enable a plaintiff to make a claim which has become time barred is as a rule to be refused and that the <ORG> would exercise its special power to allow such amendment only when there be special circumstances in the case It appears to me that such special circumstances can be only when the amended claim was at least intended to be made by the plaintiff who had given in the plaint all the necessary facts to establish the claim but had due to clumsy drafting not been able to express himself clearly in the plaint and to couch his relief in the proper legal form It observed at All rules of <ORG> are nothing but provisions intended to secure the proper administration of justice and it is therefore essential that they should be made to serve and be subordinate to that purpose so that full powers of amendment must be enjoyed and should always be liberally exercised but none the less no power has yet been given to enable one distinct cause of action to be substituted for another nor to change by means of amendment the subject matter of the suit In fact the amendment sought would necessitate practically a de navo trial on the question as to what amount the plaintiff is entitled from the defendant on account of the work done When the plaintiff cannot get the relief sought to be added as a result of the amendment on the facts mentioned in the plaint originally it is clear that the cause of action for a decree for Rs The appeal therefore fails and I would dismiss it with costs
