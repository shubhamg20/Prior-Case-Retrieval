As such purchaser he acquired under of the Bengal <ORG> Sales Act the right to avoid and annul all under tenures and forthwith to eject all under tenants with certain exceptions which are not material here In exercise of that right he gave notices of ejectment and brought a suit in to evict certain under tenants including the second respondent herein and to recover possession of the lands It would appear according to the statement of objects and reasons annexed to the Bill that great hardship was being caused to a large section of the people by the application of of the Bengal Land <ORG> Sales Act in the urban areas and particularly in Calcutta and its suburbs where the present phenomenal increase in land values has supplied the necessary incentive to speculative purchasers in exploiting this provision section the law for unwarranted large scale eviction and it was therefore considered necessary to enlarge the scope of protection already given by the section to certain categories of tenants with due safeguards for the security of Government revenue The Bill was eventually passed as the amending Act and it came into force on th March The <ORG> of West Bengal preferred the present

our Constitution makers thought necessary or sufficient tO be placed on the exercise of that power namely that such power can be exercised only by authority of law and not by a mere executive fiat and

JAGANNADHADAS i On the assumption that the question raised in this case is one that arisesunder art Appeal from the Judgment and Order dated nd March of <ORG> at Calcutta <ORG> and <NAME> in Reference No of The first respondent herein hereinafter referred to as the respondent purchased the entire Touzi No of <ORG> at a revenue sale held on January In exercise of that right the respondent gave notices of ejectment and brought a suit in to evict certain under tenants including the second respondent herein and to recover possession of statement objects and reasons annexed to the Bill that great hardship was being caused to a large section of the people by the considered necessary to enlarge the scope of protection already given by the section to certain categories of tenants with due safeguards for the security Of Government revenue The learned Judges held that the respondent right to annul under tenures and evict under tenants being a vested right acquired by him under his purchase before section was amended the retrospective deprivation of that right by section of the amending Act without any abatement of the price paid by the respondent at the revenue sale was an infringement of his fundamental right under article to hold property with all the rights below then it was a reasonable restriction imposed in the interests of the general public under clause of article having regard to the facts and circumstances which led to the enactment of the measure as In other words it declares the citizen right to own property and has no reference to the right to the property owned by him which is dealt with in article It includes those fundamental privileges and immunities which belong essentially to the citizens of every free government among which Washington enumerates the right of protection the right to pursue and obtain happiness and safety the right to pass through and reside in any State for the purposes of trade agriculture professional pursuits or otherwise to claim the benefit of the wnt of habeas corpus to institute and maintain actions of any kind in the courts of the State and to take hold and dispose of property either real or personal These primordial and fundamental rights are the privileges and immunities citizens which are referred to in the th article of the Constitution and in the th Amendment to it We are not here concerned with the meaning and content of the phrase privileges and immunities in the context of thoseprovisions which according to some of the Judges have a reference only to those privileges and immunities which owe their existence to the Federal Constitution or its laws What is of importance for the present purpose is that the two learned Judges thought that the right to take hold and dispose of property was one of those primordial and fundamental rights of the same class as the right to pursue happiness and safety and other such basic freedoms appertaining to free citizens and was different from the concrete rights which a person may have to a specific res or thing owned being the capacity power or privilege of having and enjoying those concrete rights Sub clause of clause of article seems analogous to clause of article of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights Everyone has the right to own property alone as well as in association with others and article to clause of article No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of his property I have no doubt that the framers of our Constitution drew the same distinction and classed the natural right or capacity of a citizen to acquire hold and dispose of property with other natural rights and freedoms inherent in the status of a free citizen and embodied them in article while they provided for the protection of concrete rights of property owned by a person in article The meaning of the phrase to acquire hold and dispose of property as well as the nature of the subject matter to which it has reference in the sense indicated above is also clear from the terms of sections and of the Government of India Act where the same phrase is used in prohibiting imposition of disability on grounds of religion place of birth There are difficulties in the way of accepting the view of the learned Judges below that article and deal with the concrete rights of property and the restraint to which they are liable to be subjected In the first place it will be noticed that sub clause of clause of article deals only with the rights of citizens whereas article deals with the rights of persons in general If article which is headed by the caption right to property was designed to protect property rights of citizens as well as non citizens why was it considered necessary to provide for the protection of those rights in sub clause of clause of article also I do not think that our Constitution makers could have intended to provide a double barrelled constitutional protection to private property Moreover right to acquire and dispose of property could only refer to the capacity of a citizen rights to specific things owned by a citizen I see no force in the objection that unless sub clause of clause of article read with clause is construed as relating to concrete property rights also the legislature would have the power to impose even unreasonable restrictions on the enjoyment of private property by citizens Such restrictions are imposed in exercise of the power inherent in the <ORG> to regulate private rights of property when they are sought to be exercised to the injury of others having similar rights and the measure of restriction imposed On the other hand differential treatment of citizens and non citizens would be perfectly intelligible if subclause of clause of article and clause are understood as dealing only with the freedom or capacity to acquire hold and dispose of property in general for it would be justifiable to exclude aliens from such freedom as has been done in several countries for the benefit of their own nationals particularly in respect of land Nor am I much impressed with the suggestion that the reference to exercise in clause of article of the rights conferred by sub clause of clause indicates that the latter rights must be fights of property ii of subclause of clause of article and exempted from liability to pay compensation under clause On this view the question whether section the amending Act is a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the res pondent right to the property purchased by him could not also arise as clause of article could then have reference only to disabilities of the kind already mentioned Turning next to the contention based on article it Was put thus in the language of <NAME> in <NAME> case which the learned Attorney General fully adopted Article formulates the fundamental right in negative form prohibiting the deprivation of property except by authority of law It implies that a person may be deprived of his property by authority of law Article prohibits the acquisition or taking possession of property for a public purpose under any law unless such law provides for payment of compensation This deprivation of property is different from acquisition or taking of possession of property which goes by the name of eminent domain the American law I am not prepared to adopt such construction for I do not feel pressed to do so by the language used in article I think clause enunciates the general principle that no person shall be deprived of his property except by authority of law which put in a positive form implies that a person may be deprived of his property provided he is so deprived by authority of law The effect of clause is that only certain kinds of deprivation of property namely those brought about by acquisition or taking possession of it will not be permissible under any law unless such law provides for payment of compensation I have made this lengthy extract in order to avoid possible unfairness in summarising it These I observations were made while rejecting an argument of the petitioner in that case which however the learned Judge decided in his favour on another point and are thus purely obiter There are several objections to the acceptance of this view But the most serious of them all is that it largely nullifies the protection afforded by the Constitution to rights of private property and indeed stultifies the very conception of the right to property as a fundamental right Now the whole object of Part Iii of the Constitution is to provide protection for the freedoms and rights mentioned therein against arbitrary invasion by the <ORG> which as defined by article includes the <ORG>s of the country It would be a startling irony if the fundamental rights of property were in effect to be turned by construction into an arbitrary power of the <ORG> to deprive a person of his property without compensation in all ways other than acquisition or taking possession of such property It could make no difference to him whether such deprivation was authorised under clause or clause In either case his property would be gone and he would suffer loss He would read the clause in a positive form as implying that a person may be deprived of his property by authority of law <NAME> says There are two main requirements for a proper exercise of the police power there must be a social interest to be protected which is more important than the social interest in personal liberty and there must be as a means for the accomplishment of this end something which bears a substantial relation there to This is recognised and given effect to in clauses to of article which delimit the regulative power of the <ORG> as applied to the freedoms enumerated in clause of that article including the freedom referred to in sub clause in America I said in <NAME> case When that power legislative power was threatened with prostration by the excesses of due process the equally vague and expansive doctrine of police power i the power of Government to regulate private rights in public interest was evolved to counteract such excesses And <NAME> said that the content of due process of law had to be narrowed down by the enunciation and application of the new doctrine of police power as an antidote or palliative to the former This court held in the aforesaid case that the framers of our Constitution definitely rejected the doctrine of due process of law Is it to be supposed that they accepted the antidote doctrine of police power and embodied it in clause of article as a specific power conferred on the <ORG> to deprive persons of their property The suggestion seems unwarranted and indeed contrary to the scheme of our Constitution Even where such regulative powers are defined and delimited as for instance in clauses to of article in relation to the rights and freedoms specified in clause the powers themselves are left to be exercised under laws made with respect to those matters For example the power of social control and regulation as applied to freedom of speech and expression is exercisable under a law made with respect to entry No of List II Public Order or entry No of List III Newspapers books and printing presses and in relation to a freedom not falling under clause of article like the freedom to drink or to eat what one likes such freedom can be restrained or even prohibited under a law made with reference to entry No of List II Intoxicating liquors etc I entirely agree with the observations of <NAME> in <NAME> case that In interpreting the provisions of our Constitution we should go by the plain words used by the Constitution makers and the importing of expressions like police power which is a term of variable and indefinite connotation in American law can only make the task of interpretation more difficult Though as pointed out in <NAME> case citing <NAME> Officer Administering the Government of Nigeria protection against executive action is not really needed under systems of Government based on British jurisprudence according to which no member of the executive can interfere with the liberty or property of a subject except in pursuance of powers given by law our Constitution makers who were framing a written Constitution conferred such protection explicitly by including the executive Governments of the Union and the <ORG>s in the definition of the <ORG> in article But how does the article protect the right to property It protects it by defining the limitations on the power of the <ORG> to take away private property without the consent of the owner As pointed out by <NAME> The right to appropriate private property to public uses lies dormant in the <ORG> until legislative action is had pointing out the occasions the modes conditions and agencies for its appropriation In England the struggle between prerogative and <ORG> having ended in favour of the latter the prerogative right of taking private property became merged in the absolutism of <ORG> and the right to compensation as a fundamental right of the subject does not exist independently of <ORG>ary enactment These important limitations on the power of the <ORG> acting through the executive and legislative organs to take away private property are designed to protect the owner against arbitrary deprivation of his property Attention was drawn to the Regulations and Acts relating to compulsory acquisition of land in this country including the Land Acquisition Act all of which provided for the vesting of the property acquired in the <ORG> or in one of its officers and it was suggested that the framers of our Constitution who must have been aware of the difficulties arising out of the lacuna in the <ORG> of India Act in regard to the power of requisitioning added the words taken possession of in clause and the word requisitioning in the entries referred to above It was therefore urged that the words acquired or taken possession of should not be taken to have reference to all forms of deprivation of private property by the <ORG> I see no sufficient reason to construe the words acquired or taken possession used in clause of article in a narrow technical sense The Constitution marks a definite break with the old order and introduces new concepts in regard to many matters particularly those relating to fundamental rights and it cannot be assumed that the ordinary word acquisition was used in the Constitution in the same narrow sense in which it may have been used in pre Constitution legislation relating to acquisition of land If that was the intention why was the word requisitioning not used in clause as well It is fallacious to suggest that unless taking possession is synonymous with requisitioning the power to make a law authorising the taking of possession of property would be lacking because no entry in any of the Lists of the Seventh Schedule confers that power It is in this general sense that the word has been used in articles and and not as implying any transfer or vesting of title and the court decided by a majority that the power included the power to take possession of property for a temporary purpose for an indefinite period As already stated in the case of moveable property no formal transfer or vesting of title apart from seizing it could have been contemplated And what is more clause ii of article which excepts any law made in future for the prevention of danger to life or property from the operation of clause shows that the latter clause but for such exception would entail liability to pay compensation for deprivation by destruction which must therefore I am of opinion that the word acquisition and its grammatical variations should in the context of article and the entries in the Lists referred to above be understood in their ordinary sense and the additional words taking possession of or requisitioning are used in article and in the entries respectively not in contradistinction with but in amplification of the term acquisition so as to make it clear that the words taken together cover even those kinds of deprivation which do not involve the continued existence of the property after it is acquired The expression taking possession can only mean taking such possession as the property is susceptible of and not actual physical possession as the interest in or in any company owing any commercial or industrial undertaking which is expressly included in clause of article is not susceptible of any actual physical occupancy or seizure It will now be seen that the two objections raised by <NAME> to the view expressed above namely that clauses and must be read together and understood as dealing with the same topic are really baseless It would not be so because it embodies one of the three important limitations on the exercise of the <ORG> power of deprivation of private property namely the necessity for the legislative action as a condition precedent to the exercise of the power and constitutes a protection against the executive organ of the <ORG> The second objection that the <ORG> power in an emergency to deprive a person of his property without payment of compensation as for example to demolish an intervening building to prevent a conflagration from spreading would be excluded is equally baseless The learned Attorney General suggested that sub clause was inserted ex abundante cautela as even without it no one could have supposed that a law of the kind mentioned in that sub clause would fall under clause Whether it was considered necessary to provide expressly that destruction of private property under emergency conditions entails no liability to pay compensation or whether the <ORG> power to do so was so well established that sub clause ii was really unnecessary and must be taken to have been inserted ex abundante cautela in either view the second objection must equally fail Where was the necessity it was asked to provide in clause of article for protection against the executive government in the matter of compulsory acquisition of property by the <ORG> as no such protection is provided for in the case of the regulative powers exercisable under article to The answer is the same need apparently which dictated the enactment of article providing for similar protection in the matter of taxation In any case this would be no more of an objection if it be an objection to the view I have indicated above than to the other view which also recognises the necessity for legislative action before a person could be deprived of his property Attention was called to article as showing that one of the goals set by the Constitution was the promotion of social welfare and it was urged that the attainment of that object as well as the growing complexities of modern conditions of life must call for an expanding power of social control and regulation particularly in the sphere of the enjoyment of private property and that the exercise of such power without entailing liability to pay compensation ought not to be confined within the narrow limits specified in article It only limits the purposes for which the power could be exercised without liability to pay compensation though its exercise results in deprivation of property in the sense already explained There is therefore no room for the apprehension that article would unduly cramp social control and regulation of private property for the public good or would lead to any alarming consequences to the safety of the community In ultimate analysis is not well informed and organised public opinion the true and effective protection against arbitrary action of the <ORG> The argument has no force So far as the power of taxation is concerned the Constitution recognises no fundamental right to immunity from taxation and that is why presumably no constitutional protection is provided against the exercise of that power In <NAME> case I said <NAME> who played a prominent part in framing the First Amendment of the American Constitution pointing out the distinction due to historical reasons between the American and the British ways of securing the great and essential rights of the people observed Here they are secured not by laws paramount to prerogative but by Constitutions paramount to laws This has been translated into positive law in Part I of the Indian Constitution There is a remarkable difference between the characters of the inconveniences which attend a declaration of rights and those which attend the want of it Does such abridgement amount to deprivation of property within the meaning of article as interpreted above and if so does it fall within the exception in clause ii of that article Now the word property in the context of article which is designed to protect private property in all its forms must be understood both in a corporeal sense as having reference to all those specific things that are susceptible of private appropriation and enjoyment as well as in its juridical or legal sense of a bundle of rights which the owner can exercise under the municipal law with respect to the user and enjoyment of those things to the exclusion of all others Under the Constitution of India however such questions must be determined with reference to the expression taken possession of or acquired as interpreted above namely that it must be read along with the word deprived in clause and understood as having reference to such substantial abridgement of the rights of ownership as would amount to deprivation of the owner of his property In the result the appeal is allowed and the judgment of <ORG> is set aside The first respondent will pay the costs of this appeal incurred by the appellant here and in the lower Court <NAME> reasons given in my judgment in <NAME> <ORG> A of I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice in his construction of article of the Constitution <NAME> agree that this appeal must be allowed but I have arrived at this conclusion by a different process of reasoning As the arguments advanced before us have raised very important constitutional issues it is only right that I should give the reasons for my decision in some detail And such a purchaser as is aforesaid shall be entitled to proceed in the manner prescribed by any law for the time being in force for the enhancement of the rent of any land coming within the fourth class of exceptions above made if he can prove the same to have been held at what was orginally an unfair rent and if the same shall not have been held at a fixed rent equal to the rent of good arable land for a term exceeding twelve years but not otherwise Provided always that nothing in this section contained shall be construed to entitle any such purchaser as aforesaid to eject any raiyat having a right of occupancy at a fixed rent or at a rent assessable according to fixed rules under the laws in force or to enhance the rent of any such raiyat otherwise than in the manner prescribed by such laws or otherwise than the former proprietor irrespectively of all engagements made since the time of settlement may have been entitled to do The respondent No who was the defendant No alone contested the suit The learned Subordinate Judge who tried the suit delivered his judgment on the th February and i tenures and holdings not included in exception a above made and ii other leases of land whether or not for purposes connected with agriculture or horticulture existing at the date of issue of the notification for sale of the estate under this Act Provided that notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force or in any lease or contract no person shall be entitled to hold under such a purchaser as is aforesaid any tenure holding or lease coming within exception above made free Of rent or at a low rent or at a rent or rate of rent fixed in perpetuity or for any specified period unless the right so to hold has been expressly recognised under any law for the time being in force by any competent civil or revenue court and the purchaser shall be entitled to proceed in the manner prescribed by any law for the time being in force for the determination of a fair and equitable rent of such tenure holding or lease Every decree passed or order made before the date of commencement of this Act for the ejectment of any person from any land in pursuance of section or section of the said Act shall if the decree or order could not have been validly passed or made had this Act been in operation at the date of the passing or making thereof be void Provided that nothing in this section shall affect any decree or order in execution whereof the possession of the land in respect of which the decree or order was passed or made has already been delivered before the date of commencement of this Act It is quite clear that under this section the suit of the respondent <NAME> must abate and the decree passed in his favour must become void if that section be valid law and intra vires the Constitution of India Notice having been given by the <ORG> to the Advocate General of Bengal the State of West Bengal appeared on the Reference On the nd March <ORG> held that section imposed an unreasonable restriction on the respondent <NAME> right to hold property and violated his fundamental right guaranteed by article read with article and was therefore void under article It is therefore clear that section affects pre existing rights bygiving in effect retrospective operation to section which has sub stituted inter alia the new section for the old section of the Act of The respondent <NAME> contends that his fundamental right under article of the Constitution namely his right to hold that is to say his right to enjoy and exercise the full rights of ownership in relation to the property acquired by him under the old section has been I violated and therefore section which operates retrospectively and gives retrospective operation to the new section is ultra vires the Constitution and is void under article The learned Attorney General has not seriously contended that the impugned section has not prejudicially affected the right given to the purchaser by the old section but he maintains that the abridgement of the rights of the purchaser at a revenue sale brought about by the new section amounts to nothing more than the imposition of a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right conferred by article in the interests of the general public and is perfectly legitimate and permissible under clause of that article While I see some force in this argument I am nevertheless not convinced that the fact of the statute being given retrospective operation may not be properly taken into consideration in determining the reasonableness of the restriction imposed in the interest of the general public Nor am I satisfied that the loss occasioned to the purchaser by reducing without any abatement of the purchase price an estate in possession into one in reversion may not also be taken into account in determining the reasonableness of the restrictions permissible under article It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness wherever prescribed should be applied to each individual statute impugned and no abstract standard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases As regards the third element <ORG> has pointed out that no suggestion had been made before it that the number of pending suits or proceeding for ejectment of tenants was abnormally large or that there was any other cogent reason for introducing the impugned section in the amending Act It is indeed very unfortunate that several important matters which would have assisted <ORG> in arriving at a right conclusion as to the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed by the impugned section were not brought to the notice of <ORG> Those are all matters which as already stated must enter into the judicial verdict as to the reasonableness of the restrictions which article permits to be imposed on the exercise of the right guaranteed by article Further there is another significant fact which does not appear to have been pressed on the attention of <ORG> Further it appears from the judgment delivered by <ORG> on the application subsequently made by the <ORG> for leave to appeal to this court that a number of cases were pending before the courts in which the same question was involved Then there is the fact found by <ORG> that land values had gone up so high that auction purchasers could now be found who even without the right to eject the under tenants would willingly pay a sum much in excess of the arrears of <ORG> revenue which remains constant since the permanent settlement The cumulative effect of the foregoing facts which were not placed before <ORG> much outweighs the consideration of the pecuniary loss of the respondent <NAME> as the auction purchaser and in the circumstances the infliction of the loss of the right to eject under tenants can only be regarded as a reasonable restriction permitted by article to be imposed on the exercise of the right guaranteed under article The Bill which eventually became the Bengal Land Revenue Sales West Bengal Amendment Act was introduced in <ORG> on the rd March and after having been passed by the <ORG> it received the assent of the Governor on the th March The Bill was therefore pending in <ORG> when the Constitution of India came into force and was passed into law after the date of the Constitution Therefore the impugned law cannot claim the protection of article and what is more if it is such a law as is referred to in clause of article then by virtue of clause it cannot have any effect at all of the Bench took the view that the rights conferred by article a to and could be enjoyed only so long as the citizen was free and had the liberty of his person but that the moment he was lawfully deprived of his personal liberty under article he ceased to have the rightsguaranteed by article I a to and The question arose whether section of the Act was a law imposing restrictions on the right to move freely throughout the territory of India guaranteed under article and as such was liable to be tested with reference to its reasonableness under clause of that article <NAME> who by a separate judgment dissented from the majority on another point not material for our present purpose said at page On the other points argued in the case I agree judgment of <NAME> These freedoms even when they are so available are however not absolute and unbridled licence but are subject to social control in that reasonable restrictions may be imposed on them by law as indicated in clauses to of article But as soon as the citizen is lawfully deprived of his personal liberty as a result of detention punitive or preventive he loses his capacity to exercise the several rights enumerated in sub clauses a to and of article and cannot complain of the infraction of any of those rights The validity of the law which deprived a citizen of his personal liberty which inevitably destroys his rights under the sub clauses mentioned above cannot be judged by the test of reasonableness laid down in clauses to of article but falls to be determined according to the provisions of articles and of the Constitution Such being the correct correlation between article sub clauses a to and on the one hand and article on the other the question necessarily arises as to the correlation between article and article Article guarantees to a citizen as one of his freedoms the right to acquire hold and dispose of property but reasonable restrictions may be imposed on the exercise of that right to the extent indicated in clause What I ask myself is the correlation between article read with article and article If as held by my Lord in <NAME> case at page sub clauses a to and of article read with the relevant clauses to presuppose that the citizen to whom the possession of these fundamental rights is secured retains the substratum of personal freedom on which alone the enjoyment of these rights necessarily rests it must follow logically that article read with article must likewise presuppose that the person to whom that fundamental right is guaranteed retains his property over or with respect to which alone that right may be exercised I found myself unable to escape from this logical conclusion and so I said in <NAME> case at pages But suppose a person loses his property by reason of its having been compulsorily acquired under article he loses his right to hold that property and cannot complain that his fundamental right under subclause of clause of article has been infringed It follows that the rights enumerated in article subsist while the citizen has the legal capacity to exercise them If his capacity to exercise them is gone by reason of lawful conviction with respect to the rights in sub clauses a to and or by reason of a lawful compulsory acquisition with respect to the right in sub clause he ceases to have those rights while his incapacity lasts A suggestion was thrown out by my Lord in course of arguments that article was concerned only with the abstract right and capacity to acquire hold and dispose of property and had no reference or relation to any rights in any particular property but that article only was concerned with the right to a concrete property and there was no correlation between the two articles For the purpose of this appeal I am content to proceed on the footing that article relates to abstract right as well as to right to concrete property The clauses of that article which are material for the purposes of determining the question in debate run as follows No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law Nothing in clause shall affect a the provisions of any existing law other than a law to which the provisions of clause apply or the provisions of any law which the State may hereafter make i for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty or ii for the promotion of public health or the prevention of danger to life or property or iii in pursuance of any agreement entered into between the Government of the Dominion of India or the Government of India and the Government of any other country or otherwise with respect to property declared by law to be evacuee property Further if this line of reasoning were correct or permissible then we might as well have said as indeed we were asked to say that article reproduced the American constitutional limitationsa gainst deprivation of life and personal liberties and that therefore the expression procedure established by law to be found in article meant exactly what the expression dueprocess of law occurring in the Fifth Amendmentdid This we resolutely and definitely declinedto do in <NAME> case supra After quoting the words of <NAME> about the great and essential rights of the people my Lord concluded at page This has been translated into positive law in Part III of the Indian Constitution and I agree that in construing these provisions the high purpose and spirit of the Preamble as well as the constitutional significance of a Declaration of Fundamental Rights should be borne in mind This however is not to say that the languageof the provisions should be stretched to square withthis or that constitutional theory in disregard of the cardinal rule of interpretation of any enactment constitutional or other that its spirit no less than its intendment should be collected primarily from the natural meaning of the words used I shall deal with that argument in detail hereafter and show that it is quite untenable Accordingly I thus explained what I conceived to be the true scope and effect of clauses and of article in <NAME> case supra at page namely that clause deals with deprivation of property in exercise of police power and enunciates the restriction which our Constitution makers thought necessary or sufficient to be placed on the exercise of that power namely that such power can be exercised only by authority of law and not by a mere executive fiat and that clause deals with the exercise of the power of eminent domain and places limitations on the exercise of that power The language used in article clearly indicates beyond doubt that the power of eminent domain as adopted in our Constitution is concerned with only that kind of deprivation of property which is brought about by the taking of possession or acquisition contemplated by that clause I see no compelling or cogent reason for changing the views I expressed on this point in my judgments in those two cases Clause of that article secures to the citizens of India seven specified rights but clauses to permit the <ORG> to make laws imposing reasonable limitations on the exercise of these seven rights as therein mentioned The argument is that clauses to recognise the police power of the <ORG> in that they permit it to make laws imposing restrictions on the seven rights of the citizens and that they at the same time regulate that power by placing limitations upon it by requiring that the restrictions which may be imposed must be reasonable It is then pointed out that the <ORG> police power is further saved by article and it is concluded that the police power having been recognised and provided for in article and article there is no necessity to read article as concerned with the <ORG> police power at all I say that there is no force in this objection for the following reasons a article enumerates seven rights to freedom and guarantees them to the citizens of India Clauses to of that article recognise and regulate the exercise of police power over those rights by the <ORG> through its legislative organ for the <ORG> is by those clauses permitted to impose reasonable restrictions by law only Where then is the citizen protection against the exercise of police power by the executive over his property It is nowhere except in article as construed by me Article guarantees the seven rights of the citizens only and recognises and regulates the exercise of police power over those rights by the legislative organ of the <ORG> A non citizen is entirely outside that article and consequently he has none of those seven rights and has no protection against the <ORG> under that article He has therefore to fail back upon article and contended that all his personal liberties including the six rights enunciated in article a to and are protected against the exercise of police power by the <ORG> through its executive or legislative limb Finally clauses to of article authorise the <ORG> to make laws imposing reasonable restrictions on the citizen rights under clause <NAME> said at page Therefore article cannot apply to a substantive law depriving a citizen of personal liberty I am unable to accept the contention that the word deprivation includes within its scope restriction when interpreting article My Lord the present Chief Justice expressed his views at in the words following The use of the word restrictions in the various sub clauses seems to imply in the context that the rights guaranteed by the article are still capable of being exercised and to exclude the idea of incarceration though the words restriction and deprivation are sometimes used as interchangeable terms as restriction may reach a point where it may well amount to deprivation The contrary view expressed by a Bench of <ORG> was rejected by my Lord at the end of page with the following remark <NAME> expressed the same view in the following passage at page in his judgment in that case Preventive detention in substance is a negation the freedom of locomotion guaranteed under article but it cannot be said that it merely restricts it and the purpose of article is to indicate the limits within which the <ORG> could by legislation impose restrictions on the exercise of these fights by the individuals The reasonableness or otherwise of such legislation can indeed be determined by the court to the extent laid down in the several clauses of article though no such review is permissible with regard to laws relating to deprivation oflife and personal liberty His Lordship concluded thus at page The result is that in my opinion the first contention raised by Mr <NAME> cannot succeed and it must be held that we are not entitled to examine the reasonableness or otherwise of the Preventive Detention Act and see whether it is within the permissible bounds specified in clause of article After discussing the matter at some length at pages I concluded on page In my judgment article has no beating on the question of the validity or otherwise of preventive detention and that being so clause which prescribes a test of reasonableness to be defined and applied by the court has no application at all A suggestion was made that although in <NAME> case supra the word restriction occurring in clauses to could not in its application to sub clauses a to and be taken as extending to deprivation there is no compelling reason to hold that the word restriction occurring in clause may not in its application to sub clause cover derivation There is no substance in this contention Clause covers sub clauses and and surely one and the same word restriction used in one and the same clause cannot have one meaning in its application to sub clauses and and a different meaning and connotation in its application to subclause Further the reasons why in <NAME> case supra that word was given a narrower meaning in its application to sub clauses a to and apply mutatis mutandis in its application to sub clause read in correlation to article It is therefore clear from the decision of this court in <NAME> case supra that article does not give any protection against deprivation of property as distinct from mere restriction imposed on the right to property If in such circumstances both those clauses are read in the way suggested by learned counsel for the respondent <NAME> namely as dealing only with the topic of the <ORG> power of eminent domain then there will remain no escape from the conclusion that in the Republic of India neither a citizen nor a non citizen has any constitutional protection against the exercise of police power either by the legislative or executive organ of the <ORG> Item i under sub clause comprises future laws imposing or levying any tax or penalty It is pointed out that in the matter of imposition of restrictions on the exercise of the right to acquire hold and dispose of property the only limitation on the police power is that the restrictions to be imposed by law must be reasonable as indicated in article but that in the matter of deprivation of property by authority of law under article the limitation on the police power is more stringent namely that such law may be made only for the promotion of public health or the prevention of danger to life or property as mentioned in clause ii and for no other purpose If both clauses and of article deal with and impose restrictions only on the <ORG> power of eminent domain then there was no real necessity for exempting by article the taxation power or the police power from the operation of the power of eminent domain for ex hypothesis the two first mentioned powers being distinct from the power of eminent domain did not and could not fail within the last mentioned power and therefore needed no exemption Even a casual student of Constitutional law knows that money is one of the kinds of property which it is said cannot be taken in exercise of the <ORG> power of eminent domain and that being so there could be no necessity for exempting laws imposing taxes from the operation of article which embodies only the doctrine of eminent domain There was therefore no necessity for expressly saving the police power of our <ORG> by a constitutional provision ii According to the argument article saves the power of the <ORG> to make certain laws in exercise of its power of taxation or its police power If our sense of the sanctity of private property is not shocked at the prospect of leaving our property at the unfettered mercy of the <ORG> in respect of laws of the kind specified in clause ii I do not see why the construction suggested by me should be rejected only on the ground that it will give a carte blanche to the <ORG> to make any law it pleases for the deprivation of property in exercise of police power iii Article gives us no protection against the executive with respect to the exercise of these powers not intended to be a protection against the executive in the exercise of the power of taxation cannot for a moment be doubted for if it were so intended there was no necessity then for inserting into the Constitution article providing that no taxes Likewise article ii saves certain laws and does not in terms give us any protection against the exercise of police power by the executive But it is quite easy to contemplate laws which do not fall within article ii but are nevertheless made mistakably in exercise of the <ORG> police power A construction which leads to the astounding result of compelling the <ORG> to buy up obscene pictures and A law which in such circumstances authorises the <ORG> to take possession of the tram depot and run the tram cars by the military or other personnel during such emergency for the convenience of the travelling public is not within clause ii and on this construction will be void if it does not provide for compensation to the tramway company The suggested construction may even make it difficult to support any future law containing provisions similar to those in the procedure codes or other laws not strictly falling within the clause ii but authorising the seizure of books documents or other property or the appointment of a receiver or sequestrator to take possession of property for in all such cases there will be a deprivation of property A construction which takes a law made really and essentially in exercise of the power of eminent domain out of article cannot readily be accepted as cogent or correct There is nothing in the language of our Constitution which compels us to adopt such a construction The last objection to reading article as the enunciation of the fundamental right against deprivation of property by the exercise of police power and reading article as laying down limitations on the <ORG> power of eminent domain is that so read article will in reality afford no effective protection at all for the <ORG> will always exercise its police power under article and deprive a person of his property without any compensation by the simple device of making a law and will never exercise its power of eminent domain under article Where then it is asked is our protection against the <ORG> with respect to our property The objection thus formulated overlooks the difference between the nature and purpose of the two powers which I shall presently discuss and explain and is not otherwise well rounded for the following reasons It is incorrect to say that article as construed by me gives no protection at all It certainly gives protection against deprivation of property by executive fiat just as did that part of the famous th Clause of <ORG> which proclaimed that no free person should be dispossessed of any free tenement of his except by the law of the land of our article as I apprehend it are the same as those of <ORG> Our Constitution makers evidently considered the protection against deprivation of property in exercise of police power or of the power of eminent domain by the executive to be of greater importance than the protection against deprivation of property brought about by the exercise of the power of taxation by the executive for they found a place for the first mentioned protection in article and set out in Part III dealing with fundamental rights while they placed the last mentioned protection in article to be found in Part XII dealing with finance etc There is no shorter cut in such a case Apart from this the citizens of India have further protection against the legislature in respect of their right to acquire hold and dispose of property This right is guaranteed to them by article The Constitution however recognises by clause that the <ORG> has police power to restrict the right in the interest of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled tribe but prescribes a limitation on this police power by requiring that the restrictions to be imposed by law must be reasonable This is no ground for rejecting my construction for on the construction suggested to the contrary the position is exactly the same for article only saves certain laws from article that is to say recognises the police power but does not formulate any test for determining the validity of those laws which may be as unreasonable as the legislature may make them What I next ask is the protection which our Constitution gives to any person against the legislature in the matter of deprivation even of life or personal liberty None except the requirement of article namely a procedure to be established by the legislature itself and a skeleton procedure prescribed in article In <NAME> case supra notwithstanding the reference made to the epigrammatic observation of <NAME> in <NAME> Porte to the effect that it sounded very much like the Constitution speaking to the legislature that the latter could not infringe our right unless it chose to do so the majority of this Court declined to question the wisdom and policy of the Constitution or to stretch the language of article so as to square it with its own notions of what the ambit of the right should be but felt bound to give effect to the plain words of the Constitution Even if the legislature indulges in occasional vagaries we have to put up with it for the time being Our protection against legislative tyranny if any lies in ultimate analysis in a free and intelligent public opinion which must eventually assert itself Having dealt with the correlation between clauses and of article as I apprehend it and having considered and rejected the objections to the conclusions I have arrived at I proceed now to examine and analyse the provisions of clause article has imposed three conditions on the exercise of the <ORG> power of eminent domain over private property and those limitations constitute the protection granted tO the owner of the property as his fundamental right It insists that this sovereign power may be exercised only if it is authorised by a law taken possession of or acquired and their grammatical variations as used in article It is pointed out that the last clause of the Fifth Amendment which deals with eminent domain uses the word taken and it is suggested that as our article deals with the same topic of eminent domain it will be reasonable to hold that our article reproduces the American constitutional limitations and that therefore the expression taken possession of or acquired used in our article must be read as having the same meaning which has been attributed by the Judges of <ORG> of the United <ORG>s to the word taken occurring in their Fifth Amendment If the words used have acquired a technical or special meaning that meaning must be given to them the same wide meaning as the American courts have given to the word taken is to ignore the entire historical background of the law relating to compulsory acquisition of private property by the <ORG> Under the English law on which more or less our modern laws are rounded the term acquisition has a special meaning This means that the owner is divested and his title passes by operation of law to the <ORG> In the context in which the word acquisition appears in article it can only mean and refer to acquisition of the entire interest of the previous holder by transfer of title and It follows from what has been stated above that the word acquired used in article must be given the special meaning which that word has acquired and cannot be read as synonymous with taken as used in the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States It was therefore concluded that there must be a taking whenever there was any injury to property otherwise than by the police power or taxation which if done by a private individual would be actionable as a tort in other words that it must be held that there would be a taking whenever any of the rights powers privileges or immunities making up the ownership was taken from the owner Our Constitution makers were well aware of the very wide meaning eventually given to the word taken by the American courts Our Constitution makers on the contrary deliberately chose to adopt the narrower view point and accordingly used the words taken possession of in order to make it quite clear that they required compensation to be paid only when there was an actual taking of the property out of the possession of the owner or possessor into the possession of the <ORG> or its nominee It is finally said that both clauses and of article deal with the topic of eminent domain and therefore the expression taken possession of or acquired occurring in clause has the same meaning which the word deprived used in clause has In other words both the clauses are concerned with deprivation of property and there is no reason to think that the expression taken possession of or acquired was usedin clause to indicate any particular kind or shadeof deprivation The Obvious retort that at once comes to one mind is that if it were intended by our Constitution makers to convey the same general idea of deprivation of property by whatever means or mode it was brought about why did they use the word deprived in clause and why did they use in clause a different expression which as commonly used and understood connotes a much narrower meaning It would have been quite easy to frame clause by using the word deprived instead of the expression taken possession of oracquired The words used in those entries are acquisition or requisitioning ortheir grammatical variations In section of the Government of India Act the words taking of possession did not occur nor did they occur in any of the legislative lists in the Seventh Schedule to that Act but they have been introduced in article and in the three entries mentioned above the word requisitioning has been added after the word acquisition If taken possession of or acquired occurring in article be given a meaning wider than what is meant by acquired or requisitioned or their variations used in the entries then it will amount to saying that article even contemplates a law with the respect to matters which are beyond the legislative powers conferred on <ORG> and <ORG>s for they can only make a law with respect to acquisition or requisitioning To counter this reasoning it is pointed out that <ORG> under the Union List has the residuary power of legislation and therefore there is no difficulty in giving a wider meaning to the expression taken possession of or acquired It will then amount to giving one and the same expression different meanings Thus in its application to a law made by <ORG> taken possession of or acquired must perforce mean requisitioned or acquired whereas in its application to a law made by <ORG> it will have a much wider meaning A further question however arises at this stage and it may be now considered Although in none of the above cases there is any acquisition of property involving a transfer of title there is in each of the above cases a taking of possession and destruction of property by the <ORG> by authority of law and yet nobody will say that any of the above laws authorise the taking of possession of the property within the meaning of article so that if such law does not provide for compensation the law will be unconstitutional and void It is a law which authorises the <ORG> to take possession of the estate of a disqualified proprietor and to manage it for him There is no transfer of title to the <ORG> and therefore there is no acquisition of property by the <ORG> The learned Attorney General has also drawn our attention to statutes namely Act XLVII of The Insurance Amendment Act passed on the th May and which has added several sections to the Insurance Act Act LI of Railway Companies Emergency Provisions Act passed on the th September and Act LXV of Industries Development and Regulation Act enacted on the th October in support of his contention As all the three Acts were passed after the Constitution came into force and as they may be challenged in future an argument rounded on them will really be begging the question in debate before us What then is the test for determining whether a taking of possession authorised by a particular law is a taking of possession in exercise of the power of eminent domain or is a taking of possession in exercise of the <ORG> police power Thus the police power is exercised in the interest of the community and the power of eminent domain is exercised to implement a public purpose and in both cases there is a taking of possession of private property There is however a marked distinction between the exercise of these two sovereign powers In police power the <ORG> destroys or extinguishes or takes possession of property in order to prevent the owner from indulging in anti social activities or otherwise inflicting injury upon the legitimate interests of other members of the community either by using his property in a manner he should not do or by omitting to use it in a manner he should do that having purchased the entire <NAME>ne at a revenue sale the respondent <NAME> had under the old section of the Act of acquired the valuable right to annul the under tenures and to eject the under tenants and that he had actually obtained a decree for ejectment but that he had been deprived of those vested rights by the operation of section of the amending Act which in effect gave retrospective operation to the new section Assuming that the right to annul under tenures and to eject under tenants and the decree for ejectment come within the term property as used in article as to which I have considerable doubts the question at once arises whether they have been taken possession of or acquired under the impugned Act He can realise rents and exercise all acts of ownership except that he cannot exercise the right to annul the under tenures or eject any under tenants or execute the decree he has obtained But have these last mentioned rights been taken possession of or acquired by the <ORG> within the meaning of article There is no doubt that the <ORG> has not acquired these rights in the sense I have explained for there has been no transfer by agreement or by operation of law of those rights from the respondent <NAME> to the <ORG> or anybody else Whether the restrictions are such as would bring the case within the mischief of article of the Constitution I will examine presently but I have no hesitation in holding that they do not amount to dispossession of the shareholders from these rights in the sense that the rights have been usurped by other people who are exercising them in place of the displaced shareholders The truth is that these rights have not been taken possession of or acquired at all in exercise of the power of eminent domain but have been extinguished or destroyed in exercise of the <ORG> police power to prevent public mischief and anti social activities referred to in the objects and reasons appended to the bill which eventually became the impugned law If the impugned section is regarded as imposing a restriction on the right of <NAME> to hold property then for reasons I have mentioned I hold such restrictions in the circumstances of this case to be quite reasonable and permissible under article If the impugned section operates as an extinguishment of his right to property treating the right to annul under tenures and to eject under tenants and to execute the decree for ejectment as property then in my judgment these rights of the respondent <NAME> have not been taken possession of or acquired by the <ORG> within the meaning of article but he has been deprived of his property by authority of law under article which calls for no compensation I would therefore allow the appeal with costs both here and in <ORG> <NAME> concur with my Lord the Chief Justice that the view of <ORG> Calcutta that section of the West Bengal Revenue Sales West Bengal Amendment Act is void as abridging the fundamental rights of the first respondent under article and of the Constitution cannot be sustained and I agree with the order proposed by him <NAME> have had the advantage of reading the judgments of my Lord the Chief Justice and of my learned brother Justice <NAME> On the assumption that the question raised in this case is one that arises under article and of the Constitution that being the footing on which the learned Judges of <ORG> dealt with the case I agree with that portion of the judgment of my learned brother Justice <NAME> which holds that the impugned section of the Bengal Land Revenue Sales West Bengal Amendment Act West Bengal Act VII of is intra vires and for the reasons stated by him My Lord the Chief Justice is inclined to the view that the fundamental right declared in article has no reference to concrete property rights but refers only to the natural rights and freedoms inherent in the status of a citizen That scheme as I understand it is this The respective legislatures in the country have plenary powers assigned to them with reference to the various subjects covered by the entries enumerated in the Lists of the Seventh Schedule by virtue of articles to These powers are subject to the limitation under article that the power is not to be so exercised as to infringe the fundamental rights declared in Part III of the Constitution And therefore the legislatures can exercise every power including the police power if it is necessary to import that concept within these limits in so far as it is not provided for in article to and article ii or other specific provisions in the Constitution if any I agree with my learned brother Justice <NAME> that the Constitution envisages a large measure of social control a means to achieve the goal set out in the preamble and in the directive principles enumerated in Part IV I am also of the view that the <ORG>s may not ignore the directive principles as having no bearing on the interpretation of constitutional problems since article categorically states that it shall be the duty of the <ORG> including the legislature by virtue of the definition of <ORG> in Part III made applicable by article to apply these principles in making laws But it appears to me that its scope may well be wider But it appears to me that if in article acquisition and taking possession were meant to be synonymous with deprivation already used in article there was no reason to drop the use of the word deprivation in article and to use other words and phrases therein It appears to me that while the framers of the Constitution laid down the requirement of the authority of law for deprivation of property with a larger connotation they limited the requirement of payment of compensation to what may reasonably be comprehended within the concepts of acquisition and taking possession That the idea of transference of title or possession is not necessarily to be implied by article appears to me to be also indicated by article ii which more often than not would cover cases of destruction of property The question then remains as to what is property contemplated by article apart from the specified categories included therein by enumeration in the phrase any interest in or in any company owning any commercial or industrial undertaking This to my mind excludes for instance a bare individual right out of the bundle of rights which go to make up property as being itself property for purposes of article unless such individual right is in itself recognised by law as property or as an interest in property an easement a profits a prendre and the like and as capable of distinctive acquisition or possession In my view however the word property as used in article may have been intended to be understood in a wider sense and deprivation of any individual right out of a bundle of rights constituting concrete property may be deprivation of property which would require the authority of law It seems to me to serve a distinct purpose over and above that relating to the law of Eminent Domain viz that this is a case falling under article and is in my opinion correct In the result I agree that the appeal should be allowed with costs here and in <ORG>
