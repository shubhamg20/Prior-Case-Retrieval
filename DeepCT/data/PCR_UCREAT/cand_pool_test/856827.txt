HEADNOTE The assessee was carrying on business in Malaya and was owning rubber plantations By the year <ORG> was encouraging More and more Indian citizens to establish branches in countries with which there was no special agreement for the avoidance of double taxation and was substituted in place of the old one in for the purpose of giving double taxation relief in respect of taxes on income charged in any country by deduction or otherwise under the law in force in that country if the concession that was being given by the new section for encouraging Indian citizens to start business in foreign countries was only to give relief at the full rate of Indian income tax instead of half such tax all that was necessary by the amendment was to delete the words one half occurring in the section prior to its amendment But the words such doubly taxed income have reference to the foreign income which bears once again the burden of Indian income tax by its being included the total income chargeable under read with of the Act Under ii the income which accrues to an assessee outside the taxable territories is to be included in the total income so that the income under any of the heads enumerated in which has accrued or arisen to the assessee outside the taxable territory and is subject to the tax under the law in force in that country is included in his total income attracting the levy of charge under the Indian Income Tax Act and is therefore doubly taxed A Once it is recognized that does not make the basis of relief the tax paid on the income from the same head or source then the relief to which in assessee would be entitled would be the amount of tax on the foreign income which by its inclusion in the total income once again bears under the Act The word such in the phrase such doubly taxed income has reference to the foreign income which is being subjected to tax by its inclusion in the computation of income under the Act and not the same income under an identical head of income under the Act The scheme of the Act is that although income is classified under different heads and the income under each head is separately computed in accordance with the provisions dealing with that particular bead of income the income which is the subject matter of tax under the Act is one income which is the total income There is nothing in the language of which either expressly or by necessary implication restricts the grant of double taxation relief to incomes under the same head Under our income tax law in every assessment year the total income of an assessee during the previous year is brought to tax It is made up of income from various sources set out in The section attracts into the pool income profits and gains from whatever sources derived which are received or deemed to be received in the taxable territory in the previous year by the assessee and one of the components is the income that has accrued or arisen to him in the previous year outside the taxable territory If the entire tax paid by the assessee in a country outside India is to be deducted while computing his tax liability in this country then there is no necessity for the <ORG> to enact A After amendment relief is given on such doubly taxed income The two expressions the same income and such doubly taxed income mean the same thing <NAME> <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the judgment prepared by my learned brother Reddy <NAME> I regret I am unable to agree with the construction placed by him on of the Indian Income tax Act to be hereinafter referred to as the Act I agree with him that there is considerable difficulty in interpreting that provision but that does not absolve this <ORG> from its duty of properly construing that provision The facts of the case are fully set out in the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> It is needless to repeat those facts in their entirety During the relevant previous year the deceased assesses who carried on business in Malaya and also owned rubber gardens abroad declared his foreign income as Rs In that business he suffered a loss of Rs In this country his income from other sources amounted to Rs The Income tax Officer added his income arising outside that taxable territories with his income from other sources in India Rs He came to the conclusion that the income that has suffered double taxation was only Rs Under our Income tax law in every assessment year the total income of an assessee during the previous year is brought to tax Both the expressions income as well as dividend include certain receipts which are deemed as income or dividend One of the components which makes up the total income is the income that has accrued or arisen to a resident in India in the previous year outside the taxable territory The portion of the section that is material for our present purpose runs thus If any person who is resident in the taxable territories in any year proves that in respect of his income which accrued or arises during that year without the taxable territories he has paid in any country by deduction or otherwise under the law in force in that country he shall be entitled to the deduction from the Indian income tax payable by him of a sum calcu lated on such doubly taxed income at the Indian rate of tax or the rate of tax of the said country whichever is the lower emphasis supplied Before analyzing the ingredients of this provision it is necessary to mention that gives relief to the extent mentioned in that section in respect of the income accruing or arising in countries outside India with which our country has no reciprocal agreement for relief or avoidance of double taxation In cases falling under that section relief to be granted depends upon the terms of the concerned agreement There is no dispute that the first three conditions enumerated above have been satisfied in the present case If the entire tax paid by the assessee in a country outside India is to be deducted while computing his tax liability in this country then there was no necessity for the <ORG> to enact A Prior to that the section read If any person who has paid by deduction or otherwise Indian Income tax for any year in respect of any income arising without the taxable territories in a country the laws of which do not provide for any relief in respect of income tax charged in the taxable terri tories proves that he has paid income tax by deduction or otherwise under the laws of the said country in respect of the same income he shall be entitled to the deduction from the Indian Income tax payable of a sum equal to one half of such Indian Income tax or to one half of such tax payable in the said country whichever is less Under the present provision relief is given to such doubly taxed income The expression the same income and such doubly taxed income mean the same thing The relevant portion of that section reads as follows If any person who has paid by deduction or otherwise or is liable to pay United Kingdom income tax for any year of assessment on any part of his income Proves to the satisfaction of the Special Commissioners that he has paid Dominion income tax for that year in respect of the same part of his income he shall be entitled to relief from United Kingdom income tax paid or payable by him on that part of his income at a rate thereon to be determined as follows a If the Dominion rate of tax does not exceed onehalf of the appropriate rate of United Kingdom tax the rate at which relief is to be given shall be the Dominion rate of tax In any other case the rate at which relief is to be given shall be one half of the appropriate rate of United Kingdom tax But the two expressions mean the same thing In <ORG> Short question arose as to what extent the assessee was entitled to relief from double taxation under the aforementioned In the course of his judgment his Lordship observed If you read the first few lines of the section really on the words of it the section only appears to apply where this overlapping of taxation has been partial that is to say where a man has part of his income taxed doubly and not where he has the whole taxed doubly which obviously cannot be intended When the matter was taken up in appeal to <ORG> <NAME> set put the conditions on which the relief can be given under The basic condition is that a person has paid tax on his income over here then if some part of that income so charged and assessed to tax in the United Kingdom can be identified and proved to have paid <ORG> tax that same part which has suffered dual taxation can be relieved of the tax paid here up to the measure of relief given by the <ORG> The assessee company which was incorporated and controlled in the United Kingdom carried On the business of running a railway working coal mines brickwords etc From this decision it is seen that the total income of the assessee arising or accruing in United Kingdom for the purpose of double taxation relief was split into four parts i income arising in England the interest on debenture that was given deduction to in India the tea garden profits and the other income There was no dispute that the income from the investments in England was not to be taken into consideration while deter mining the double taxation relief If we apply the same ratio to the facts of the case before us we have to exclude from consideration while determining the double taxation relief the income of Rs It seems clear that there must be a definite part of income brought into question and that can only be expressed in a sum of money The contention of the appellants is to the contrary it is said on their behalf that the words the same part of his income refer solely to what is called the source and that identity of amount is immaterial and does not come into question except for the purpose of ascertaining the rate of tax to be allowed for These observations if I may say so with respect clearly bring out the legal principles bearing on the issue under discussion There is no doubt that some of the observations made in that case lend support to the arguments advanced on behalf of the assessee In the result I dismiss these appeals Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> is right in its view that the Commissioner of <ORG> had jurisdiction to revise the order of refund section read with section is independent and distinct from the assessment order reference was not pressed as such substantially the third question in that reference and the first and second questions in the other two references which deal with the validity of the order of the Commissioner and <ORG> need alone be considered in these appeals In the other two references it is not necessary to refer to the incomes earned by him abroad and in India except to say that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner allowed the appeal in part holding that the income from all the sources in India have to be considered together just as income from all sources abroad must be considered together and in that view held that the net assessed income in India from Malaya is what has suffered double tax A great deal would depend on the approach to the question and the meaning to be given to such doubly taxed income Before the amendment of that section by the Finance Act with effect from st April there were other provisions giving relief in respect of Part States and Dominion income tax and agreement for avoidance of double taxation in India Pakistan or apart from which granted relief in respect of income tax We may point out that for the first time relief in respect of tax charged in a country which did not provide for relief in respect of the British Indian income tax was granted under the said section introduced by the Indian Income tax Amendment Act in the Act of Since the last two sub sections deal with income of a resident in the taxable territories accruing or arising to him during that year in Pakistan they do not assume any relevance for the purposes of this case What he in fact contends is that the income from interest and from property assessed in India amounting to Rs did not arise outside India as such it cannot be taken into account in determining whether the tax paid outside is not doubly taxed Thirdly having regard to the scheme of the Act and the method of computation of income arising both within and without India income must be considered under separate heads in order to ascertain whether any income has been actually taxed or not has no relation at all with the income arising in Malaya and cannot be taken into consideration under This would be so he says even if it came under the same head We may at once state that these decisions are rendered on the provisions which are not in pari materia with the provisions in It was held on the terms of that article and the clause in the schedule that what was attributable to the Ceylon law was only that tax which was ultimately levied on the assessee and demanded but he was not entitled to abatement of tax that he would have to pay before deduction of the allowance given by of the Ceylon Income Tax Ordinance Section of the Finance Act is as under If any person who has paid by deduction or otherwise or is liable to pay United Kingdom incometax for any year of assessment on any part of his income proves to the satisfaction of the Special Commissioners that he has paid Dominion income tax for that year in respect of the same part of his income he shall be entitled to relief from United Kingdom income tax paid or payable by him on that part of his income at a rate thereon to be determined as follows a if the <ORG> rate of tax does not exceed one half of the appropriate rate of United Kingdom The assessee claimed that as it had paid both United Kingdom tax and Indian income tax for assessment year on its Indian profits for those years it was entitled to relief under from United Kingdom income tax <ORG> at gave the reasons for disallowance thus When the Indian income in the year of assessment calculated according to Indian methods is more than the Indian income calculated according to British methods then he will only get relief calculated with reference to the amount of the English calculated income upon which he has paid English Income Tax The basic condition is that a person has paid tax on his income over here then if some part of that income so charged and assessed to tax in the United Kingdom can be identified and proved to have paid Dominion tax that same part which has suffered dual taxation can be relieved of the tax paid here up to the measure of relief given by In <ORG> case <ORG> were considering the case of an assessee company which earned profits in India amounting to pound which sum was liable to United Kingdom income tax Lord <NAME> while pointing out that the more the question raised in the appeal is considered the greater is the difficulty it presents said he was inclined to agree with the construction placed by Lord <NAME> who in his speech indicated the reasoning for the particular construction placed by him I see no reason why for the purpose of identification any other meaning should be given to the word part than the numerical meaning The tax payer has paid <ORG> Income Tax in respect of Ex of his income he is entitled to relief in respect of pound part of the same income and to no more In that case it was ultimately held that when a company controlled in the United Kingdom carries on business in a <ORG> the relief from the United Kingdom Income tax under in respect of that business is to be determined by ascertaining the assessable income following the legislative directions in those respective countries as to allowances or deductions and thereafter without scrutinizing those allowances or deductions by an individual comparison with a different system in other part of the Commonwealth relief should be granted to the extent of the smaller amount there was no need to record anything else except the two statutory incomes of the business taking care to see that neither includes income from any other source These cases show that the actual tax paid on the Dominion income statutorily determined would alone be considered for relief that the relief which under can be claimed is the statutory income of the Dominion derived from the same source which has been taken into account in the United Kingdom from the same source The word source has been differently understood by different law Lords but in effect as Lord <NAME> observed in the <ORG> case the words the same part of his income are apt to include both elements of comparison and identification It may be mentioned that after the Income tax Amendment Act the residents of India became liable annually to be taxed on their world income which naturally would bring to tax income which has accrued in a foreign country and has been subjected to tax there and would also be subject to tax under the Act It took time even for conditions to settle down and become normal and even then the change of outlook in those countries had to be faced particularly in the field of fiscal laws before our citizens could have the confidence to re invest in ventures abroad By things became more settled and the Government of India with a view to encourage more and more Indian residents to establish branches in countries with which there is no special agreement for the avoidance of double taxation by its Press Note Finance Department New Delhi dated May made it known that certain proposals were being considered by it in that behalf and in accordance with that Press Note the Income tax Amendment Bill was introduced to amend the section with effect from the assessment year ending st March covering its operations unilaterally even to the United Kingdom The objects and reasons for the amendment of of the Act and Clause of the Amendment Bill of gives the following reasons The provision as proposed to be amended secures that this unilateral relief will be increased from one half to the abatement of tax at the full Indian rate or the full foreign rate whichever is lower As respects the income accruing or arising in the <ORG> is empowered to make this unilateral basis of relief applicable if necessary for the assessment years and In interpreting the amended where the assessee is en tided to the deduction from Indian income tax payable by him under the Act the tax paid in a foreign country are we to give the same meaning to the words of a sum calculated on such doubly taxed income as that which has to be given to the words in respect of the same income occurring under the repealed In other words is the phrase such doubly taxed income of similar import as the same income It has re drafted the entire section with a different emphasis and this advantage was also afforded unilaterally under sub in relation to any income accruing or arising in and chargeable under the Act for the period specified therein The words such doubly taxed income can have reference to the tax which the foreign income bears once again the burden of Indian income tax by its being included in the total income chargeable under read with which defines it as the total amount of income profits and gains referred to in sub of computed in the manner laid down in the Act The word such in the phrase such doubly taxed income has reference to the foreign income which is again being subjected to tax by its inclusion in the computation of the income under the Act and not the same income under an identical head of income under the Act The income from each head under is not under the Act subjected to tax separately unless the legislature has used words to indicate a comparison of similar incomes but it is the total income which is computed and assessed as such in respect of which tax relief is given for the inclusion of the foreign income on which tax had been paid according to the law in force in that country There is indeed nothing in the language of section which either expressly or by necessary implication restricts the grant of double taxation relief to incomes under the same head In the result the appeals are allowed with costs here and in <ORG>
