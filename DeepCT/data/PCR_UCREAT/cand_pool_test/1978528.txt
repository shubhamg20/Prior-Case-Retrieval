On behalf of the petitioners applicant it was submitted that the answers given to the questions as set out at the end of the majority Judgment lay down the true ratio of the Judgment It was submitted mat any observation made in the body of the judgment had to be read in the context of the answers given It is further submitted that the private unaided professional educational institutions had been given complete autonomy not only as regards the admission of students but also as regards the termination of their own fee structure If was submitted that these institutions could fix their own fee structure which could include a reasonable revenue surplus for purposes of development of education and expansion of the institution and that so long as there was no profiteering or charging of capitation fees there could be no interference by the Government It was submitted that the right to admit students is an essential facet of the right to administer and so long as admission to the unaided educational institutions is on a fair and transparent basis and on the basis of merit government cannot interfere It was submitted that these institutions are entitled to fill up all their seats by adopting evolving a rational and transparent method of admission which ensures that merit is adequately taken care of On behalf of non minority institutions it was submitted that they also had a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions and that the majority Judgment puts them on a par with the minority institutes As against this on behalf of <ORG> various State Governments and some students who sought to intervene it was submitted that the right to set up and administer an educational institution was not an absolute right and this right is subject to reasonable restrictions and that this right is subject even in respect of minority institutions to national interest It was submitted that <ORG> the States Universities had statutory rights to fix the fees and to regulate admission of students in order to ensure a that there was no profiteering capitation fees were not charged admissions were based on principles of merit and to ensure that persons from the backward classes and poorer sections of society also had an opportunity to receive education particularly professional education It was submitted that unless it was ensured that colleges admit students strictly on the basis of merit at a common entrance test it would be impossible to ensure that capitation fees were not charged and that there was no profiteering It was submitted that the majority Judgment clarified that Article had been enacted not for the purposes of giving any special right or privileges to the minority educational institutions but to ensure that the minorities had equal rights with the majority In view of the rival submissions the following questions arise for consideration whether the educational institutions arc entitled to fix their own fee structure whether minority and non minority educational institutions stand on the SAME footing and have the same rights whether private unaided professional colleges are entitled to fill in their seats to the extent of and if not to what extent and whether private unaided professional colleges are entitled to admit students by evolving their own method of admission Question No Each institute must have the freedom to fix its own fee structure taking into consideration the need to generate funds to run the institution and to provide facilities necessary for the benefit of the students The fee structure for each institute must be fixed keeping in mind the infrastructure and facilities available the investments made salaries paid to the teachers and staff future plans for expansion and or betterment of the institution etc As at present mere are statutes regulations which govern the fixation of fees and as this <ORG> had not yet considered the validity of those statutes regulations we direct that in order to give effect to the judgment in <ORG> case the respective State Governments concerned authority shall set up in each State a committee headed by a retired High <ORG> judge who shall be nominated by the Chief Justice of that State A representative of <ORG> in short <ORG> or <ORG> in short <ORG> depending on the type of institution shall also be a member Each educational Institute must place before this <ORG> well in advance of the academic year its proposed fee structure Along with the proposed fee structure all relevant documents and books of accounts must also be produced before the committee for their scrutiny The <ORG> shall then decide whether the fees proposed by that institute are justified and are not profiteering or charging capitation fee The <ORG> will be at liberty to approve the fee structure or to propose some other fee which can be charged by the institute The fee fixed by the committee shall be binding for a period of three years at the end of which period the institute would be at liberty to apply for revision Once fees are fixed by the <ORG> the institute cannot charge cither directly or indirectly any other amount over and above the amount fixed as fees If any other amount is charged under any other head or guise donations the same would amount to charging of capitation fee The Governments appropriate authorities should consider framing appropriate regulations if not already framed whereunder if it is found that an institution is charging capitation fees or profiteering that institution can be appropriately penalised and also face the prospect of losing its recognition affiliation It was submitted that if the student left the course in midstream then for the remaining years the seat would lie vacant and the institute would suffer The next question for consideration is whether minority and non minority educational institution stand on the same footing and have the same rights under the Judgment In support of the contention that the minority and non minority educational institutions had the same rights reliance was placed upon paragraphs and of the Judgment As we look at it Article is a sort of guarantee or assurance to the linguistic and religious minority institutions of their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice It was observed in <ORG> case at page that the whole object of conferring the right on minorities under Article is to ensure that there will be equality between the majority and the minority They will have to comply with the condition of recognition which cannot be such as to whittle down the right under Article However on a careful reading of these paragraphs it is evident that the essence of what has been laid down is that the minority educational institutions have a guarantee or assurance to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice We do not read these paragraphs to mean that non minority educational institutions would have the same rights as those conferred on minority educational institutions by Article of the Constitution of India Even though the principle behind Article is to ensure that the minorities are protected and arc given an equal treatment yet the special right given under Article does give them certain advantages However the right given under Article to minorities cannot be done away with and the minorities will still have a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice Similarly even though the government may have a right to take over management of a non minority educational institution the management of a minority educational institution cannot be taken over because of the protection given under Article Further minority educational institutions have preferential right to admit students of their own community language In order to answer the third arid fourth questions it is necessary to see the manner in which the majority judgment is framed and to consider certain paragraphs of the judgment It would be unfair to apply the same rules and regulations regulating admission to both aided and unaided professional institutions It must be borne in mind that unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration while at the same time they do not forgo or discard the principle of merit It would therefore be permissible for the university or the government at the time of granting recognition to require a private unaided institution to provide for merit based selection while at the same time giving the <ORG> sufficient discretion in admitting students This can be done through various methods For instance a certain percentage of the seats can be reserved for admission by the <ORG> out of those students who have passed the common entrance test held by itself or by <ORG> and have applied to the college concerned for admission while the rest of the seats may he filled up on the basis of counseling by the state agency This will incidentally take care of poorer and backward sections of the society The prescription of percentage for this purpose has to be done by the government according to the local needs and different percentages can be fixed for minority unaided and non minority unaided and professional colleges The same principles may be applied to other non professional but unaided educational institutions viz While it may be normally possible to judge the merit of the applicant who seeks admission into a school while seeking admission to a professional institution and to become a competent professional it is necessary that meritorious candidates are not unfairly treated or put at a disadvantage by preferences shown to less meritorious but more influential applicants Excellence in professional education would require that greater emphasis be laid on the merit of a student seeking admission Appropriate regulations for this purpose may be made keeping in view the other observations made in this judgment in the context of admissions to unaided institutions Merit is usually determined for admission to professional and higher education colleges by either the marks that the student obtains at the qualifying examination or school leaving certificate stage followed by the interview or by a common entrance test conducted by the institution or in the case of professional colleges by government agencies Based on the above paragraphs it had been submitted on behalf of <ORG> various State <ORG>s and students that the majority Judgment makes a clear distinction between professional educational institutions both minority and non minority and other educational institutions i schools and undergraduate colleges The submission was that in professional institutions merit had to play an important role and that excellence in professional education required that for purposes of admission merit is determined by <ORG> agencies It is submitted that paragraph provides that in unaided professional colleges only a certain percentage of seats can be reserved for admission by the management Thirdly the unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration while at the same time they should not forego or discard the principles of merit Fourthly it is permissible for the university or the <ORG> at the time of granting recognition to require an unaided institution to provide for merit based admission while at the same time giving the management sufficient discretion in admitting students Fifthly for unaided non minority professional colleges certain percentage of seats can be reserved for admission by the management out of those students who have passed the common test held by itself or by <ORG> and for applying to the college university for admission while the rest of the seat may be filled up on the basis of counseling by the <ORG> agency A different percentage of seats for admission can be fixed for minority unaided and non minority unaided professional colleges It is provided that in cases of non minority professional colleges a certain percentage of seats can be reserved for admission by the management A reading of paragraphs and shows that in non minority professional colleges admission of students other than the percentage given to the management can only be on the basis of merit as per the common entrance tests conducted by government agencies It has been held that the right to administer includes the right to admit students of their own community language It is for this reason that paragraph provides that a different percentage can be fixed for unaided minority professional colleges The expression different percentage for minority professional institutions carries different meaning than the expression certain percentage for unaided professional colleges In fixing percentage for unaided minority professional colleges the <ORG> must keep in mind apart from local needs the interest need of that community in the <ORG> Further if the scats cannot be filled up from members of their community language then the other students can be admitted only on the basis of merit based on a common entrance test conducted by government agencies That brings us the question as to how the management of both minority and non minority professional colleges can admit students in the quota allotted to them Undoubtedly the majority Judgment has kept in mind the sad reality that there are a large number of professional colleges which indulge in profiteering and or charging of capitation fees Also as has been rightly pointed out if a student is required to appeal at more than one entrance test it would lead to great hardship A copy of the merit list will also be forthwith sent to the concerned authority and the <ORG> At this juncture it is brought to our notice that several institutions have since long had their own admission procedure and that even though they have been admitting only students of their own community no finger has ever been raised against them and no complaints have been made regarding fairness or transparency of the admission procedure adopted by them It is submitted that their cases are not based only on the right flowing from Article but in addition they have some special features which requires to they be permitted to admit in the manner they have been doing for all these years We leave it open in institutions which have been established and who have had their own admission procedure for at least the last years to apply to the <ORG> set out hereinafter Lastly it must be mentioned that it was urged by learned counsel for the appellant that paragraph of the majority judgment only permits <ORG> to provide for merit based selection at the time of granting recognition affiliation Such a provision can be made at the time of granting recognition affiliation as well as subsequently after the grant of such recognition affiliation We now direct that the respective <ORG> Government do appoint a permanent <ORG> which will ensure that the tests conducted by the association of colleges to fair and transparent The <ORG> will be free to nominate co opt an independent person of repute in the field of education as well as one of the Vice Chancellors of University in that <ORG> so that the total number of persons on the <ORG> do not exceed five The <ORG> shall have powers to oversee the tests to be conducted by the association This would include the power to call for the proposed question paper to know the names of the paper setters and examiners and to check the method adopted to ensure papers are not leaked The <ORG> shall supervise and ensure that the test is conducted in a fair and transparent manner The <ORG> shall have power to permit an institution which has been established and which has been permitted to adopt its own admission procedure for the last at least years to adopt its own admission procedure and if the <ORG> feels that the needs of such an institute are genuine to admit students of their community in excess of the quota allotted to them by the <ORG> Government It is clarified that different percentage of quota for students to be admitted by the management in each minority or non minority unaided professional college shall be separately fixed on the basis of their need by the respective <ORG> Governments and in care of any dispute as regards fixation of percentage of quota it will be open to the management to approach the <ORG> It is also clarified that no institute which has not been established and which has not followed its own admission procedure for the last at least years shall be permitted to apply for or be granted exemption from admitting students in the manner set out hereinabove To meet the urgent situation without going into the issues involved in the various petitions application we direct that the seats be filled up by the institution and the State <ORG> in the ratio It is made clear that due to the lime constraint this arrangement has been made without deciding the contentious issue involved in various pending cases Privately managed educational institutions imparting professional education in the fields of medicine dentistry and engineering have spurted in the last few decades The right of the minorities to establish an institution of their own choice in terms of Clause of Article of the Constitution of India is recognized so is the right of a citizen who intends to establish an institution under Article thereof However the fundamental right of a citizen to establish an educational institution and in particular a professional institution is not absolute The right to establish an educational institution although guaranteed under the Constitution recognition or affiliation is not <ORG> filed a writ petition in the year questioning the validity thereof The <ORG> Governments also fixed regulated fees to be charged from the students by such institutions SUBMISSIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF WRIT PETITIONERS APPLICANTS It was urged that while interpreting the judgment this Court should bear in mind the salient aspects of the findings in A Pai supra that is to say I ON THE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS i Citizens have a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions under Article and of the Constitution Paras and thus the said rights cannot be taken away restricted <NAME> iii The right to establish and administer educational institutions comprises of the right to a admit students set up a reasonable fee structure constitute a governing body appoint staff and take disciplinary action <NAME> iv Although such rights are subject to reasonable restrictions but the same must be for the betterment of the institution and as such the right under Article and Article cannot be undermined Although the aided institutions are subject to Clause of Article and Clause of Article of the Constitution but the unaided minority institutions being not so subject would not be bound by the restraints emanating therefrom so long they exercise their right to admit and select students in a transparent and non arbitrary manner III ON ADMISSION OF STUDENTS BY UNAIDED INSTITUTIONS i Unaided institutions have an unbridled right on admission of students comprising of devising a test for selecting students of their choice <NAME> Such a right emanates from the principle that every private and public owner of an institution has the power to admit qualified students of their own choice <NAME> ii As such a right also emanates with a view to maintain the atmosphere and traditions of the private educational institutions the general principles for unaided institutions would also apply to unaided professional institutions iv In any event the direction to determine a small percentage of persons drawn from the weaker sections of the society should be left with the management which would include the weaker sections of the minority community for which such institution has been established For the purpose of finding out as to who would be the students belonging to the weaker sections of the community local needs and other needs must be taken into consideration SUBMISSIONS MADE ON BEHALF OF STATES CENTRAL GOVERNMENT STATUTORY AUTHORITIES i The right of citizens including the minority communities whether based on any religion or language contained in Article and Article is not absolute but is subject to reasonable restrictions iii Since education in a sense is regarded as charitable unaided institutions cannot charge a hefty fee which would not be required for the purpose of fulfilling the object for which the institutions are established nor by reason thereof they can take recourse to profiteering <NAME> iv As merit is usually determined by either the marks of the students obtained at the qualifying examination or school leaving certificate stage followed by the interview or by a common entrance test conducted by the institution the <ORG> while framing regulation has the requisite jurisdiction to issue necessary directions in this behalf so that merit is not sacrificed <NAME> The plea of the minority institutions to the effect that their right to admit or reject students is absolute would not be in consonance with the direction issued in para which provides for a a system to provide merit based selection while granting sufficient discretion to the management As certain percentage of seats have to be reserved for the management the rest can be filled up on the basis of counseling by the <ORG> agencies which would take care of poorer and backward sections of the society The right to establish an institution is provided for in Article of the Constitution of India Minorities whether based on religion or language however have a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their own choice This Court in <NAME> supra while framing the scheme directed a that a professional college should be established and or administered only by a <ORG> registered under the Societies Registration Act or the corresponding Act of a State or by a Public Trust registered under the Trusts Act or under the Wakes Act and that no individual firm company or other body of individuals would be permitted to establish and or administer a professional college In A Pai Foundation supra the Scheme framed by this Court restricting the right of the citizen to establish private unaided institutions including minority institutions and manage the same was held to be unconstitutional stating The Scheme enforced by the State Governments in relation to privately managed institutions would not be a reasonable restriction within the meaning of Article of the Constitution of India as it resulted into revenue shortfalls making it difficult for the educational institutions the provision made for free seats and payment seats amounted to subsidising education of one segment of society at the cost of other which was unreasonable having regard to the fact that higher education has been held not to be a fundamental right A question however arose therein as to whether the <ORG> could impose regulatory measures on the institutions run by the minority community which provides for admission by conducting interviews but not solely on the marks obtained in the qualifying examination In that case the <ORG> had imposed restrictions on the college management compelling it to make admission exclusively on the basis of marks obtained in the qualifying examination From the above decisions of this <ORG> it is evident that though the right engrafted under Article of the Constitution does not lay down any limitations or restrictions upon the right of a minority to administer its educational institutions yet the right cannot be used absolutely and unreasonably What is meant by the expression religion in Article Can the followers of a sect or denomination of a particular religion claim protection under Article on the basis that they constitute a minority in the State even though the followers of that religion are in majority in that State a what are the indicia for treating an educational institution as a minority education institution Would an institution be regarded as a minority educational institution because it was established by a person belonging to a religious or linguistic minority or its being administered by a person belonging to a religious or linguistic minority To what extent can professional education be treated as a matter coming under minorities rights under Article Whether the admission of students to minority educational institution whether aided or unaided can be regulated by <ORG> or by the university to which the institution is affiliated a Whether the minorities rights to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice will include the procedure and method of admission and selection of students Whether the Minority institutions right of admission of students and to lay down procedure and method of admission if any would be affected in any way by the receipt of State aid Whether the statutory provisions which regulate the facets of administration like control over educational agencies control over governing bodies conditions of affiliation including recognition withdrawal thereof and appointment of staff employees teachers and principals including their service conditions and regulation of fees etc a Where can a minority institution be operationally located Where a religious or linguistic minority in State A establishes an educational institution in the said State can such educational institution grant preferential admission reservations and other benefits to members of the religious linguistic group from other States where they are non minorities Whether it would be correct to say that only the members of that minority residing in state A will be treated as the members of the minority vis a vis such institution Whether the member of a linguistic non minority in one State can establish a trust society in another State and claim minority status in that State except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right and the scheme framed thereunder require reconsideration modification and if yes what Whether the non minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institution under Articles and read with Articles and in the same manner and to the same extent as minority institutions and What is the meaning of the expressions education and educational institutions in various provisions of the Constitution Is the right to establish and administer educational institutions guaranteed under the Constitution Is there a fundamental right to set up educational institutions and if so under which provision The answers to the relevant questions are in the following terms A Article gives religious and linguistic minorities the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The use of the words of their choice indicates that even professional educational institutions would be covered by Article schools and undergraduate colleges where the scope for merit based selection is practically nil cannot be regulated by the <ORG> or <ORG> concerned except for providing the qualifications and minimum conditions of eligibility in the interest of academic standards The right to admit students being an essential facet of the right to administer educational institutions of their choice as contemplated under Article of the Constitution the state government or the university may not be entitled to interfere with that right so long as the admission to the unaided educational institutions is on a transparent basis and the merit is adequately taken care of The right to administer not being absolute there could be regulatory measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellence thereof and it is more so in the matter of admissions to professional institutions A minority institution does not cease to be so the moment grant in aid is received by the institution An aided minority educational institution therefore would be entitled to have the right of admission of students belonging to the minority group and at the same time would be required to admit a reasonable extent of non minority students so that the rights under Article are not substantially impaired and further the citizens rights under Article are not infringed What would be a reasonable extent would vary from the types of institution the courses of education for which admission is being sought and other factors like educational needs <ORG> concerned has to notify the percentage of the non minority students to be admitted in the light of the above observations Observance of inter se merit amongst the applicants belonging to the minority group could be ensured As regards non minority students who are eligible to seek admission for the remaining seats admission should normally be on the basis of the common entrance test held by the state agency followed by counselling wherever it exists A a A minority institution may have its own procedure and method of admission as well as selection of students but such a procedure must be fair and transparent and the selection of students in professional and higher education colleges should be on the basis of merit Even an unaided minority institution ought not to ignore the merit of the students for admission while exercising its right to admit students to the colleges aforesaid as in that event the institution will fail to achieve excellence A While giving aid to professional institutions it Would be permissible for the authority giving aid to prescribe bye rules or regulations the conditions on the basis of which admission will be granted to different aided colleges by virtue of merit coupled with the reservation policy of the state qua non minority students The merit may be determined either through a common entrance test conducted by the University or the Government concerned followed by counselling or on the basis of an entrance test conducted by individual institutions the method to be followed is for the university or the government to decide The authority may also devise other means to ensure that admission is granted to an aided professional institution on the basis of merit In the case of such institutions it will be permissible for the government or the university to provide that consideration should be shown to the weaker sections of the society A So far as the statutory provisions regulating the facets of administration are concerned in case of an unaided minority educational institution the regulatory measure of control should be minimal and the conditions of recognition as well as the conditions of affiliation to an university or board have to be complied with but in the matter of day to day management like the appointment of staff teaching and non teaching and administrative control over them the management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency However a rational procedure for the selection of teaching staff and for taking disciplinary action has to be evolved by the management itself For redressing the grievances of employees of aided and unaided institutions who are subjected to punishment or termination from service a mechanism will have to be evolved and in our opinion appropriate tribunals could be constituted and till then such tribunals could be presided over by a Judicial Officer of the rank of District Judge The <ORG> or other controlling authorities however can always prescribe the minimum qualification experience and other conditions bearing on the merit of an individual for being appointed as a teacher or a principal of any educational institution Regulations can be framed governing service conditions for teaching and other staff for whom aid is provided by the <ORG> without interfering with the overall administrative control of the management over the staff Fees to be charged by unaided institutions cannot be regulated but no institution should charge capitation fee A The scheme framed by this <ORG> in <NAME> case and the direction to impose the same except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right is unconstitutional Reasonable surplus to meet cost of expansion and augmentation of facilities does not however amount to profiteering CORE QUESTION i Whether unaided professional institutions are entitled to lay down their own fee structure ii Whether in view of the judgment of this <ORG> in <ORG> supra private and unaided professional institutions are entitled to have their own admission programme iii Whether the State Governments are entitled to lay down the quota of total seats to be filled up by the management RELEVANT FINDINGS OF THIS COURT IN A PAI FOUNDATION The right to establish and administer educational institutions was held to be guaranteed to citizens under Article of the Constitution of India and to the minorities under Article semblance of qualification and which does not maintain even a fair standard of teaching or which teaches matters subversive of the welfare of the scholars In such matters the <ORG> can insist that in order to grant aid the <ORG> may prescribe reasonable regulations to ensure the excellence of the institutions to be aided emphasis supplied Thus it is clear that regulations postulated for granting recognition or aid ought to be with regard to the excellence of education and efficiency of administration vis <ORG> also agreed with the said view stating Similarly the Constitution has also carved out a further exception to Article in the form of Article by recognising the rights of special classes in the form of minorities based on language or religion to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice The reason for such classification is not only religion or language per se but minorities based on religion and language One of us <NAME> <NAME> speaking for himself and <NAME> <NAME> agreed with the majority but thought it appropriate that a mechanism therefor should be set up observing So far as the statutory provisions regulating the facets of administration are concerned in case of an unaided minority educational institution the regulatory measure of control should be minimal and the conditions of recognition as well as conditions of affiliation to a University or Board have to be complied with but in the matter of day to day Management like appointment of staff teaching and non teaching and administrative control over them the Management should have the freedom and there should not be any external controlling agency However a rational procedure for selection of teaching staff and for taking disciplinary action has to be evolved by the Management itself For redressing the grievances of such employees who are subjected to punishment or termination from service a mechanism will have to be evolved and in our opinion appropriate tribunals could be constituted and till then such tribunal could be presided over by a Judicial Officer of the rank of District Judge The <ORG> or other controlling authorities however can always prescribe the minimum qualifications salaries experience and other conditions bearing on the merit of an individual for being appointed as a teacher of an educational institution Regulations can be framed governing service conditions for teaching and other staff for whom aid is provided by the <ORG> without interfering with overall administrative control of Management over the staff <ORG> representative can be associated with the selection committee and the guidelines for selection can be laid down There could be appropriate mechanism to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and profiteering is not resorted to The majority held that there is an apparent conflict between the provisions of Clause of Article and Clause of Article Article guarantees the right to every citizen not to be denied admission into any educational institution maintained by the <ORG> or receiving aid out of <ORG> funds on grounds only of religion race caste language or any of them whereas Clause of Article confers a fundamental right to set up educational institutions of their choice However one of us <NAME> <NAME> speaking for himself and <NAME> <NAME> clearly held that where the minor by institutions take aid from the State they do not have any right to admit students of minority community alone The learned Judge further referred to the significance of conditional clause at their own expense in the draft Article VI which reads as follows Citizens belonging to national minorities in a state whether based on religion or language have equal rights with other citizens in forming controlling and administering at their own expense charitable religious and social institutions schools and other educational establishments with the free use of their language and practice of their religion The fundamental right to establish an educational institution cannot be confused with the right to ask for recognition or affiliation While declaring that the Scheme framed in <NAME> case supra and the directions issued to the <ORG> <ORG> and other concerned bodies to give effect to the same vis a vis privately managed educational institutions as unconstitutional it upheld two propositions primary education is a fundamental right and the institution cannot charge any capitation fee or otherwise take recourse to profiteering It was observed The scheme framed by this Court in <NAME> case and the direction to impose the same except where it holds that primary education is a fundamental right is unconstitutional However the principle that there should not be capitation fee or profiteering is correct Reasonable surplus to meet cost of expansion and augmentation of facilities does not however amount to profiteering Establishment of Educational Institutions All citizens have a right to establish and administer educational institutions under Articles and but this right is subject to provisions of Articles and A Admission to Courses i Private Unaided Professional Colleges a Admission to professional colleges should be based on merit by common entrance test conducted by the Government agencies See Paragraph Certain percentage of seats can be reserved for admission by management out of those students who have passed common entrance test held by itself or by the State agency and the rest of the seats may be filled up on the basis of counsellings by the State agency Those who seek professional education roust pay for it ii Private aided professional institutions It would be permissible for the authority giving aid to prescribe by Rules or Regulations the conditions on the basis of which the admissions shall be granted to different aided colleges by virtue of merit coupled with reservation policy of the <ORG> The merit may be determined either through the common entrance test conducted by the <ORG> or the <ORG> followed by counselling or on the basis of entrance test conducted by individual institution and method to be followed is for the <ORG> or <ORG> to decide iii Private aided minority institutions <ORG> is not entitled to interfere with the right of minority educational institutions to admit students of their choice so long as the admission is on a transparent basis and the merit is adequately taken care of The right not being absolute there could be regulatory measures for ensuring educational standards and maintaining excellency thereof specially in the case of admission to professional institutions Unaided minority institutions Such institutions would have the right of admission of students belonging to minority groups and at the same time would be required to admit reasonable extent of non minority students as notified by <ORG> While the State has a right to prescribe qualifications necessary for admission private unaided colleges have right to admit students of their choice subject to objective arid rational procedure of selection and the compliance with the conditions if any requiring admission of certain percentage of students belonging to weaker sections by granting them free scholarships or scholarships if not granted by the Government paragraph In practice it has been the case of the marginally less merited rural or poor students bearing the burden of a rich and well exposed and urban students iii A rational fee structure should be adopted by the management and it would not be entitled to charge capitation fee and appropriate machinery can be devised by the <ORG> or University to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and that there is no profiteering though a reasonable surplus in furtherance of education is permissible The conditions of granting recognition or affiliation can broadly cover academic and educational matters including the welfare of students and teachers Paragraph There is a fundamental right to set up educational institutions both under Article and Article of the Constitution of India to establish and administer an institution comprises of the right a to admit students to set up a reasonable fee structure to constitute a governing body to appoint staff teaching and non teaching and to take action if there is dereliction of duty on the part of any employees Although an educational institution is not a business in order to examine the degree of independence that can be given to a recognized educational institution like any private entity that does not seek aid or assistance from the Government and that exists by virtue of the funds generated by it including its loans or borrowing It is important to note that the essential ingredients of the management of the private institution include the admission of students and recruiting staff and the quantum of fee that is to be charged An educational institution is established for the purpose of imparting education of the type made available by the institution More amenities will ensure that better students seek admission to that institution One cannot lose sight of the fact that providing good amenities to the students in the form of competent teaching faculty and other infrastructure costs money One also cannot lose sight of the fact that we live in a competitive world today where professional education is in demand Excellence in professional education would require that greater emphasis be laid on the merit of a student seeking admission for which appropriate regulations can be made As regards determination of merit it was stated Merit is usually determined for admission to professional and higher education colleges by either the marks that the student obtains at the qualifying examination or school leaving certificate stage followed by the interview or by a common entrance test conducted by the institution or in the case of professional colleges by government agencies The principles governing private unaided professional colleges were dealt with separately in paragraphs and the relevant portions whereof read thus It would be unfair to apply the same rules and regulations regulating admission to both aided and unaided professional institutions It must he borne in mind that unaided professional institutions are entitled to autonomy in their administration while at the same time they do not forgo or discard the principle of merit It would therefore be permissible for the university or the government at the time of granting recognition to require a private unaided institution to provide for merit based selection while at the same time giving the <ORG> sufficient discretion in admitting students This can be done through various methods For instance a certain percentage of the seats can be reserved for admission by the <ORG> out of those students who have passed the common entrance test held by itself or by <ORG> and have applied to the college concerned for admission while the rest of the seats may be filled up on the basis of counselling by the state agency This will incidentally take care of poorer and backward sections of the society The prescription of percentage for this purpose has to be done by the government according to the local needs and different percentages can be fixed for minority unaided and non minority unaided and professional colleges The same principles may be applied to other non professional but unaided educational institutions viz In such professional unaided institutions the Management will have the right to select teachers as per the qualifications and eligibility conditions laid down by <ORG> subject to adoption of a rational procedure of selection A rational fee structure should be adopted by the Management which would not be entitled to charge a capitation fee Appropriate machinery can be devised by the state or university to ensure that no capitation fee is charged and that there is no profiteering though a reasonable surplus for the furtherance of education is permissible Conditions granting recognition or affiliation can broadly cover academic and educational matters including the welfare of students and teachers STATUTES OPERATING IN THE FIELD Functions of the Council It shall be the duty of the <ORG> to take all such steps as it may think fit for ensuring co ordinated and integrated development of technical

collect data on all related matters and make forecast of the needed growth and development in technical education co ordinate the development of technical education in the country at all levels allocate and disburse out of the Fund of the Council such grants on such terms and conditions as it may think fit to i technical institutions In this section a affiliation together with its grammatical variations includes in relation to a college recognition of such college by association of such college with and admission of such college to the privileges of a <ORG> college means any

such University is recognized as competent to provide for such course of study and present students undergoing such course of study for the examination for the award of such qualification prosecution in relation to a course of study includes promotion from one part or stage of the course of study to another part or stage of the course of study Qualification means a degree or any other

section have been made student includes a person seeking admission as a student university means a university or institution referred to in Sub section of section If after making in relation to a college providing for a specified course of study an inquiry in the manner provided by regulations and after giving such college a reasonable opportunity of being heard the <ORG> is satisfied that such college has contravened the provisions of Sub section the <ORG> may with the previous approval of <ORG> pass an order prohibiting such college from presenting any students then undergoing such course of study therein to any university for the award of the qualification concerned The <ORG> shall forward a copy of the order made by it under Sub section to the university concerned and on and from the date of receipt by the University of a copy of such order the affiliation of such college to such university shall in so far as it relates to the course of study specified in such order stand

interests of the students concerned The provisions of this section and the regulations made for the purposes of this section shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force By reason of the said regulations <ORG> however have been delegated with the power to determine the fee structure in respect of professional institutions wherefor requisite guidelines have been issued pursuant whereto and in furtherance whereof committees have been constituted for the said purpose The State Governments also in terms of the observations made by this Court issued various orders or adopted resolutions providing for enforcement of their reservation policy as also determining the fee structure In to uncertain terms it was held that all citizens of India irrespective of the fact as to whether they belong to a minority group or not have a right to establish and run an institution A right conferred on a citizen of India in terms of Article of the Constitution of India indisputably is subject to reasonable restrictions which may be imposed in public interest under Clause thereof Right to admit students of their own choice the learned counsel would contend in a professional college therefore is not absolute On the other hand the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Writ Petitioners Applicant would contend that the discussions in <ORG> centered round the question as to whether the right conferred upon minorities under Article was subject to Clause of Article or not A citizen of India whether belonging to a minority community or not will have the right under Article A person belonging to a minority community apart from has a right to establish administer institution of their choice In <ORG> this Court held that minority institutions can establish and run a professional institution in terms of Clause of Article of the Constitution having regard to the fact that they have a right to establish an institution of their own choice They also have a right to establish an institution and admit students of their own choice in terms of Para of the judgment in <NAME> but they do not have any right of admitting students belonging to a particular locality or speaking a particular language as such institutions are not meant to serve the said purpose The private unaided educational institutions impart education and that cannot be the reason to take away their choice in matters inter alia of selection of students and fixation of fees the right of a private unaided institution to give admission and to fix the fee As we look at it Article is a sort of guarantee or assurance to the linguistic and religious minority institutions of their right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice It was observed in <ORG> case that the whole object of conferring the right on minorities under Article is to ensure that there will be equality between the majority and the minority If the minorities do not have such special protection they will be dented equality They will have to comply with the conditions of recognition A minority institution has no additional rights but it enjoys a constitutional protection to admit students belonging to the minority communities whether based on religion or language Furthermore in the event running of a minority institution is found to be against national interest or permissible limits of regulations it can be taken over with a view to maintain morality public order health national interest The right of the minority institution to admit their own students in other words is only by way of protection of the minority interest so that they may get the benefit of the equality clause Only certain additional protection has been conferred under Article of the Constitution of India to bring the minorities on the same platform as that of non minorities as regards the right to establish and administer an educational institution for the purpose of imparting education to UK The question thus has to be considered keeping in view the fact that every Indian may be a minority either based on religion or language in one part of the country or the other Furthermore one of us <NAME> <NAME> speaking for himself and <NAME> <NAME> clearly said Article merely protects the right of the minority to establish and administer an educational institution i to have the same rights as those enjoyed by majority Article gives no right to receive <ORG> aid The statutory rules and regulations thus must be equally applied to an the professional institutions whether aided or unaided whether run by a minority or non minority If it be held that the minority institutions can admit all the students belonging to their own community whereas the non minority institutions cannot the same in my opinion would amount to re writing the judgment The arguments which have been advanced in this behalf if accepted would clearly lead to the conclusion that the majority decision in <ORG> is wrong Whatever may be the power and jurisdiction of the <ORG> and <ORG> authorities to make a special provision in favour of backward and downtrodden when the <ORG> tests the reasonableness of such distinctive <ORG> action it should be done by posing a question whether such <ORG> action to ameliorate social economic and political poverty whatever be the reason delays the journey towards proclaimed goal of equality In the event the minorities are not granted the right to establish educational institutions of their choice and admit students of their community the right of equality would lose all its purpose and relevance So far as institutions imparting professional education are concerned having regard to the public interest they are bound to maintain excellence in standard of education The width of the rights and limitations thereof of unaided institutions whether run by a majority or a minority must conform to the maintenance of excellence Article of the Constitution does not confer an absolute right Broadly stated there are permissible regulations and impermissible regulations Clauses and of Article of the Constitution of India read thus Nothing in this article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for women and children Nothing in this article or in Clause of Article shall prevent the State from making any special provision for the advancement of any socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes The <ORG> has also a right to make some reservation for women and children in terms of Clause of Article of the Constitution of India The right of a citizen in terms of Article of the Constitution whether to practise any profession or to carry on any business occupation must be the same or similar The reasonable restrictions in terms of Clause must be on the exercise of a right conferred by the said sub clause Although reasonable restrictions can be imposed on exercise of such right in terms of the constitutional scheme the <ORG> cannot impose its own duties and obligations upon a citizen At this juncture it may be useful to refer to the decisions of this Court in Re the Kerala Education Bill supra wherein <NAME> speaking for the Constitution Bench held in the following terms Learned counsel for the <ORG> of Kerala referred us to the directive principles contained in Article which requires the <ORG> to endeavour to provide within a period of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution for free and compulsory education for all children until they complete the age of fourteen years and with considerable warmth of feeling and indignation maintained that no minorities should be permitted to stand in the way of the implementation of the sacred duty cast upon the <ORG> of giving free and compulsory primary education to the children of the country so as to bring them up properly and to make them fit for discharging the duties and responsibilities of good citizens There can be no manner of doubt that our Constitution has guaranteed certain cherished rights of the minorities concerning their language culture and religion Article no doubt requires the <ORG> to provide for free and compulsory education for ail children but there is nothing to prevent the <ORG> from discharging that solemn obligation through <ORG> and aided schools and Article does not require that obligation to be discharged at the expense of the minority communities Looking at the rights guaranteed to the minorities by our Constitution from the angle of vision indicated above we are of opinion that Clause except Sub clauses and which apply only to aided schools and Clause may well be regarded as permissible regulation which the <ORG> is entitled to impose as a condition for according its recognition to any educational institution but that Clause which has been extended by Clause to newly established recognised schools in so far as it affects educational institutions established and administered by minority communities is violative of Article If a legislature can impose any regulation which it think necessary to protect what in its view is in the interest of the <ORG> or society sounds paradoxical that a right which the Constitution makers wanted to be absolute can be subjected to regulations which need only satisfy the nebulous and elastic test of <ORG> necessity While laying down the law based on interpretation of a Constitution as well as a judgment we cannot take a myopic view and hold that local needs must be referable to the medical education The SIC questions which arise for consideration herein did not arise there it is stated There is always peril in treating the words of a speech or judgment as though they are words in a legislative enactment and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular case said Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> WLR Sub nom <ORG> <NAME> All ER HL it was held As often enough pointed out by us words and expressions used in a judgment are not to be construed in the same manner as statutes or as words and expressions defined in statutes reported in AIR SC it was held Article empowers <ORG> to declare the law and enact it It is also permissible for this purpose albeit only in certain cases and if there exist strong and cogent reasons to look to the pleadings of the parties We way notice that in the Tamil Nadu Educational Institutions Prohibition of Collection of Capitalisation Fee Act Capitation fee has been defined as capitation fee means any amount by whatever name called paid or collected directly or indirectly in excess of the fee prescribed under Section It is true as has been contended by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the applicants that <ORG> in answer to question raised in the <ORG> has stated that the expenses incurred by the <ORG> for imparting education to the students is very high While fixing the fee structure the <ORG> shall also take into consideration inter alia the salary or remuneration paid to the members of the faculty and other staff the investment made by them the infrastructure provided and plan for future development of the institution as also expansion of the educational institution With a view to ensure that an educational institution is kept within its bounds and does not indulge in profiteering or otherwise exploiting its students financially it will be open to the statutory authorities and in its absence by the <ORG> to constitute an appropriate body till appropriate statutory regulations are made in that behalf Fees once fixed should not ordinarily be changed for a period of three years unless there exists extra ordinary reason Paras refers to private unaided professional colleges which would include both minority and non minority as would appear from the following The prescription of percentage for this purpose has to be done by the Government according to the local needs and different percentages can be fixed for minority unaided and non minority unaided and professional colleges Excellence in professional education would require that greater emphasis be laid on the merit of a student seeking admission Appropriate observations made in this judgment in the context of admissions to Unaided institutions It therefore takes into its fold inter se merit between minority and non minority students To the said extent it has to be read down The management of a private unaided professional colleges for the purpose of admitting students will have options a to hold a common entrance test by itself or to follow the common entrance test held by the <ORG> or the <ORG> So far as students belonging to poorer or backward section of society is concerned As a logical corollary it will also be incorrect to say that minority unaided institutions can fill up all the seats from amongst the students belonging to their community whereas the non minority unaided institutions will have no such right The very fact that different percentages are to be fixed up for minority unaided and non minority unaided institutions is itself a clear pointer to show that although different percentages may be prescribed therefor but both minority unaided and non minority institutions can admit the students of their choice to the extent of the percentage so prescribed albeit without giving a go bye to the merit criteria It has nothing to do with minority or non minority aided or unaided Each case will have to be considered on its own merit We may however place on record that the <ORG> of Maharashtra has placed before us a chart showing that some of the students had appeared at two examinations and one who got only in the common entrance test held by the <ORG> passed the examination held by the management From the above chart supplied to us by the state of Maharashtra it appears that only three students who had appeared both at the common entrance test held by the <ORG> and the management had passed the common entrance test held by the <ORG> whereas a large number of students had passed the test held by the management although they could not pass the Common Entrance Test But if they are permitted to hold their own examinations not only the students will have to purchase different admission former which as noticed hereinbefore may cost between Rs but he may be asked to appear in examinations at various places on the same day or on the next day and having regard to the distance the transport facilities and other factors he may not be able to appear therein Furthermore answers to Questions a and would go to show that the minority unaided institution have a right to evolve their own machinery for admitting the students on the basis of merit subject of course to passing the fairness and transparency test There is no mechanism which would ensure fairness or transparency of the examination held by each and every unaided professional institution It may thus be possible to protect the right of the minority if such <ORG> take a decision in this behalf in consultation with the statutory authorities or the concerned <ORG> as regards holding of a common entrance test for the said purpose We may notice that Mr <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General has submitted that <ORG> may hold such all India examinations but there are practical difficulties in this behalf as has been rightly pointed out by Mr <NAME> There is another aspect of the matter which cannot be lost sight of The minority institutions imparting professional courses may have a legal or constitutional right to hold their own examination but a serious consideration is required to be bestowed as to whether for the purpose of judging merit they should opt for the Common Entrance Test held by the <ORG> Unless there exists any exigency normally the institutions will have the right to admit a higher percentage of students depending upon their need The learned counsels appearing on behalf of parties have submitted that this Court may with a view to avoid any future controversy fix a definite percentage for the said purpose All these factors must be taken into consideration by the appropriate committee or Body so long a statutory regulation is not framed in this behalf In terms of Paragraph of the judgment local need would be a relevant factor for the purpose of determining the percentage of students who would be admitted on non minority quota Each case thus has to be considered on its own merit and no hard and fast rule can be laid down therefor The <ORG> or the rule making authority may however lay down the procedure for proper functioning thereof So far as minority institutions are concerned merit criteria would have to be judged like a pyramid At the kindergarten primary secondary levels minorities may have quota At this level the merit may not have much relevance at all but at the level of higher education and in particular professional education and post graduate level education merit indisputably should be a relevant criteria At the post graduation level where there may be a few seats the minority institutions may not have much say in the matter Services of doctors engineers and other professionals coming out from the institutions of professional excellence must be made available to the entire country and not to any particular class or group of people All citizens including the minorities have also a fundamental duty in this behalf Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children Article of Convention Against Discrimination in Education reads thus Article undertakes to ensure by legislation where necessary that there is no discrimination in the admission of pupils to educational institutions not to allow any difference of treatment by the public authorities between nationals except on the basis of merit or need in the matter of school fees and the grant of scholarships An economic prosperity or elimination of poverty is not the only goal to be achieved but along with it allows individuals to lead a life with dignity with a view to participate in the Governmental process so as to enable them to preserve their identity and culture In the UNESCO Convention against Discrimination in Education the <ORG>s parties agree Article that it is essential to recognize the right of members of national minorities to carry on their own educational activities including the maintenance of schools and depending on the educational policy of each <ORG> the use or the teaching of their own language and set out the circumstances in which this right may be exercised The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights adopted by <ORG> in includes an article on the rights of persons belonging to minorities which reads Article In those States in which ethnic religious or linguistic minorities exist persons belonging to such minorities shall not be denied the right in community with other members or their group to enjoy their own culture to profess and practice their own religion or to use their own language Among the decisions of principal organs of <ORG> which have dealt with the question of special protective measures for ethnic religious or linguistic groups are three resolutions of <ORG> on the future government of Palestine on the question of the disposal of the former Italian colonies and on the question of Eritrea In addition the Statue of the City of Jerusalem approved by <ORG> on April provides special protective measures for ethnic religious or linguistic groups in articles dealing with human rights and fundamental freedoms the legislative council the judicial system official and working languages the educational system and cultural and benevolent institutions and broadcasting and television The right to establish professional colleges both by minorities and non minorities has been found in Article as also Article of the Constitution of India Thus subject to reasonable restrictions any unaided institution imparting professional courses may although exercise greater autonomy in the matter of management and determination of the fee structure it will have a limited right so far as the right to admit students is concerned It takes into consideration globalisation and opening up of economy This can be achieved only by producing students of excellence which can be achieved only by encouraging institutions of excellence imparting professional education to those who are meritorious When there are two competing human rights namely human rights for the religious minorities and the human rights for development having regard to the economic and national interest of the country in the matter of admission of students the latter should be Furthermore the right to admit students may vary from course to course discipline to discipline At the stage of post graduate level there may be only one seat or two seats and thus in such a situation the right of the minority institutions to admit a student may be less than in the case of non professional course The competing human rights of the minorities vis a vis any other citizen thus requires a delicate balance It must be given full effect with the aid of these additional reasons Although the minorities have a right to establish institutions of their own choice they admittedly do not have any right of recognition or affiliation for the said purpose There exist some institution in this country which are more than a century old It would be too much to say that only because an institution receives recognition affiliation at a distant point of time the appropriate Government is denuded of its power to lay down any law in imposing any fresh condition despite the need of change owing to passage of time Furthermore the <ORG> or the State Legislatures are not denuded of its power having regard to restrictions that may satisfy the test of Clause of Article of the Constitution of India or regulations in terms of Article depending upon the national interest public interest and other relevant factors We have also not expressed any opinion on cross subsidy They cannot evolve a fool proof system on the basis of affidavits filed by the parties or upon hearing their counsel
