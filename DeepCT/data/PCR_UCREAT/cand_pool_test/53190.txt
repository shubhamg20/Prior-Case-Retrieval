HEADNOTE The respondent and his four brothers were partners in a firm carrying on business in gunnies The respondent filed a writ petition in <ORG> for quashing the order The question that fell for consideration was whether which was introduced by the Income tax Amendment Act could be used to rectify assessments made before st April the date from which the said amendment came into force There is nothing in the section to show that such completed assessment must Like place after was brought on the statute book What must take place to give rise to the power of rectification is the finding on the assessment or re assessment of the firm The finding alone must be made after the section came into force Section neither expressly nor by necessary implication em powers <ORG> to reopen assessments which had become final If the section empowers the reopening of all final assessments of the partners of firm there was no need to give that provision a partial retrospectivity A The legislature used the expression completed assessment in to distinguish that class of assessment from assessments which are made final under the Act The respondent along with his four brothers were partners of a registered firm carrying on business in gunnies When the matter came to be heard by <ORG> there were already three reported decisions of this Court bearing on the interpretation of of the Act If the result leads to a conflict of decisions we will have to examine the question as to whether the view taken in an earlier case should be adhered to The Commissioner or Appellate Assistant Commissioner may at any time within four years from the date of any order passed by him in appeal or in the case of the Commissioner in revision under section A and the Income tax Officer may at any time within four years from the date of any assessment order or refund order passed by him on his own motion rectify any mistake apparent from the record of the appeal revision assessment or refund as the case may be and shall within the like period rectify any such mistake which has been brought to his notice by an assessee Provided that no such rectification shall be made having the effect of enhancing an assessment or reducing a refund unless the Commissioner the Appellate Assistant Commissioner or the Income tax Officer as the case may be has given notice to the assessee of his intention so to do and has allowed him a reasonable opportunity of being heard Provided further that no such rectification shall be made of any mistake in any order passed more than one year before the commencement of the Indian Income tax Amendment Act to Where in respect of any completed assessment of a partner in a firm it is found on the assessment or reassessment of the firm or on any reduction or enhancement made in the income of the firm under section section section A section section or section A that the share of the partner in the profit or loss of the firm has not been included in the assessment of the partner or if included is not correct the inclusion of the share in the assessment or the correction thereof as the case may be shall be deemed to be a rectification of a mistake apparent from the record within the meaning of this section and the provisions of subsection shall apply thereto accordingly the period of four years referred to in that sub section being computed from the date of the final order passed in the case of the firm Section of the Act provided that Subject to any special provision made in this behalf in this Act it shall be deemed to have come into force on the st day of April Such power could in the case of an Income tax Officer be exercised at any time within four years from the date of any assessment order passed by him on his own motion The section however imposes a limitation in that the mistake must be in the re cord of the case itself order or refund order passed by the Income tax Officer the starting point of computation of the period of four years under is the date of the final order passed in the case Of the firm is that all statutes other than those which are merely declaratory or which relate only to matters of procedure or of evidence are prima facie prospective and retrospective effect is not to be given to them unless by express words or necessary implication it appears that this was the intention of the legislature Sub of is only a step in that direction but the legislature in its wisdom thought it best that assessments of individuals which had taken place before the final order in the assessment of the firm should not be disturbed except within four years therefrom There is nothing in the section to show that such completed assessment must take place after the provision i was brought on the statute book The finding alone must be made after section comes into force It was stated in express terms by this Court The power to rectify assessment of a partner consequent upon the assessment of the firm of which he is a partner by including or correcting his share of profit or loss can therefore be exercised only in the case of assessment of the firm made on or after April There are certain words in sub which Ire not to be found in sub and on a contrast between the language used in the two sub sections it was observed in Habibullah case When the <ORG> under cl of expressly authorised rectification in the circumstances mentioned therein even if the assessment has been completed before the Indian Income tax Amendment Act and it made no such provision in cl it would be reasonable to infer that the <ORG> did not intend to grant to the revenue authorities a power to rectify assessments falling within cl where the firm assessment was completed before April We do not want to express any view as to the interpretation of sub but in our opinion sub was clearly intended to give retrospective effect to final orders made in the case of the firm by incorporation of the result thereof in the case of the partner as an individual After referring to <NAME> case and <NAME> case it was said The assessment of the respondents was a final assessment before April and sub section has not been made applicable to such assessment either expressly or by implication It has been given a limited retrospectivity from April and it was held by this court in the cited case that it was not open to courts to give more retrospectivity to it took the view that <NAME> case had been correctly decided but that <NAME> case might require re consideration although they did not express any final opinion on that point He said further There is nothing in <NAME> case to indicate that in the opinion of the learned Judges deciding it there were any words which would indicate that sub was to have a retrospective operation was delivered by <NAME> who dealt with the subject of retrospective operation of statutes elaborately and discussed <NAME> case at some length and expressed the view at that although the section mentioned the final order in the firm assessment as the starting point there was nothing to show that this new terminus a quo must be after before sub could be used The judgment and order of <ORG> are set aside and the orders of rectification passed by the Income tax Officer are held to be effective and binding on the respondents <ORG> The respondents in these appeals were the partners of a registered firm carrying on business in gunnies Section of that Act provided that subject to any special provision made in this behalf in this Act it shall be deemed to have come into force on the st day of April The respondents challenged the validity of those proceedings in <ORG> at Madras in writ petitions of on its file These appeals are directed against the said decision Section the extent it is material for our present purpose reads as follows Where in respect of any completed assessment of a partner in a firm it is found on the assessment or reassessment of a firm that the share of the partner in the profit or loss of the firm has not been included in the assessment of the partner or if included is not correct the inclusion of the share of the assessment or the correction thereof as the case may be shall be deemed to be a rectification of a mistake apparent from the record within the meaning of this section and provisions of sub sections shall apply thereto accordingly the period of four years referred to in that sub section being computed from the date of the final order passed in the case of the firm It affects the vested rights of the assessee It confers additional powers upon the income tax authorities and that power cannot be exercised in respect of assessment of a firm which had been completed before the date on which the power had been invested This Court quoted with approval Sup At of the report this is what this Court observed in <NAME> case Here the original assessment was made before the amendment and to that assessment the amended provision cannot still be made applicable for the reason to be given by us even though the assessments of the firms were after April and sub section has not been made applicable to such assessment either expressly or by implication It has been given a limited retrospectivity from April and it was held by this court in the cited case that it was not open to courts to give more retrospectivity to it It was further held in <NAME> case that the provision enacted by sub section is not procedural in character and that it affects vested rights of an assessee It merely applied the principle laid down in <NAME> case to the facts of that case In my opinion there is no legal basis to distinguish the one from the other upon to interpret the scope of sub of of the Act which was brought into force on April Three separate judgment were delivered in that case one on behalf of <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> by <NAME> <NAME> another on behalf of <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> It applied the rule of presumption against a statute having a retrospective operation as to which rule of course there is no dispute to sub of There is nothing in <NAME> case to indicate that in the opinion of the learned Judges deciding it there were any words which would indicate that sub was to have a retrospective operation Furthermore I do not find that the other considerations to which I have referred arose for discussion in that case But <NAME> who as mentioned earlier was a party to both the decisions dealing with those decisions observed We do not naturally express a final opinion on sub We must leave that to a future case For the reasons to be presently stated I would rather prefer to follow the decisions in <NAME> case and <NAME> case which I am sure must have been rendered after deep consideration rather than the passing doubts hesitatingly expressed by two of the learned Judges who were parties to those decisions The rule laid down in <NAME> and <NAME> cases is a well settled rule The language of a statute imposing a tax duty or charge must receive a strict construction in the sense that there is no room for any intendment and regard must be had to the clear meaning of the words be construed in favour of the subject however much within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be but a fair and reasonable construction must be given to the language used without leaning to one side or the other There is no rule admitting equitable construction of a taxing statute that is to say cases which are not within the actual words of the statute cannot be brought within the statute by consideration of its governing principle or intention There is no room for any intendment There is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to a tax One can only look fairly at the language used If on the other hand the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxing statute no tax call be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter We must of necessity therefore have regard to the actual provisions of the Act and the rules made there under before we can come to the conclusion that the appellant was liable to assessment as contended by the Sales Tax authorities There is no room for any intendment There is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to a tax It is well recognised that the rule of construction that if a case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of a taxing statute no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance I this Court quoted with approval the rule laid down by <NAME> in Cape Brandy Syndicate case to which reference has already been made The courts have repeatedly observed that there is no equity in a tax The said rule has only a limited application in the interpretation of a taxing statute This takes me to the question whether the impugned assess ments come clearly within the scope of But before going into that question we must remind ourselves that the assessments of the respondents had become final in the year and under the law as it stood prior Lo the enactment of those assessments could not I Section unlike several other provisions in the amending Act of had been given only a partial retrospective effect On the basis of well recognised canons of construction of statutes we must give that expression a meaning different from that given to assessment Evidently the legislature used the expression completed assessments to distinguish that class of assessments from assessments which are final under the Act It appears to me by using that expression the legislature intended that the assessment of a partner should not be considered as a final assessment till the assessment of the firm becomes final Even assuming that can receive a different interpretation and that interpretation is more reasonable than that adopted by this <ORG> in <NAME> case in that even also this <ORG> would not be justified in overruling its previous decision which has the force of law in view of Art This <ORG> must overrule its previous decisions only when it comes to the conclusion that it is manifestly wrong not upon a mere suggestion that some or all of the members of the later <ORG> might arrive at a different conclusion if the matter was res integra Our power of review which undoubtedly exists must be exercised with due care and caution and only for advancing the public well being in the light of the surrounding I circumstances of each case brought to our notice but we do not consider it right to confine our power within rigidly fixed limits as suggested before us For the reasons mentioned above I dismiss these appeals with Costs ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority the appeals are allowed the judgment and order of <ORG> are set aside and the orders of rectification passed by the Income tax Officer are held to be effective and binding on the respondents
