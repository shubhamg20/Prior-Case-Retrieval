These two tax revision cases give rise to a common question of law for our consideration and hence they are disposed of by a common order If there is no such possibility it would be a different commodity but if there is such a possibility it would be the same commodity Hence it was urged by the learned counsel appearing for the <ORG> that <ORG> erred in holding that the galvanised plain and corrugated sheets and sheets fall within the entry iron and steel In order to decide the question referred to us we must know the exact nature of the commodities known as galvanised plain or corrugated sheets and sheets Corrugated iron sheets are thus nothing but iron sheets sheets of iron corrugated that is wrinkled for the purpose of making them more rigid and giving them increased stiffness so that they become more suitable for roofing and walling than they would otherwise be as flat iron sheets <ORG> rejected the contention holding that this word must be construed not in any technical sense nor from the botanical point of view but as understood in common parlance It has not been defined in the Act and being a word of every day use it must be construed in its popular sense meaning that sense which people conversant with the subject matter with which the statute is dealing would attribute to it Both the <ORG> as well as the learned Judges of <ORG> upheld the dealer contention in regard to the sale of refined oil but rejected it in so far as it related to the sale of hydrogenated oil The <ORG> as well as <ORG> held that the hydrogenated oil ceased to be groundnut oil by reason of the chemical changes which took place and which resulted in the acquisition of new properties including the loss of its fluidity Before <ORG> the question that was raised for their decision was whether if beyond the process of refinement of the oil the oil was hardened again by the use of chemical processes it was rendered any the less groundnut oil In regard to that question the Advocate General late <NAME> laid stress on two facts i while normally oil was a viscous liquid the hydrogenated oil was semi solid and that this change in its physical state was itself indicative of a substantial modification of the identity of the substance and ii in the course of hydrogenation the oil absorbed two atoms of hydrogen and there was an inter molecular change in the content of the substance It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that patasa harda and alchidana bore a distinct and different name from sugar and were not commercially purchased or sold as sugar and therefore they were commodities different from sugar The test of possibility of substitution of the one for the other so far as the consumers or purchasers are concerned cannot be said to be a decisive or the only test for determining whether the sold was the same or different from the specified in the entry in the schedule to the Sales Tax Act It is in this background of decided cases and by applying the tests laid down by those cases that we will now have to decide whether or not galvanised plain of corrugated sheets and sheets are different from iron and steel specified in entry No in the Third Schedule to the Andhra Pradesh General Sales Tax Act
