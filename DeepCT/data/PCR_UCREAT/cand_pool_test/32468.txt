In December he was appointed to a substantive post in <ORG> on probation He was accordingly asked to show cause against his discharge <NAME> with all the contentions raised on behalf of the respondent petitioner in <ORG> and after examining the relevant rules of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules and Art of rule of the Civil Service Classification Control and Appeal Rules but that he was entitled to the protection under Art Though in that case this <ORG> decided that the order impugned had not that effect this <ORG> went elaborately into all the implications of the service conditions with particular reference to the Railway Service Rules and the constitutional provisions contained in of the Government of India Act and Art Appointment to a post on probation gives to the person so appointed no right to the post and his service may be terminated without taking recourse to the proceedings laid down in the relevant rules for dismissing a public servant or removing him from service The termination of employment of a person holding a post on probation without any enquiry whatsoever cannot be said to deprive him of any right to a post and is therefore no punishment But if instead of terminating such a person service without any enquiry the employer chooses to hold an enquiry into his alleged misconduct or inefficiency of for some similar reason the termination of service is by way of punishment because it puts a stigma on his competence and thus affects his future career In such a case he is entitled to the protection of Art In the last mentioned case if the probationer is discharged on any one of those grounds without a proper enquiry and without his getting a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against his discharge it will amount to a removal from service within the meaning of Art But if the employer simply terminates the services of a probationer without holding an enquiry and without giving him a reasonable chance of showing cause against his removal from service probationary civil servant can have no cause of action even though the real motive behind the removal from service may have been that his employer thought him to be unsuitable for the post he was temporarily holding on account of his misconduct or inefficiency or some such cause It would thus appear that in the instant case thought the respondent was only a probationer he was discharged from service really because the Government had on enquiry come to the conclusion rightly or wrongly that he was unsuitable for the post he held on probation This was clearly by way of punishment and therefore he was entitled to the protection of Art It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the respondent being a mere probationer could be discharged without any enquiry into his conduct being made and his discharge could not mean any punishment to him because he had no right to a post It is true if the Government came to the conclusion that the respondent was not a fit and proper person to hold a post in the public service of the <ORG> it could discharge him without holding any enquiry into his alleged misconduct He had the right in those circumstances to insist upon the protection of Art That protection not having been given to him he had the right to seek his redress in <ORG> The appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs
