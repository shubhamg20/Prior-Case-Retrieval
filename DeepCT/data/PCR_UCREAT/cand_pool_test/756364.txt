On this view it was not necessary to consider whether there was a violation of Art What weighed with this <ORG> was not only that there was a sufficient element of punishment in reverting him so that Art after considering all the previous cases and there is no scope for any misapprehension of the law The facts of the present case are similar to those of <NAME> case and <ORG> was right in holding that there was a violation of the principles of natural justice embodied in Art There were no administrative reasons for the respondent reversion The sudden reversion for the reason given in the order amounts to unjustified stigma which could not be said to be devoid of the element of punishment If he was really unfit as compared with his juniors there could have been a fair comparison with them at a time when such assessment is called for under the rules rules should be made if there are none and on such a comparative assessment of merits the juniors could have been preferred ensuring that there was no violation of Act The Judgment of the Court was delivered by BEG This appeal by special leave granted to the Regional Manager of <ORG> Allahabad challenges the findings of a learned single Judge affirmed by a Division Bench of <ORG> holding that the respondent <NAME> was reverted from the post of a Senior Station Incharge in which he was officiating to his substantive post of a Junior Station Incharge by means of an order dated passed as a measure of punishment inflicted upon him for alleged misconduct indicated by an adverse entry communicated to him by a letter dated th January Even though we have come to the conclusion that the question before us is substantially one of fact we would like to explain a little the law applicable to such cases in view of the submission that <NAME> case supra had led to some misunderstanding of it It was pointed out in that case at No abstract proposition can be laid down that where the services of a probationer are terminated without saying anything more in the order of termination than that the services are terminated it can never amount to a punishment on the facts and circumstances of the case If a probationer is discharged on the ground of misconduct or inefficiency or for similar reason without a proper enquiry and without his getting a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against his discharge it may in a given case amount to removal from service within the meaning of Article of the Constitution In the absence of any Rules governing a probationer in this respect the authority may come to the conclusion that on account of inadequacy for the job or for any temperamental or other reason not involving moral turpitude the probationer is unsuitable for the job and hence must be discharged It was also observed in <NAME> case supra at The fact of holding an inquiry is not always conclusive A preliminary inquiry to satisfy that there was reason to dispense with the services of a temporary employee has been held not to attract Article see We think that the principles involved in applying Article having been sufficiently explained in <NAME> case supra it should no longer be possible to urge that <NAME> case supra could give rise to some misapprehension of the law Indeed we do not think that the principles of law declared and applied so of have really changed But the application of the same law to the differing circumstances and facts of various cases which have come up to this Court could create the impression sometimes that there is some conflict between different decisions of this Court It is the rule deducible from the application of law to the facts and circumstances of a case which constitutes its ratio decidendi and not some conclusion based upon facts which may appear to be similar One additional or different fact can make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases even when the same principles are applied in each case to similar facts He only took the for of the action into account When the case came before <ORG> in special appeal one of the learned Judges agreed with the learned single Judge who had dismissed <NAME> position merely on the ground that <NAME> had no right to the post without considering the impact of the surrounding facts or the background of the order <NAME> had been held to have been punished for nothing beyond what had taken place two years before the reversion order so that it could not have been justly or reasonably connected with the delayed action based upon it This Court could have dismissed the appeal by special leave solely on the ground that no question of law arose on the finding of fact also upheld by this Court that <NAME> was punished in substance so that Article was attracted This <ORG> judgment in <NAME> case supra shows that it was only following the law on Article of the Constitution as laid down repeatedly earlier by this <ORG> It seems to us to be clear after examining the record of <NAME> case supra that what weighed with this <ORG> was not only that there was a sufficient element of punishment in reverting <NAME> for a supposed wrong done from which the order of reversion could not be divorced so that Article had to be complied with but there was also enough of an impropriety and unreasonableness in the action taken against <NAME> solely for a very stale reason which had become logically quite disconnected to make out a case of malice in law even if it was not a case of malice in fact by this <ORG> when it recorded the conclusion In this view of the matter we have no doubt that the order was passed by way of punishment though all outward indicia show the order to be a mere order of reversion Even if it were not so we have no doubt that the order would be Again in <NAME> supra this Court held that the motive behind an order of termination of service in accordance with the terms of a contract would not be really relevant even if an enquiry had been held to decide whether proceedings under Article should be instituted or the services of a <ORG> servant terminated in terms of his contract We have tried to gather from such materials on the record of the case before us as have been made available to us by the parties the spirit and substance to use the expressions employed by this Court in <NAME> case supra of the action taken against the contest A I On the other hand we find that preceding the order of reversion passed on th February against the respondent there is a spurt of warnings and very vague complaints and adverse remarks of th September and th October st October and th January presumably all by a particular superior officer alleging disrespect shown disobedience to orders given and aspersions said to have been cast by the respondent against the conduct of the superior officer There were some old adverse entries also against the respondent His allegations that his juniors are still holding the posts in the cadre in which he was officiating and that there are no administrative reasons for his reversion are not controverted Indeed they can still be taken if there are substantial grounds against the respondent If the respondent is really unfit or inefficient as compared with his juniors there is no reason why on a comparative assessment of merits at a time when such assessment may be called for under the rules there should be rules on the subject if there are none so far his juniors in service should not be preferred over him And as we have already indicated it is still open for the authorities to proceed in a just and legal way against the respondent if there is really a substantial case against him deserving punitive action This appeal is dismissed with costs
