The impugned Act which was passed in order to implement the recommendations of <ORG> and had for its object the regulation of the conditions of service of working journalists and other persons employed in newspaper establishments provided inter alia for the payment of gratuity to a working journalist who had been in continuous service whether before or after the commencement of the Act for not less than three years even when he voluntarily resigned from service regulated hours of work and leave provided for the payment of retrenchment compensation with retrospective effect in certain cases and by laid down the principles that <ORG> was to follow in fixing the rates of wages of working journalists The petitioners contended on various grounds that the provisions of the impugned Act violated their fundamental rights under Arts a and Of the Constitution and that the decision of <ORG> fixing the rates and scales of wages which was arrived at without any consideration whatsoever as to the capacity of the newspaper industry to pay the same imposed too heavy a financial burden on the industry and spelled its total ruin was vitiated by a wrong approach and non application of the proper criteria and transgressed the principles of natural justice and was therefore illegal and void Held that the constitutional validity of the impugned Act with the sole exception of a iii of the Act which infringed Art of the Constitution was beyond question and as that section severable as it was from the rest of the Act must alone be declared ultra vires Section of the Act properly construed made it incum bent on <ORG> to take into consideration the capacity of the newspaper industry to pay the rates and scales of wages recommended by it and as there was nothing to indicate that it bad done so its decision was void and inoperative a of the Constitution was based on Amendment of the Constitution of that country and the rules that could be deduced therefrom made it clear that although freedom of the press included freedom from restriction in respect of employment in the editorial staff the press was not immune from ordinary forms of taxation or from the application of general laws relating to industrial relations or laws regulating payment of wages it had not the effect of taking away or abridging the freedom of speech and expression of the petitioners and did not therefore infringe Art On a true construction of that section it must be held that the criterion of prevalent rates of wages for comparable employment could be consistent only with the wages higher than the bare subsistence or minimum wages and since rates of wages must be held to include scales of wages as well it was essential that <ORG> should take into consideration the capacity of the newspaper industry to pay before it could fix the rates of wages There could be no substance in the contention of the peti tioners that the provisions of the impugned Act relating to proofreaders whom it included within the definition of working journalists period of notice under retrospective operation in cases specified by and hours of work imposed unreasonable restrictions on their fundamental right to carry on business The impugned Act contained no prohibition nor did it in any way prevent <ORG> from giving reasons for its decision and thus passing a speaking order where it chose to do so and it could not therefore be said to have violated the fundamental right of a citizen to move <ORG> for a writ of certiorari under Art The question whether a particular body was exercising legislative administrative or judicial or quasi judicial functions has to be determined in the light of the statute under which it was constituted and an administrative body functioning as such can also be acting in a quasi judicial capacity Article a which guarantees freedom of speech and expression includes the freedom of the employment of means to exercise those rights and consequently comprehends the freedom of the Press The Act also violates the right guaranteed by Art The provisions of ss to and place restraints on newspaper establishments which would have the effect of destroying the business of the petitioners The right to impose restrictions on the right to carry on business under Art it gives them the benefit of the wage fixation by devising machinery in the form of <ORG> without the existence of any industrial dispute without prescribing the major criterion of capacity to pay to be taken into consideration <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> Report of <ORG> pp The reconstitution of the <ORG> oil the retirement of one of its members was ultra vires and unauthorised by the Act as it stood at the time the Rules having been published on July when the questionnaire was issued and when a number of newspapers failed to reply to the questionnaire the <ORG> asserted that it had the powers of <ORG> There is nothing on record to suggest that both as regard rates of wages and the scales of pay <ORG> ever took into account as to what the impact of its decision would be on the capacity of the industry to pay either as a whole or region wise The Act and the decision of <ORG> which under the Act becomes enforceable as a part of it have imposed an excessive and prohibitive burden which will have a tendency to curtail the revenue and restrict circulation which is the means of imparting information and giving free expression to speech impose a penality on the petitioners right to choose the instruments for its exercise or to seek alternative media of expression drive the <ORG> to seek Government aid in order to survive and prevent newspapers from being started In A the due process clause enabled <ORG> to read into the Constitution any doctrine restrictive of the fundamental right in the <ORG> had held that statutory fixation of minimum wage in the newspaper industry was violation of fundamental rights of free speech but after some years the same <ORG> acting under the discretion given by the due process clause took cognizance of altered circumstances in labour relations and held that the imposition of a minimum wage on the Press did not violate the fundamental right Constitution of the United States of America Revised and Annotated <ORG> pp Where Government provided a media for the settlement of disputes and claims between citizen and citizens there was no question of any contravention of fundamental rights which were protected against governmental encroachment The various sections of the Act have the effect of placing restrictions on the press which would in evitably have the effect of restricting the freedom of speech and expression in contravention of Art Sinha Section of the Act says that the <ORG> may fix rates of wages for time work and for piece work The same words in the statute mean the same thing The Act has provided no machinery for a review or revision of the wage structure even if circumstances changed The functions of <ORG> constituted tinder of the Act were not judicial or quasi judicial in character the fixation of the rates of wages by <ORG> was a legislative act and not a judicial one <ORG> arrived at its decision on a consideration of all the criteria laid down in of the Act for fixation of wages and the material as well as the evidence placed before it a large number of the decisions of <ORG> was unanimous under the Act <ORG> has the power and authority to fix the scales of wages also and to give retrospective operation to its decision The principle enunciated by <ORG> several decisions is that when a legislation is attacked on the round of contravention of a fundamental right the <ORG> must first examine whether it directly deals with the fundamental right The fact that a legislation directed in its path and substance to regulate gambling incidentally placed certain restrictions on business was held not to make the law violative of the fundamental right to carry on business will not cease to be reasonable even if such restrictions resulted in prohibition of carrying on business in certain cases Is it an industrial minimum or is it a statutory minimum An industrial minimum is a subsistence wage that has to be paid by any unit if it wishes to exist a statutory minimum is someting more than a subsistence level wage and may be any level which the <ORG> thinks fit to impose Sinha My point is whether the question has been raised and decided or has it been only assumed The matter so far as I know has not been raised and decided The discretion given to <ORG> to consider any other circumstances which to the <ORG> may seem relevant is no doubt subjective The general policy with regard to <ORG> was that they were given the widest discretion and there was no question of their discretion being fettered There is nothing unusual or arbitrary in leaving to <ORG> a wide discretion in the matter of its procedure There is nothing unreasonable in the period of notice for retrenchment in of the Act There is nothing unusual in of the Act which provides for a gratuity There is nothing unreasonable in the constitution of the <ORG> Section of the Act relates only to the mode of recovery of money from an employer and does not impose any financial burden therefore it could not be said that it infringes Art There is nothing unreasonable in of the Act which makes the decision of the <ORG> binding on the employers only There is nothing discriminatory in a provision which governs employees in other industries being extended to working journalists It has no application to this case of delegated legislation The principle audi alteram partem also applies only to judicial or quasi judicial proceedings There was nothing wrong in the Central <ORG> reconstituting the <ORG> on the resignation of Shri <NAME> The decision by majority is provided by Rules framed by the Central <ORG> under of the Act which became a part of the Act There is nothing to warrant the provision being read as obligatory or mandatory There is nothing in the Act which prohibits <ORG> from grouping into chains or multiple units Further there is nothing in the Act to prohibit the treating of several newspaper establish ments publishing one or more newspapers though in different parts of the country as one establishment for fixing rates of wages If <ORG> adopted gross revenue as a workable basis for classification there was nothing wrong and that fact could not vitiate its decision The balance sheets and profit and loss accounts of the petitioner company for several years when analysed show that with normally prudent management the earnings of the <ORG> group of newspapers admit of payment to working journalists on the scale fixed by <ORG> and the decision of <ORG> was legally valid and just having regard to the several factors to be taken into consideration in fixing a fair wage The Act similarly being based on the Report of <ORG> has made no provision for considering the capacity to pay it gives power to <ORG> to fix indeterminate wages investing them with attributes of minimum wages and it confers on the <ORG> power to fix wages i without specifying essential standards ii without casting a duty to follow a reasonable procedure iii without any control by an appellate tribunal or court and iv without providing any opportunity to the parties concerned to be heard on the merits of the proposal it makes In other countries there are various safeguards and checks against arbitrary wage decisions Even if it is held that there was no excessive delegation it is still open to the <ORG> to see whether the restrictions impinged on the Constitutional safeguards tinder Art In the United Kingdom the decisions of <ORG> in the shape of wage regulations proposal acquires legislative character from the order made by the Minister giving effect to the proposals Under the recent amendment of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act <ORG>s constituted under the Act are to follow the procedure of the Industrial <ORG> in respect of arbitration proceedings and it cannot be said that they perform any legislative function of the Constitution raise the question as to the vires of the Working Journalists Conditions of Service and Miscel laneous Provisions Act hereinafter referred to as the Act and the decision of <ORG> constituted thereunder As they raise common questions of law and fact they can be dealt with under one common judgment In order to appreciate the rival contentions of the parties it will be helpful to trace the history of the events which led to the enactment of the impugned Act It came to the conclusion that if a person had been employed as a proof reader only for the purpose of making him a more efficient sub editor then it was obvious that even while he was a proof reader he should be regarded as a working journalist but in all other instances he would not be counted as a journalist but as a member of the press staff coming within the purview of the Factories Act This must be a matter for mutual adjustment between the employers and the employees and if there is no agreement some machinery must be provided by which disputes between the parties could be resolved He has to possess a certain amount of intellectual equipment and should have attained a certain educational standard without which it would be impossible for him to perform his duties efficiently The possible impact of such a minimum wage was also considered by it and it was considered not unlikely that the fixation of such a minimum wage may make it impossible for small papers to continue to exist as such but it thought that if a newspaper could not afford to pay the minimum wage to the employee which would enable him to live decently and with dignity that newspaper had no business to exist by the Bank Award Though the living wage is the target it has to be tempered even in advanced countries by other considerations particularly the general level of wages in other industries and the capacity of the industry to pay In India however the level of the national income is so low at present that it is generally accepted that the country cannot afford to prescribe a minimum wage corresponding to the concept of a living wage It compared the minimum wage recommended by it with the recommendations of the Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh Committees and stated that its recommendations were fairly in line with the recommendations of those Committees particularly having regard to the rise in the cost of living which bad taken place since those reports were made It then considered the applicability of the Industrial Disputes Act to the working journalists and after referring to the award of <ORG> in connection with the dispute between <ORG> and their workman and the decision of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <ORG> it came to the conclusion that the working journalists did not come within the definition of workman as it stood at that time in the Industrial Disputes Act nor could a question with regard to them be raised by others who were admittedly governed by the Act All words and expressions used but not defined in this Act and defined in the Industrial Disputes Act were under to have the meanings respectively assigned to them in that Act Section applied the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act as it was in force for the time being to working journalists as they applied to or in relation to workmen within the meaning of that Act subject to the modification that of that Act in its application to working journalists in regard to the period of notice in relation to the retrenchment of a workman was to be construed as substituting six months in the case of the retrenchment of an editor and three months in the case of any other working journalist Section provided for the payment of gratuity inter alia to a working journalist who had been in continuous service whether before or after the commencement of the Act for not less than three years in any newspaper establishment even when he voluntarily resigned from service of that newspaper establishment Section authorised <ORG> by notification in the Official Gazette to constitute <ORG> for fixing rates of wages in respect of the working journalists in accordance with the provisions of the Act which <ORG> was to consist of an equal number of persons nominated by <ORG> to represent employers in relation to the newspaper establishments and working journa lists and an independent person appointed by <ORG> as the Chairman thereof The decision of the <ORG> fixing rates of wages was to be communicated as soon as practicable to <ORG> and this decision was under to be published by <ORG> in such manner as it thought fit within a period of one month from the date of its receipt by <ORG> and the decision so published was to come into operation with effect from such date as may be specified and where no date was so specified on the date of its publication Section prescribed the powers and procedure of the <ORG> and stated that subject to any rules of procedure which might be prescribed the <ORG> may for the purpose of fixing rates of wages exercise the same powers and follow the same procedure as <ORG> constituted under the Industrial Disputes Act exercised or followed for the purpose of adjudicating an industrial dispute referred to it Sections and applied the provisions of the Industrial Employment Standing Orders Act as it was in force for the time being and also the provisions of the Employees Provident Funds Act as it was in force for the time being to every newspaper establishment in which twenty or more persons were employed Section provided for the recovery of money due from an employer and enacted that where any money was due to a newspaper employee from an employer under any of the provisions of the Act whether by way of compensation gratuity or wages the newspaper employee might without prejudice to any other mode of recovery make an application to <ORG> for the recovery of the money due to him and if <ORG> or such authority as <ORG> might specify in this behalf was satisfied that any money was so due it shall issue a certificate for that amount to the collector and the collector shall proceed to recover that amount in the same manner as an arrear of land revenue notification in the Official Gazette to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act and in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such rules were to provide inter alia for the procedure to be followed by the <ORG> in fixing rates of wages All rules made under this section as soon as practicable after they were made were to be laid before both Houses of <ORG> When a vacancy thus arose in the office of the Chairman or in the membership of the <ORG> <ORG> was to take immediate steps to fill the vacancy in accordance with the Act and the proceedings might be continued before the <ORG> so reconstituted from the stage at which the vacancy was so filled It was divided into three parts It was decided that for purposes of taking oral evidence the country be divided into zones namely Trivandrum Madras Delhi Calcutta and Bombay and the Secretary was asked to summon witnesses to the nearest and convenient centre A copy of the written statement submitted by the representatives of the employers was given to the representatives of the working journalists and they submitted a written reply the same afternoon contending that the <ORG> was competent to fix scales of pay of various categories of working journalists Thereafter several suggestions were made on this question but since there was no possibility of any agreement on this issue the chairman suggested that members should submit their specific scales to him for his study to which the mem bers agreed A newspaper establishment will be classified as i A group if it publishes more than one newspaper from one centre ii A multiple unit if it publishes the same newspaper from more than one centre iii A chain if it publishes more than one newspaper from more than one centre <NAME> suggested that wage scales should be conditional on a newspaper establishment making profits in any particular year and also that time should be given to the newspaper establishments for bringing the scales into operation From that point of view the salaries paid to secondary school teachers college and university teachers and employees in commercial firms and banks should be taken into consideration but the majority had rejected this view Some anomalies may also be pointed out but it must be remembered that we had no data of all the newspapers before us and where we had it was in many cases not satisfactory I am also of the opinion that by rational management there is great scope for increasing the income of newspapers and we have evidence before us that the future of the Indian language newspapers is bright having regard to increasing literacy and the growth of political consciousness of the reading public But if there is a good paper and it deserves to exist we hope the <ORG> and the public will help it to continue Writ Petition No of was thereupon filed on June by <ORG> against <ORG> others and this petition was followed up by similar petitions filed on August by <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> being Petitions Nos and of respectively <ORG> New Delhi filed on August a similar petition being Petition No of and three more petitions being Petitions Nos and of were filed by <ORG> <ORG> Ahmedabad and <ORG> Ahmedabad respectively on September They would also have to pay remuneration to the part time correspondents on the basis of retainer as well as payment for news items on column basis If perchance the petitioners not being able to run their concern except at a loss intended to close down the same the amount which they would have to pay to the working journalists under the pro visions of the Act and the decision of the <ORG> would be Rs If similar benefits were also given to the other members of the staff who were not working journalists the annual burden will increase by Rs The total cost of closing down the concern if perchance the petitioners have to so close down owing to their inability to carry on the business except at a loss is worked out at Rs The wages paid to the working journalists absorb about one third of the total wage bill as against other members of the staff whose wage bill constitutes the remaining two thirds There would also be a further recurring increase in the wage bill by reason of the increments which would have to be given to the various categories of working journalists on the scales of wages prescribed by <ORG> The vires of the Act was challenged on the ground that the provisions thereof were violative of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution under Art were infringed by the impugned Act that the functions of <ORG> were not judicial or quasijudicial in character that the fixation of the rates of wages was a legislative act and not a judicial one that the decision of <ORG> bad been arrived at after taking into consideration all the criteria for fixation of wages under of the Act and the material as well as the evidence led before it that a considerable portion of the decisions recorded by <ORG> were unanimous that <ORG> had the power and authority also to fix the scales of wages and to give retrospective operation to its decision and that the financial position of the petitioners was not such as to lead to their collapse as a result of the impact of the provisions of the impugned Act and the decision of <ORG> The petitioners in Petitions Nos of of of of and of also filed petitions for special leave to appeal against the decision of <ORG> being Petitions Nos and of respectively and this Court granted the special leave in all these petitions under Art We took up the hearing of the Writ Petitions first as they were more comprehensive in scope than the Civil Appeals filed by the respective parties and heard counsel at considerable length on the questions arising for our determination therein The Queensland Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides that the basic wage paid to an adult male employee shall not be less than is sufficient to maintain a well conducted employee of average health strength and competence and his wife and a family of three children in a fair and average standard of comfort having regard to the conditions of living prevailing among employees in the calling in respect of which such basic wage is fixed and provided that in fixing such basic wage the earnings of the children or wife of such employee shall not be taken into account It will be seen from this summary of the concepts of the living wage held in various parts of the world that there is general argument that the living wage should enable the male earlier to provide for himself and his family not merely the bare essentials of food clothing and shelter but a measure of frugal comfort including education for the children protection against ill health requirements of essential social needs and a measure of insurance against the more important misfortunes including old age Article of our Constitution has also adopted as one of the Directive Principles of <ORG> Policy that The <ORG> shall endeavour to secure by suitable legislation or economic Organisation or in any other way to all workers agricultural industrial or otherwise work a living wage conditions of work ensuring a decent standard of life and full enjoyment of leisure and social and cultural opportunities This is the ideal to which our social welfare <ORG> has to approximate in an attempt to ameliorate the living conditions of the workers The concept of the minimum wage The International Convention of prescribes the setting up of minimum wage fixing machinery in industries in which no arrangements exist for the effective regulation of wages by collective agreement or otherwise and wages are exceptionally low As a rule though the living wage is the target it has to be tempered even in advanced countries by other considerations particularly the general level of wages in other industries and the capacity of industry to pay There are however variations of that concept and a distinction has been drawn for instance in Australian industrial terminology between the basic wage and the minimum wage There is also a distinction between a bare subsistence or minimum wage and a statutory minimum wage If an industry is unable to pay to its workmen at least a bare minimum wage it has no right to exist If an employer cannot maintain his enterprise without cutting down the wages of his employees below even a bar subsistence or minimum wage he would have no right to conduct his enterprise on such terms They would therefore include all payments made from time to time to a workman during the course of his employment as such and not merely the starting amount of wages at the beginning of his employment Rates of wages would thus include the scales of wages and there is no antithesis between the two expressions the expression being applicable both to the initial as well as subsequent amounts of wages Similar observations were made in the case of <ORG> For before incremental scales can be imposed by adjudication it is essential to see whether employer would be able to bear its burden There is the important question of determining the charges that have to be deducted before arriving at the amount that can be paid in wages As regards the measure of the capacity again there are two points of view in regard to the same One view is that the wage fixing machinery should in determining the capacity of industry to pay have regard to i a fair return on capital and remuneration to management and ii a fair allocation to reserves and depreciation so as to keep the industry in a healthy condition Again unless what the trade can bear be held to imply that in no circumstances should the existing rate of profit be reduced there is no reason why attempts should not be made to discover how far it is possible to force employers to bear the burden of an increased rate without driving them out of business The principles which emerge from the above discussion are that in the fixation of rates of wages which include within its compass the fixation of scales of wages also the capacity of the industry to pay is one of the essential circumstances to be taken into consideration except in cases of bare subsistence or minimum wage where the employer is bound to pay the same irrespective of such capacity that the capacity of the industry to pay is to be considered on an industry cum region basis after taking a fair cross section of the industry and that the proper measure for gauging the capacity of the industry to pay should take into account the elasticity of demand for the product the possibility of tightening up the <ORG> so that the industry could pay higher wages without difficulty and the possibility of increase in the efficiency of the lowest paid workers resulting in increase in production considered in conjunction with the elasticity of demand for the product no doubt against the ultimate background that the burden of the increased rate should not be such as to drive the employer out of business <ORG> can make such further enquiries as it considers necessary and thereafter submit the proposals to the Minister either without amendment or with such amendments as it thinks fit in regard to the same The Minister considers these wage regulations proposals and makes an order giving effect to the proposals from such date as may be specified in the order There are also similar provisions under the Agricultural Wage Regulation Act Geo In Australia also there are provisions in various states for the appointment of wage boards the details of which we need not go into The first important enactment for the settlement of disputes was the Bombay Industrial Disputes Act which created <ORG> The Act had limited application and the Court was not charged with the responsibilities of fixing and regulating wages Under that Act the appropriate <ORG> has either to appoint a <ORG> to hold enquiries and to advise it in regard to the fixation of minimum rates of wages or if it thinks that it has enough material on hand to publish its proposals for the fixation of wages in the official gazette and to invite objections There is no provision for any appeal There is provision for the filing of appeals from the decisions of the wages boards to <ORG> In order to ensure that the employers and workers representatives shall be persons having the confidence of those whose interests they respectively represent the employers and workers concerned should be given a voice as far as is practicable in the circumstances in the selection of their representatives and if any organisations of the employers and workers exist these should in any case be invited to submit names of persons recommended by them for appointment on the wage fixing body The system however suffers from the limitation that there is no one authority to co ordinate the activities of the various boards with the result that wide disparities may arise between the scales sanctioned for similar industries It leaves the broadest possible discretion in practice to the wage fixing tribunals Thus in Queensland there is a statutory definition of the family unit on whose requirements the basic wage is to be calculated No classification shall be made under this section on the basis of age or sex is entitled to regulate its procedure in such manner as it thinks fit There are however a number of safeguards which have been provided in order to protect the interests of the parties concerned The reports of the industry committees convened by the administrator in the United States of America are subject to scrutiny by the administrator who gives notice to all interested persons and gives them an opportunity of being heard in regard to the same it is only after this is done that he approves and carries into effect the recommendations in these reports on his being fully satisfied that they are proper and if he disapproves of these recommendations he again refers the matter to such committees for further considerations and recommendations The wage boards appointed by the amended Bombay Industrial Relations Act are subject to the appellate jurisdiction as well as supervisory jurisdiction of the industrial courts in the <ORG> and parties affected by their decisions are entitled to file appeals against the same in the industrial courts <NAME> the functions performed There is considerable divergence of opinion in regard to the character of the functions performed by these wage boards and a controversy has arisen as to whether the functions performed by them are administrative judicial or quasi judicial or legislative in character The question assumes importance on two grounds viz i whether the decisions of the wage boards are open to judicial review and ii whether the principle of audi alteram partem applies to the proceedings before the wage boards Any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially is subject to the controlling jurisdiction of <ORG> exercised by means of these orders The principle of audi alteram partem also applies only to judicial or quasi judicial proceedings As was observed by <ORG> in <NAME> District Commissioner of Accra On this part of the case counsel suggested that the provisions of were in the nature of a mass punishment of the inhabitants of the proclaimed district and he relied on the well known passage from the judgment of the court in <NAME> <NAME> no proposition can be more clearly established than that a man cannot incur the loss of liberty or property for an offence by a judicial proceeding until he has had a fair opportunity of answering the charge against him unless indeed the legislature has expressly or impliedly given an authority to act without that necessary preliminary It is the province of judicial power also to decide private disputes between or concerning persons but of legislative power to regulate public concerns and to make laws for the benefit and welfare of the <ORG> The following classic passage from the opinion of <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> is very apposite in this context A judicial inquiry investigates declares and enforces liabilities as they stand on present or past facts and under laws supposed already to exist The Minister then makes orders embodying and giving effect to these proposals representative members of the latter are chosen from within the industry concerned whereas employers and workers on arbitration tribunal come from outside the industry whose disputes they have to resolve if in any case technical knowledge of a particular industry is required this is normally supplied by the help of assessors who take no part in the final award The choice of industrial arbitrators unconnected with the industries the merits of whose claims they must pledge is evidently intended as a guarantee that they like other judges will be free from bias arising from personal interest As against this trend of opinion it has been urged that the decisions of <ORG> in the shape of wage regulation proposals submitted to the minister in Great Britain under <ORG> Act derive their sanction from the orders made by the minister giving effect to these proposals but for such orders of the minister they would merely remain the determinations of <ORG> and would not acquire any legislative character The recent amendment of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act empowers <ORG> by notification in the official <ORG> to constitute for one or more industries a wage board for the <ORG> and enjoins these wage boards to follow the same procedure as <ORG> in respect of arbitration proceedings before it and appeals from the decisions of these wage boards lie to <ORG>s which has powers of superintendence and control over these wage boards and it cannot under the circumstances be urged that these wage boards perform any legislative functions If on a scrutiny of the provisions in regard thereto one can come to the conclusion that they are appointed only with a view to determine the relations between the employers and the employees in the future in regard to the wages payable to the employees there would be justification for holding that they were performing legislative functions Even if on the construction of the relevant provisions of the statute we come to the conclusion that the functions performed by a particular wage board are not of a legislative character the question still remains whether the functions exercised by them are administrative in character or judicial or quasi judicial in character because only in the latter event would their decision be amenable to the writ jurisdiction or to the special leave jurisdiction above referred to There is no doubt that these wage boards are not exercising purely judicial functions Any body of persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially is subject to the controlling jurisdiction of <ORG> exercised by means of these orders A body may be under a duty however to act judicially and subject to control by means of these orders although there is no form of lies inter partes before it it is enough that it should have to determine a question solely on the facts of the particular case solely on the evidence before it apart from questions of policy or any other extraneous considerations Thus if in order to arrive at the decision the body concerned had to consider proposals and objections and consider evidence if at some stage of the proceedings leading up to the decision there was something in the nature of a lies before it then in the course of such consideration and at that stage the body would be under a duty to act judicially Where the decision is that of a court then unless as in the case for instance of justices granting excise licences it is acting in a purely ministerial capacity it is clearly under a duty to act judicially Thus if in order to arrive at the decision the body concerned had to consider proposals and objections and consider evidence then there is the duty to act judicially in the course of that inquiry It is strenuously urged before us by learned counsel for the petitioners that if the functions which the wage boards perform in the matter of fixation of the rates of wages are considered in the light of the principles cited above it would appear that as between the employers on the one hand and the employees on the other there is a proposition and opposition If the functions performed by <ORG> would thus consist of the determination of the issues as between a proposition and an opposition on data and materials gathered by the board in answers to the questionnaire issued to all parties interested and the evidence led before it there is no doubt that there would be imported in the proceedings of <ORG> a duty to act judicially and the functions performed by <ORG> would be quasijudicial in character It has been on the other hand urged before us by the learned counsel for the respondents that the very constitution of <ORG>s is against the fundamental principle of jurisprudence which postulates that no man should be a judge in his own cause There is considerable force in these contentions but A as substituted by the Constitution First Amendment Act with retrospective effect reads as under Nothing in sub clause a of clause shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the <ORG> from making any law in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause in the interests of the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence Freedom of speech and expression includes within its scope the freedom of the press and it would be apposite here to refer to the following passages from Freedom of the Press A Framework of Principles Report of <ORG> in the United States of America Resulting Conception of Freedom of the Press The emerging conception of freedom of the press may be summarised as follows As with all freedoms press freedom means freedom from and freedom for The first case which came up for decision before this court was that of <NAME> The State of Madras It was a case of a ban on the entry and circulation of the appellant journal in the State of Madras under the provisions of section A of the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act and it was observed by <NAME> as he then was at There can be no doubt that freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of propagation of ideas and that freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation who delivered the majority judgment observed at There can be little doubt that the imposition of precensorship on a journal is a restriction on the liberty of the press which is an essential part of the right to freedom of speech and expression declared by Art a and they only lay down that the freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of propagation of ideas which freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation and that the liberty of the press is an essential part of the right to freedom of speech and expression and that liberty of the press consists in allowing no previous restraint upon publication There is however a considerable body of authority to be found in the decisions of the Supreme <ORG> of the United States of America bearing on this concept of the freedom of speech and expression There is room for regulation of the ways and means of invading privacy This is the concept of the freedom of speech and expression as it obtains in the United States of America and the necessary corollary thereof is that no measure can be enacted which would have the effect of imposing a pre censorship curtailing the circulation or restricting the choice of employment or unemployment in the editorial force While therefore no such immunity from the general laws can be claimed by the press it would certainly not be legitimate to subject the press to laws which take away or abridge the freedom of speech and expression or which would curtail circulation and thereby narrow the scope of dissemination of information or fetter its freedom to choose its means of exercising the right or would undermine its independence by driving it to seek Government aid It must be recognized that freedom of speech and expression is one of the most valuable rights guaranteed to a citizen by the Constitution and should be jealously guarded by the <ORG> In the present case it is obvious that the only justification for the enactment of the impugned Act is that it imposes reasonable restrictions in the interests of a section of the general public viz As the preventive detention order results in the detention of the applicant in a cell it was contended on his behalf that the rights specified in article a and have been infringed It was argued that because of his detention he cannot have a free right to speech as and where he desired and the same argument was urged in respect of the rest of the rights mentioned in sub clauses and Although this argument is advanced in a case which deals with preventive detention if correct it should be applicable in the case of punitive detention also to any one sentenced to a term of imprisonment Linder the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code Unless such conclusion necessarily follows front the article it is obvious that such construction should be avoided So read it clearly means that the legislation to be examined must be directly in respect of one of the rights mentioned in the sub clauses If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen freedom of speech or expression or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms etc the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of article will arise On that short ground in my opinion this argument about the infringement of the rights mentioned in article generally must fail Any other construction put on the article it seems to me will be unreasonable It was held by <ORG> in that case that though personal liberty is sufficiently comprehensive to include the freedoms enumerated in Art This was also a case of detention under the Preventive Detention Act and the detention of the detenu had been ordered with a view to prevent him from making speeches prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and if the <ORG> had come to the conclusion that there was an infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expression the order could not have been saved under Art The <ORG> however took the view that the direct object of the order was preventive detention and not the infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expression which was merely It was contended on the other hand on behalf of the petitioners that the <ORG> has got to look at the true nature and character of the legislation and judge its substance and not its form or in other words its effect and operation Reliance was placed in this behalf on the following passage in Minnesota Ex Rel The impugned Act is as its long title shows an act to regulate certain conditions of service of working journa lists and other persons employed in newspaper establishments and in the very forefront of the Act the Industrial Disputes Act is by made applicable to working journalists with certain modification in connection with the application of of that Act It was however urged that apart from the application of these general laws to the working journalists there are provisions enacted in the impugned Act in relation to payment of gratuity hours of work leave and fixation of the rates of wages which are absolutely special to the press industry qua the working journalists and they have the effect of singling out the press industry by creating a class of privileged workers with benefits and rights which have not been conferred upon other employees and the provisions contained therein have the effect of laying a direct and preferential burden on the press have a tendency to curtail the circulation and thereby narrow the scope of dissemination of information fetter the petitioner freedom to choose the means of exercising their right and are likely to undermine the independence of the press by having to seek Government aid The gravamen of the complaint of the petitioners against the impugned Act however has been the appointment of <ORG> for fixation of rates of wages for the working journalists and it is contended that apart from creating a class of privileged workers with benefits and rights which were not conferred upon other employees of industrial establishments the Act has left the fixation of rates of wages to an agency invested with arbitrary and uncanalised powers to impose an indeterminate burden on the wage structure of the press to impose such employer employee relations as in its discretion it thinks fit and to impose such burden and relation for such time as it thinks proper The fundamental right of the petitioners herein is the right to carry on any occupation trade or business which in so far as it is relevant for our purposes enacts Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause The contention under this head is thus elaborated on behalf of the petitioners Legislation which arbitrarily or excessively invades the right cannot be said to contain the quality of reasonableness and unless it strikes a proper balance between the freedom guaranteed in article and the social control permitted by clause of article it must be held to be wanting in that quality It is important in this context to bear in mind that the test of reasonableness where ever prescribed should be applied to each individual statute impugned and no abstract standard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases The appointment of a wage board for the purposes of fixing rates of wages could not be and was not challenged as such because the constitution of such wage boards has been considered one of the appropriate modes for the fixation of rates of wages Though under the amendment of that Act by the Industrial Disputes Amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions Act there is a provision for the appointment of <ORG> by <ORG> for the adjudication of industrial disputes which in the opinion of <ORG> involve questions of national importance or are of such a nature that industrial establishments situated in more than one State are likely to be interested in or affected by such dispute Vide the condition precedent however is the existence of an industrial dispute or the appre hension of one These criteria it was contended were only relevant for fixing minimum rates of wages though the word minimum which had been used in the Bill No of as introduced in <ORG> was deleted when the Act actually came to be passed and it was further contended that the capacity of the Industry to pay which was an essential circumstance to be taken into consideration in the fixation of wages was not set out as one of the circumstances to be taken into consideration by the <ORG> in fixing rates of wages We do not propose to enter into any elaborate discussion on the question whether it would be competent to us in arriving at a proper construction of the expression fixing rates of wages to look into the Statement of Objects and Reasons attached to the Bill No of as introduced in <ORG> or the circumstances under which the word minimum came to be deleted from the provisions of the Bill relating to rates of wages and the Wage <ORG> and the fact of such deletion when the Act came to be passed in its present form This was the concept of a minimum wage which was sought to be implemented by the legislature and for that purpose the capacity of the industry to pay was an essential circumstance to be taken into consideration and the deletion of the word minimum if at I A I Cal But by the deletion of that wordfrom the context <ORG> was invested with a power to determine the question of the fixation of rates of wages unfettered by any such limitations and to fix the rates of wages in any pro per manner having regard to the circumstances of the case whether the resultant wages would be a statutory minimum wage or would approximate to a standard of wage though having regard to the economic conditions of our country at present they could not find it within their power to fix living wages for the working journalists Reference may be made in this connection to a decision of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> where it was held that the comparison with rates of waves in other concerns could be undertaken for determining fair wage and the upper limit of wages but not for determining the minimum or floor level of wages which should depend on the minimum requirements of the workers family consisting of three consumption units The capacity of the industry to pay was therefore one of the essential circumstances to be taken into consideration by <ORG> whether it be for the fixation of rates of wages or the scales of wages which as we have observed before were included within the expression rates of wages Even here there is considerable difficulty in reconciling oneself to this mode of construction The last criterion enumerated in of the Act was any other circumstance which to the <ORG> may seem relevant and it was urged that this was left merely to the subjective determination of the <ORG> and the <ORG> was at liberty to consider the circumstances if any falling within this category in its own absolute discretion which could not be Controlled by any higher authority If the principles which should guide the <ORG> in fixing the rates of wages were laid down with sufficient clarity and particularity and the criteria so far as they were of major importance were specifically enumerated there was nothing wrong in leaving other relevant considerations arising in the course of the enquiry to the subjective satisfaction of the <ORG> It was however contended that the procedure to be followed by the <ORG> for fixing the rates of wages was not laid down and it was open to the <ORG> to follow any arbitrary procedure violating the principle of audi alteram partem and as such this also was unreasonable Section of the impugned Act gave power to <ORG> to make rules inter alia in regard to the procedure to be followed by the <ORG> in fixing rates of wages and provided that subject to any rules which might be prescribed the <ORG> may for the purpose of fixing rates of wages exercise the same powers and follow the same procedure as <ORG> constituted under the Industrial Disputes Act exercises or follows for the purpose of adjudicating an industrial dispute referred to it It would not therefore be legitimate to hold that the procedure to be followed by the wage board for fixing rates of wages must necessarily be prescribed by the statute constituting the same It is no doubt contemplated in each of these statutes that rules of procedure may be prescribed but even though they may be so prescribed it is left to the discretion of the wage boards to regulate their procedure in such manner as they think fit subject of course to the rules thus prescribed Even though they may perform quasi judicial functions the exercise of arbitrary powers by them would not be countenanced by any court or higher authority The principles to be followed by <ORG> for fixing rates of wages are also laid down and the decision of the <ORG> is to be published in the same manner as awards of industrial courts under the Industrial Disputes Act All these circumstances point to the conclusion that even though the <ORG> was not bound to exercise the same powers and follow the same procedure as an industrial tribunal constituted under the Industrial Disputes Act the <ORG> was in any event not entitled to adopt any arbitrary procedure violating the principles of natural justice There is also a committee on subordinate legislation which is established for scrutinizing and reporting to the <ORG> whether the powers to make regulations rules sub rules by laws etc The constitution by the <ORG> of the Wages <ORG> in the matter of the fixation of rates of wages was not considered as a piece of delegated legislation in the memorandum regarding delegated legislation appended to the draft Bill No of introduced in the Rajya Sabha on September and the only reference that was made there was to Cl of the Bill which empowered <ORG> to make rules in respect of certain matters specified therein and it was stated that these were purely procedural matters of a routine character and related inter alia to prescribing hours of work payment of gratuity holidays earned leave or other kinds of leave and the procedure to be followed by the Minimum Wager <ORG> in fixing minimum wages and the manner in which its decisions may be published Clause of the Bill further provided that all rules made under this section shall as soon as practicable after they are made be laid before both <ORG>s of <ORG> While recognizing the force of these contentions we may observe that it is not necessary for our purposes to determine the nature and character of the functions performed by <ORG> here It was urged that the right to impose reasonable restrictions on the petitioners right to carry on business did not empower the legislature to destroy the business itself and reliance was placed in support of this proposition on <NAME> <ORG> where it was observed From what has thus been said it is not to be inferred that this power of limitation or regulation is itself without limit Similar observations of <ORG> in the Municipal Corporation of the City of Toronto <NAME> and the Attorney General for Ontario Attorney General for the Dominion were also relied upon and particularly the following observations in the former case But their Lordships think there is a marked distinction to be drawn between the prohibition or prevention of a trade and the regulation or governance of it and indeed a power to regulate and govern seem to imply the continued existence of that which is sought to be regulated or governed opinion on this matter and the <ORG> ultimately wound up by saving that whether the restrictions are reasonable or not would depend to a large extent on the nature of the trade and the conditions prevalent in it Even if the provisions of the impugned Act would not necessarily have the effect of destroying the business of the petitioners but of crippling it and making it impossible for the petitioners to continue the same except under onerous conditions they would have the effect of curtailing their circulation and drive them to seek government aid and thereby impose an unreasonable burden on their right to carry on business and would come within the ban of Art The provision with regard to retrenchment was also made applicable retrospectively to all cases of retrenchment which had occurred between July and March so also the payment of gratuity was ordered not only in the cases usually provided for but also in cases where a working journalist who had been in continuous service for not less than three years voluntarily resigned from service from a newspaper establishment These provisions taken each one by itself may not have the effect of destroying the petitioners business altogether or even crippling it in the manner indicated but taken cumulatively along with the provisions contained in ss and of the impugned Act which applied the provisions of the Industrial Employment Standing Orders Act and the Employees Provident funds Act to newspaper establishments would certainly bring about that result and would therefore constitute an unreasonable restriction on the petitioners right to carry on business We shall deal with these contentions one by one There is no doubt that proof readers were not all recommended by <ORG> to be included in the definition of working journalists but it has to be remembered that proof readers occupy a very important position in the editorial staff of a newspaper establishment He has not only to correct mistakes but also to see that corrections are carried out and the Kemsley Manual of Journalism has the following passage at Having thus seen the proof reader in action lot us consider in detail what proof reading denotes If he thinks there is a mistake but is not sure he must query the proof so that the editorial staff may decide There was nothing untoward in that provision also A similar clause is to be found in Switzerland in the collective agreement signed on April between <ORG> and <ORG> If a marked change takes place in the character or fundamental policy of the newspaper if the concern no longer has the same moral political or religious character that it had at the moment when an editorial employee was engaged and if this change is such as to prejudice his honour his reputation or in a general way his moral interests he may demand his instant release We hold therefore that this provision imposes an unreasonable restriction on the petitioners right to carry on business and is liable to be struck down as unconstitutional We shall have occasion to deal with this provision in connection with the alleged infringement of the fundamental right under Art We do not subscribe to the view that such a provision infringes the fundamental right of the petitioners to carry on business under Art that it violates the petitioners fundamental right to carry on business therefore fails except in regard to a iii thereof which being clearly severable from the rest of the provisions can be struck down as unconstitutional without invalidating the other parts of the impugned Act Such discrimination lies in a singling out newspaper employees for differential treatment saddling them with a new burden in regard to a section of their workers in matters of gratuities compensation hours of work and wages devising a machinery in the form of <ORG> for fixing the wages of working journalists not prescribing the major criterion of capacity to pay to be taken into consideration allowing the Board in fixing the wages to adopt any arbitrary procedure even violating the principle of audi alteram partem permitting the <ORG> the discretion to operate the procedure of the Industrial Disputes Act for some newspapers and any arbitrary procedure for others making the decision binding only on the employersand not on the employees and providing for the recovery of money due from the employers in the same manner as an arrear of land revenue In order however to pass the test of permissible classification two conditions must be fulfilled namely i that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and ii that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question These were the considerations which weighed with <ORG> in recommending the working journalists for special treatment as compared with the other employees of newspaper establishments in the matter of amelioration of their conditions of service We may also in this connection refer to the following passage from the Legislation for Press Film and Radio in the world to day a series of studies published by <ORG> in supra at Under certain systems special advantages more extensive than those enjoyed by ordinary employees are conferred upon journalists Thus for example this law gives all professional journalists the right to an annual holiday with pay However if the period of service exceeds years the amount of the indemnity is fixed as we have seen by an arbitral committee The working journalists are thus a group by themselves and could be classified as such apart from the other employees of newspaper establishments and if the <ORG> embarked upon a legislation for the purpose of ameliorating their conditions of service there was nothing discriminatory about it The only thing which is prohibited under this article is that persons belonging to a particular group or class should not be treated differently as amongst themselves and no such charge could be levelled against this piece of legislation If this group of working journalists was specially treated in this manner there is no scope for the objection that group had a special legislation enacted for its benefit or that a special machinery was created for fixing the rates of its wages different from the machinery employed for other workmen under the Industrial Disputes Act There was no industrial dispute as such which had arisen or was apprehended to arise as between the employers and the working journalists in general though it could have possibly arisen as between the employers in a particular newspaper establishment and its own working Journalists If therefore such a machinery was devised for their benefit there was nothing objectionable in it and there was no discrimination as between the working journalists and the other employees of newspaper establishments in that behalf There was no occasion if <ORG> chose to exercise the same powers and follow the same procedure as <ORG> under the Industrial Disputes Act for it to discriminate between one set of newspaper establishments and others Once the rates of wages were fixed by <ORG> it would normally follow that they would govern the relationship between the employers and the working journalists but if liberty was reserved to the working journalists for further increase in their wages under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act there was nothing untoward in that provision and that did not by itself militate against the position that what was done for the benefit of the working journalists was a measure for the amelioration of their conditions of service as a group by themselves It may be remembered that if the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act which was a general Act had been made applicable to the working journalists there would have been no quarrel with the same We do not see anything discriminatory in making such a provision for the recovery of monies due by the employers to these working journalist The only question for consideration would be whether there was a nexus between the basis of classification and the object of the Act sought to be challenged The classification was based on an intelligible differentia which distinguished the working journalists from other employees of newspaper establishments and that differentia had a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved viz It is contended that the right to apply to <ORG> for a writ of certiorari required an order infringing a fundamental right that such a right was itself a fundamental right and any legislation which attempted to restrict or defeat this right was an infraction of Art This decision was affirmed by <ORG> and the decision of <ORG> is reported in <NAME> <ORG> Ex parte Shaw and while doing so <NAME> as he then was discussed at what was it that constituted the record What then is the record Following these cases I think the record must contain at least the document which initiates the proceedings the pleadings if any and the adjudication but not the evidence nor the reasons unless the tribunal chooses to incorporate them This decision only affirmed that certiorari could lie only if an order made by the inferior tribunal was a speaking order The reason given by <NAME> as he then was is stated at This <ORG> would be disabled from exercising its functions under article and adjudicating on the point that the grounds given satisfy the requirements of the sub clause if it is not open to it to see the grounds that have been furnished This <ORG> would be entitled to examine the matter and to see whether the grounds furnished are the grounds on the basis of which he has been detained or they contain some other vague or irrelevant material The whole purpose of furnishing a detained person with the grounds is to enable him to make a representation refuting these grounds and of proving his innocence In order that this <ORG> may be able to safeguard this fundamental right and to grant him relief it is absolutely essential that the detenu is not prohibited under penalty of punishment to disclose the grounds to the <ORG> and no injunction by law can be issued to this <ORG> disabling it from having a look at the grounds Section creates a substantive offence if the grounds are disclosed and it also lays a duty on the <ORG> not to permit the disclosure of such grounds It virtually amounts to a suspension of a guaranteed right provided by the Constitution inasmuch as it indirectly by a stringent provision makes administration of the law by this <ORG> impossible and at the same time it deprives a detained person from obtaining justice from this <ORG> In my opinion therefore this section when it prohibits the disclosure of the grounds contravenes or abridges the rights given by Part III to a citizen and is ultra vires the powers of <ORG> to that extent It is no doubt true that if there was any provision to be found in the impugned Act which prevented <ORG> from giving reasons for its decision it might be construed to mean that the order which was thus made by <ORG> could not be a speaking order and no writ of certiorari could ever be available to the petitioners in that behalf It is also true that in that event this <ORG> would be powerless to redress the grievances of the petitioners by issuing a writ in the nature of certiorari and the fundamental right which a citizen has of approaching this <ORG> under Art The position however as it obtains in the present case is that there is no such provision to be found in the impugned Act It is left to the discretion of <ORG> whether it should give the reasons for its decision or not It may be noted that this point was not at all urged in the petitions which the petitioners had filed in this Court but was taken up only in the course of the arguments by the learned Counsel for the petitioners In regard to the constitutionality of the Act therefore we have come to the conclusion that none of the provisions thereof is violative of the fundamental rights enshrined in Arts Apart from challenging the vires of the Act dealt with above the petitioners contend that the decision of <ORG> itself is illegal and void because Reconstitution of the Board was ultra vires and unauthorised by the Act as it stood at the time the rules having been published only on July The decision by a majority was unwarranted by the Act and since there was no provision in the Act the Rules providing for the same went beyond the Act and were therefore ultra vires There was no provision in the Act for the resignation of any member from his membership or for the filling in of the vacancy which thus arose in the membership of the <ORG> This power of constituting <ORG> must be construed having regard to of the General Clauses Act which says that where by any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of the Act any power is conferred then unless a different intention appears that power may be exercised from time to time as occasion arises If this is the true position there was nothing objectionable in <ORG> reconstituting the <ORG> on the resignation of <NAME> being accepted by it That section empowered <ORG> to make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act in particular to provide for the procedure to be followed by the <ORG> in fixing rates of wages It is urged that the procedure established under the Industrial Disputes Act was not in terms prescribed for <ORG> the <ORG> having been given under of the Act the discretion for the purpose of fixing rates of wages to exercise the same powers and follow the same procedure as <ORG> constituted under the Industrial Disputes Act while adjudicating upon an industrial dispute referred to it On two distinct occasions however <ORG> definitely expressed itself that it had the powers of <ORG> constituted under the Industrial Disputes Act The first occasion was when the questionnaire was issued by <ORG> and in the questionnaire it mentioned that it had such powers under of the Act It would have been no doubt more prudent for <ORG> to have followed the procedure outlined above The Act made no provision in this behalf and the <ORG> was perfectly within its rights if it chose not to give any reasons for its decision Prudence should however have dictated that it gave reasons for the decision which it ultimately reached because if it had done so we would have been spared the necessity of trying to probe into its mind and find out whether any particular circumstance received due consideration at its hands in arriving at its decision This note of the Chairman is very revealing and throws considerable light on the question whether particular circumstances were at all taken into consideration by <ORG> before it arrived at its decision If the need for classification is accepted as it should be having regard to the various sizes and capacities of newspaper establishments all over the country it was certainly necessary to adopt a workable test for such classification and if <ORG> had adopted classification on the basis of the gross revenue we do not see any reason why that decision of its was in any manner whatever unwarranted We have already referred in the earlier part of this judgment to the unsatisfactory nature of the profit and loss test As a matter of fact even before us attempts were made by the respondent <ORG> to demonstrate that the profit and loss accounts and the balance sheets of several petitioners were manipulated and unreliable The short answer to this contention is that if such grouping into chains or multiple units was justified having regard to the conditions of the newspaper industry in the country there was nothing in the Act which militated against such grouping Reliance was placed in support of this contention on a decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> where the expression which came up for construction before the <ORG> was employed in an industrial establishment and it was observed that Employed in an industrial establishment must mean employed in some particular place that place being the place used for manufacture or an activity amounting to industry as that term is used in the Act is not an industrial establishment as that expression has been used in the several sections of the Act I need refer only to section of the Act to negative the contention of the learned counsel for <ORG> <ORG> with all its branches should betaken as one industrial establishment These decisions lend support to the contention that a newspaper establishment like an industrial establishment should be located in one place even though it may be carrying on its activities of production or publication of more newspapers than one Here again the petitioners are faced with this difficulty that there is nothing in the Act to prohibit such a grouping There is nothing in the Act to prohibit the treating of several newspaper establishments producing or publishing one or more newspapers though in different parts of the country as one newspaper establishment for the purpose of fixing the rates of wages As we have already seen the fixings of rates of wages by <ORG> did not prescribe whether the wages which were to be fixed were minimum wages fair wages or living wages and it was left to the discretion of <ORG> to determine the same The principles for its guidance were However laid down and they prescribed the circumstances which were to be taken into consideration before such determination was made by <ORG> This was the only reference to this requirement of and there was no reference herein to the capacity of the industry to pay which we have held was comprised therein The only question in the questionnaire as finally framed which had any reference to this criterion was Question No in Part A under the heading Special Circumstances and that question was Are there in your regions any special conditions in respect of the newspaper industry which affect the fixing of rates of wages of working journalists If so specify the conditions and indicate how they affect the question of wages It is pertinent to observe that even before <ORG> the figures had disclosed that out of newspapers had been running into loss and with profits and there was an overall profit of about on a capital investment of seven crores There was again another difficulty which faced <ORG> in that behalf and it was that out of newspapers to whom the questionnaire was addressed only or at best had responded and <ORG> was in the dark as to what was the position in regard to other newspaper establishments <ORG> in fact groped in the dark in the absence of sufficient data and information which would enable it to come to a proper conclusion in regard to the wage structure which it was to determine Even with regard to the impact of these proposals on individual newspaper establishments the chairman stated that the future of the Indian language newspapers was bright having regard to increasing literacy and the growth of political con sciousness of the reading public and by rational management there was great scope for increasing the income of newspapers and even though there was no possibility of any adjustment which might satisfy all persons interested it was hoped that no newspaper would be forced to close down as a result of its decision but that if there was a good paper and it deserved to exist the <ORG> and the public would help it to continue It is clear therefore that this principle which found favour with <ORG> was sought to be worked out without taking into consideration the burden which it would impose upon the weaker units of a particular newspaper establishment There is nothing on the record to suggest that both as regards the rates of wages and the scales of wages which it determined <ORG> ever took into account as to what the impact of its decision would be on the capacity of the industry to pay either as a whole or region wise There is however a further difficulty in upholding the decision of <ORG> in this behalf and it is this that even as regards the fixation of the rates of wages of working journalists <ORG> does not seem to have taken into account the other provisions of the Act which conferred upon the working journalists the benefits of retrenchment compensation payment of gratuity hours of work and leave Even though <ORG> established under the Industrial Disputes Act might not give them relief commensurate with the relief which <ORG> gave to the working journalists there was bound to be an improvement in their conditions of service which <ORG> would certainly determine having regard to the benefits which the working journalists enjoyed and this would indeed impose an additional financial burden on the newspaper establishments which would substantially affect their capacity to pay This consideration also was necessarily to be borne in mind by <ORG> in arriving at its final decision and one foes not find anything on the record which shows that it was actually taken into consideration by <ORG> The financial burden which was imposed by the decision of <ORG> was very vividly depicted in the statements furnished to us on behalf of the petitioners in the course of the hearing before us The conclusion however is inescapable that the decision of <ORG> imposed a very heavy financial burden on the newspaper establishments which burden was augmented by the classification on the basis of gross revenue fixation of scales of wages provisions as regards the hours of work and leave grouping of newspapers into chains or multiple units and retrospective operation given to the decision of <ORG> as therein mentioned Nowhere can we find in the instant case any genuine consideration of the capacity of the industry to pay either as a whole or region wise The very fact that <ORG> thought it necessary to express a pious hope that if there is a good paper and it deserves to exist the <ORG> and the public will help it to continue and also desired the interests which it felt had been hit hard by its decision not to pass judgment in haste but to watch the effects of its decision in actual working with patience for a period of to years shows that <ORG> was not sure of its own ground and was publishing its decision merely by way of an experiment Neither in the proceedings nor in any of the tables do we see satisfactory evidence to show that the capacity of the industry to pay was examined by the <ORG> in fixing the wage structure A cross section of these respective classes may have to be taken for careful examination and all relevant factors may have to be borne in mind in deciding what burden the class considered as a whole can bear After all in cases of this kind where special <ORG>s are set up to frame wage structures this <ORG> would normally refuse to constitute itself into a court of appeal on questions of fact but in the present case an essential condition for the fixation of wage structure has been completely ignored and so there is no escape from the conclusion that the <ORG> has contravened the mandatory requirement of and in consequence its decision is ultra vires the Act itself The retrospectivity may have its repercussions on the capacity of the industry to pay and we need not say anything more in regard to the same On a consideration of all the grounds of attack thus levelled against the validity and the binding nature of the decision of <ORG> we have therefore come to the conclusion that the said decision cannot be sustained and must be set aside These Civil Appeals are directed against the decision of <ORG> and seek to set aside the same as destroying the very existence of the newspaper establishments concerned and infringing their fundamental rights
