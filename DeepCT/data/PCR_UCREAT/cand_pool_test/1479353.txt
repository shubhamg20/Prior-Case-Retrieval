The assessee preferred an appeal against the assessment order Before the <ORG> the assessee filed an additional ground stating that the ITO should have allowed the surtax liability of the assessee company as a deduction The assessee appealed to <ORG> which decided the issue with the following observation We have heard both sides At the instance of the assessee company the <ORG> has referred the following question of law to this court under Section of the I Act arising out of the <ORG> order dated th February Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and on a correct interpretation of the provisions of the Income tax Act the <ORG> was right in holding that the surtax liability under the Companies Profits Surtax Act for the relevant year should not be deducted in arriving at the total income under the Income tax Act It has further been argued that there are significant changes in the phraseology of Section a ii of the Act from the language used in Section of the Act It has been argued that Section a ii has been incorporated only for the purpose of excluding the liability of income tax and the liability for surtax should be allowed as expenditure wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of business It is not a case of the application by the appellant of part of his income in a particular way it is rather the allocation of a sum out of his revenue before it becomes income in his hands Payment of surtax by an assessee cannot be described as an allocation of a sum out of his revenue before it becomes income in his hands Obligations no doubt there are in every case but it is the nature of the obligation which is the decisive factor There is a difference between an amount which a person is obliged to apply out of his income and an amount which by the nature of the obligation cannot be said to be a part of the income of the assessee The assessee total income has been computed by the ITO under the provisions of the I Act to be Rs It is as if he received only from the consumers the original amount minus the amount he returned to them The amount returned is not a part of the profits at all <ORG> held that in the case of a sub partnership the sub partnership created a superior title and diverted the income from the main firm before it became the income of the partner This case in our opinion does not throw any light on the problem before us <ORG> held that the amount paid was either a revenue expenditure or diverted by an overriding charge or an expenditure laid out wholly or exclusively for the purposes of trading The company distributed as dividend tax free A sum which is an expense which must be borne whether profits are earned or not may no doubt be deducted before arriving at profit Taxes on company income An English legal interpretation of the nature of these taxes may be found in a decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> All TCR CA which dealt with the question as to whether excess profits tax should be deducted in arriving at net profit That all statutory dues including taxes on income will have to be deducted from the income of a company for the purpose of computing its divisible profit for the purpose of distribution of dividend cannot be disputed AH ER <ORG> was faced with the problem of construction of an agreement which provided for sale of property including the business of West African merchants formerly carried on by the vendor company That however does not quite answer the question because it may still be asked computing the profits of a trading company for what purpose Now there again it seems to me that the answer is a clear answer for the ordinary purpose for which profits of a trading company are computed namely the profit and loss account of the company on the basis of which the profits are to be distributed As Lord <NAME> put it whether these profits are so divided or are used for developing the company business or in other similar ways did not affect the position In fact there is a specific provision under the Chargeable profits has been defined to mean total income of an assessee as computed under the I Act and adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the First Schedule We shall now consider the argument that the liability for surtax must be allowed as business expenditure in computing the total income of the assessee under the I Act and the embargo contained in Section a ii of the I Act must be confined to income tax only Tax in relation to the assessment year commencing on the st day of April and any subsequent assessment years means income tax chargeable under the provisions of this Act and in relation any other assessment year income tax and super tax chargeable under the provisions of this Act prior to the aforesaid date The definition given in Section only will apply unless the context otherwise requires This is made clear in the judgment of this court in <ORG> case that business income is broken up under different heads only for the purpose of computation of the total income by that break up the income does not cease to be the income of the business the different heads of income being only the classification prescribed by the Indian Income tax Act for computation of income The importance of this distinction was pointed out by <NAME> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Ch CA There are many things which in common colloquial English would not be called a business even when carried on by a single person which would be so called when carried on by a number of persons For instance a man who is the owner of offices that is of a house divided into several floors and used for commercial purposes would not be said to carry on a business because he let the offices as such but suppose a company was formed for the purpose of buying a building or leasing a house to be divided into offices and to be let out should not we say if that was the object of the company that the company was carrying on business for the purpose of letting offices or was an office letting company trying it by the use of ordinary colloquial language The same observation may be made as regards a Single individual buying or selling land with this addition that he may make it a business and then it is a question of continuity Moreover in the case before us the assessee filed a return disclosing an income of Rs If the tax that is sought to be imposed is not on the profits or gains of the business of the assessee it is certainly levied on the basis of the profits or gains made by the assessee company in its business It was also provided that if any amount of excess profits tax was refunded it would be taken into account in computing the profits and gains of a business for the purpose of income tax as if the amounts were profits accruing in the relevant previous year Section defines chargeable profits It means total income of an assessee computed under the I Act and adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the First Schedule Section of the Act empowers the ITO to recompute and determine the surtax payable or refundable when an order has been passed under Section or of the I Act and the period of limitation for such recomputation shall be four years from the date of the relevant order passed under the I Act If there is any reduction or enhancement of the amount of income tax payable by an assessee as a result of any proceeding by way of rectification or revision or appeal or reference then the surtax assessment will have to be modified accordingly There is no provision similar to Section of the Excess Profits Tax Act or Section of the Business Profits Tax Act wherein it was specifically provided that these two taxes will be deductible from the total income for the purpose of computation of income tax For the purpose of Sections and A and this Section i distributable income means the gross total income of a company as reduced by a the amount of income tax payable by the company in respect of its total income but excluding the amount of any income tax payable under Section If we accept the contention made on behalf of the assessee and hold that the surtax payable by the assessee is eligible for deduction under Section of the I Act for the purpose of computation of the total income of the assessee then Section of the Surtax Act becomes meaningless and otiose It has been held that there is no distinction in principle between payment of excess profits tax under the laws of England and under the laws of a foreign country in this respect The amount of excess profits tax paid under a foreign statute is not allowable as deduction because there is no specific provision of law to that effect Therefore on general principle an amount paid by way of excess profits tax under foreign law cannot be allowed as deduction in England It has been argued that in order to decide the question that has arisen before us reliance should not be placed on the English cases because the phrase wholly and exclusively for the purpose of business has been construed by <ORG> in a very wide sense This test however was not applied by the other judges of <ORG> who agreed with Lord <NAME> in that case In the case of <ORG> <ORG> has relied on the ratio of the decision in the case of <ORG> <ORG> in holding that wealth tax was an allowable deduction as business expenditure It was held by <ORG> at The tax is not in my judgment a tax which is of the same character as income tax or excess profits tax it is not a tax which can only be measured and the liability to which can only be ascertained after the profits position of the company has been finally determined in any year Payment of that tax is not as it seems to me an application of the company profits nor is it a payment which in its nature could be said to fall to be made out of the earned profits of the company for it is not a tax the liability to which depends upon the company having earned any profits It is a liability which the company has exposed itself to or undertaken in order that it may be able to carry on its business in the Argentine The judgment of <ORG> was affirmed on appeal The real question is whether a tax which has been imposed on the total income of a company after some adjustments can be allowed as a deduction in computing total income of that company under the I Act But where the tax was levied as it was in <ORG> case TC CA on capital or assets used for the purpose of earning these profits it was a permissible deduction in calculating profits The question of deducibility of excess profits tax paid by a company as business expenditure came up for consideration before <ORG> in the case of IRC <ORG> TC It was held that it could not be allowed as a deduction on the ground that excess profits tax was a tax on profits and it could not be allowed on the same principle that income tax was not allowed as a deduction in making assessment of income This case is important for our purpose and the principle laid down in this case is equally applicable to surtax which is a tax of the same character as income tax or excess profits tax Taxes such as these are not paid for the purpose of earning the profits of the trade they are the application of those profits when made and not the loss so that they are exacted by a dominion or foreign government It is true that the payments which the respondents seek to have allowed as deductions were payments of <ORG> taxes and not of United Kingdom taxes but the parties have admitted that the relevant legislation in <ORG> corresponds to that in the United Kingdom and I cannot see that there is any distinction in principle between them for present purposes It therefore appears to me to be established that there is not and never was any right under the principles applicable to Case I to deduct income tax or excess profits tax British or foreign in computing trading profits Lord <NAME> observed at as follows It is true that both those decisions bore upon the question of deducting excess profits tax paid in this country in a computation of pro fits and the question before us relates to a deduction of income and profit taxes paid in another country Lord <NAME> was also of the view that the amount paid by way of excess profits tax was not actually an expenditure but was to be deducted as an expenditure from the profits of the company because of the specific provision made in the Finance Act It has also been argued on behalf of the assessee that the earning of profit and payment of taxes are not isolated and independent activities The liability to pay income tax and surtax arises because a person is carrying on the business by which he earns profits Therefore the liability to pay the tax is an incidence of carrying on of the business through which he earns profits Without an express provision to that effect there is no scope for deducting the estimated amount of surtax from the profits for the purpose of arriving at the taxable income <ORG> pointed out at of ITR as follows The essential test which has to be applied is whether the expenses were incurred for the preservation and protection of the assessee business from any such process or proceedings which might have resulted in the reduction of its income and profits and whether the same were actually and honestly incurred If the assessee takes any steps for reducing its liability to tax which result in more funds being left for the purpose of carrying on the business there is always a possibility of higher profits As was observed by Viscount <NAME> in Smith Potato Estates case TC ITR Suppl If he succeeds he will have more money with which to earn profits next year Costs charges and expenses for the purpose of reducing or avoiding liability for payment of income tax or surtax may well be expenditure wholly and exclusively incurred for the purpose of business Liability to pay this tax depends upon whether profits are made or not In our opinion having regard to the nature of the tax and the scheme of the Surtax Act the liability to pay surtax cannot be allowed as a deduction from the total income of the assessee as expenditure wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of its business We therefore answer the question that has been referred in the affirmative and against the assessee
