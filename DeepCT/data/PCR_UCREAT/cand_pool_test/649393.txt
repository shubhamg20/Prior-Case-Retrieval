of the Constitution had been violated inasmuch as he had a right to be equally treated with the <ORG> Servants similarly situated Held that under the provisions of Rule of the Fundamental Rules it is a matter of discretion with the local Government whether it will grant dearness allowance to any Government servant and if so how much It imposes no duty on the <ORG> to grant it and therefore no mandamus can issue to compel the <ORG> to grant it nor can any other writ or direction be issued in respect of it as there is no right in the Government servant which is capable of being protected or enforced Nor does it contemplate a law of the <ORG> or of the <ORG> dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of two enactments The sources of authority for the two statutes being different Article can have no application is highly discri minatory that the <ORG> servant has a right to be treated equally with the <ORG> servant similarly situated and that every servant has these fundamental and natural rights and the petitioner and the members of <ORG> have a right to demand from the respondent the Dearness Allowance at the <ORG> rates It is against this judgment that the present appeal has been preferred by <ORG> on a certificate granted under article of the Constitution It is argued on behalf of the appellant firstly that grant of dearness allowance is a matter ex gratia and not justiciable and that neither a writ of mandamus nor any direction could be issued with reference thereto and secondly that the Resolution dated th September is not hit by article of the Constitution That being so the prayer for mandamus is clearly misconceived as that could be granted only when there is in the applicant a right to compel the performance of some duty cast on the opponent It merely confers a power on the <ORG> to grant compassionate allowance at its own discretion and no mandamus can issue to compel the exercise of such a power Nor indeed could any other writ or direction be issued in respect of it as there is no right in the applicant which is capable of being protected or enforced Now the scheme which has been adopted in the impugned Resolution is firstly that dearness allowance if to I be paid to the employees on a scale graded according to pay different rates being adopted for different slabs and there being a progressive reduction Mr <NAME> does not contend that there is anything in the scheme or in the Resolution adopting it which bring it within the prohibition enacted in article We do not find anything in article which supports this somewhat startling contention Article enacts that the <ORG> shall not make any laws taking away or abridging the rights conferred by Part III and article enacts that The <ORG> shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India If it decides that it does it has to declare it void if it decides that it does not it has to uphold it Nor does it contemplate a law of the <ORG> or of the <ORG> dealing with similar subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of comparative study of the provisions of the two enactments The sources of authority for the two statutes being different article can have no application It was argued on behalf of the appellant that the assumption underlying the argument of the respondent with reference to article that the <ORG> had adopted the Report of the <ORG> in part and rejected it in part was itself without foundation In the view we have taken on the applicability of article this question has no practical importance but as all the materials have been placed before us we may briefly express our opinion thereon In paragraph they observed that unlike the <ORG> they were taking into consideration the financial resources of the <ORG> in fixing the scale Mr <NAME> also referred us to two Resolutions of the appellant dated th January and th October adopting the scale fixed by the <ORG> in respect of certain other categories That has no bearing on the question whether the <ORG> whose recommendations were approved by the <ORG> had adopted in part the Report of the <ORG> so as to result in discrimination In the result this appeal must be allowed and the petition of the respondent dismissed but in the circumstances there will be no order as to costs either here or in the <ORG> below
