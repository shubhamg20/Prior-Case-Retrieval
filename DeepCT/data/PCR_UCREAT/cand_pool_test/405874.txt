The appeal arises out of a suit instituted by the plaintiff for Rs There is a note at the end of Ex The sale of the property was fixed for th July on which date the plaintiff put in a claim petition A No of Ex I The learned District Munsif held that inasmuch as the plaintiff claim based on the sale was dismissed and he did not bring a suit within a year to set aside the order he lost his right wider the sale deed and was debarred from claiming the property any longer Ex Having lost his rights under the sale deed by his own default the plaintiff instituted the present suit on th October to recover the money due under the mortgage bond dated st August Dealing with the first contention of the plaintiff it does not appear in the present case that the <ORG> made an order that the property should be sold subject to the suit mortgage There is nothing on the record to show that the executing <ORG> decided whether the suit mortgage subsisted or not and ordered attachment and sale subject to the mortgage as required under this provision In our opinion the present case falls within the latter class and we are confirmed in this opinion by a comparison of the proclamation of sale with Form No given in the Civil Rules of Practice We think that by the note appearing in the sale proclamation the decree holder intended to give notice of the suit mortgage which he thought was prima facie valid and he gave also notice of other encumbrances which in his view were invalid II he stated with reference to the sale that he purchased the property under a registered sale deed that it is supported by consideration and has been effected in partial discharge of the debt due to him under the registered mortgage bond dated st August that is the suit bond for Rs This is made clear in para There is no case of estoppel here as in <NAME> <NAME> I All The order precluded the plaintiff from proceeding upon the same cause of action against the attaching decree holder or against the auction purchaser whose title proceeded from the same attachment and sale but otherwise it does not affect the validity of the sale deed in other words the mortgage is not revived by operation of this order There is therefore no reason why the plaintiff should be allowed to fall back upon the previous mortgage The effect of the execution of the sale deed must therefore be taken to be the extinguishment of the suit mortgage unless there is an express of implied intention to keep the encumbrance alive No such intention has been pleaded in this case nor can it be found on the facts While rib doubt there is good authority for <ORG>s in equity allowing a party when one remedy has failed to take whatever other remedy lies ready to hand <ORG>s can hardly go so far as to allow a party to revive a dead remedy merely because that best suits his convenience Before the plaintiff can invoke equity in his favour he must show that there is a remedy available to him on which he can rely It is dismissed with costs
