The petitioner filed objections to these notices The petitioner filed objection to the aforesaid notice challenging the jurisdiction of <ORG> to reopen the assessment under Section of the Act The plea taken was that there was no subsequent information on the basis of which <ORG> could issue the impugned notices The question that arises for decision in the present writ petition is as to whether the Income tax Officer acting under Sections of the Act could reopen the assessment on the basis of the circular issued by <ORG> It was urged that all relevant information in respect of the assessment years was already on the record and the present proceedings taken by the Income tax Officer in effect are mere change of opinion formed by him on the matter and as such the proceedings are without jurisdiction The assessment can be reopened under Section of the Income tax Act only in case the Income tax Officer has in consequence of the information in his possession reason to believe that the income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment The fact that the adjective definite qualified the word information and the word discovers which were introduced in the Income tax Amendment Act were deleted by the Amendment Act of would lead to the irresistible inference that the word information is of the widest amplitude and comprehends a variety of factors Where the ground on which the original assessment is based is held to be erroneous by a superior court in some other case that will also amount to a fresh information which comes into existence subsequent to the original assessment As we read the decision of <ORG> the only restriction is that the information must be of such a nature that the Income tax Officer must have reason to believe that the income has escaped assessment Now the belief which the Income tax Officer has to form on the information received by him is the conviction which a reasonable and prudent man would form on the basis of the objective information received by him that the income has escaped assessment It would he contends give unbridled power to the Income tax Officer to change his view on a question of law even if such information is received from some lay man This means that information must come from such source as would instil confidence in the Income tax Officer and as a prudent man he would have reason to believe that the income has escaped assessment If the Income tax Officer acting on the circular letter of the <ORG> of Direct Taxes entertains the belief that there has been a misapplication of the law as a result of which the income has escaped assessment it cannot be said that he acted arbitrarily in the matter or without any subsequent information Thus the circular sent by <ORG> constitutes information as contemplated by the statute and the Income tax Officer can form a prima facie belief that the income has escaped assessment on account of misapplication of law Counsel for both sides cited a large number of cases but we do not propose to refer to all of them except the following as in our view they do not help in resolving the controversy It took the view that the audit department was not the authority competent and authorised to declare the correct state of law or to pronounce upon it and as such the assessment could not be reopened on the information of the audit department There is nothing in the statute which curtails the source of information to the effect that it must come from some person who was authorised to pronounce upon the law If such a test was applied then it might lead to the result that only judicial decisions would answer the test We are not prepared to accept this test in view of the phraseology of the Section We have already indicated some of the sources of information which could lead the Income tax Officer to form the belief that the information was prima facie correct and that the income has escaped assessment In view of these conclusions the challenge to the notice issued under Sections must fail The petition is accordingly dismissed with costs
