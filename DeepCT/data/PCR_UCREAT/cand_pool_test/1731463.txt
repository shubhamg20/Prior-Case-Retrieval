These are cross appeals under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act as amended by Act of hereinafter called the Act against the award of compensation given under Section thereof by <ORG> Delhi hereinafter called the <ORG> The total amount of the net loss spread over years would therefore come to Rs The amount so reduced came to Rs The various points for decision arising out of the argument of the learned counsels for both the sides may be dealt with broadly under two headings Was the death of <NAME> caused by the negligence of the truck driver or was it caused by the negligence of <NAME> himself or at any rate by the contributory negligence of <NAME> Is the amount of compensation awarded by the <ORG> liable to be enhanced or reduced The learned <ORG> carefully considered the whole evidence on record and I am in full agreement with its finding that the accident was caused by the negligence of the truck driver and that there was no contributory negligence on the part of <NAME> It was argued for the respondents that the truck was compelled to go to the right side of the road to overtake the stationary bus that it sounded the horn before doing so and that <NAME> was coming on its motor cycle so fast that he could nto stop and therefore collided with the truck There is nothing to show that the truck driver took care to see that there was no on coming traffic which would be blocked by his going to the right side There is no such evidence on record The accident was thus caused by the unilateral negligence of the motor truck driver There is no contributory negligence on the part of <NAME> In fact this sudden diversion of the truck to the right side of the road was so indefensible that <NAME> did nto have the courage to say that he took care to warn the on coming traffic before diverting the truck to the right side Even <NAME> has nto been examined to say that he took care to warn the on coming traffic before diverting the truck to the right side When neither <NAME> nor <NAME> has come forward to say that the truck was nto driven rashly and negligently there is complete absence of evidence on the side of the respondents to show that the truck driver had taken any precaution to warn the on coming traffic before diverting to the right side of the road The claimants evidence is supported by the undoubted fact that the accident took place on the right side of the road where the truck was nto entitled to be except after warning the on coming traffic How is the compensation payable for death caused by negligent motor driving to be determined There are two possible answers to this question The Fatal Accidents Act modified the law of torts regarding the payment of compensation for death in India and is therefore to be followed by us first so far as it applies to our case The enactment of Sections to of the Motor Vehicles Act in by the legislature authorised the State Governments to establish Motor Accidents Claims <ORG>s for such areas as may be specified in the notifications for the purposes of adjudicating upon the claims for compensation in respect of accidents in volving the death or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of Motor Vehicles It is clear therefore that the above mentioned provisions do not in any way override the pre existing principles of the law of torts governing the determination of the liability to pay compensation and also the fixation of the amount thereof For the above reasons the correct answer to the question as to how the compensation is to be determined in this case would be that it is to be done according to the existing principles of law of torts applicable to India as modified by Indian Legislation On the contrary they held on agreement of the learned counsels for both the sides in paragraph that the principles underlying Section of the Fatal Accidents Act were applicable to the determination of the compensation for death caused by a motor vehicle The Rule for fixation of the compensation for death according to the law of torts as pithily expressed in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act is that in every such action the <ORG> may give such damages as it may think proportionate to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought There is little direct evidence of the income of <NAME> after June till his death in The original account books were neither produced nor proved by the partners of the deceased <NAME> though they are said to have written them The learned counsel for the claimants urged that the <ORG> was nto bound by the provisions of the Evidence Act and therefore it could and should have relied upon these statements per month the actual amount spent by <NAME> on his dependents would come to Rs In the <ORG> decision cited above the age of the deceased was only years and the compensation awarded to him worked out a life expectancy of only eight years more Since it is being paid to them immediately in a lump sum same scaling down has to be made for such acceleration Both these decisions were cited with approval by <ORG> in the decision referred to above It is a quid pro quo larger if he gets it on the chance that he will never get it at all There is something in the evidence of <NAME> to suggest that out of this insurance amount of Rs In India however there is no such legislation It cannto be said that the statutory changes made in England embody a fundamental rule of justice equity and good conscience or that the unamended common law was therefore contrary to to justice equity and good conscience It is also admitted by <NAME> that Rs were paid to her out of <ORG> on the death of the deceased
