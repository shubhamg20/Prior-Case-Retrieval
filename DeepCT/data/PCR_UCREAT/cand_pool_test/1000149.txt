ACT Income Tax Act Income Tax Act Sections vi and xiv ii iv iv Explanation Depreciation Scientific Research Deductions in computing business income Depreciation allowance in respect of the asset as also allowance in respect of expenditure incurred on the Scientific Research Whether permissible Retrospective amendment of Section Whether violative of Articles and A of the Constitution Whether imposed unreasonable and oppressive burden on the assesse Nature and effect of amendment Position before and after the amendment Explained Statute Law Retrospective operation Amended provision given retrospective effect Whether open to challenge as imposing oppressive burden Whether new obligation created under new provision Section provided for the deduction of four types of expenditure on scientific research and the deduction provided under iv was to the effect that in respect of any expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business carried on by the assessee such deduction as may be admissible under the provisions of sub section It further provided in clauses iv and that where a deduction was allowed for any previous year under this section in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by an asset no deduction should be allowed under clauses i ii and iii of sub section of section for the same previous year in respect of that asset and where the asset mentioned in clause ii was used in the business after it ceased to be used for scientific research related to that business depreciation should be admissible under clauses i ii and iii of sub section of Section Explanation to Section also provided that where an asset was used in business after it ceased to be used for scientific research related to that business and a deduction had to be made under clause i clause ii or clause iii or sub section or sub section A of Section in respect of that asset the actual cost of the asset to the assessee as reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed under clause iv of sub section of Section The provisions of Section ii and Section iv and read with Explanation to Section virtually repeated the provisions contained in Section vi and xiv of the Act In there was an amendment in the provisions of Section In the Writ Petitions filed before this <ORG> on behalf of the asses sees it was contended that the allowances in respect of depreciation on the one hand and of capital expenditure on scientific research on the other are two totally different and independent heads of allowances one was a notional allowance to provide for the wear and tear of a capital asset employed in the business as the years rolled by and the other was an allowance for actual expenditure of a capital nature granted to give fillip to new industrial innovations and development of indigenous know how and techniques by proper planning on research and development by various business houses and therefore there was nothing wrong in construing the statute as providing cumulatively for both types of deductions in respect of the same capital asset that both the types of allowances were permissible under the statute except to the extent limited by clauses iv and of Section of the Act Clauses and of the proviso to Section xiv of the Act that this interpretation of the statutory provisions was very clear patent and unambiguous that the retrospective amendment of the provision would impose unexpected and impossible burden on them over the years jeopardise their solvency and lay them open to action by creditors and financial institutions and such an onerous burden was unreasonable and oppressive and the provision imposing such a burden violated the fundamental rights of the assessees under Articles and of the Constitution that retrospective provisions may be permissible even in taxing statutes in certain special circumstances such as in the case of provisions clarifying the impact of a statute provision curing defective legislations in the light of the judicial decisions and the like but if the legislature chose to impose a totally new burden which was not at all in contemplation earlier and proceeded to give full retrospective effect thereto such an attempt should be struck down as unreasonable and discriminatory It is impossible to conceive of the legislature having envisaged a double deduction in respect of the same expenditure even though it is true that the two heads of deduction do not completely overlap and there is some difference in the rationale of the two deductions under consideration assets for any year of assessment during any part of which they were used by the person carrying on the trade for scientific research related to the trade show that there is really no difference between the English and Indian Act the former also in terms prohibits depreciation only so long as the assets are used for scientific research In the circumstances it is clear that even before the amendment the Act did not permit a deduction for depreciation in respect of the cost of a capital asset acquired for purposes of scientific research to the extent such cost has been written off under Section xiv of the Act of the Act In respect of assets acquired in previous year relevant to assessment year and thereafter their cost was written off in the previous year of acquisition and no depreciation would be allowed in that year The assessees may have some possible case only if the earlier statutory provisions can be said to have been unambiguously in favour of the assessee and the amendment had radically altered the provisions to cast a new and substantial burden on the assessee with retrospective effect but there is no ambiguity Even if it is assumed that there was an ambiguity or doubt as to interpretation that was retrospectively clarified by the legislature If during the very five previous years depreciation under the aforementioned provisions is also allowed the assessee would obtain at the end of five years a double depreciation i under Section and almost under Section It would be a rather curious thing to say in the case of an asset acquired prior to April that <ORG> barred claim for depreciation under Section even in the first year when only of the cost of the asset is allowed as deduction under Section iv it barred it in the second third and fourth years when the deduction had reached and per cent but permitted it be claimed after the fifth year by which year the entire cost was allowed as a deduction None of the assessments relating to any of the assessment years in question has become final Since the amendment under challenge merely makes explicit which was implicit in the unamended clause there is no question of any right vesting in the assessee and its being taken away It is the second amendment to the provisions contained in section of the Act that has given rise to the present controversy between the parties The question is really one of interpretation of two important provisions relating to the computation of business income for purposes of income tax scientific research related to the business an expression which was defined in a fairly comprehensive manner by the statute in respect of any expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business an allowance for each of the Five consecutive previous year beginning with the year in which the expenditure was incurred or where the expenditure was incurred prior to the commencement of the business for each of the five consecutive previous years beginning with the year in which the business was commenced equal to one fifth of such expenditure Provided that no allowance shall be made for any expenditure incurred more than three years before the commencement of the business A Provided further that XXX XXX XXX where a deduction is allowed for any previous year under this clause in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by any asset no deduction shall be allowed under clause vi or clause vii for the same previous year in respect of that asset where an asset is used in the business after it ceases to be used for scientific research related to that business and a claim for an allowance under clause vi or clause vii is made in respect of that asset the actual cost to the assessee of the asset shall be treated as reduced by the amount of any deductions allowed under this clause A cursory and conjoint reading of section vi and section xiv suggests that where an assessee incurs expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business and the expenditure results in the acquisition of an asset the assessee can claim under clause vi a deduction of the specified percentage of the written down value of the asset and under clause xiv he can ask for a deduction in five consecutive years of the expenditure he has incurred on the acquisition of the asset For this purpose we are assuming that an asset used for scientific research related to the business is also ipso facto an asset used for the purpose of business We next turn to the provisions of Act Section provides for the deduction of four types of expenditure on scientific research and what we are concerned with is the deduction provided under section iv which is to the following effect iv in respect of any expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research related to the business carried on by the assessee such deduction as may be admissible under the provisions of sub section There is an explanation which is not relevant for our present purposes It read as follows at the relevant time Explanation Where an asset is used in business after it ceases to be used for scientific research related to that business and a deduction has to be made under clause i clause ii or clause iii of sub section I or sub section A of section in respect of that asset the actual cost of the asset to the assessee as reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed under clause iv of sub section of section or under any corresponding provision of the Indian Income tax Act From the above it will be seen that the provisions of Section ii and Section i iv and read with Explanation to virtually repeat the provisions contained in Section vi and xiv of the Act so that the question earlier posed still loomed in the background of Act In there was an amendment in the provisions of Section It is therefore suggested that there is nothing absurd in construing the statutes act as providing cumulatively for both types of deductions in respect of the same capital asset The second limitation is found in clause of the proviso to Section xiv and which say that if a capital asset used for scientific research ceases to be so used but is thereafter brought into a business for use therein the actual cost for purposes of granting depreciation in respect of the asset thereafter should be taken as the amount of its original cost reduced by the amount of deductions allowed under Section xiv or In other words the contention of the assessee was and is that both the types of allowances are permissible under the statute except to the extent limited by clauses and of the proviso to Section xiv of the Act and reproduced in clauses iv and of Section of the Act Before us it is claimed on behalf of the assessee that this interpretation of the statutory provisions is very clear patent and unambiguous It is therefore contended that there was and could have been no doubt that an assessee was entitled to claim depreciation allowance in respect of such assets in respect of previous years other than those in which an allowance had been allowed under the other head We shall revert later to this aspect of the matter Painting a very grim picture of the consequences of giving full retrospective effect to the amendment the assessees say that it will impose unexpected and impossible burden on them over the years is unreasonable and oppressive and the provision imposing such burden violates the fundamental rights of the assessees under Articles and of the Constitution of India Learned counsel for the assessees do not contest the competence of the legislature to enact the impugned provision nor do they dispute the right of the legislature to give retrospective effect to statutory provisions The principal questions therefore for our consideration are Were the earlier statutory provisions capable of only one interpretation namely that placed by the assessees or was there any ambiguity in relation thereto If there was some doubt or ambiguity about the earlier legislation and the Act clarified the position by a retrospective amendment would it offend the provisions of the Constitution If on the other hand the earlier provision was very clear and capable of only one interpretation as placed by the assessee was the legislature within its rights in amending the provision retrospectively and thus imposing an unreasonable tax burden on the assessees Taking up the first of the three questions it has to be considered from two angles one factual and the other legal The position in the case is available only as it stood at the time when the writ petition and the counter affidavit were filed and subsequent developments are not known In that case the Income tax Officer <ORG> is said to have allowed depreciation on assets used for scientific research for the assessment year though this is denied by the department The claim was perhaps disallowed by the <ORG> for the assessment year but it was allowed by the Allahabad Bench of <ORG> <ORG> by its order dated The <ORG> allowed the claims subject to the rider that there is no provision to give deduction of more than of the expenditure by way of depreciation In this background it is not correct to say that the position was crystal clear and that save for a few ITOs who took a biassed view the authorities were all agreed that the <ORG> stand was untenable We have dealt with this aspect only to meet an aspect that was urged In our view it is impossible to conceive of the legislature having envisaged a double deduction in respect of the same expenditure even though it is true that the two heads of deduction do not completely overlap and there is some difference in the rationale of the two deductions under consideration But changes were made and the provisions of the new Act in this regard were drafted in pari materia with those of the old Act iii The language used in clause of the proviso to xiv and iv again is significantly different from the language used in various other provisions of the Act which in like contexts of possible double allowances emphatically rule out deductions in respect of the same expense or exemptions in respect of the same income under two different provisions for the same or even any other assessment year See for example Sections CC CCA CCB GGA HH A HHA and HHB and iv When the relevant provisions say that depreciation shall not be allowed in certain previous years it permits a disallowance only in those previous years and means by necessary implication that it shall be allowed in other years if otherwise eligible on the language of the provision for depreciation We may however point out that the last few underlined words of the English statute show that there is really no difference between the English and Indian Act the former also in terms prohibits depreciation only so long as the assets are used for scientific research If as contended for by the assessees there can be no objection in principle to allowances being made under both the provisions as their nature and purpose are different then the interdict disallowing a double deduction will be meaningless even in respect of the previous years for which deduction is allowed under xiv If that were the correct principle The assessee should logically be entitled to deduction by way of depreciation for all previous years including those for which allowance have been granted under the provision relating to scientific research On the other hand if we accept the principle we have outlined earlier viz that there is a basic legislative scheme unspoken but clearly underlying the Act that two allowances cannot be and are not intended to be granted in respect of the same asset or expenditure one will easily see the necessity for the limitation imposed by the quoted words Then the question would arise and might create a difficulty in that event which not the two allowance should the assessee be granted that which the assessee chooses or that which the assessing officer might prefer It is necessary for the statute to define this and this is what has been done by the rider in clause of the proviso to xiv However if the asset continues to be used in scientific research related to the business he would be entitled to get depreciation on its full cost after the first few previous years during which allowance is granted under those provisions This seems to be anomalous but <NAME> says that there is no anomaly because this is a provision intended to act as a disincentive to persons who purport to purchase assets for scientific research but withdraw it from such use soon after In certain cases where a full deduction has been allowed in relation to a capital asset under other sections as for example section which permits a deduction in respect of capital expenditure for scientific research the taxpayers have contended that such deduction is independent of the allowance by way of depreciation If and to the extent that there is any anomaly or contrary view possible on a construction of section we recommend that the law should be clarified to provide that no depreciation under section shall be allowable in respect of capital expenditure for scientific research qualifying for deduction under section For the reasons discussed above we are of the view that even before the amendment the Act did not permit a deduction for depreciation in respect of the cost of a capital asset acquired for purposes of scientific research to the extent such cost has been written off under xiv In respect of assets acquired in previous year relevant to assessment year and thereafter their cost was written off in the previous year of acquisition and no depreciation could be allowed in that year In our view there was no difficulty at all in the interpretation of the provisions In view of the answer given by us to the first question posed by us there is no need to answer the second and third questions since even without the amendment the assessees cannot claim the depreciation allowance in question The second question can arise only if it is assumed that there was an ambiguity or doubt as to interpretation that was retrospectively clarified by the legislature We however make no order as to costs <NAME> I agree with my learned brother <NAME> that these writ petitions should fall The challenge in this batch of writ petitions is to the retrospective operation given to the amended clause iv of sub section of Section of Income Tax Act by the Finance No Learned Counsel for the petitioners assessees contended that the retrospective effect given to the said amendment has the effect of taking away the rights vested in the assessees by the unamended provisions making them liable to pay huge amounts by way of tax It is submitted that the retrospectivity given to the said amendment is violative of the petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles and besides the guarantee in Article A It provided for the first time that even expenditure of a capital nature laid out on scientific research related to the business of the assessee shall be allowed to be deducted The effect of sub clause was that if an assessee claimed and was allowed a deduction in respect of expenditure of a capital nature on scientific research and where such expenditure took the shape of an asset which in the normal course would be entitled to deduction on account of depreciation under clauses vi and vii of Section no depreciation would be allowed in respect of that asset in those respective previous years In the Income tax Act a similar provision was made in section Clause iv of sub section of section provided for deduction of expenditure of a capital nature incurred on scientific research related to the business carried on by the assessee Clause iv declares that where a deduction is allowed for any previous year under the said section in respect of expenditure represented wholly or partly by an asset no deduction shall be allowed under clauses i ii and iii of sub section I or under sub section A of section for the same previous year in respect of that asset There is no reason more so in a taxing enactment to extend the said bar beyond the limit prescribed by the statute If during the very five previous years depreciation under the aforementioned provisions is also allowed the assessee would obtain at the end of five years a double depreciation i under Section and almost under Section It would be a rather curious thing to say in the case of an asset acquired prior to April that <ORG> barred claim for depreciation under Section even in the first year when only of the cost of the asset is allowed as deduction under Section iv it barred it in the second third and fourth years when the deduction has reached and per cent but permitted it be claimed after the fifth year by which year the entire cost was allowed as a deduction Explanation appended to the definition says Where an asset is used in the business after it ceases to be used for scientific research related to that business and a deduction has to be made under clause ii of sub section of section in respect of that asset the actual cost of the asset to the assessee shall be the actual cost to the assessee as reduced by the amount of any deduction allowed under clause iv of sub section of section or under any corresponding provision of the Indian Income tax Act In certain cases where a full deduction has been allowed in relation to a capital asset under other sections as for example section which permits a deduction in respect of capital expenditure for scientific research the tax payers have contended that such deduction is independent of the allowance by way of depreciation If and to the extent that there is any anomaly or contrary view possible on a construction of section we recommend that the law should be clarified to provide that no depreciation under section shall be allowable in respect of capital expenditure for scientificresearch qualifying for deduction under section It is apparent that the scheme and structure of the English provision is different than ours as has been demonstrated by my learned brother <NAME> So far as the arguments of taking away of vested rights is concerned it is evident from the facts stated in the writ petition which was treated as representative of the facts and contentions in all the writ petitions and with reference to which facts were arguments addressed itself that none of the assessments relating to any of the assessment years concerned herein has become final
