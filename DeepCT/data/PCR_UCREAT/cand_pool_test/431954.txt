In pursuance of the directions of this court in No of dated December <ORG> Madras has referred the following question of law under section of the Income tax Act for the assessment year for our opinion Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case <ORG> was justified in holding and had valid materials to hold that the assessee is entitled to the deduction under section in respect of the commission paid to <ORG> and also on its share of contribution paid to <ORG> for participating in a trade exhibition The question referred to us consists of two parts one regarding the claim of the assessee for weighted deduction in respect of the commission paid to <ORG> and another in respect of its share of its contribution paid to <ORG> for participating in an international trade exhibition The assessee is a company and the assessee claimed weighted deduction under the provisions of section of the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act in its assessment proceedings for the assessment year and the claim of the assessee for weighted deduction in respect of the commission paid to <ORG> and another in respect of its share of its contribution paid to <ORG> for participating in an international trade exhibition The assessee is a company and the assessee claimed weighted deduction under the provisions of section of the Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act in its assessment proceedings for the assessment year and the claim of the assessee related to the following items of expenditure Commission paid to <ORG> on export sales The Income tax Officer rejected the claim of the assessee for weighted deduction in so far as it related to the commission paid to <ORG> on export sales and the share of its expenditure for participation in Second Asian Automotive and Accessories Exhibition at Singapore on the ground that the assessee has not established the link between the expenditure and the items enumerated under section of the Act The assessee preferred an appeal before <ORG> against the order of <ORG> denying its claim for weighted deduction on the share of export promotion division expenditure and the commission paid to <ORG> and on the share of the expenditure for participation in the second Asian Automotive and Accessories Exhibition The Commissioner of Income tax Appeals held that the commission paid to <ORG> was not covered by any of the provisions of section of the Act and further the commission was also paid in India and hence the assessee was not entitled to claim weighted deduction In so far as the share of expenditure for participation in the Second Asian Automotive and Accessories Exhibition is concerned he held that the assessee has not participated in the said exhibition and therefore the assessee was not entitled to claim weighted deduction In so far as the claim of the assessee relating to the commission paid to <ORG> is concerned <ORG> followed its earlier order passed for the assessment years and and held that the assessee is entitled to weighted deduction in respect of the commission paid to <ORG> As regards the claim of the assessee for weighted deduction in respect of the share of expenditure in participating the Second Asian Automotive and Accessories Exhibition is concerned the Tribunal has found that on the basis of the bills produced by the assessee the assessee had participated in the exhibition and therefore the assessee is entitled to weighted deduction under section of the Act in respect of the sum of Rs Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the <ORG> submitted that the assessee is not entitled to weighted deduction in respect of both the items as the expenditure incurred cannot be brought in within in any of the items enumerated under section of the Act and there is no nexus between the expenditure and the items mentioned under section of the Act and the assessee is not entitled to weighted deduction ITR cited supra would apply to the commission paid to <ORG> As regards the share of expenditure incurred by the assessee in the participation in the Second Asian Automotive and Accessories Exhibition is concerned learned counsel for the assessee submitted that the assessee had participated in the exhibition by exhibiting its goods in the foreign country and thereby it has incurred an expenditure towards either advertisement or publicity of the goods or for obtaining information regarding the market outside India and therefore the assessee is eligible to claim weighted deduction in respect of its share of expenditure incurred for participating in the exhibition We have carefully considered the submissions of learned counsel ITR cited supra rendered in the assessee own case has held that the assessee is eligible to claim weighted deduction in respect of the commission paid to <ORG> This court in the above judgment has upheld the view of <ORG> that the assessee was eligible for weighted deduction in respect of the said expenditure We are of the view that since the facts prevailing in the earlier decision rendered in the assessee own case are the same we hold that <ORG> was right in holding that the assessee is entitled to weighted deduction under section of the Act in respect of the commission paid to <ORG> In so far as the claim of the assessee for weighted deduction in respect of his share of contribution paid to <ORG> is concerned the Income tax Officer has not allowed the claim of the assessee on the ground that there was no nexus between the expenditure and the items enumerated under section of the Act The logical inference that flows from the above finding of <ORG> is that the assessee had displayed its articles in the Second Asian Automotive and Accessories Exhibition held at Singapore and since there was a display of the assessee articles in a foreign country it would amount to either advertisement of its goods or publicity of its goods outside India The purpose behind the act of the assessee in participating in the exhibition also shows that it was inviting trade enquiries about the assessee products in the foreign country which would enable the assessee to obtain information regarding the markets outside India and it is significant to note that the expenditure was incurred only in connection with the export of the assessee products Since by the display of the goods made in an international exhibition there was a publicity or advertisement of its products eliciting information regarding markets outside India we are of the view that the claim of the assessee would fall either under sub clause i or sub clause ii of clause of sub section of section of the Act We are therefore of the view that there is no infirmity in the order of <ORG> in holding that the assessee is entitled to weighted deduction in respect of the share of contribution by <ORG> when it participated in the international trade exhibition held in the foreign country We answer the question of law referred to us in the affirmative and against the <ORG>
