We have before us a group of nine writ petitions whereby the several petitioners who are carrying on business in agricultural commodities in what were recently constituted as Market Areas under the Rajasthan Agricultural Produce Markets Act No of hereinafter to be referred as the Act seek writs in the nature of prohibition against the <ORG> and other respondents restraining them from making any interference with their right to carry on their business unhampered as before Before we come to enumerate the several grounds of attack taken in the various writ petitions we think it convenient to refer to the salient features of the Act The Act which was passed by <ORG> received the assent of the President on and is designed to provide for the better regulation of buying and selling of agricultural produce and the establishment of markets for agricultural produce in the State of Rajasthan Chapter I is the preliminary Chapter and Section thereof contains the various definitions Notification of intention of exercising control over purchase and sale of agricultural produce in specified area The State Government may by notification in the official Gazette declare its intention of regulating the purchase and sale of such agricultural produce and in such area as may be specified in the notification Provided that no area within the limits of a municipality shall be included in the area specified in such notification except after consultation with <ORG> or <ORG> concerned as the case may be Section provides for declaration of a market area and this has to be done in accordance with the provisions of that section which runs as follows Section Declaration of market area After the expiry of the period specified in the notification issued under Section and after considering such objections and suggestions as may be received before such expiry and after holding such inquiry as may be necessary the State Government may by notification in the official Gazette

specified in the said notification On and after the date of the notification issued under Sub section or such later date as may be specified therein no local authority notwithstanding anything contained in any law and no other person shall within the market area or within a distance thereof to be notified in the official <ORG> in this behalf in each case by <ORG> set up establish or continue or allow to be set up established or continued any place for the purchase or sale of any agricultural produce so notified <ORG> may on the report of the Collector or of the Director or of <ORG> or an officer appointed in this behalf and after such inquiry as it deems fit to make suspend or cancel any licence granted under Sub section Section makes provision for dividing a market into yards and it runs as under Section Every market committee shall be constituted as prescribed and shall consist of the following members namely i Seven shall be persons elected by such recognised organisation of agriculturists in the market area for which it is established as <ORG> may prescribe and where no such organisations exist by the agriculturists paying not less than ten rupees per

municipal board or a panchayat one person shall be elected by the councillors of such municipal council or by the members of such municipal board or by the panchas including the sarpanch of such panchayat as the case may be if in a market area the principal market yard and the sub market yard or yards are situated within the limits of more than one municipal council or municipal board or of more than one panchayat one person shall be elected by the councillors of the municipal council or members of the municipal board or panchas including the sarpanch of the panchayat as the case may be within the local limits of which the major portion of the principal market yard is situated and one person shall be elected in the prescribed manner by the other municipal councils or boards or by the other panchayats as the case may be within the local limits of which the remaining portion of the principal market yard and sub market yard is situated Provided that a person to whom a licence has been granted under Sub section of Section or under Section shall not be eligible to become a member of the market committee under Clause iii or Clause iv nominated as follows a where in the circumstances mentioned in Clause iv the number of persons to be elected by local authorities is two two persons shall be nominated by the State Government where in the circumstances mentioned in Clause iv the number of persons to be so elected is three one person shall be nominated by the State Government Provided that <ORG> may at any time reduce the number of nominated members for any market committee and in their place increase the number of members to be elected under Clause i or Clause ii as it thinks fit Section makes provision for issuing of licences by a market committee and it originally stood as follows Section Then there are provisions about suspension or cancellation of licences granted under Section and with them we are not concerned at the moment Subject to the provisions of Section the market committee fund shall be expended for the following purposes namely the acquisition of a site or sites for the market the maintenance and improvement of the market the construction and repair of buildings necessary for the purposes of such market and for the health convenience and safety of the persons using it the provision and maintenance of standard weights and measures the pay pensions leave allowances gratuities compensation for injuries resulting from accident compassionate allowance and contributions towards leave allowances pensions or provident funds of the officers and servants employed by it the expenses of and incidental to elections the payment of interest on the loans that may be raised for the purposes of the market committee and the provision of sinking fund in respect of such loans the collection and dissemination of information regarding matters relating to crop statistics and marketing in respect of the agricultural produce notified under Section the payment of the cost referred to in Sub sections and of Section any propaganda in favour of agricultural improvement and the carrying out of the purposes and provisions of this Act and the rules and bye laws made thereunder Section provides for making of rules by the Government and the relevant portions thereof run as under Section The State Government may either generally or specially for any market area or market areas make rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing provision such rules may provide for or regulate the issue of licences to traders brokers weighmen measurers surveyors warehousemen and other persons operating in the market the form in which and the conditions subject to which such licences shall be issued or renewed and the fee to be charged therefor Section enacts how bye laws are to ha framed by the market committee and Section contains the power of the Director to make the bye laws Subject to any rules made by <ORG> under Section and with the previous sanction of the Director or any other officer specially empowered in this behalf by <ORG> <ORG> may in respect of the market area under its management make bye laws for the regulation of business and conditions of trading therein Any bye law made under this section may provide that any contravention thereof shall on conviction be punishable with fine which may extend to fifty rupees Power of Director to make bye laws These rules provide for various matters Any person desiring to hold such licence shall make a written application for a licence to the market committee and shall pay such a fee as may be specified in the bye laws subject to the maximum of Rs The names of all such traders and A class brokers shall be entered in a register to be maintained for the purpose Rule provides for licences to class brokers and is a replica of Rule already quoted and it only makes a change in the fee It has been given the powers to control and regulate the trading activities both in the interests of agriculturists and the traders operating in the market Then we have the Rules made by the <ORG> and the bye laws framed by the market committees to find out how the scheme of control and regulation of trade is to be carried out Now we may briefly enumerate the several grounds taken in the various writ petitions That the Act was violative of the fundamental rights of the petitioners as enshrined in Article of the Constitution to carry on their trade in the agricultural commodities in the market areas unhampered in any manner That the preliminary notifications that were issued by the Government under Section of the Act suffer from two fatal defects i That the proper opportunity to make objections against the notification was wholly denied to the petitioners for the simple reason that while the objections were required to be filed within one month from the date of the notification the notification itself was published after the expiry of the period fixed for filing objections ii That whereas under Section of the Act a period of not less than one month was to be specified in the notification for the filing of objections the notification fixed a period which was within one month from the date of the notification It is submitted that the creation of a proper market and a market area was a condition precedent for the issuance of licences Under Section the fee has to be prescribed by the <ORG> in the Rules and it is not to be left to the market committee to prescribe any fee in bye laws If at all this has got to be done by the <ORG> in the Rules under Section of the Act There was excessive delegation by the Government of its powers to impose licence fee to the marketing committee The Collector was implementing Section of the Act and he had asked the marketing committee to entertain applications for licences and this he was not entitled to do The cess imposed by the market committees on sale of cotton and oilseeds was in contravention of Section of the Central Sales Tax Act and Article of the Constitution as they were essential commodities declared by the <ORG> for purposes of the Central sales tax and as the <ORG> had already imposed a sales tax of per cent We immediately proceed to deal with the several grounds narrated above in a serial order As regards the test of reasonableness however their Lordships observed that no abstract standard or general pattern of reasonableness can be laid down as applicable to all cases Having regard to the entire scheme of the Act the provisions of the Act including Section constitute reasonable restrictions on a citizen right to do business and therefore they are valid Thus we do not find any force in the first ground In exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the Rajasthan Agricultural Produce Markets Act <ORG> hereby declares its intention to regulate the purchase and sale of the following Agricultural produce in the area falling within the limits of Panchayats of Panchayat Samiti Karanpur District Ganganagar as shown in Appendix A including the Municipal limits of <ORG> Any objection or suggestion which may be received by <ORG> within one month from the date of notification shall be considered by <ORG> As already observed by us the attack on the validity of this notification is twofold that the notification was just a bare farce and it did not afford any real opportunity to the petitioners to file their objection as they were required to be filed within one month from the date of the notification which date had already passed when the notification saw the light of the day on and That whereas Section required that the period during which objections are to be filed is to be not less than one month to be specified in the notification it is submitted that the words within one month from the date of the notification as contained in the notification do not conform to the language of the section namely not less than one month He also invited our attention to the Hindi notification which was simultaneously published with the English version of the notification and in the notification as published in Hindi the words are that the objections are to be filed within one month of the date of the publication Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part until <ORG> by law otherwise provides a all proceedings in <ORG> and is <ORG> the authoritative texts i of all Bills to be introduced or amendments thereto to be moved in either <ORG> or in the <ORG> or either <ORG> of the Legislature of a State ii of all Acts passed by <ORG> or the Legislature of a State and of all Ordinances promulgated by the President or the Governor of a State and iii of all orders rules regulations and bye laws issued under this Constitution or under any law made by <ORG> or <ORG> shall be in the English language Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause a of Clause the Governor of a State may with the previous consent of the President authorise the use of the Hindi language or any other language used for any official purposes the State in proceedings in <ORG> having its principal seat in that State Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to any judgment decree or order passed or made by such High Court Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause of Clause where the Legislature of a State has prescribed any language other than the English language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by the Legislature of the State or in Ordinances promulgated by the Governor of the State or in any order rule regulation or bye law referred to in para iii of that sub clause a translation of the same in the English language published under the authority of the Governor of the State in the Official Gazette of that State shall be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof in the English language under this article Clause of this Article permits <ORG> to introduce in other language an Act but in that event a translation of the same in the English language published under the authority of the Governor in the State Gazette shall be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof in the English language under this article The Rajasthan Official Language Act Act No of provides as to what is to be the language to be used for various official purposes of the <ORG> of Rajasthan Section declares that Hindi shall be the official language for certain purposes of the <ORG> and Section enacts that Subject to the provisions of Article of the Constitution of India and notwithstanding anything contained in Section the language of i all Bills introduced in <ORG> ii all Acts passed by <ORG> iii all Ordinances promulgated under Article of the Constitution of India and iv all orders rules regulations and bye laws issued by the State Government under the Constitution of India or under any Central or State law shall be either Hindi written in Devnagri script or English Provided that in every such case where the English language is used there shall be published under the authority of <ORG> as soon as may be a translation thereof in the Hindi language written in Devnagri script Consequently we have no doubt that English version of the notification alone has to be treated as the authorised version of the notification On first blush we were inclined to accept the contention made by the learned counsel of the petitioner that as the notification is dated and was published more than a month thereafter proper opportunity of making objections cannot be held to have been given to the concerning people Section which contains the general definitions provides that unless there be anything repugnant in the subject or context or unless the contrary intention appears the following expressions shall have the meanings respectively assigned to them hereby namely notification or public notification shall mean a notification published under proper authority in the <ORG> On the language of this clause it is argued that there is a marked distinction between a <ORG> order simpliciter and a <ORG> order which matures into a notification on publication It is strenuously contended that a <ORG> order matures into a notification within the meaning of the Act only on its first publication and prior to that in law it is not a notification but only a <ORG> order Thus it is pointed out that an order of the <ORG> to become a notification requires i that it is published in the gazette and ii that it is so published under proper authority Accordingly it is argued that the so called notification dated extracted above became a notification only on and not on an earlier date and since the petitioners were free to file objections within a period of one month commencing from it cannot be said that there has been any non compliance of the law It is also urged on behalf of the petitioners that in construing a notification which results in putting fetters on the fundamental rights of a citizen we should prefer an interpretation which will advance the right of making objections rather than one which would result in contraction of that right Now if we prefer the interpretation suggested by the petitioners then the period would stand reduced by days that is the lag between the date on which the Government passed the order and the date when that order was published in the gazette What we have said above applies to other cases in which there is only the difference about the date of the so called notification and the date of its publication Time within which an election petition shall be presented An election petition calling in question an election may a in the case where such petition is against a returned candidate be presented under Section at any time after the date of publication of the name of such candidate under Section but not later than fourteen days from the date of publication of the notice in the Official Gazette under Rule that the return of election expenses of such candidate and the declaration made in respect thereof have been lodged with the Returning Officer The argument that fell for consideration was as to what was the period which can be said to be not later that days from the date of the publication of the notice Their Lordships examined the difference between the words not later than days and the words within a period of days and their Lordships were pleased to hold that they mean the same thing We entertain no doubt that the <ORG> has used both the expressions as meaning the same thing and there are accordingly no grounds for holding that Section is not applicable to petitions falling within Rule The question that fell for consideration was whether in computing the time of one month was or was not to be excluded The cases of this <ORG> dealing with the provisions of Panchayat Act and Rules cited by learned counsel for the petitioners are to our mind distinguishable and we may make a brief reference to them The provisions of Rule of the Panchayat Rules which fell for consideration were to the following effect The Returning Officer shall at least seven days before the date of election announce for the information of the Panchayat Circle by notice and in such other manner as the Chief Panchayat Officer may direct the number and names of wards if any the number of panchas to be elected from each ward and from the entire Panchayat Circle and the date time and place of election The words used at least seven days before the date of election were held to mean that seven clear days should intervene between the date of the notification and the date of the election As we have already observed Section of the Act requires that the marketing committee can frame bye laws with the previous sanction of the Director or any other officer specially empowered in this behalf by the State Government Where the imposition of the tax is with the sanction of Government all that is required is that after the necessary procedure has been followed by the body imposing the tax it sends the final proposal to Government for sanction It was also observed in that case that the obtaining of the previous sanction of the <ORG> is a condition precedent to the passing of bye laws in question and the law is well established that such a condition must strictly be fulfilled before the bye laws can be held to have been duly passed What was done in the present case by the Director of Agriculture does not fulfil the requirements of law There is an obvious purpose in insisting upon the requirements of a previous sanction After they have applied their mind and framed the draft bye laws they are to receive a proper attention at the hands of the competent authority before it gives the sanction to the introduction of the bye laws There are analogous notifications in other cases Suffice it to say that a maximum fee is prescribed by the Rules framed under Section of the Act vide Rule and kindred rules referred to above Since the rule making authority namely the <ORG> has fixed the maximum fee that could be charged by the marketing committees there is no excessive delegation if thereby each market committee is left with the discretion to fix the fees at a lower figure in each individual case As we have already held that the bye laws are not valid it will not be competent for the committee to issue any licences Section permits <ORG> to grant licences subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed to use any place in the market area for the purchase and sale of any agricultural produce Section of the Act permits <ORG> to delegate to any officer any of the powers conferred on it by or under this Act except the powers exercisable by it under Clause iv of Sub section or under Sub section of Section or under Section or under Section of the Act The orders of delegation of powers under Section proviso has not been placed before us No We are not persuaded to accept the contention raised by the petitioners as valid for more than one reason Lastly Sub section of Section which enables the <ORG> to constitute a market committee for the first time does not lay down any particular limitation for the nomination of a particular person Notwithstanding anything contained in Sub section a on the failure of any organisation persons or authority to elect a member under Sub section within a period of three months from the date of the occurrence of the vacancy <ORG> shall give notice in writing to the organisation persons or authority concerned to elect a member within a month from the date of such notice and on the failure of the organisation persons or authority again to elect a member within the said period <ORG> shall nominate a person on behalf of such organisation persons or authority as a member of the market committee and when a market committee is constituted for the first time all the members of the market committee shall be persons nominated by <ORG> In the light of our discussion we declare That the bye laws framed by the various market committees in the cases before us are invalid That the respondents are hereby restrained from giving effect to the bye laws as framed That they are further restrained from realising any cess or fee from the petitioners under the bye laws and We hereby direct <ORG> to provide a proper machinery for the issuance of licences in accordance with Section of the Act till the market committees are in a position to issue licences in accordance with the rules and bye laws
