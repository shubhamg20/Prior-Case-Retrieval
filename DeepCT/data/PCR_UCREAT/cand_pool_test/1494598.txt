The arbitrators gave an award allowing Rs It is urged on behalf of the Municipality that the application made by Tuljaram for compelling the Municipality to pay compensation for the whole of the land is not warranted by any of the provisions of Section of the Bombay City Municipalities Act and therefore <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain the application and the order passed by <ORG> is a nullity and should be set aside Under Sub section either party if dissatisfied with the decision of the panchayat may apply to <ORG> which shall determine the matter in accordance with Sub section i according to the procedure prescribed by the Land Acquisition Act In the present case the panchayat gave the decision in favour of Tuljaram and it cannot be said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the panch Under Sub section the <ORG> has power after the award has been made by the panchayat or <ORG> to take possession of the land after paying the amount of compensation to the party to whom such compensation may be payable and if the party refuses to accept such compensation or it there is no person competent to alienate the land or if there is any dispute as to the title to the compensation or as to the apportionment the <ORG> may deposit the amount of the compensation in <ORG> It is clear from the provisions of Section that the application made by Tuljaram to <ORG> to compel the <ORG> to pay compensation for the whole land is not maintainable under any of the provisions of the section It is therefore clear that <ORG> had no jurisdiction in this case to entertain the application made by <NAME> It had also no jurisdiction to determine the right of opponent No <NAME> who was a mortgagee from the predecessor in title of <NAME> <ORG> therefore clearly had no jurisdiction to decide the question submitted for its consideration and the decision is null and aoid Act III of which corresponds to Section of the Bombay City Municipalities Act that though a right of appeal is given by Section of the Land Acquisition Act no appeal is provided by Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act corresponding to Section of the Bombay City Municipalities Act and that the order of <ORG> is not a decree because it is made not under the ordinary civil jurisdiction but under the special jurisdiction created by the special Act In that case it was held that as no appeal lay from the decision of the In <NAME> <NAME> it was held that a District Judge acting under Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act was not a Court within the meaning of the word in Section of the Civil Procedure Code corresponding to a of the present Code and <ORG> had no jurisdiction to revise his order and it was held that a District Judge as distinguished from <ORG> is a persona designata it was held by <ORG> that an order made by <ORG> under Section of the Religious Endowments Act was an order revisable by the High <ORG> under Section of the Civil Procedure Code Reference was made to the decision in the case of <NAME> <NAME> and the decision that the District Judge was a persona designata under Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act was held to be correct on the ground that the District Judge was a persona designata for a specific purpose and not an officer exercising judicial functions under the Act but it was held that under the Religious Endowments Act <ORG> was not a persona designata but a civil <ORG> exercising jurisdiction under the Act The decision in the case of <NAME> was referred to in the Madras case which went up to <ORG> and the remark of their Lordships appears to have been made in reference to the designation of the person who had to decide an election under Section of the Municipal Act as a District Judge as distinguished from <ORG> Their Lordships of <ORG> confirmed the view of <ORG> that <ORG> under Section of the Religious Endowments Act XX of empowering a civil <ORG> to fill up the vacancy in <ORG> was acting in a judicial capacity as a <ORG> and not merely in an administrative capacity and that though no appeal lay under the Civil Procedure Code from such an order the matter in which the order of <ORG> was made was a case within the meaning of Section of the Civil Procedure Code In <ORG> Postmaster General A it was held that <ORG> which as regards England consisted of one ex officio and two appointed <ORG>ers was established as <ORG> and an appeal lay from the <ORG> to <ORG> except upon questions of fact and locus standi it was held that no appeal lay to <ORG> from the order passed by the District Judge as persona designata under a scheme for management of a charitable institution but at page it was observed as follows We are not concerned with hypothetical oases which have been suggested be us such as the District Judge declining to exercise the functions imposed upon him by the scheme or in the exercise of those functions entirely failing to exercise any discretion in the matter When such oases arise we have no doubt that <ORG> will be competent to deal with them It was agreed between the parties that square feet should be acquired and as the Municipality considered that the compensation demanded by Tuljaram was exorbitant the matter was referred to arbitration as provided by Section of Act XVIII of The area to be acquired was not settled by the panchas because at the time there was no dispute on that point But afterwards the Municipality changed its mind and proposed to acquire square feet only at the same rate per square foot A preliminary question arises as to whether the application is competent that is to say whether <ORG> has any power to revise the order of <ORG> purporting to have been made under Section of Act XVIII of Section of the Civil Procedure Coda gives power to <ORG> to revise the proceedings of any <ORG> subordinate to <ORG> in a case in which no appeal lies This has been interpreted to mean that the provisions of the Code apply to proceedings under special Acts unless there is some provision in the special Act which shows a contrary intention was a case under the Madras Rent Recovery Act which contained an express provision that orders passed under it should not be liable to revision except by <ORG> There is no provision in Act XVIII of such as there was in the Act dealt with in <NAME> <NAME> which excludes the revisional jurisdiction of <ORG> It would appear therefore that Section must apply and give this <ORG> power to revise the order of the District Judge if it can be regarded as an order of a <ORG> subordinate to <ORG> Then there is Section of the Government of India Act which gives <ORG> powers of superintendence over all <ORG> subject to its appellate jurisdiction The power of superintendence here referred to includes the power of revision <NAME> <NAME> I Cal therefore has power to revise the order in question under Section of the Government of India Act if it is an order of a <ORG> normally subject to the appellate jurisdiction of <ORG> That in the present case we are concerned with an order of a <ORG> is clear from the language of Section and <NAME> King Emperor where it was held respectively that the High <ORG> has no power to revise the orders of a District Registrar a Rent Collector under the Rangoon Rent Act a District Judge acting departmentally as the head of an office and a Commissioner appointed under the Defence of India Act has little or no application in the present case The difficulty arises owing to the decision in <ORG> <NAME> where it was held that no application for revision lies against the decision of <ORG> under Clause of Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act III of which corresponds to Clause of Section of the present Act The first point to be noted in connection with this case is that the application had been properly made to <ORG> under Clause of Section which gives <ORG> power to enforce an award on the application of a party who relies upon itand where moreover the <ORG> has determined a dispute viz In <NAME> <NAME> this <ORG> has held that it has no jurisdiction to revise the order of a District Judge acting under Section of the Bombay District Municipalities Act of In <NAME> case it was decided that no appeal lies from the decision of <ORG> under Clause of Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act The fact that there is no appeal does not ordinarily imply that there is no remedy by revision either In fact revision only lies under Section of the Code in cases where there is no appeal So that evidently what <NAME> meant when he said that any other decision would be seriously anomalous was this viz that the particular grounds on which it had been decided that there was no appeal would apply equally in the case of a revision application A subsidiary ground was that in <NAME> <NAME> it was decided that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to revise the order of a District Judge under Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act of on the ground that the District Judge was not a <ORG> but a persona designata <NAME> apparently considered that it made no material difference whether the powers under a special Act were assigned to the District Judge or to the District <ORG> <ORG> made an order determining the amount and the applicant appealed <NAME> view was that <ORG> only came in as a substitute for the panchayat where adjudication by the latter had failed and therefore <ORG> order could not be questioned any more than the award of the panchayat could be questioned by way of an appeal The learned Judge also referred to the provisos to Section Clause which are the same as the provisos to Section Clause of the present Act namely a no application to the Collector for a reference shall be necessary and the Court shall have full power to give and apportion the costs of all proceedings in any manner it thinks fit This so far as I can see is the only reason in the judgment which can in any way be said to negative the power of <ORG> to revise <ORG> order The additional reason given for holding that there was no appeal namely that the order could not be regarded as a decree would not affect the question of revision at all Now if the decision in this case is to be considered not with reference to the question which was decided in the case itself namely the question whether there was an appeal but with reference to the question whether a revision application lies there are two important points of difference which I think must affect the decision As regards <NAME> <NAME> that was a case under the Bombay District Municipal Act Section of which Act empowered the District Judge to pass an order for confirming or amending the declared result of an election or for setting the election aside It was this order for payment of costs which <ORG> was asked to revise and it was held that the District Judge acting under Section was not a Court and that <ORG> could not interfere In the first place the powers under Section of the Act of were given to the District Judge and not to <ORG>
