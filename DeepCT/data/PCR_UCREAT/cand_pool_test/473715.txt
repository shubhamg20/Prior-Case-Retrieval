This appeal is filed by <ORG> against the order of <ORG> Madras awarding a sum of Rs and <ORG> came to the conclusion that the driver of the lorry was rash and negligent in driving the lorry which resulted in the death of the deceased It was contended that <ORG> has got only a limited right to defend under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act and that it has no right to question the quantum of compensation awarded or as to the fact whether there was any rashness or negligence on the part of the driver Sub section of is as follows No sum shall be payable by an insurer under sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the Court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds enumerated in clauses a to The sub section therefore enables <ORG> to have notice either before judgment or after judgment to raise the defences that are made available in clauses a to The right to defend is conferred under Section of the Act and the right therefore is created by statute and its content necessarily depends on the provisions of the statute <ORG> observed that an insurer made a defendant to the action is not entitled to take any defence which is not specified in it and when the grounds of defence have been specified they cannot be added to The learned counsel for the respondents submits that the Insurance company is not entitled to question the quantum of compensation allowed or as to the fact whether there was negligence on the part of the driver But <ORG> in paragraph at page in the above said decision has laid down that the Insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all the defences open to the assured can then be urged by him This an important right conferred on <ORG> provided in the insurance contract the company has reserved by its policy the right to defend the action in the name of the assured although such right is not conferred under Section of the Act In the policy issued by the appellant there is a condition namely condition No which provides that no admission offer promise or payment shall be made by the insured without the written consent of the company which shall be entitled if it so desires to take over or conduct in the name of the insured the defence or settlement of any claim or to prosecute in his name for its own benefit any claim for indemnity or damages or otherwise and shall have full discretion in the conduct of any proceedings or in the settlement of any claim and the insured shall give all such information and assistance as the company may require In this case as the Insurance policy contains a clause reserving a right on the Insurance company to conduct the defence on behalf of the insured <ORG> is entitled to the rights that are open to the insured We would refer to the few decisions cited in the case The Court observed thus The decisions do not relate to proceedings before <ORG> where the Insurers are made parties and the scope of the defences which they were to put forward has not in any way been restricted Rejecting the contention that if would have no application to proceedings before the <ORG> it would have been deleted after Section was introduced in the Act the Court observed that the obvious answer is that it was only after the Claims <ORG> is constituted by the State Government by a notification in the Official Gazette <ORG> jurisdiction would be barred In conclusion it was observed that the Insurance Companies who are mainly responsible to satisfy the claims of third parties and who are parties to the proceedings before the Claims <ORG> and who are entitled to cross examine cannot be restricted to the defences specified in Section of the Act It was held that Insurance Companies who are mainly responsible to satisfy the claims of third parties and who are entitled to cross examine cannot be restricted to the defences specified in Section of the Act With respect we find it difficult to accept the distinction made by the Bench between the case and the case before the Bench It also held that it is not open to the appellant insurers in that appeal to take up any grounds other than those specified in Section With respect we agree with the view of <ORG> as well as the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> Mad LJ hold that the defences that are open to <ORG> are only those that are specified in of the Motor Vehicles Act But so far as this case is concerned as we have already pointed out a reservation had been made in the policy that <ORG> will be entitled to take over and conduct the defences on behalf of the insured we find in this case that <ORG> is entitled to raise all the grounds that are open to insured The Court held referring to the decision of <ORG> in that in order to avail himself of the clauses contained in the policy the insurer can urge all the defences open to the insured only when the insurer defends the action in the name of the insured Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the respondents referred to the recent amended Section A and submitted that <ORG> may direct impleading of the insurer as party to the proceedings when it finds that there is collusion between the person making the claim and the person against whom the claim is made has failed to contest It was submitted that only when the <ORG> gives such a finding the insurer can be added as a party and otherwise the Insurer is not a proper party It is unnecessary for us to examine this question In this view we reject the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents that <ORG> is not entitled to question the quantum or the fact of negligence We confirm the finding of the tribunal that the accident resulting in the death of the deceased was due to the negligence of the driver the lorry and as such the claimants are entitled to compensation The deceased was earning about Rs Being a workman he would have spent some amount on himself and the benefit to the family would not have exceeded Rs In the result we allow the appeal to the extent of reducing the compensation from Rs
