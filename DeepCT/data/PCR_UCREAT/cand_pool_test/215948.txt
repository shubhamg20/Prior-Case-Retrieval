As regards the meaning of the word judgment as used in the clause Courts in this country have taken different views <NAME> said We think judgment in means a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties by determining some right or liability It may be final or preliminary or interlocutory the difference between them being that a final judgment determines the whole cause or suit and a preliminary or interlocutory judgment determines only a part of it leaving other matters to be determined And it may fairly be said to determine some right between them viz to sue in a particular <ORG> and to compel the defendants who are not within its jurisdiction to come in and defend the suit or if they do not to make them liable to have a decree passed against them in their absence This reason it must be admitted would hardly bring the case within the definition given in Justices of the Peace of Calcutta <ORG> WR because it is perfectly clear that the right or liability contemplated by the definition in that case must mean some right or liability which was the subject matter of the controversy in the suit or proceeding This decision was affirmed by <ORG> on the ground that it came within the meaning of the word judgment in that clause because the transmission of the record was not a merely ministerial proceeding and the Judge who had made the order had in fact exercised a judicial discretion and had come to a decision of great importance which if it remained would entirely conclude any rights of the decree holder for an execution in the suit <NAME> <NAME> Cal <NAME> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> Cal laid down a definition in these words I think the word judgment means a judgment or decree which decides the case one way or the other in its entirety and that it does not mean a decision or order of an interlocutory character which merely decides some isolated point not affecting the merits or the result of the entire suit As an order refusing an application for the appointment of a receiver based on a provision in the indenture of hypothecation that on a breach of any one of the covenants contained therein the plaintiffs assignor would be entitled to have a receiver appointed the order has determined a right which is one of the matters in the controversy itself and so it satisfies the definition of <NAME> <NAME> as well But there is another and a far simpler ground on which it must be held that an appeal is competent We have been referred by learned Counsel for the respondent to a judgment of the said <ORG> in another suit to which the present appellant was no party as containing reasons which would justify the present order The appellant will have her costs of this appeal and of the costs of the application in the <ORG> below The receiver will take possession before the order is drawn up and on counsel endorsement only
