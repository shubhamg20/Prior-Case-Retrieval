I III and Rules and Notification dated amending the Rules retrospectively Yarn sized for purpose of weaving the same into fabrics Levy of duty on the weight of sized yarn Validity of HEADNOTE The petitioners challenged before <ORG> the levy of excise duty on the weight of the yarn sized for the purpose of weaving them into fabrics The constitutional validity of these amendments are challenged by the petitioners in the present Writ Petitions filed before this Court The sized yam which is actually put into the integrated process will not again be subjected to payment of excise duty for the unsized yam which is sized for the purpose does not change the nature of commodity as yarn Thus excise duty cannot be levied on the weight of the yarn after the yarn is sized for the purpose of weaving the same into fabrics Before we deal with the objections of the learned counsel for the respondents it would be useful to examine the points which were involved in the aforesaid case of <ORG> The appellants in the said case had a composite mill wherein it manufactured fabrics of different types In order to manufacture the said fabrics yarn was obtained at an intermediate stage The yarn so obtained was further processed in an integrated process in the said composite mill for weaving the same into fabrics They also did not dispute their liability in respect of yarn which was also removed from the factory It was the contention of the appellants therein that no duty of excise could be levied and collected in respect of yam which was obtained at an intermediate stage and thereafter subjected to an integrated process for the manufacture of different fabrics On a writ petition by those appellants <ORG> by its judgment dated th October held that yarn obtained and further processed within the factory for the manufacture of fabrics could not be subjected to duty of excise It was the case of the appellants that in spite of the said decision of <ORG> <ORG> had wrongly issued a circular dated th September purporting to interpret Rules and of the Central Excise Rules hereinafter referred to as the Rules and directing the subordinate excise authorities to levy and collect duty of excise in accordance therewith In the said circular the Board had directed the subordinate excise authorities that use of goods in manufacture of another commodity even within the place premises that have been specified in this behalf by the Central Excise Officers in terms of the powers conferred under Rule of the Rules will attract duty As the said circular was being implemented to the prejudice of the appellants they filed the writ petition before <ORG> inter alia challenging the validity of the said circular Section of the Finance Act provides that the amendments in Rules and of the Rules shall be deemed to have and to have always had the effect on and from the date on which the Rules came into force i th February It was further held that the retrospective effect given by Section of the Finance Act will be subject to the provisions of Sections A and of the Act It was further held that the yam which is produced at an intermediate stage in the mill of the appellants therein and subjected to the integrated process of weaving the same into fabrics will be liable to payment of excise duty in view of the amended provisions of Rules and of the Rules But the sized yam which is actually put into the integrated process will not again be subjected to payment of excise duty for the unsized yarn which is sized for the purpose does not change the nature of the commodity as yarn The Writ Petition was accordingly allowed in part as stated aforesaid and it was this decision which came up in appeal before this Court This Court also agreed with <ORG> that the retrospective effect given by section of the Finance Act will be subject to the Provisions of Sections A and of the Act This Court also agreed with the view of <ORG> that the yarn which is produced at an intermediate stage in the mill of the appellants and subjected to integrated process of weaving the same into fabrics would be liable to payment of excise duty in view of the amended provisions of the Rules But this Court further agreed with <ORG> the sized yarn which is actually put into the integrated process will not again be subjected to payment of excise duty for the unsized yarn which is sized for the purpose does not change the nature of the commodity as yarn This Court observed at pages and of the report as under In the instant case the appellants are liable to pay excise duty on the yarn which is obtained at an intermediate stage and thereafter further processed in an integrated process for weav ing the same into fabrics After the yarn is produced it is sized and thereafter subjected to a process of weaving the same into fabrics Be that as it may as we have held that the commodity which is obtained at an intermediate stage of an integrated process of manufacture of another commodity is liable to the payment of excise duty the yarn that is produced by the appellants is also liable to payment of excise duty In our view <ORG> by the impugned judgment has rightly held that the appellants are not liable to pay any excise duty on the yarn after it is sized for the purpose of weaving the same into fabrics No distinction can be made between unsized yarn and sized yarn for the unsized yarn when converted into sized yarn does not lose its character as yarn This Court upheld the validity of the Section as well as the retrospective applicability of the Rules but took the view that this would be subjected to the provisions of Sections A and of the Act and at the same time declared that the appellants were not liable to pay excise duty on the yarn after it is sized for a purpose of weaving the same into fabrics Cellulosic spun yarn <ORG> in which man made fibre of cellulosic origin predomi nates in weight and in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power i not containing any manmade fibres of non cellulosic origin Non cellulosic Spun Yam Spun discontinuous yarn in which man made fibres of noncellulosic origin other than acrylic fibre predominate in weight and in or in relation to the manufacture of which any process is ordinarily carried on with the aid of power He however could not dispute that the matter is directly covered by the decision of this Court in the aforesaid case of <ORG>
