All these appeals have been preferred against the impugned judgment and order dated st May of <ORG> Andhra Pradesh at Hyderabad in Writ Petition No of by which <ORG> has struck down the provisions of Andhra Pradesh Mutually Aided Co operative Societies Amendment Act hereinafter called as Act as unconstitutional and further declared that even if the Act is to be considered constitutional provisions providing that the Boards of Directors appointed under the Andhra Pradesh Mutually Aided Co operative Societies Act hereinafter called Act shall be deemed to have been continued under the provisions of A Co operative Societies Act hereinafter called Act and further Ms No Animal Husbandry Dairy Development Fisheries Dairy II Department dated and the consequential proceedings orders of the Milk Commissioner and Registrar of Milk Co operatives and the District Collectors concerned in these regards are quashed In the meanwhile the Act came into force <ORG> vide its judgment and order dated dismissed the original petition against <ORG> on the premises that the Act had not mentioned about returns of assets and the Managing Director had no power to further delegate the power to some one to file the petition <ORG> vide interim order dated stayed the operation of the Government Order dated <NAME> <ORG> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellants have submitted that the impugned judgment and order are untenable as the <ORG> is competent to amend the Act and while doing so the <ORG> in its wisdom had rightly decided to treat the milk dairy co operatives distinctly from all other kinds of societies More so there is no discrimination among the milk dairies as all such dairies have been treated as a separate class Appointment of persons in charge was merely a temporary transitional phase to facilitate such elections and therefore there was no violation of fundamental rights of any of the writ petitioners The Government undoubtedly had transferred the management of the assets to the District <ORG> and as the said District <ORG> would continue with such management of assets there was no question of breach of any of the promises made by the <ORG> There was a rational nexus to enact the Act as a large number of the milk dairy societies did not enter into the MoU as required under Section of the Act There were valid reasons for excluding the milk dairy societies from the provisions of the Act Having regard to the special and distinctive features of the Dairy industry and the existence of large number of financially weak and dependent primary milk <ORG> and the necessity of <ORG> funding of these societies it has been found necessary to take dairy industry out of the purview of Act On the contrary Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel Mr <NAME> <NAME> Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the respondents have submitted that the Act suffered from vice of arbitrariness and has taken away the accrued rights of the milk dairy co operative societies We have considered the rival submissions made by learned counsel for the parties and perused the record Before we examine the merits of the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties it may be necessary to make a reference to some of the relevant findings recorded by <ORG> i The ordinance Act suffers from vice of hostile discrimination against dairy farms and milk producers without scientific or rational basis for such distinction merely because <ORG> distinctly deals with dairy activities cooperatives dealing with such activities cannot form a separate and distinct class in so far as co operative activity is concerned ix Fundamental right under Section of the Constitution of India to form association or union is infringed by the impugned Ordinance Act xi The agreement dated between <ORG> and <ORG> the letter of understanding dated between <ORG> and <ORG> and acted upon by <ORG> and the concerned agencies estopped <ORG> from backing out on the assurance Thus the question does arise as to whether in view of the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties it is desirable to interfere with the aforesaid findings or any of them Therefore it is permissible in law to have class legislation provided the classification is founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes persons or things that are grouped together from others left out of the group and that differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the statute in question It should be presumed that legislature has correctly appreciated the need of its people and that its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds There is further presumption in favour of the legislature that legislation had been brought with the knowledge of existing conditions The good faith on the legislature is to be presumed but if there is nothing on the face of the law or the surrounding circumstances brought to the notice of the court on which the classification may reasonably be regarded as based the presumption of constitutionality cannot be carried to the extent of always holding that there must be some undisclosed and unknown reasons for subjecting certain individuals or corporations to hostile or discriminating legislation Article guarantees to all citizens the right to form associations or unions of their choice voluntarily subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law This court while examining its validity held that any law altering the composition of the <ORG> compulsorily will be a breach of the right to form association because it violated the composite right of forming an association and the right to continue it as the original members desired has been exercised by the members forming it they have no right to claim that its activities must also be permitted to be carried on in the manner they desire The right to form an association in our opinion necessarily implies that the persons forming the <ORG> have also the right to continue to be associated with only those whom they voluntarily admit in the <ORG> Any law by which members are introduced in the voluntary <ORG> without any opinion being given to the members to keep them out or any law which takes away the membership of those who have voluntarily joined it will be a law violating the right to form an association this Court held that the first test is the test of reasonableness which is common to all the clauses under Article and the second test is to ask for the answer to the question whether the restrictions sought to be imposed on the fundamental right fall within clauses to respectively qua sub clauses a to of Article of the Constitution and the Court further held that a right guaranteed by Article on the literal reading thereof can be subjected to those restrictions which satisfy the test of clause of Article Therefore the freedom guaranteed under Article is not restricted merely to the formation of the association but to the effective functioning of the association so as to enable it to achieve the lawful objectives AIR SC <ORG> of this Court held that a fundamental right to form the association cannot be coupled with the fundamental right to carry on any trade or business As soon as citizens form a company the right guaranteed to them by Article has been exercised and no restrain has been placed on that right and no infringement of that right is made Thus right under Article does not comprehend any concomitant right beyond the right to form an association and right relating to formation of an association In view of the above it becomes evident that the right of the citizens to form the association are different from running the business by that association It is a settled legal proposition that Article of the Constitution strikes at arbitrariness because an action that is arbitrary must necessarily involve negation of equality This doctrine of arbitrariness is not restricted only to executive actions but also applies to legislature The Court observed as under Honesty of purpose of those who prepared and published the list was not and is not challenged but the validity of a law which apparently infringes the fundamental rights of citizens cannot be upheld merely because the law maker was satisfied that what he did was right or that he believes that he acted in manner consistent with the constitutional guarantees of the citizen The test of the validity of a law alleged to infringe the fundamental rights of a citizen or any act done in execution of that law lies not in the belief of the maker of the law or of the person executing the law but in the demonstration by evidence and argument before the <ORG> that the guaranteed right is not infringed AIR SC this Court held A law applying to a class is constitutional if there is sufficient basis or reason for it It can also repeal it step by step It is well settled that the safeguard provided by Article of the Constitution can only be invoked if the classification is made on the grounds which are totally irrelevant to the object of the statute But if there is some nexus between the objects sought to be achieved and the classification the legislature is presumed to have acted in proper exercise of its constitutional power But a statutory discrimination cannot be set aside if there are facts on the basis of which this statutory discrimination can be justified The court can only consider whether the classification has been done on an understandable basis having regard to the object of the statute The law must satisfy the requirements of the Constitution today taking into account the accrued or acquired rights of the parties today The law cannot say twenty years ago the parties had no rights therefore the requirements of the Constitution will be satisfied if the law is dated back by twenty years AIR SC Constitution Bench of this Court similarly held that the date from which the rules are made to operate must be shown to have reasonable nexus with the provisions contained in the statutory rules specially when the retrospective effect extends over a long period AIR SC this Court similarly held as under an amendment having retrospective operation which has the effect of taking away a benefit already available to the employee under the existing rule is arbitrary discriminatory and violative of the rights guaranteed under Articles and of the Constitution this Court held that the legislative power to amend the enacted law with retrospective effect is also subject to several judicially recognized limitations inter alia the retrospectivity must be reasonable and not excessive or harsh otherwise it runs the risk of being struck down as unconstitutional It is a legitimate or settled expectation to obtain right to enjoy the property etc In the matter of Government of a <ORG> the succeeding Government is duty bound to continue and carry on the unfinished job of the previous Government for the reason that the action is that of the <ORG> within the meaning of Article of the Constitution which continues to subsist and therefore it is not required that the new Government can plead contrary from the <ORG> action taken by the previous Government in respect of a particular subject The <ORG> being a continuing body can be stopped from changing its stand in a given case but where after holding enquiry it came to the conclusion that action was not in conformity with law the doctrine of estoppel would not apply Thus unless the act done by the previous Government is found to be contrary to the statutory provisions unreasonable or against policy the <ORG> should not change its stand merely because the other political party has come into power supra this Court while dealing with the issue held as under The Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Bill is not admissible as an aid to the construction of the Act to be passed but it can be used for limited purpose for ascertaining the conditions which prevailed at that time which necessitated the making of the law and the extent and urgency of the evil which it sought to remedy The Statement of Objects and Reasons may be relevant to find out what is the objective of any given statute passed by the legislature Therefore as a general rule the doctrine of estoppel will not be applied against the <ORG> in its governmental public or sovereign capacity The Government has inherent power to promote the general welfare of the people and in order to achieve the said goal the State is free to exercise its sovereign powers of legislation to regulate the conduct of its citizens to the extent that their rights shall not stand abridged Members of an association have the right to be associated only with those whom they consider eligible to be admitted and have right to deny admission to those with whom they do not want to associate The right to form an association cannot be infringed by forced inclusion of unwarranted persons in a group In case the association has an option choice to get registered under a particular statute if there are more than one statutes operating in the field the <ORG> cannot force the society to get itself registered under a statute for which the society has not applied The recommendations of <ORG> and <ORG> are not based on relevant material as there was no investigation of all the co operative societies either converted to or registered under the Act There is nothing on record to show that <ORG> had considered either the functioning of other more than societies registered under the Act or consensus thereof arrived at by the <ORG> the <ORG> and the <ORG> at the meeting convened by the Chief Secretaries on alongwith other high officials of the co operative section to solve the problems faced by the <ORG> the <ORG> and the Milk <ORG> within the framework of the Act and consistent with the statutory co operative principles The impugned provisions have no nexus with the object of enforcing the tier structure inasmuch as a the and the Acts both permit registration of <ORG> the Act does not contain any express provision providing for tier structure the object of having a tier structure could be achieved by the <ORG> registering itself under the Act as decided at the meeting of cooperative milk unions convened by the Chief Secretary on and even the Act does not treat Dairy <ORG> as a separate class to be governed by a separate structure Chapter of the Act which empowers the Registrar to recover dues by attachment and sale of property and execution of orders having been expressly incorporated in the Act by Section thereof there was no justification at all for the impugned Amendments The Act provide for multiplicity of organisations and the statutory authorities have no right to classify the co operative societies while under the Act the Registrar can refuse because of non viability conflict of area of jurisdiction or for some class of co operative Role of the <ORG> and Registrar under the Act is much more than under the Act as under the Act the Registrar can postpone the elections nominate directors to <ORG> can appoint persons in charge for State level federations frame rules and handle appeals revisions reviews can give directions to co operatives regarding reservations on staff and set up <ORG> and <ORG> while so much control is not under the Act Clause thereof clearly described the salient features of the legislation inter alia to enunciate the cooperative principles which primarily place an assent on voluntarily self financing autonomous bodies for removal from State control to accept the cooperative societies to regulate their functioning by framing bye laws subject to the provisions of the Act and to change the form or extent to their liability to transfer their assets and liabilities to provide for the constitution of board and functions of the board of directors Principles of co operation as incorporated in Section and given effect to in the other provisions of the Act permit better democratic functioning of the society than under the Act Whereas the Act provides for State regulation to the barest minimum the Act provides for extensive State control and regulation of cooperative societies which is inconsistent with the national policy with regard to cooperative societies evolved in consultation and collaboration with the States which stands accepted by the State of A and reflected in the Scheme of the Act which is based on the model law recommended by <ORG> Act had been enacted without taking note of the basic principles of co operatives incorporated in Section of the Act which provide that membership of a co operative society would be voluntary and shall be available without any political restriction In view of the above we do not see any cogent reason to interfere with the impugned judgment and order
