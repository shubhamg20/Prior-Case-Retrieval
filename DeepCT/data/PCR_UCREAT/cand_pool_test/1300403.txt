It is not disputed that the lands in question were included in the putni patta but it is said that these lands were not taken into account in settling the rent payable under the patta and that consequently the zemindar the respondent is entitled to a share of the rent derived from settling the resumed lands with tenants No dispute arises with regard to the payment of <ORG> which has been assessed on the resumed lands and which under the terms of the putni patta is payable by the appellant It was argued on behalf of the zemindar that the lands which had been resumed that is to say the choukidari chakran lands were not taken into account when the jama was fixed On the other hand it was contended on behalf of the plaintiff that the lands were comprised in the putni patta and consequently it must follow that the rents and profits of these lands belonged to the putnidar and further that the rents and profits must be taken as the equivalent of the personal service which had been rendered to the putnidar by the choukidars before the resumption As to the first ground it is suggested that the decision of this Court indirectly affects a number of other resumed lands within the estate of the appellant and that the appellant will lose at least an annual income of rupees five thousand the details of which were to be given later on and that if that amount is taken into consideration there would be a question relating to property of the value of rupees ten thousand It was alleged as a ground in the petition that it would affect the property and income of many zemindars in Pengal On the contrary when the reported cases are examined it appears that the facts relating to the respective cases vary considerably and the cases certainly do not show that the facts proved in these suits are such as would cover the arrangements between putnidars and zemindars in Bengal generally Before the <ORG> could come to the conclusion that this decision involves a question of wide public importance there should be some evidence that the rights of the zemindars and the putnidats in Bengal inrespect of such lands are generally speaking dependent upon the same facts as appear in these suits and that the terms of the leases regulating such rights are similar to the terms of the pattas in these suits There is no evidence before the <ORG> which would justify us in arriving at that conclusion In my judgment there is not sufficient evidence before us at the present time to justify the <ORG> in holding that the decision in these suits involves a question of wide public importance and in certifying that these are fit cases for appeal to <ORG> I have nothing to add to the reasons given by my Lord the Chief Justice in his judgment for refusing leave
