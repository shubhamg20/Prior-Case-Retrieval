Apparently the appellants had no notice of the proceedings in liquidation and they as secured creditors now say that they want to stand outside the winding up The appellants had obtained a valuation of the properties of the company in liquidation and according to the valuers the value of the assets came to Rs In addition to opposing the report of <ORG> the appellants also filed an application praying that as secured creditors standing outside the winding up they may be permitted to realize the securities and apportion the net sale proceeds between them and <ORG> another secured creditor who was also entitled to payment pari passu with them Challenging this order the appellants filed an appeal before <ORG> of <ORG> It is feeling aggrieved by the dismissal of their appeal by <ORG> that the appellants have filed this appeal by special leave before this Court In this situation it is seen straightaway that Section of the SFC Act has application Where proceedings for liquidation in respect of an industrial concern have commenced before an application is made under sub section of section nothing in this section shall be construed as giving to <ORG> any preference over the other creditors of the industrial concern not conferred on it by any other law On the face of it it is apparent that no right is acquired by the appellants or no right has accrued to them or can accrue to them under Section of the Act unless any such right is conferred on the appellants by any other law in force There is no plea that other than the SFC Act any other law confers any additional right on the appellants A mere right to take advantage of an enactment without any act done towards availing of that right cannot be deemed a right accrued When this appeal came up for hearing before two learned Judges it was submitted that there was a conflict between the decisions in <ORG> Versus <ORG> and <ORG> Learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants submitted that the appellants had special rights under the SFC Act and since there was no notice to them of the proceedings in liquidation and they were not parties to the order of winding up they were entitled to proceed with the enforcement of their rights under the SFC Act and the company court was not justified in not permitting the appellants to sell the securities on their own and in directing them to associate <ORG> in the matter of sale and in the matter of disbursement of the proceeds among the creditors Section of the SFC Act gave the provisions of that Act overriding effect There is no doubt that the appellants are financial corporations within the meaning of the SFC Act conferred with the right to proceed under that Act to take over the management and possession of the assets of the debtor here the company in liquidation or to enforce their claims by resort to Section of the SFC Act by approaching the concerned <ORG> The appellants not having invoked the provisions of the SFC Act stand only in the shoes of secured creditors entitled to enforce their security The rules with regard to debts provable the valuation of annuities and future and contingent liabilities and the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors as are in force for the time being under the law of insolvency with respect to the estates of persons adjudged insolvent apply Section of the Act deals with the rights of creditors the respective rights of secured and unsecured creditors as are in force for the time being under the law of insolvency with respect to the estates of persons adjudged insolvent Provided that the security of every secured creditor shall be deemed to be subject to a pari passu charge in favour of the workmen to the extent of the workmen portion therein and where a secured creditor instead of relinquishing his security and proving his debt opts to realize his security a the liquidator shall be entitled to represent the workmen and enforce such charge any amount realized by the liquidator by way of enforcement of such charge shall be applied rateably for the discharge of workmen dues and so much of the debt due to such secured creditor as could not be realized by him by virtue of the foregoing provisions of this proviso or the amount of the workmen portion in his security whichever is less shall rank pari passu with the workmen dues for the purposes of Section A It reads A Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act or any other law for the time being in force in the winding up of a company a workmen dues and debts due to secured creditors to the extent such debts rank under clause of the proviso to sub section of Section pari passu with such dues shall be paid in priority to all other debts The debts payable under clause a and clause of sub section shall be paid in full unless the assets are insufficient to meet them in which case they shall abate in equal proportions A combined reading of Section A and indicates that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in the Companies Act itself there is a preferential payment provided for workmen dues and debts due to the secured creditors to the extent such debts rank under clause of the proviso to Section pari passu with such dues In <ORG> Bombay Vs The Official Liquidator AIR BOMBAY <ORG> took the view that rights conferred on a financial corporation as a mortgagee under Section of the SFC Act are not obliterated when the company is in winding up The statutory right under Section to sell the property had to be exercised consistently with the rights of a pari passu chargeholder in whose favour a statutory charge is created by the proviso to Section of the Companies Act when the company is in liquidation Therefore such a power can be exercised only with the concurrence of the Official Liquidator and the Official Liquidator is required to take the permission of the <ORG> before giving such concurrence since he is an officer of the <ORG> and is required to act under the directions of the <ORG> while exercising his powers on behalf of the workers The <ORG> held that there was no inconsistency between the SFC Act and Section read with Section A of the Companies Act and hence Section of the SFC Act was not attracted It was held that the permission granted to the <ORG> a secured creditor of the company in liquidation to sell the assets of the company which constituted security for repayment of loans advanced by the <ORG> to the <ORG> and which the <ORG> had already taken into possession before the winding up was ordered and the permission to realize the dues of the <ORG> subject to payment of the workmen dues as undertaken by it by standing outside the winding up was well in accordance with the provisions of Section as amended and Section A as inserted in the Companies Act and Section and Section of the SFC Act The Court held that the right of the secured creditor to deal with his security and realize the same without intervention of the court remains unaffected notwithstanding such vesting or property coming in the custody of the company court SCC while considering the question as to when should a company court grant leave to a secured creditor to proceed with his suit against the company after an order of winding up was made and on what conditions the permission should be granted this Court held that in the case of conflict in power between the Official Liquidator appointed by the company court and the Receiver appointed by <ORG> in a suit filed by the secured creditor the interest of the Official Liquidator should have precedence supra the question of jurisdiction of <ORG> under the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act vis vis the company court arose for decision The <ORG> took into account the fact that Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act was a legislation subsequent in point of time to the introduction of Section A of the Companies Act by Act of and it had overriding effect But it noticed that by virtue of Section of the Recovery of Debts Act the priorities among various creditors had to be decided by <ORG> only in terms of Section A of the Companies Act and Section did not give priority to all secured creditors The <ORG> also held that the occasion for a claim by a secured creditor against the realization by other creditors of the debtor under Section A read with proviso to Section of the Companies Act could arise before <ORG> only if the concerned creditor had stood outside the winding up and realized amounts and if it is shown that out of the amounts privately realized by it some portion had been rateably taken away by the liquidator under clauses a and of the proviso to Section The <ORG> has not held that Section A of the Companies Act will have no application in a case where a proceeding under the Recovery of Debts Act has been set in motion by a financial institution It was held that Sections and A of the Companies Act had overriding effect and the amendment being later in point of time the non obstante clause therein would prevail over the non obstante clause contained in Section of the SFC Act This Court held that a right is available to a financial corporation under Section of the SFC Act against a debtor if a company only so long as there is no order of winding up When the debtor is a company in winding up the rights of financial corporations are affected by the provisions in Sections and A of the Companies Act As far as we can see there is no conflict on the question of the applicability of Section A read with Section of the Companies Act to cases where the debtor is a company and is in liquidation The conflict if any is in the view that <ORG> could sell the properties of the Company in terms of the Recovery of Debts Act This view was taken in <ORG> Versus <ORG> and <ORG> supra in view of Recovery of Debts Act being a subsequent legislation and being a special law would prevail over the general law the Companies Act This argument is not available as far as the SFC Act is concerned since Section A was introduced by Act of and the overriding provision therein would prevail over the SFC Act of as amended in and notwithstanding Section of the SFC Act As regards distribution of assets there is no conflict The directions thus made clearly are consistent with the provisions of the relevant Acts and the views expressed by this <ORG> in the decisions referred to above In this situation we find no reason to interfere with the decision of the High <ORG> We clarify that there is no inconsistency between the decisions in <ORG> Versus <ORG> and <ORG> supra and in <ORG> Vs <ORG> supra in respect of the applicability of Sections and A of the Companies Act in the matter of distribution among the creditors iii If a financial corporation acting under Section of the SFC Act seeks to sell or otherwise transfer the assets of a debtor company in liquidation the said power could be exercised by it only after obtaining the appropriate permission from the company court and acting in terms of the directions issued by that court as regards associating the Official Liquidator with the sale the fixing of the upset price or the reserve price confirmation of the sale holding of the sale proceeds and the distribution thereof among the creditors in terms of Section A and Section of the Companies Act But we find merit in the submission that the company court was not justified in not ordering a fresh valuation of the properties We make no order as to costs
