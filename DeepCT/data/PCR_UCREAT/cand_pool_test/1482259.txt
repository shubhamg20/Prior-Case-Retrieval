Section of the Amending Act provided that no suit or other proceedings shall be maintained or continued in any other Court for the refund of the duty collected and no enforcement shall be made by any Court of any decree or order directing the refund of such duties of excise which have been collected and which may have been collected as if the provisions of Section of the Act had been in force on and from the appointed day as defined in the Act The present appeals by special leave preferred against the judgments of <ORG> of Gujarat and <ORG> of Bombay and the batch of writ petitions under Article of the Constitution of India involve common PG NO questions of law concerning the validity of the levy of duties of excise under tariff items and of the Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act Central Excise Act as amended by the Central Excises and Salt Additional Duties Excise Amendment Act Amending Act treating as manufacture the process of bleaching dyeing printing sizing mercerising water proofing rubberising shrink proofing organdie processing etc At the time of hearing the correctness of the view taken in the <ORG> case on certain aspects having been doubted by another Bench of this Court these appeals writ petitions were referred to a Bench of five judges on two questions namely whether the processing of grey fabric amounted to manufacture within the meaning of Section as it stood prior to its amendment and whether even if such processing did amount to manufacture what should be the proper basis for determining the assessable value of the processed fabrics In the petitions and appeals the following points arise for determination Allowing the appeals preferred by <ORG> HELD Per Majority The appeals preferred by <ORG> are allowed and the Judgment of <ORG> under appeal is PG NO set aside But the price received by he wholesale dealer who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and in his turn sells the same in wholesale to other dealers would be irrelevant for determination of the value of the goods and the goods would be charged on that basis Per <NAME> for himself and on behalf of <NAME> and <NAME> i The prevalent and generally accepted test to ascertain that there is manufacture is whether the change or the series of changes brought about by the application of processes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but is instead recognised as a distinct and new article that has emerged as a result of the processes ii The view taken in the Empire Industries case that grey fabrics after they undergo the various processes of bleaching dyeing sizing printing finishing etc emerges as a commercially different commodity with its own price structure custom and other commercial incidents and that there was in that sense a manufacture within the meaning of Section even as unamended is an eminently plausible view and is not shown to suffer from any fallacy are not sources of the legislative power but are merely topics or fields of legislation and must receive a liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate upon that topic or field Of course it has concurrent power also in respect of the subjects in List The view taken in the matter in <ORG> case does not call for reconsideration Any statutory standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the tax It was considered not necessary or possible to stretch the language of the definition in beyond the ambit of the provision as delineated in the earlier decisions ii There is nothing in the decision HMM case that supports the contention of the petitioners here that the amendment of the definition of manufacture cannot be sustained by reference to entry of List in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India if it cannot be upheld as falling under the purview of Entry It is an expression of wide import and takes in all the stages of charge quantification and recovery of duty though in certain contexts it may have a restricted meaning The words levy and collection in sub section cannot be construed differently from the words levied and collected used in sub section ii Having regard to the nature and content of the levy indicated in it is obvious that has to have the effect of attracting not only the purely procedural and machinery provisions of the Act but also some of its charging provisions It may only make a reference of a broad nature as to the law on the subject generally or contain a general reference to the terms of an earlier statute which are to be made applicable While the Act imposes a general levy of excise duty on all goods manufactured and produced and aim of the present Act is to supplement the levy by an additional duty of the same nature on certain goods Dyeing Printing Sizing Mercerising water proofing rubberising Shrink Proofing Organdie Processing etc done by the processor who carry out these operations in their factories on Job work basis in respect of Cotton fabric and Man made fabric belonging to their customers The Amending Act which became effective from sought to render the processes of Bleaching Dyeing Printing Sizing Mercerising etc Manufacture within the meaning of the Section of the Central Excise Act The amendment was necessitated by the Judgment of <ORG> which has declared the levy on such processing as illegal as according to <ORG> the processing did not bring into being a new and commercially different article with a distinctive character and use and did not therefore constitute manufacture for purposes and within the meaning of the charging section It is contended that these job work processing operations do not amount to manufacture as the petitioners do not carry out any spinning or weaving operations that what they receive from their customers for processing is PG NO therwise fully manufactured man made fabric and that what is returned to the customers after processing continues to remain man made fabric Before its amendment by the Amending Act Central Act VI of Section of the Central Excise ACt defined manufacture in its well accepted legal sense nomen juris and not with reference to an artificial and statutorily expanded import manufacture includes any process incidental or ancillary to the completion of a manufactured product and i ii Omitted as unnecessary The reasoning of <ORG> was on these lines In the instant case the excise duty claimed on the basis of the market value of the processed cotton fabrics or manmade fabrics cannot be levied because assuming that process amounts to manufacture all that they have done is to manufacture processed cloth processed fabric either cotton or man made and that not being a taxable event in the light of Section read with section of the Act and PG NO Items and levy of excise duty on this basis was ultra vires and contrary to law Section of the Amending Act provided Special provisions as to duties of excise on cotton fabrics woollen fabrics man made fabrics etc during a certain past period and validation Any rule or notification or any action or thing made issued taken or done or purporting to have been made cotton fabrics woollen fabrics rayon or artificial silk fabrics or as the case may be man made fabrics shall for all purposes be PG NO deemed to be and to have always been as validly and effectively made issued taken or done as if the provisions of this section had been in force at all material times and accordingly notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court tribunal or other authority a all duties of excise levied assessed or collected or purported to have been levied assessed or collected before the date of commencement of this Act on i cloth cotton cloth and cotton fabrics subjected to any process ii woollen fabrics subjected to any process iii rayon or artificial silk fabrics and man made fabrics subjected to any process under any such Central Act shall be deemed to be and shall be deemed always to have been as validly levied assessed or collected as if the provisions of this section had been in force on and from the appointed day no suit or other proceeding shall be maintained or continued in any court for the refund of and no enforcement shall be made by any court of any decree or order directing the refund of any such duties of excise which have been collected and which would have been validly collected if the provisions of this section had been in force on and from the appointed day However the correctness of the view taken in the <ORG> case on certain aspects was doubted by another Bench of this court and the matter was accordingly referred to a Bench of five judges Indeed <ORG> appears to have proceeded on the premise that the view taken in <ORG> case on the point was the correct one se writ petitions and appeals are referred to the larger Bench it will be open to the larger Bench to consider not only the question of determination of the assessable value but also the other question namely whether processing of grey fabric by a processor on job work basis constitutes manufacture because the judgment in <ORG> case which has decided this question in favor of the revenue and against the processor is a judgment of a Bench of only three Judges and now the present writ petitions and appeals will be heard by a Bench of five Judges This is how the first question which is otherwise concluded by the pronouncement in <ORG> case is sought to be reagitated before us Out of deference to the learned counsel who vigorously argued this aspect at great length and we though we should examine the submission on this point also though the matter could by no means be considered to have been referred to a larger bench It contemplated the alternative possibilities of valuation thus It was common ground between the parties that the procedure followed by the <ORG> authorities was that the trader who entrusted cotton or man made fabrics to the processor for processing on job work basis would give a declaration to the processor as to what would be the price at which he would be selling the processed goods in the market and that would be taken by the <ORG> authorities as the assessable value of the processed fabrics and excise duty would be charged to the processor on that basis Rs The assessable value in the case given in this example would be taken by the Excise authorities at Rs which was the sale price of the trader The view of the Referring Bench on the point was this We cannot accept the contention of the learned counsel on behalf of the petitioners and the appellants that the value of the grey cloth which is processed by the processor should not be included in the assessable value of the processed fabric since the grey cloth is one of the raw materials which goes into the manufacture of the processed fabric and the value of the processed fabric cannot be computed without including the value of the raw material That goes into its manufacture The element of selling profit of the trader would be entirely an extraneous element and it cannot be taken into account for the purpose of determining the assessable value of the processee fabric which would comprise the value of the grey cloth and the PG NO job work charges but exclude the profit at which the trader may sub sequently sell the processed fabric The word manufacture used as a verb is generally understood to mean as bringing into existence a new substance and does not mean merely to produce some change in a substance manufacture is the end result of one or more processes through which the original commodity is made to pass Where there is no essential difference in identity between the original commodity and the processed article it is not possible to say that in one commodity has been consumed in the manufacture of another But something more is necessary and there must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use Further learned counsel placed reliance upon <ORG> case where it was held that ground nut oil after the process of hydrogenation which improved its keeping qualities and shelf life yet remained basically ground nut oil and that the quality of the oil had been improved by the processes it was subjected to did not detract from its continuing identity as ground nut oil It was also urged that the affidavits filed by person engaged in and familiar with the textile trade indicated that the finished fabric was not a commercially different commodity We have carefully considered these submissions It was contended that processing the manufactured fabric does not bring into existence any new woven material but the question is does new and different goods emerge having distinctive name use and character Answering the Bench said It appears in the light of the several decisions and on the construction of the expression that the process of bleaching dyeing and printing etymologically also means manufacturing processes It is strenuously urged for the processors that the view taken by <ORG> in the <ORG> case suffers from fallacies both of reasoning and conclusion and requires to be reconsidered The prevalent and generally accepted test to ascertain that there is manufacture is whether the change or the series of changes brought about by the application of processes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but is instead recognised as a distinct and new article that has emerged as a result of the processes The correctness of the view in the <ORG> case cannot be tested in the light of material in the form of affidavit expressing the opinion of persons said to be engaged in or connected with the textile trade as to the commercial identity of the commodities before and after the processing placed before the court in a sub sequent case These opinions are of course relevant and would be amongst the various factors to be taken into account in deciding the question On a consideration of the matter we are persuaded to think that the view taken in the <ORG> case that Grey fabric after they undergo the various processes of bleaching dyeing sizing printing finishing etc emerges as a commercially different commodity with its own price structure custom and other commercial incidents and that there was in that sense a manufacture within the meaning of Section even as unamended is an eminently plausible view and is not shown to suffer from any fallacy we have on the one hand to bear in mind the salutary rule that words conferring the right of legislation should be interpreted liberally and the powers conferred should be given the widest amplitude on the other hand we have to guard ourselves against extending the meaning of the words beyond their reasonable connotation in an anxiety to preserve the power of the legislature There is in law no manufacture unless as a result of the process a new and commercially distinct product with distinct use emerges Entries to the legislative lists it must be recalled are not sources of the legislative power but are merely topics or fields of legislation and must receive a liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not in a narrow pedantic sense It stipulates the levy and charge of duty of excise on all excisable goods produced or manufactured We are therefore of the opinion that there is no substance in this contention We respectfully agree It is divided into Parts dealing respectively with customs and excise duty value added tax income tax capital gains tax stamp duty capital transfer tax and so on There is no prohibition against the <ORG> enacting in a single statute matters which call for the exercise of power under two or more entries in List I of the Seventh Schedule If it is not it is not necessary to go any further or search for the field in List I <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate upon that topic or field Of course it has concurrent power also in respect of the subjects in List III It would be a new terror in the construction Acts of Parliament if we were required to limit a word to an unnatural sense because in some Act which is not incorporated or referred to such an interpretation is given to it for the purposes of that Act alone There are at least two circumstances which render the definition of manufacture under Section attracted to the additional levies Ievy and collection of the additional duties as they apply in relation to the levy and collection of the duties of excise on the goods specified in sub section therefore clear is that what applies to the main levy applies to the additional duties as well we find no substance in Contention either Re Contention There is really no substance in the grievance that the retroactivity imparted to the amendments is violative of Article There is no merit in contention either The processors say that they have filed classification lists under rule PG NO of the Central Excises and Salt Rules as they had no other choice and that if the proper principles of determination of the assessable value do not legally justify the consequences flowing from the classification it is open to them to contend against the validity of the determination and they are not estopped from doing so <ORG> held We cannot accept the contention of the learned counsel on behalf of the petitioners and the appellants that the value of the grey cloth which is processed by the processor should not be included in the assessable value of the processed fabric In the argument as presented that the assessable value would include what is referred to as the post manufacture profits there is an obvious fallacy SCR <NAME> speaking for the Court said The value of the goods for the purpose of excise must take into account only the manufacturing cost and the manufacturing profit and it must not be loaded with post manufacturing cost or profit arising from post manufacturing operation Any statutory standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the tax On a consideration of the matter the view taken in the matter in the <ORG> case does not call for reconsideration In the result the appeals preferred by <ORG> are allowed and the Judgment of <ORG> under appeal is set aside <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgment proposed to be delivered by my learned brother <NAME> I respectfully agree with him There is however one aspect of the matter in respect of which I would like to say a few words The processors in the cases before us say that they have filed classification lists under rule of the Central Excises and Salt Rules as they had no other choice and that if the proper principles of determination of the assessable value do not legally justify the consequences flowing from the classification it is open to them to contend against the validity of the determination and they are nOt estopped from doing so Section a of the Act stipulates that the value should be subject to other provisions of the Section the normal price thereof that is to say the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer PG NO is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale And it was held that there was no hardship in these cases Where a manufacturer se<ORG><ORG>s the goods manufactured by him in who<ORG>esa<ORG>e to a who<ORG>esa<ORG>e dea<ORG>er at the arms <ORG>ength and in the usua<ORG> course of business the who<ORG>esa<ORG>e cash price charged by him to the who<ORG>esa<ORG>e dea<ORG>er <ORG>ess trade discount wou<ORG>d represent the va<ORG>ue of the goods for the purpose of assessment of excise But the price received by the who<ORG>esa<ORG>e dea<ORG>er who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and in his turn se<ORG><ORG>s the same in who<ORG>esa<ORG>e to other dea<ORG>er wou<ORG>d be irre<ORG>evant for determination of the va<ORG>ue of the goods and the goods wou<ORG>d not be charged on that basis PG NO RANGANATHAN I agree but I should like to add a few words on two of the points argued before us First I should like to clarify the nature of the decision in <ORG> <ORG> the <ORG> case to which I was a party since learned counsel for the petitioners sought to rely on my judgment in that case as supporting his contention that the <ORG> cannot seek to uphold the amendment presently in question by reference to Entry of List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution The question had been answered by several <ORG> in the negative principally on the ground that the duty sought to be levied under the Act was an excise duty the very nature of which required a proximate connection with production or manufacture and that what had passed beyond this region and entered the domain of sale could not pass as excise duty We do not think in considering this amendment that it is necessary for us to discuss whether if <ORG> were to enact a law imposing on goods manufactured or produced a duty based not only on the manufacturing cost profits but also including in the dutiable value the whole or some part post manufacturing cost profits such a law would be intra vires or not because it appears to us that no such law has been enacted in this case It was concluded after referring to the previous position as well as the statement of objects and reasons for the amendment that there was nothing to show that the legislature had intended to make ally change and that the rule against a presumption of implicit alteration of the law should be invoked in the context It was considered not necessary or possible to stretch the language of the definition in beyond the ambit of the provision as delineated in the earlier decisions Entry in List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution permits the enactment by <ORG> of a law relating to taxation of income If such extended concept is within the range of duties of excise as envisaged under Entry and I agree that with my learned brothers that is there is no difficulty In my view therefore there is nothing in the decision in the <ORG> case that supports the contention of the petitioners have that the amendment of the definition of manufacture cannot be PG NO sustained by reference to Entry of List I in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution of India if it cannot be upheld as falling under the purview of Entry there is no warrant or justification for giving such a narrow interpretation to the wide language of of the Act Learned counsel for the petitioner in advancing this argument apparently has in mind the famous dictum of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <ORG> A echoed in several decisions of this Court and of the various <ORG> in India PG NO Now there are three stages in the imposition of a tax there is the declaration of liability that is the part of the statute which determines what persons in respect of what property are liable Next there is the assessment It is an expression of wide import and takes in all the stages of charge quantification and recovery of duty though in certain contexts it may have a restricted meaning The words levy and collection in sub section cannot be construed differently from the words levied and collected used in sub section This decision was really concerned with ZD of the Income Tax Act which in turn called for a reference to of the Finance Act which is in the following terms I When goods of the description mentioned in this section chargeable with a duty of excise under the Central Excises Act are assessed to duty there shall be levied and collected a as respects certain goods a special duty of excise equal to per cent of the total amount so chargeable on such goods as respects certain other goods a special duty of excise equal to per cent apply in relation to the levy and collection of the duty of excise leviable under this section in respect of any goods as they apply in relation to the levy and collection of the duties of excise on such goods under that Act or rules The question was whether the tax credit could also be given in respect of the amount of the special duty of excise levied and collected under the Finance Act It said It is true that the expression leviable is an expression of wide import and includes stages of quantification and recovery of the duty but in the context in which that expression has been used in clause of sub section of ZD it is clear that it has been used in the sense of chargeability to duty Having said this the <ORG> added Sub clauses and of of the Finance Act on which reliance has been placed by counsel for the appellant company in terms refers to the procedural aspect such as the qualification and collection of the special duty and simply because the qualification and collection of the special duty under the Finance Act is to he done in accordance with the provisions of the Excise Act such duty does not become leviable that is to say chargeable under the Excise Act The above observations no doubt lend some support to the contention of the petitioner as the wording of of the Finance Act is identical with that of and has been interpreted as attracting only the procedural aspect of the Central Excise Act There are three ingredients of the charging provision viz The additional duties are charged a on manufacture storage of production of certain named goods at the rates specified in the first schedule Having regard to the nature and content of the levy indicated in it is obvious that has to have the effect of attracting not only the purely procedural and machinery provisions of the Act but also some of its charging provisions I have referred to the fact that a provision similar to that in of the Finance Act is also found in other Finance Act On perusal of these provisions it will be found that a like position exists there also A question has been raised as to why if it were the intention of the <ORG> to take in all the provisions PG NO including definitions from the Act it was considered necessary to make a specific reference to the definitions of the various goods on which additional duty was being imposed as contained in the schedule to the Act enumerates various items of goods among which arc the six items specified in of the Act and this list further specifies that they shall have the same meaning as is attached to the respective items in the First Schedule to the Central Excises Salt Act vide items ii a vii viii ix The next question that arises for considerion is whether even assuming that the terms of are applicable its terms are wide enough to take in not merely the provisions of the Central Excises and Salt Act and in particular its definition clauses as they stood in on the date when the Act came into force but also the amendments effected therein from time to time It may only make a reference of a broad nature as to thc law on a subject generally as in <NAME> <NAME> It only declares generally that the provisions of the Act shall apply so far as may be that is to the extent necessary and practical for the purposes of the Act as well That apart it has been held even when a specific provision is incorporated and the case apparently falls in the first of the above categories that the rule that repeals modifications or amendments of the earlier Act will have to be ignored is not adhered to incertain situations The present case falls within the scope of these exceptions even if is construed as incorporating certain specific provisions of the into itself While the Act imposes a general levy of excise duty on all goods manufactured and produced and aim of the present Act is to supplement the levy by an additional duty of the same nature on certain goods There is no reason or logic why all the incidents attaching under the earlier legislation in so as they are not clearly inconsistent with the later one should not be extended to the later legislation as well In the circumstances I agree that we should give full and literal effect to the language of and hold that it has the effect not only of attracting the procedural provisions of the Act but also all its other provisions including those Containing the definition
