This petition is filed for the issue of a writ of certiorari calling for the records of <ORG> <ORG> relating to Rt and to quash the order dated th April made therein The Petitioner applied to the Collector of Dharmapuri for the grant of a no objection certificate to locate a touring cinema theatre in No in Mallapuram Village on th February The third respondent preferred appeals to <ORG> one against the other granting a no objection certificate to the petitioner and another against the order rejecting his application far the grant of a no abjection certificate The appeals were heard by <ORG> and it allowed the appeals of the third respondent and granted a no abjection certificate to him and declined to grant a no objection certificate to the petitioner Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the order of <ORG> is vitiated by errors apparent on the face of the record It is admitted that the petitioner applied to the Collector of Dharmapuri for the grant of a no objection certificate to locate a touring cinema in No in Mallapuram Village on th February while the third respondent applied only on th February for a site which is within the prohibited distance It has been held by a Bench of this Court in <NAME> Arumugham I Crl at that there is nothing in the Act or in the rules framed thereunder which casts a duty on the Collector or <ORG> to make a selection among several applicants and that the person who applied earlier could be given a no objection certificate if the requirements of the Act are satisfied No No of The petitioner application being the earlier one and as there was no objection to the site a no objection certificate ought to have been granted to the petitioner The next contention of the learned Counsel for the petitioner is that the <ORG> was in error in arrogating to itself the function of determining a question of law which had been decided by <ORG> and thereby the order is vitiate by an error apparent on the face of the record It is in law bound to administer the law as declared and propounded by <ORG> In dismissing it the learned Judge observed that the test applied in that case appeared prima facie to be a valid test in connection with the grant of a cinematographic licences Where a judgment is given without the losing party having been represented there is no assurance that all the relevant considerations have been brought to the notice of the <ORG> and consequently the decision ought not to be regarded as possessing absolute authority even if it does not fall within the sub silentio rule In <NAME> Charles Leslie Norman at <ORG> was of the view that a decision was not entitled to great weight as the prisoner was not represented and no argument whatever was addressed to the <ORG> by Counsel on his behalf at stated the position thus No doubt the petitioner Counsel did address an argument before the <ORG> but it must be borne in mind that argument addressed at motion hearing is rarely full particularly when the question is intricate or is an unusual one It must therefore be said that the decision on the point was given by the learned Judges per incuriam In cases when petitions are dismissed at the admission stage the respondent is not present and has no opportunity to put forth his case Admittedly whatever observations may be made they will not bind the respondent and the judgment cannot be a precedent because it is a judgment rendered on hearing only one side But the fact that he has relied on the observations in the two decisions which have no force as precedents is an error apparent on the face of the record The order of the <ORG> is attacked on the ground that its conclusion that the granting of a no objection certificate to the petitioner would be a source of nuisance was based purely on surmises <ORG> has discouraged the tribunals coming to conclusions on surmises In <NAME> Commissioner at <ORG> pointed out thus The conclusions reached by the <ORG> should not be coloured by any irrelevant considerations of matters of prejudice and if there are any circumstances which required to be explained by the assessee the assessee should be given an opportunity of doing so It is contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the right to object is given to the public under Rule a if the objection is preferred within days of the notification and the ground of objection is non compliance of the rules framed under the Act I do not think that this point need be considered as any relevant objection can be taken into consideration by the authority issuing the licence whether it is brought to his notice by way of objection from the public or otherwise Learned Counsel brought to my notice the decision of this Court in <NAME> The State I A I where <NAME> took the view that the interest of the public generally as used in Section of the Motor Vehicles Act was comprehensive enough to cover the interest of the public generally besides the interest of the travelling public Agreeing with the view of the Bench of <ORG> <ORG> pointed out that the interest of the public as mentioned in the Act cannot include matters which have nothing to do with the interests of the public which was going to use the motor vehicles in question Mr <NAME> referred to two decisions of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> <ORG> and in <ORG> <ORG> The passages relied on by the learned Counsel would indicate that the facts to be taken into consideration were the interests of the public listening to the broadcasts The decisions do not help the contentions of the learned Counsel I see no reason for revising my view that the words the interest of the public generally in Section a of the Madras Cinemas Regulation Act would refer only to the interests of the cinema going public In the result the writ petition is allowed with costs
