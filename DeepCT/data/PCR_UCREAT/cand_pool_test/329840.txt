In the present case the question referred for the decision of <ORG> is as follows Whether <ORG> should exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure or otherwise on behalf of persons who feel themselves aggrieved by orders passed by <ORG> below in cases such as the present in which it appears the law has specifically prescribed another remedy by suit or otherwise Parties considering themselves aggrieved by orders passed under Sections or may under Section institute a suit Instead of filing a suit are they entitled to ask <ORG> to exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction and set aside the order The decisions on the point conflict and we have therefore made the reference We propose therefore to consider it in the light both of the decisions of the Indian <ORG>s and of those given by the English <ORG>s in analogous circumstances and as the question is closely connected with others referable to the same general principles and can be better understood by a discussion of the whole group we will try to ascertain what are the proper grounds and limits of the <ORG> visitatorial and superintending that is of its extraordinary jurisdiction For the proper limit of the jurisdiction we must still look to the words of the law but the decisions and the practice of the <ORG> and after it of the High <ORG> are of use as in the case of other jural questions as showing what view was taken by competent authorities with or without special advertence to the questions now brought before us of the construction and application of the language we are called on to interpret The provisions in Regulation Section of reserving to the Governor in <ORG> for two years the power of interpretation of the then new Elphinstone Code and after that time giving it to <ORG> meant no more than that after the temporary suspension of the ordinary powers of <ORG> these were to be resumed <ORG> are not generally subject to the Code of Civil Procedure nor are they included in the provisions of the Bombay Civil Courts Act XIV of so that the visitatorial power over them has to be drawn from the earlier source of Regulation II of and from the Statute and Vict There was a possible remedy by suit but the direction was to exercise a particular judicial function in a way avoided by the Court below this Court set aside an order of a Subordinate Judge for filing an award under Section Code of Civil Procedure Act of Under the Code no appeal would lie from a decree passed in accordance with the award there was apparently an exercise by <ORG> of its extraordinary jurisdiction in a case admitting of a remedy in the regular course of the law This was called an excess of jurisdiction but <NAME> said Although the <ORG> is competent to require the inferior <ORG>s to exercise a jurisdiction which they possess and which they have declined to exercise or to set aside anything which has plainly been done without jurisdiction that Section Section of the same Statute will not enable this <ORG> by way of motion to deal with an order made by a lower Appellate <ORG> in cases where it has jurisdiction and the law expressly declares that its order shall be final In both cases the <ORG> intends the controversy to be closed when the designated Judge has exercised his mind on the intended subject Nevertheless he ordered a sale to be made subject to all that there was a question of who were necessary parties defendant which had been disposed of by <ORG> in a way that if wrong would work an injury to the plaintiff This is said to have been done under the extraordinary jurisdiction but though a refusal to grant a certificate could not it was said be appealed against that being a matter of discretion Re <NAME> th April yet it appears from Sections and of Act XXIII of coupled with the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code Act VIII of Sections that an appeal might possibly be made against an order granting a certificate If there was no appeal then the case being one in which no remedy in the same course of proceedings beyond the <ORG> supposed to have erred is provided by the law was one of a class to which most of the cases of interference have belonged It comes out however that <ORG> will interfere to enforce the exercise of jurisdiction or to restrain an excess of jurisdiction in cases apparently calling for such interference even though there may be a remedy by suit When there is a remedy by appeal the cases do not appear to warrant such interference except under circumstances in which an appeal would manifestly be ineffectual In one sense every erroneous decision or order is illegal in another no judicial order is illegal even though it may call for reversal or amendment which is within the general competence of the Judge who makes it Such an error undoubtedly warrants the interference of this <ORG> even under the Civil Procedure Code the precise circumstances under which it will interfere are left to its discretion It has not only power to reverse erroneous judgments but also to punish all inferior Magistrates and all other officers of justice for wilful and corrupt abuses of authority Bac This authority was so essential to the <ORG> that there are numerous cases in the books which establish that notwithstanding the privative clause in a Statute the <ORG> of Queen Bench will grant a certiorari Colonial Bank of Australasia <ORG> at It is further to be observed that their Lordships of <ORG> at rely on the fact that the Statute they had to expound gave an appeal to the Chief Judge of <ORG> as a ground for holding that the general power of certiorari was withdrawn even in the case of proceedings under a previous Act connected with the later one only by a general provision in the latter giving a right of appeal from the subordinate <ORG> of Mines to that of the Chief Judge In argument for the respondents who had to maintain the certiorari Mr <NAME> put his case thus Ibid at A right of appeal can be given only by express words there was no appeal open to the respondent and therefore it was a case to be set right by <ORG> on certiorari for when the <ORG> creates a <ORG> without appeal it is presumed that certiorari lies to restrain excess of jurisdiction The exception allowed by this able advocate implies that he felt he could not contend for a certiorari where the remedy intended by the law was an appeal and where there were not some special circumstances in the case making that remedy inapplicable or ineffectual or else such as to place the case altogether outside the intention and scope of the privative clause Blewitt re <ORG> In that case the allegation was that the justices had convicted without any evidence at all yet as they had jurisdiction over the subject matter and the conviction was formally valid <ORG> refused a certiorari and <NAME> it will be refused on such a ground as that the party seeking to get an inquisition into compensation quashed lies allowed the time to expire within which he could have got an award set aside under the same Lands Clauses Consolidation Act The Queen <NAME> It does not appear indeed that the principles now recognized were always strictly adhered to in the earlier English cases and in Eaton it could be argued that a certiorari issued of course but in that case it was definitely laid down that a cause must be shown The object of the writ is to prevent a failure of justice and it is granted only where there is no other specific remedy and in another case where a judgment creditor complained that an inferior <ORG> refused to allow him to sign judgment it was pointed out that there was a remedy by writ of error and the <ORG> added Still however if he had once heard the case on the merits though no appeal lay yet no mandamus it was held could be issued however erroneous his decision to compel him to rehear the case on its merits <NAME> <NAME> Jur Afterwards the directors appealed to the Privy <ORG> and the decision having been against them the rule for a mandamus was made absolute The Judge has then really exercised his discretion but when he has given himself jurisdiction by coming to an erroneous conclusion upon a point of law the case is very different and he is in fact without jurisdiction and has no authority to entertain the question In the same case <NAME> says On the second point I would refer to <NAME> <NAME> where to a declaration in prohibition against a <ORG> Judge which stated that title to land was in question there was a plea alleging that the Judge heard the evidence of both parties upon the point and adjudged that title was not in question The plea was demurred to and judgment was given for the plaintiff the ground of the decision being that although the Judge must of necessity decide the point for the time his determination was not conclusive as in the analogous case of a plea to the jurisdiction and as there was no writ of error from the <ORG> the question whether there was jurisdiction or not must be open to one of the superior Courts on motion for a prohibition If the value of the land was above there would be good ground for issuing the writ and I am quite prepared to hold that if the evidence upon that point was conflicting that circumstance though not conclusive upon us so as absolutely to deprive as of the discretionary power of granting the prohibition would so far influence us that we should require very strong grounds before we should interfere I think that he was wrong in the conclusion at which he arrived because ho applied a wrong rule of law to the facts and therefore that he had no jurisdiction There was no remedy after a wrong judgment should be delivered and therefore the Judges were forced to see whether the facts did or did not on any reasonable construction give jurisdiction as the Judge of <ORG> had Supposed A clause in the Constituting Act required any objection by a defendant on that ground to be made by special plea and added if the want of jurisdiction be not so pleaded the <ORG> shall have jurisdiction for all purposes The case of <ORG> <ORG> was disposed of on the ground of want of jurisdiction It would seem that as the Recorder had a general jurisdiction over the subject matter of the appeal the trial before the recorder apart from any prohibition could not have been regarded as coram non judice and the case would on the principles recognized in <NAME> Ramalinga Filial I A at pp in the case of the Attorney General <ORG> at <NAME> says It is very important no doubt that all these special jurisdictions and powers which are given to departments of the <ORG> and other similar bodies should not be exceeded and that such bodies should keep themselves within the jurisdiction which is given to them But as it appears to me it is no less important that we should set them the example of keeping ourselves within our proper jurisdiction and I am of opinion that we have no jurisdiction to sit as Judges on appeal from a finding of <ORG> ok the facts properly brought before them in this matter and that we ought not to try to find reasons for substituting our judgment and decision for theirs From the consideration we have given to the whole subject the following conclusions may we think be deduced Where an appeal is provided the Court will not interfere by any peremptory order with the ordinary course of adjudication save in cases wherein a defeat of the law and a grave wrong are manifest and are irremediable by the regular procedure Where a decree or order of a subordinate <ORG> is declared by the law to bo for its own purposes final or conclusive though in its nature provisional as subject to displacement by the decree in another more formal suit the <ORG> will have regard to the intention of the <ORG> that promptness and certainty should in such cases be in some measure accepted instead of juridical perfection It will rectify the proceedings of the inferior <ORG> where the extrinsic conditions of its legal activity have plainly been infringed but where the alleged or apparent error consists in a misappreciation of evidence or misconstruction of the law intrinsic to the inquiry and decision it will respect the intended finality and will intervene peremptorily only when it is manifest that by the ordinary and prescribed method an adequate remedy or the intended remedy cannot be had The <ORG> will in all cases regard its exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction as discretional and subject to considerations of the importance of the particular case or of the principle involved in it of delay on the part of an applicant and of his merits with respect to the case in which the interference of the <ORG> is sought Should other special causes appear for or against the <ORG> intervention due weight is to be given to them regard being always had to the principles already enunciated It seems to us that the question put by <ORG> does not admit of a precise categorical reply that the <ORG> cannot impose on itself limitations without regard to circumstances but that it should generally be governed in the class of cases in question by the principles contained in the fifth of the propositions just stated
