There was an ordinary mortgage decree of the year We might find some difficulty more speaking for my self I think a verbal than a real difficulty in bringing such appearance within the meaning of the words application to take some step in aid of execution under Article old now Article We think that it is not putting too great a strain upon ordinary language to say that an appeal in such circumstances fairly falls within the meaning of the words an application to take a step in aid of execution This he did and although it is unnecessary to trace the subsequent tedious proceedings it is sufficient to say that his last appeal could not have been made earlier than January that is to say well within three years of his present <ORG> Adopting that view it is unnecessary to enter into any of the other nice and difficult questions which have been raised and adequately argued in the course of this appeal We do not seek to lay down any general principle upon any of those questions but we desire to confine our judgment to the rather unusual facts before us and we think that we do no violence to the meaning of Article old now Article by holding that the present <NAME> is within three years of the last application made by the judgment creditor to a <ORG> to take some step in aid of the execution of his decree We think that this appeal must be allowed with all costs
