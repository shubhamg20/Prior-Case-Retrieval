The lands in these appeals form present parts of Surendra Nagar and Bhavnagar districts Sub Section thereof empowers the <ORG> <ORG> to issue notification from time to time in respect of an estate or part of an estate or in respect of any area specified in the said notification Under clasue of relevant for the purpose of this case it has been provided that consequent upon the notification issued by the govern ment under Section with effect from the specified date all cultivable and non cultivable waste land excluding land used for building or other non agricultural purposes which are comprised in the estates so notified shall except in so far as any rights of any person other than the <NAME> or the <NAME> may be established in and over the same and shall be deemed to be with all rights in or over the same or appertaining thereto the property of the <ORG> and all rights held by a <NAME> or a <NAME> in such property shall be deemed to have been extinguished emphasis supplied and it shall be lawful for the Collector subject to the general or special orders of the Revenue Commissioner to dispose of them as he deems fit subject always to the rights of way and or other rights of the public or of individuals legally subsisting At this juncture it is relevant to note that Saurashtra Land Reforms Act defines agriculture by Section which includes horticulture and the raising of crops fodder or garden produce and agricultural land means any land including wells which is used for the purpose of agricul ture and includes sites of farm buildings appurtenant to land used for agricultural purposes and sites of dwelling houses and wades occupied by agriculturists agricultural labourers or artisans and land appurtenant to such dwelling houses In the same Act under Section estate means all land of whatever description or an undivided share thereof held by a <NAME> and includes uncultivable waste whether such land is used for the purposes of agriculture or not and Section defines land which means any agricultural land bid land or cultivable waste The Saurashtra Barkhali Abolition Act defines under Section i Bharkhalidar which means a person who holds a tenure as <NAME> Jiwaidar Chakariyat Kherati or Dharmada and includes any holder of an estate whom the <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette declare to be a <NAME> for the purpose of this Act The Act gives right to the <NAME> to make an application for personal cultivation and the details etc It is settled law that the concept estate denotes that the person holding the estate should be in direct relationship with the <ORG> paying land revenue except what is remitted in whole or in part or exempted etc We find no force in this contention The legislature derives its power from Article and other related Articles of the Constitution Therefore the power to make the Amendment Act is derived not from the respective entries but under Article of the Constitution The language of the respective entries should be given the widest scope of their meaning fairly capable to meet the machinery of the Government settled by the Constitu tion Each general word should extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be comprehended in it When the vires of an enactment is impugned there is an initial presumption of its con stitutionality and if there is any difficulty in ascertaining the limits of the legislative power the difficulty must be resolved as far as possible in favour of the legislature putting the most liberal construction upon the legislative entry so that it may have the widest amplitude It must be remembered that we are interpreting the Constitution and when the court is called upon to interpret the Constitution it must not be construed in any narrow or pedantic sense and adopt such construction which must be beneficial to the amplitude of legislative powers The broad and liberal spirit should inspire those whose duty is to interpret the Constitution to find whether the impugned Act is relatable to any entry in the relevant List It is well settled that widest amplitude should be given to the language of these entries but some of these entries in different lists or in the same list may overlap and sometimes may also appear to be in direct conflict with each other Hence the language of the Entries should be given widest scope to find out which of the meaning is fairly capable in the set up of the machinery of the government It is seen that under Entry of List II State List land that is to say right in or over the land Entry Regulation of Mines and Mineral Development subject to the provision of List I in respect of regulation and development under the control of <ORG> Article of the Constitution gives exclusive power to make law for the State of Gujarat or any part thereof It is seen that restriction or extinction of existing interest in the land includes provision for abolition and extinguishment of the rights in or over the land SCC this Court held that actual cultivation is not necessary to constitute an estate and the right to collect grass is a right annexed to land which was held to be an estate and abolition of the right to pay annual amount was an agrarian reform In considering that question a bench of seven judges per majority held that Section of the Mines and Mineral Development and Regulation Act imposes a liability to pay royalty and prohibits the <ORG> not to enhance more than once during a period of four year imposition of the cess was considered to be a tax on royalty and therefore it is a tax on mineral rights Thereby all mines minerals or quarries situated in any land be it alienated or unalienated held by any person including <NAME> or <NAME> are now governed by Sections and A of the Code It is also equally settled law that the power to make law prospectively would include the power to make the law retrospectively It is equally settled law that every statute which takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing taws or creates a new obligation or imposes a new duty or burden or touches a new right in respect of transaction already passed must normally be presumed unless expressed otherwise to be intended not to have retrospective effect In the light of the language in of the Amendment Act the express retrospective operation given to the Amendment Act with effect from May retrospectively effected vested rights of the <NAME> or Barkhalidars created by a grant or agree ment etc It is true that a limited retrospective effect was given to the Amendment Act as the State was formed and became operative from May the date on which the State was formed Accordingly it must be held that the retrospective operation cannot be faulted nor would it be declared ultra vires it is a law relating to acquisition of mines and minerals belonging to the appellants and others which had come into force from December and is not a law made under Article and and does not get the protection under Article Since it was given retrospective operation from May the compensation provided under sub section of Section A of the Code is void as compensation was not just equivalent to the property acquired or full indemnification to the owner of the mines and minerals expropriated While dealing with the first contention we have held that the Amendment Act is part of the scheme of agrarian reform envisaged under the Act falling within Entry and of List II State List and Entry of Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution SCR interpreted the word compensation in clause of Article as just equivalent or indemnification for the property expropriated which led to the Constitution th Amendment Act suitably amending Article that no law providing for compulsory acquisition or requisition shall be called in question in any court on the ground of compensation provided by that law is not adequate This had become the subject of consideration in Kesavanand Bharti State of Kerala SuppL SCR known as Fundamental Rights case Full Court of Judges per majority of Judges held after considering the validity of th Amendment Act that substituting the word amount for compensation in Article of the Constitution the quantum of amount if directly fixed by law or the principles for its quantification are matters for legislative judgment The Constitution nd Amendment Act had given primacy to law made to implement any or all directive principles and provided protective umbrella under Article and placed in Ninth Schedule enlarging its width that a law made to give effect to directive principles does not become void violating fundamental rights and shall not be questioned in a court of law SCR had upheld the dissenting view of <NAME> in <ORG> case and it was held that nationalisation of coal industries does not violate Article On January the Independence Day <ORG> affirmed in its pledge that the inalienable right of the people is to have freedom and to enjoy the fruits of their toil and have the necessities of life so that they may have full opportunity of growth The debates in <ORG> on the lines of Section of the Government of India Act and the resultant right to acquire and hold to the property in Article and deprivation and acquisi tion of the property under Article as fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution find their habitation like in every constitution of modern democracies Equally the debates in <ORG> and the unanimous animation of the founding fathers was that the tiller of the soil should be conferred with right to hold the property directly under the <ORG> and to abolish the estates elimination of the intermediaries and conferment of right title and interest in the land in the estate on the cultivator There was however division in opinion on payment of compensation to the deprived Zamindars etc Between these promises and the st Amendment there is a discernible nexus direct and immediate Indeed if there is one place in an agriculture dominated society like ours where citizens can hope to have equal justice it is on the strip of land which they till and love the land which assures to them dignity of their person by providing to them a near decent means of livelihood The mere fact that the resources are material will make no differences in the concept of the word resources The word distribution used hi Article must be broadly construed so that a court may give full and comprehensive effect to the statutory intent contained in Article There is no warrant for interpreting the expression in so narrow a fashion and to confine it to public owned material resources and exclude private owned material resources Even otherwise it would fall under Arts The Constitution th Amendment Act bringing the Amendment Act under th Schedule to the Constitution does not destroy the basic structure of the Constitution Even agreeing with the contention that after the Constitution Forty fourth Amendment Act which had come into force from June the right to property engrafted in Chapter IV Part namely Art A that the appellants are entitled to its protection whether Section A is unconstitutional The heading Right to Property with marginal note reads thus Art A Persons not to be deprived of property save by authority of law No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law which is restoration of Article of the Constitution each case must be decided as it arises on its own facts <NAME> as he then was held that Clauses and of Art dealt with the topic of eminent domain the expressions taken possession of or acquired according to Clause have the same meaning which the word deprived used in clause <NAME> held that the word taken possession of or acquired in Art Each case must depend on its own facts The word law used in Art A must be an Act of <ORG> or of <ORG> Legislature a rule or statutory order having force of law A but the obligation to pay compen sation to the deprived owner of his property was enjoined as an inherent incident of acquisition under law is equally untenable for the following reasons At it was further stated that the sovereign power vested in the <ORG> to take private property for the public use providing first a just compensation therefore The right of every government to appropriate otherwise than by taxation and its police authority private property for public use The ultimate right of sovereign power to appropriate not only the public property but the private property of all citizens within the territorial sovereignty to public purpose In Black Law Dictionary th edition at eminent domain is defined as the power to take private property for public use by the state municipalities and private persons or corporations authoritised to exercise functions of public character The Constitution gives the power to take for public purpose and prohibits the exercise of the power of eminent domain without just compensation to the owners of the property which is taken The right of eminent domain is the right of the sovereign <ORG> through its regular agencies to reasert either temporarily or permanently its dominion over any portion of the soil of the <ORG> including private property without its owner consent on account of public exigency and for the public good It gives the right to resume possession of the property in the manner directed by the Constitution and the laws of the <ORG> whenever the public interest requires it The other condition is that no property can be taken unless the law which authorises such appropriation contains a provision for payment of compensation in the mam ar as laid down in the clause The other condition is that no property can be taken unless the law which authorises such appropriation contains a provision for payment of compensation in the manner laid down in the clause <NAME> as he then was quoting from <NAME> cases on Constitutional Law stated that Shorn of all its incidents the simple definition of the power to acquire cornpulsorily or of the term eminent domain is the power of the sovereign to take property for public use without the owner consent Such power can be exercised only by authority of law and not by a mere executive fiat or order The question then is what is the meaning of the word property used in Art Every citizen shall strive towards excel lence in all spheres of individual and collective activity so that the nation constantly rises to higher levels of endeavour and achievement It is open to the charge made by socialists again and again that any form of property which gives man power over man is not an instrument of freedom but of servitude Property in legal sense means an aggregate of rights which are guaranteed and protected by law it extends to every species of valuable right and interest more particularly ownership and exclusive right to a thing the right to dispose of the thing in every legal way to possess it to use it and to exclude every one else from interfering with it Therefore the word property connotes everything which is subject of ownership corporeal or incorporeal tangible or intangible visible or invisible real or personal everything that has an exchangeable value or which goes to make up wealth or estate or status The term property has a most extensive signification and according to its legal definition consists in free use enjoyment and disposition by a person of all his acquisitions without any control or diminution save only by the laws of the land in <NAME> case this court gave extended meaning to the word property The word property used in Article A must be understood in the context in which the sovereign power of eminent domain is exercised by the <ORG> and Property expropriated Article A gets attracted to an acquisition or taking possession of private property by necessary implication for public purpose in accordance with the law made by the <ORG> or a <ORG> legislature a rule or a statutory order having force of law A only limits the powers of the <ORG> that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law In other words if there is no law there is no deprivation It is common knowledge that when the <ORG> exer cises its executive power to acquire private property it is under the land Acquisition Act or similar <ORG> laws In any democracy governed by rule of law Constitution is the supreme law of the land As pointed in <NAME> laws of England that when parliament has authorized the compulsory acquisition of land it is almost invariably provided for payment of a money compensation to the person deprived of his interest in it Concomitantly legislature has power to acquire the property of private person exercising the power of eminent domain by a law for public purpose The law may fix an amount or which may be determined in accordance with such principles as may be laid therein and given in such manner as may be specified in such law However when the <ORG> exercises its power of eminent domain and acquires the property of private person or deprives him of his property for public purpose concomitantly fixation of the amount or its determination be must in accordance with such principles as laid therein and the amount given in such manner as may be specified in such a law For acquisition of the property of a minority educational institution the measure is that the <ORG> shall ensure that the amount fixed or determined under such law would not restrict or abrogate the right guarantced by Art Equally when the land of a person within the ceiling limit and in his personal cultivation is acquired law shall provide for payment of compensation at a rate which shall not be less then the market value thereof this was brought by Constitution Seventh Amendment Act Crores it was held to be not illusory and the provisions is not confiscatory and that therefore it does not violate Art In <NAME> case this court held that the provision in of the Maharashtra Housing and Develop ment Act that in the absence of agreement the amount shall be equal to times the net average monthly income actually derived from such land during the period of five consecutive years immediately preceding the date of the publication of the notification referred to in as may be determined by the Land Acquisition Officer was held to be not violative of Art The further contention that money value of the rupee from three years preceding May till date has considerable been eroded and that therefore the fixation on the principle of net annual income of three years preceding the date of vesting namely st May is arbitrary and amount so determined is illusory is also devoid of substance It is next contended that the act and the related provisions provided different modes of compensation than the one provided in sub of Section A of the Code and that therefore it is discriminatory violating Art We find no substance in this contention It is seen that the principle bears just relation to the object of determining the amount or compensation payable to the owner and the principle of average of three years net annual income is a reasonable classification having relation to the object of modification of the existing rights and extinguishment thereof does not apply to the acquisition or deprivation of property under Article A giving effect to the directive principles are not concerned in these appeals of the effect of mining and mineral lease or leases granted by the appel lants to third parties since that question was neither canvassed in <ORG> nor any factual foundation laid before us The appeals are accordingly dismissed with quantified costs at Rs The State should take immediate action is this behali
