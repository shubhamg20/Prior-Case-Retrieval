Challenging the termination order the respondent filed a suit for declaration that the termination without enquiry and opportunity of being heard was violative of Rule A of the Madhya Pradesh Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules and that he became a permanent employee of the <ORG> with continuity of service and arrears of salary On behalf of the respondent it was contended that by operation of the resolution passed by the Municipal <ORG> under Section of the Central Provinces and Bearer Municipality Act the Municipal Officers and Servants was governed by recruitment rules thereunder that since no action was taken by the appellant <ORG> to dispense with the respondent service on the expiry of the period of two years as envisaged in Rule of the Municipal Officers and Servants Recruitment Rules the respondent must be deemed to have been confirmed and consequently the only power the <ORG> had was to terminate the respondent service in accordance with the classification Control and Appeal Rules after conducting an enquiry and giving him reasonable opportunity that too for misconduct but since no such procedure was adopted the notice was illegal and <ORG> was justified in granting the decree Servant General Conditions of Service Rules if the probationer is neither confirmed nor discharged from service at the end of the period of probation he should be deemed to have been continued in service as probationer subject to the condition of his service being terminated on the expiry of a notice of one calendar month given in writing by either side Therefore after the expiry of the period of probation and before its confirmation he would be deemed to have been continued in service as probationer Note to sub rule read with sub rule of Rule manifest she legislative intent that confirmation of the probation of the respondent would be made only on successful completion of the probation and the passing of the prescribed examinations Before confirmation the appointing authority is empowered to terminate the service of the probationer by issuing one calendar month notice in writing and on expiry thereof the service stands terminated without any further notice Hence the question of conducting an inquiry under the Classification Control and Appeal Rules after giving an opportunity and that too for specific charges does not arise The facts in this appeal would lie in a short compass the Appellant filed this appeal A resolution was passed making a draft bye law by <ORG> on November exercising the power under of the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Act and confirmed the same under of the said Act adopting Government Rules to regulate the conditions of service of officers and servants of <ORG> which provides thus The fundamental rules and the Civil Service regulations as amended from time to time in their applications to the Government Servants Conduct Rules as amended from time to time and the General Book Circulars of the Govt Rule of the Rules reads thus Probation A person appointed to a service or post by direct recruitment shall ordinarily be placed on probation for such period as may be prescribed The appointing authority may for sufficient reasons extend the period of probation by a further period not exceeding one year The appointing authority would be entitled to place a direct recruit on probation for a specified period and for sufficient reasons may extend the period of probation to a further period not exceeding one year Under the note to sub rule if the probationer is neither confirmed nor discharged from service at the end of the period of probation he shall be deemed to have been continued in service as probationer subject to the condition of his service being terminated on the expiry of a notice of one calender month given in writing by either side Therefore after the expiry of the period of probation and before its confirmation he would be deemed to have been continued in service as probationer By issue of notice of one calender month in writing by either side the tenure could be put to an end which was done in this case Thus in the above case there was no power to extend the probation in the rules beyond the specified period On those facts this Court held that since under those regulations appellant probationary period could not be extended beyond the maximum period of two years he stood confirmed on the expiry of maximum probationary period and there after he could not be reverted to lower post treating him on probation We are of the view that note to sub rule read with sub rule of Rule manifests the legislative intent that confirmation of the probation of the respondent would be made only on successful completion of the probation and the passing of the prescribed examinations In this view the question of conducting an inquiry under the Classification Control and Appeal Rules after giving an opportunity and that too for specific charges does not arise By an interim order passed by this court the respondent received a sum of Rs The judgment and decree of <ORG> is set aside and that of <ORG> and <ORG> are confirmed But in the circumstances parties are directed to bear their own costs
