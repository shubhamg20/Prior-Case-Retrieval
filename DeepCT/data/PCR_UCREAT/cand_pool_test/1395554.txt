The two issues before <ORG> were whether the employees had been wrongly dismissed and what wages and allowances would the employees be entitled to on reinstatement Even so it directed the <ORG> to make certain payments to the employees on compassionate grounds <ORG> held that even though the strikes were illegal under read with of the Industrial Disputes Act the <ORG> had by entering into the agreement with <ORG> waived its right to take penal action against the employees for joining the illegal strikes and that therefore an enquiry should be held on additional evidence to decide the disputes on merits Against this interlocutory order the <ORG> appealed to this <ORG> and it was held by this <ORG> that while the strikes were no doubt illegal under of the Act the orders of dismissal passed by the <ORG> were no less so under of the Act and it dismissed the appeal Preliminary objections were raised on behalf of the said employees that in view of the decision of this <ORG> dismissing the <ORG> appeal against the said interlocutory order the subsequent inquiry by the <ORG> and the orders of dismissal must be held to be void and no charges having been admittedly framed nor any proper enquiry held by the <ORG> against the employees the orders of dismissal were wholly invalid It was urged inter alia on behalf of the <ORG> in the appeals that participation in a pen down strike by itself amounted to misconduct sufficient to disentitle an employee to reinstatement and that the entire body of strikers being collectively responsible for the publication of the subversive documents in question the dismissed employees could by no means escape liability Held per curiam that the preliminary objections must be negatived and the decision of the Appellate <ORG> affirmed with this modification that in view of its inconsistent findings the appeal of one of the employees must be allowed The purpose the <ORG> had in view in enacting of the Industrial Disputes Act was to maintain the status quo by placing a ban on any action by the employer pending adjudication Where a proper enquiry had been held and no victimisation or unfair labour practice had been resorted to the <ORG> in granting permission had only to satisfy itself that there was a Prima facie case against the employee and not to consider the propriety or adequacy of the proposed action There was substantial difference between non compliance with of the Act and that with Art Even if such contravention was proved the employer could still justify the impugned dismissal on merits and there was no difference in this regard between a reference under of the Act and a dispute raised under A of the Act Although there can be no doubt that in proper cases <ORG> has the power to direct reinstatement in disputes arising out of dismissal of employees it is not possible to Jay down any hard and fast rule to be applied to such cases If no enquiry is held by the employer before it passes an order of dismissal the propriety of such dismissal can be adjudged by the <ORG> on evidence and no employer can be allowed to object to it on the ground that it interferes with the exercise of its managerial function <NAME> On July this dispute was referred by <ORG> for adjudication to the industrial tribunal of which Mr <NAME> a retired Judge of <ORG> was the sole member In order to appreciate the points raised for our decision in these appeals it is necessary to indicate briefly at the outset the salient points of controversy between the parties the findings made by the original tribunal the conclusions reached by <ORG> in its interlocutory and final judgments and the decision of this <ORG> in the appeal which had been brought before it by the <ORG> against the interlocutory judgment of <ORG> It was then sent to him by registered post and on April he was suspended On April the <ORG> issued notices calling upon all striking members of the staff to report for duty by a on April and it warned them that if they did not comply with the notice it would be taken that they had voluntarily ceased to be its employees and their services would be deemed to have terminated from that date An option was however given to the strikers who were still willing to rejoin duty to apply in that behalf and explain their action in staying away It is common ground that the employees represented by the <ORG> who had taken part in the strike were dismissed by the <ORG> for absence due to the strike The other banks in the region took back their employees who rejoined on May but the <ORG> refused to take back its employees on the ground that they had not offered to rejoin on or before the date fixed and so it proceeded to dismiss them This conference led to an agreement as a result of which the <ORG> undertook to reinstate all its employees who had taken part in the strikes except those to whose reinstatement it had positive objections This however was subject to the reservation that the number of such employees was not to exceed and that their case would be referred by <ORG> for adjudication by a tribunal The tribunal gave two interim awards by which it directed the <ORG> to make some payments to the employees by way of allowance pending the final disposal of the dispute It held that the strikes were illegal and that the <ORG> was entitled to dismiss the employees solely on the ground that the said employees had participated in an illegal strike It decided the dispute on the sole ground that the strikes were illegal and participation in illegal strikes justified the dismissal of the employees Even so the tribunal made an order directing the <ORG> to pay certain amounts to the said employees on compassionate grounds It was urged by the <ORG> before the appellate tribunal as a preliminary objection that the appeals preferred by the employees were incompetent The appellate tribunal then proceeded to consider two questions of law whether an employer has the right to dismiss a workman for his absence from duty by reason of his mere participation in an illegal strike and if he has can the tribunal scrutinise the exercise of that right and grant relief to such a workman when it comes to the conclusion that the right has been exercised capriciously or by unfair labour practice It appears that on February an industrial dispute between the <ORG> and the <ORG> had been referred to the arbitration of Mr <NAME> and whilst the proceedings in the said reference were pending before the tribunal the strike was commenced on or about April According to the appellate tribunal such waiver or relinquishment can be inferred from conduct and it thought that the conduct of the <ORG> evidenced by the agreement which it reached with <ORG> on or about May unambi guously proved that it had waived or relinquished its rights to take any penal action against its employees merely for their participation in the illegal strike The appellate tribunal also considered the general question of law as to whether participation in an illegal strike can be said to deserve dismissal of the striking workmen It took the view that an illegal strike absolves the liability of the employer to pay to its employees wages during the period of absence of the striking workmen but that it cannot be stated as a general proposition that participation in an illegal strike would by itself necessarily involve the penalty of dismissal There is abundant authority observed the appellate tribunal for the proposition that an employer can justify before the tribunal a dismissal only on the ground on which he purported to dismiss him and not a ground different from it That is why the <ORG> was allowed to lead evidence only in respect of item and some heads mentioned in item In the result opportunity was given to the parties to lead evidence on the following points victimisation past service records of the employees conduct of those employees or any of them during the strike confined to acts of violence intimidating loyal workers and acts subversive of the credit of the <ORG> employment which any of those persons got after this dismissal the period during which they were in employment and the wages or emoluments they received On behalf of the <ORG> it was urged that the conclusion of the appellate tribunal that the <ORG> had condoned the illegal strike by its workmen was unjustified and that it was open to the <ORG> to rely upon the illegal strike as justifying the dismissal of the said workmen The case of the <ORG> thus was that the order passed by the appellate tribunal setting down the dispute for further enquiry was illegal and should be set aside The judgment of this Court delivered by <NAME> shows that this Court thought it unnecessary to express any opinion on the question of condonation or waiver of the illegal strike because in its opinion even if there was no such condonation or waiver and even if it was open to the <ORG> to rely upon the illegal strike as a valid ground for dismissing its employees there was no doubt that the order of dismissal was illegal having regard to the provisions of of the Act In the result the appeal preferred by the <ORG> was dismissed and it was held that there was no substance in the plea of the <ORG> that the appellate tribunal had no jurisdiction to direct reinstatement of the employees It considered the evidence led by the parties in regard to the character of the strike and it held that the definite instruction issued to the employees was to continue occupation of their seats till the police intervened and threatened to arrest and so it was not prepared to accept the employees case that the pen down strikers vacated their seats on the mere asking by the management According to the finding the persons who took part in the pen down strike not only ceased to work but continued to occupy their seats It was also urged by the <ORG> that during the course of the strike posters and circulars were issued which were clearly subversive of the credit of the <ORG> and it was contended that employees who were guilty of issuing such posters and circulars did not deserve reinstatement the findings recorded by the appellate tribunal in two places of its decision are somewhat inconsistent but the operative portion of the decision shows that the appellate tribunal was inclined to hold that Ex On this finding a question which arose before the appellate tribunal was Who should be held responsible for the offending documents The appellate tribunal was not prepared to hold all the employees responsible for them In this connection it considered the statement made by <NAME> in this evidence and it field that since <NAME> had admitted that he consulted specified persons in preparing Exs The appellate tribunal the considered the voluminous evidence led by the parties in respect of each one of the employees and it held that in regard to the employees no case had been made out by the <ORG> for refusing them reinstatement It appeared to the appellate tribunal that some of the statements made by the witnesses of the <ORG> showed that their affidavits had been prepared by the <ORG> lawyers and they simply put their signatures thereon and affirmed them before the oath commissioner Indeed the appellate tribunal apparently thought that there was some force in the contention raised by the employees that some of the documents produced by the <ORG> had been manufactured or tampered with long after the strike was over It has noticed the argument urged by the <ORG> that even if it was so the <ORG> cannot be condemned for the act or acts of its branch managers in that behalf In regard to the first two appeals preferred by the <ORG> special leave was granted to the <ORG> on February limited to grounds and set out in paragraph of its petitions Almost a month and a half after limited leave was thus granted to the <ORG> the <ORG> filed its petition for special leave on April and it applied for condonation of delay made in presenting the petition Broadly stated these are the relevant facts which give rise to the three present appeals Before dealing with the merits of these appeals we must consider two preliminary objections raised by the learned Attorney General on behalf of the employees We would accordingly deal with these contentions at some length This <ORG> has held that the dismissal of the employees is illegal having regard to the provisions of of the Act if the dismissal is illegal it is void and inoperative and as such it cannot be said to have terminated the relationship of master and servant between the <ORG> and its employees In support of this argument reliance has been placed on the decision of <ORG> in the case of The High Commissioner for India and High Commissioner for Pakistan and <NAME> This decision holds that the order of dismissal passed against a person who is a member of <ORG> in India without complying with the mandatory relevant provisions of of the Government of India Act is void and inoperative and that the Civil Servant against whom such an order is passed is entitled to a declaration that he remained a member of <ORG> at the date of the institution of the suit in which he challenged the validity of the impugned order It is in the light of these decisions that the learned Attorney General asks us to hold that the relationship between the <ORG> and its employees remains wholly unaffected by the orders of dismissal passed by the <ORG> against them and so as soon as the orders are held to be void nothing more remains to be done but to make a declaration about the the continuance of the relationship of master and servant between the parties and to direct reinstatement Thus presented the argument no doubt appears prima facie to be attractive but in our opinion a careful examination of the relevant sections of the Act shows that it is not valid The object of the <ORG> in enacting this section is obvious insists upon the maintenance of the status quo pending the disposal of the industrial dispute between the parties nevertheless it recognises that occasions may arise when the employer may be justified in discharging or punishing by dismissal his employees and so it allows the employer to take such action subject to the condition that before doing so he must obtain the express permission in writing of the tribunal It is true that the ban is imposed in terms which are mandatory and makes the contravention of the provisions of an offence punishable as prescribed therein But the question which calls for our decision is What is the effect of such contravention on the decision of the industrial dispute arising from it Where an application is made by the employer for the requisite permission under the jurisdiction of the tribunal in dealing with such an application is limited It has merely to consider the prima facie aspect of the matter and either grant the permission or refuse it according as it holds that a prima facie case is or is not made out by the employer But it is significant that even if the requisite permission is granted to the employer under that would not be the end of the matter The enquiry to be conducted by the Regional Conciliation Officer under the said clause observed <NAME> was not an enquiry into an industrial dispute as to the non employment of workmen who was sought to be discharged or dismissed which industrial dispute would only arise after an employer his agent or manager discharged or dismissed the workman in accordance with the written permission obtained from the officer concerned This section does not confer any power on the tribunal to adjudicate upon any other dispute or to impose conditions as a prerequisite for granting the permission asked for by the employer It would and should interfere when there is want of good faith when there is victimisation or unfair labour practice when the management has been guilty of a basic error or violation of the principle of natural justice or when on the materials the finding of the management is completely baseless or perverse There is another principle which has to be borne in mind when the tribunal deals with an industrial dispute arising from the dismissal of an employee In <ORG> it has been held by this Court that in dealing with the merits of the dismissal of an employee the employer would be confined to the charge sheet given by him to his employee when an enquiry was held into his conduct It therefore follows that where a proper enquiry has been held by the employer and findings are recorded against the employee that the principles laid down by this Court in the case of <ORG> would be applicable and in applying the said principles the employer would be confined to the grounds set out by him in his charge sheet against the employee That is why A was enacted for making a special provision for adjudication as to whether has been contravened It was urged before this Court that in holding an enquiry under A the tribunal duty was only to find out whether there had been a contravention of and if it found that there was Such a contravention to make a declaration to that effect If yes is the order passed by the employer against the employee justified on the merits Thus there can be no doubt that in an enquiry under A the employee would not succeed in obtaining an order of reinstatement merely by proving contravention of by the employer In the present case the impugned orders of dismissal have given rise to an industrial dispute which has been referred to the tribunal by the appropriate <ORG> under In this connection it would be relevant to remember that in dealing with industrial disputes arising out of dismissal of employees the tribunal undoubtedly has jurisdiction to direct reinstatement in proper cases all its aspects and rejected the argument of the employer that to invest the tribunal with jurisdiction to order re employment amounts to giving it authority to make a contract between two persons when one of them is unwilling to enter into a contract of employment at all This argument observed <NAME> as he then was overlooks the fact that when dispute arises about the employment of a person at the instance of a trade union or a trade union objects to the employment of a certain person the definition of industrial dispute would cover both those cases Each case must be considered on its own merits and in reaching the final decision an attempt must be made to reconcile the conflicting claims made by the employee and the employer No such considerations can be relevant in cases where in civil courts the validity of dismissals is challenged on the ground of non compliance with of the Government of India Act or Art There is one more point which still remains to be considered and that is the effect of the <ORG> default it not holding an enquiry in the present case But it follows that if no enquiry has in fact been held by the employer the issue about the merits of the impugned order of dismissal is at large before the tribunal and on the evidence adduced before it the tribunal has to decide for itself whether the misconduct alleged is roved and if yes what would be proper order to make In that case the order of reinstatement passed by the tribunal was reversed in appeal by the appellate tribunal which observed that in dealing with cases of dismissal where the management had acted bona fide and with knowledge and experience of the problems which confronted in the daily work of the concern it should be considered to be well qualified to judge what sentence would be appropriate and the sentence imposed by the management should normally stand subject to the qualification that it must not be unduly severe It is obvious that in that case the management had held a proper enquiry and the question which arose for decision was what are the limits of the jurisdiction of the tribunal in dealing with an industrial dispute arising from an order of dismissal passed by an employer after holding a proper enquiry Let us now deal with the two appeals filed by the <ORG> Civil Appeals Nos and of We have already indicated that in dealing with these appeals we have to bear in mind the limitations imposed by the nature of the limited leave granted to the <ORG> it is only the grounds specifically covered by the leave which fall to be considered and even these grounds will necessarily have to be dealt with in the light of the findings already recorded by the appellate tribunal which are no longer open to challenge Considered in the light of these limitations the grounds on which leave has been granted to the <ORG> must first be examined A bare perusal of the said grounds would show that some of them are vague and they are urged on assumptions of fact which run counter to the findings recorded by the appellate tribunal That is why when those appeals were urged before us Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> have recast their contentions within the frame work of the grounds in respect of which leave has been granted and have urged the following points before us that participation in a pen down strike is itself an activity of such a subversive character that it disqualifies the employees who took part in it from claiming the relief of reinstatement that the publication and circulation of subversive documents was the result of a concerted plan and represent a collective activity of all the strikers and as such all the employees before us should be held responsible for it and on this ground reinstatement should be refused to them that the finding recorded by the appellate tribunal that only persons were directly and actively concerned with the preparation and publication of the subversive documents is opposed to the weight of evidence and is perverse that the appellate tribunal erred in law in not taking into account the fact that after the employees were dismissed the <ORG> has engaged fresh hands and the order of reinstatement would therefore be unjust and unfair and that the appellate tribunal was also in error in not taking into account the fact that some of the employees have in the meanwhile taken employment elsewhere Before dealing with these contentions we would like to make one general observation As we have already emphasized whether or not reinstatement should be ordered in cases of wrongful or illegal dismissals is normally a question of fact and in deciding it several relevant factors have to be borne in mind unless it is shown that the order suffers from an error which raises a general or substantial question of law The finding of the tribunal on this point is that the persons who took part in the pen down strike not only ceased to work but continued to occupy their seats There has been some argument before us as to the number of persons who actually took part in this kind of pen down strike On the other hand the learned Attorney General has contended that on the findings recorded by the appellate tribunal not more than persons can be said to have taken part in it In support of its case the <ORG> has relied on the proposition that even if a person has a right of entry on the land of another for a specific purpose he commits a trespass if he enters for any other purpose or under any other claim or title apart from that under which he might lawfully enter But this proposition is subject to the exception that if a person enters for a lawful purpose he is not a trespasser unless the case is one to which the doctrine of trespass ab initio applies of the Indian Penal Code That is the next point which calls for decision It would be noticed that there are two essential ingredients which must be established before criminal trespass can be proved against the employees The distinction between knowledge and intention is quite clear and that distinction must be borne in mind in deciding whether or not in the present case the strikers were actuated by the requisite intention It had also taken the view that it had jurisdiction to direct reinstatement of the said employees under of the said act with a view to effectuate the policies of the Act Mr Justice <NAME> who delivered a dissenting judgment thought that both labour and management had erred grievously in their respective conduct and so it would not be unreasonable to restore both to their former status In considering the question as to whether the principle underlying the majority decision should be applied to a pen down strike in India it is necessary to remember that the pen down strike properly so called is recognised as a strike under of the Act and so it would not be safe to extend the principles of American decisions bearing on this question without a careful scrutiny of the relevant provisions of the American statute and the facts on which the said decisions are based In this connection we may point out that according to <NAME> the <NAME> decision marks what is hoped to be an end of an unfortunate chapter in the history of American labor activity he has added that there is danger however in viewing the sitdown strike solely as the reflection of lawless labour leadership by injunction between employers and employees in cases growing out of a dispute concerning terms or conditions of employment was challenged and the challenge was upheld by a majority of the learned judges who took the view that the said provision was contrary to the th Amendment of the Constitution It is urged on behalf of the <ORG> that it is really unnecessary to examine which particular employee was directly associated with the preparation and circulation of the subversive circular or posters It is really an argument based on the theory of conspiracy which makes all conspirators liable for the act of any one of them It is the acts of individual strikers who have been dismissed that have given rise to the dispute and the enquiry must be confined to that dispute alone The learned Attorney General seriously asked us to bear in mind that the application of the doctrine of conspiracy to the decision of the present dispute may have far reaching consequences on the future of the trade union movement itself and he suggested that since the <ORG> and its activities were not the subject matter of the present enquiry we need not consider the argument of conspiracy at all In this connection he also referred us to ss and of the Indian Trade <ORG>s Act of There is no doubt that the three posters Exs It was in the light of these admissions that the appellate tribunal came to the conclusion that persons named by him can be safely taken to have been actively associated with the drafting and the publication of the subversive documents In this connection he has relied on the affidavit filed by <NAME> on behalf of the <ORG> We are satisfied that the <ORG> is not justified in contending that in excluding employees from the responsibility of direct participation in the drafting and publication of the subversive circulars and hand bills the appellate tribunal has ignored any important evidence It does appear that <NAME> admitted that he had taken part in the drafting of documents and but none of these documents has been found to be subversive and so it is idle to contend that <NAME> connection with any of the three subversive documents is established So there is no substance in the argument that <NAME> case should be reconsidered This document is the report made by <NAME> on April in which the incidents that took place on April and have been set out and the names of persons who took prominent part in the said incidents have been enumerated Further he also admitted that during the course of his visit and stay at the <ORG> when the strike was going on he only knew three persons who took part in the activity which was described by <NAME> in his reports Thus the evidence of <NAME> does not show that he clearly knew any of the five employees and the same comment obviously falls to be made about <NAME> himself who made the report Besides if the <ORG> has failed to establish its specific case against any of the employees there is no reason why the normal rule should not prevail and the employees should not get the relief of reinstatement Mr <NAME> no doubt raised three additional subsidiary points in Civil Appeal No of in which he appeared but as we have pointed out there is no substance in any one of them In Civil Appeal No of in which Mr <NAME> appeared for the <ORG> he did not challenge the findings recorded by the appellate tribunal in respect of the employees concerned in the said appeal That takes us to Civil Appeal No of filed by the employees In addition to the two preliminary objections which we have already considered the learned Attorney General raised two general points for the appellant
