On the other hand there was before that date an unregistered Marwari <ORG> of Commerce of which both the petitioners and the respondents were members The learned Judge took the view that the bye laws of the old <ORG> amounted to a compulsory provision for arbitration Next as regards the rules of the present <ORG> they provide in Article of the Articles of Association It shall be compulsory for every Member or Associate Member in the first instance to hove all disputes arising out of or in course of all dealings and transactions in seeds wheat and hundi chitties between himself and any other Member or Associate Member and optional in the case of disputes in gold silver cotton cloth etc settled by or before the <ORG> or such person or persons as may be nominated by the <ORG> to act as arbitrators or umpires and subject to any special rules as may be prescribed in that behalf from time to time by arbitration and without recourse to a Court of law Now under the Articles of <ORG> it is clear from Article that there are two kinds of members of this <ORG> called Members and Associate Members Accordingly the argument advanced to us by the petitioners is that the disputes to be determined by the new company are only those arising out of transactions between members or associate members of the new company and therefore cannot include transactions which took place previously to the registration of the company between then non members It follows then that in my judgment the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to hear this particular dispute The real difficulty before us is as to whether we have any proper award before us within the meaning of the Indian Arbitration Act and that even if we have a document which purports to be an award then whether we have power to set it aside under Section of the Act seeing that it has never been filed in accordance with the provisions of the Act and our <ORG> rules see Rule Now taking the first point no doubt the letter of <ORG> dated April Ex Then at the request of any party to the submission and upon payment of the fees and charges due in respect of it the arbitrators should cause the award to be filed and notice of it given to the parties But we have nothing to show that those persons ever signed the award The actual award itself is not before us And we have no evidence as to whether the arbitrators gave notice of the amount of their fees and charges That being so in our judgment it is not proved that there is an award within the meaning of Section of the Act Consequently if there is no award there is nothing which we can set aside The next question is what under those circumstances is the proper order for us to make In our judgment it would be misleading to dismiss the appeal or for the matter of that to dismiss the petition without more In doing that I am following a course which has to my knowledge been frequently adopted by <ORG> in appropriate cases Accordingly the order I would propose would be to this effect that the appeal be allowed the decree of the lower <ORG> set aside and that this appellate <ORG> being of opinion that on the true construction of the Articles of Association of the Marwari <ORG> of Commerce Ltd and in the events which have happened the <ORG> of the said <ORG> had no jurisdiction to hear and determine the alleged dispute referred to in the letter from the <ORG> dated April Ex Then after my learned brother has delivered his judgment and after we have heard counsel on the question of costs the order can be completed I desire to add a word only upon one submission that was made by Mr <NAME> He contended that even if Article ought to be construed in the way indicated by the learned Chief Justice and I may say I am in entire agreement with that construction yet nevertheless there was a waiver by the petitioners of their right to contend that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to enter upon and determine the disputes in question Mr <NAME> referred us to of the appeal paper book from which it appears that the petitioners had asked for an adjournment and requested the <ORG> to fix a meeting after April to enable the petitioners to bring their solicitors <NAME> was asked by some of the respondents with the permission of the President of the <ORG> what the petitioners solicitors had to say in the matter having regard to the fact that the hundies were drawn by the petitioners on themselves and had become due It seems to me that if arbitrators enter upon the consideration of a matter when they have no jurisdiction to do so by the arbitration clause or submission between the parties then they cannot be given jurisdiction under that submission by a mere appearance of the parties before them at a preliminary meeting followed by a protest against their jurisdiction before they have entered upon a consideration of the matters upon which they subsequently purport to make an award In cases where an arbitrator enters into the consideration of matters which are not referred to him or which he has no jurisdiction to try <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> said that The question is not one of waiver or of estoppel but of authority and a party continuing to attend the reference after objection taken and protest made does not give the arbitrator authority to make an award Even if a party under protest continues to attend before arbitrators and cross examines witnesses he does not thereby waive his objection nor is he estopped from saying that the arbitrators have exceeded their authority by awarding on the matter In arbitrations where a protest is made against jurisdiction the party protesting is not bound to retire he may go through the whole case subject to the protest he has made In my judgment it is clear that if a party to a submission appears before an arbitrator and merely takes part in a preliminary discussion he doss not thereby waive his right to object to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator before the arbitrator actually enters upon the consideration of the matters upon which he makes his award The learned Chief Justice reminds me that although there is an allegation in para of the petition that a large number of the <ORG> had an adverse interest to that of the petitioners that point has not been persisted in before us and therefore we feel it unnecessary to say anything in regard to that part of the petition <NAME> Kt On the peculiar facts of this particular case we think that the proper order to make is that each party do bear his own costs of this appeal and also in the <ORG> below
