The Commissioner of Income tax submitted that this question should be answered in the affirmative In they formed <ORG> and also registered in Pudukottai a company called <ORG> both of which have their registered offices at Pudukottai The business carried on by the <NAME> and his sons were wound up and all the assets and liabilities transferred to the three companies There is no doubt that the two companies are controlled by the same people As Lord <NAME> said many years ago in <NAME> Attorney General as I understand the principle of all fiscal legislation it is this If the person sought to be taxed comes within the letter of the law he must be taxed however great the hardship may appear to the judicial mind to be On the other hand if the <ORG> seeking to recover the tax cannot bring the subject within the letter of the law the subject is free however apparently within the spirit of the law the case might otherwise appear to be The fact that the transactions were negotiated through the branches of the banks does not affect this question the branches were not separate entities but were parts of the two respective banks and it is obvious that the business so transacted by the two branches was the business of the two banks It was argued on behalf of the appellant bank that in order to bring the case within the section it must be shown by the income tax authorities that <ORG> non resident in British India had a business connection in British India in relation to the actual transactions in question that a business connection arises out of business transactions and that the transactions in this case namely the above mentioned loans were made not in British India but in the Malay States and were to be repaid in the Malay States in the Malay States currency In the case of any person residing out of British India all profits or gains accruing or arising to such person whether directly or indirectly through or from any business connection or property in British India shall be deemed to be income accruing or arising within British India and shall be chargeable to income tax in the name of the agent of any such person and such agent shall be deemed tot be for all the purposes of this Act the assesses in respect of such income tax There remains the question whether the Income tax Commissioner was correct in treating <ORG> as the agent of <ORG> within the meaning of Section of the Act In view of the above mentioned conclusions it is clear that the Income tax Officer was acting within the power conferred upon him by Section in treating <ORG> as the agent of <ORG> for the purposes of the Act The headnote of that case is as follows A company incorporated in the A and hereinafter called the American company carried on business in New York and there manufactured and sold typewriter machines It was held that there was a business connection within the meaning of Section and Section Sub section of the Indian Income tax Act between the American company and each of the Indian companies and consequently under Section the respondent company could be deemed for the purposes of the Act to be the agent of the American company and as its agent could be charged to tax under Section Sub section in respect of profits made by the American company upon machines exported to British India It was stated in the judgment that that the business connection existed only in respect of actual business which was transacted by the branches of the two banks outside British India the above cited case should have been decided the other way in so far as it related to the matter now under consideration
