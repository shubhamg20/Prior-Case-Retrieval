Both matters can be considered and disposed of by common order because the issue involved in both the matters is common The Petitioner has approached this court feeling aggrieved by the orders passed by the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate Aurangabad <ORG> for short on in Criminal A Nos and of The applications are rejected by learned <ORG> with common line of reasons and we quote the observations Therefore by this application Petitioner has prayed for assistance in taking possession of secured assets On perusal of judgment cited it is seen that there was decree passed by in favour of said Petitioner who had prayed for such assistance in taking possession of secured assets by filing application before Admittedly in our case nowhere Petitioner has come with the case that he has obtained decree in his favour from competent court and in execution of same he is in need of assistance of this criminal Court Because of the writ petitions filed by the petitioner we are required to consider the issue Whether a creditor requesting assistance under Section of the NPA Act is required to be armed with a decree for recovery of dues from the borrower from competent court or Bom was placed before the learned <ORG> and reading the facts from that judgment the learned <ORG> has taken a view that in the reported matter there was a decree passed by <ORG> in favour of the creditor therein respondent in that writ petition and because the present writ petitioner who is creditor and seeking assistance from the <ORG> for taking possession of secured assets as under Section a of the NPA Act is not armed with a decree against the borrower from the competent court or <ORG> the learned <ORG> felt that the present petitioner is not entitled to assistance of the <ORG> for taking possession of the secured assets The bank and financial institution shall also consider before approaching <ORG> for an order under Section of the NPA act whether Section of the NPA Act excludes the application of Sections and thereof to the case on hand There is no adjudication of any kind at that stage While the banking industry in India is progressively complying with the international prudential norms and accounting practices there are certain areas which the banking and financial sector do not have a level playing field as compared to other participants in the financial markets in the world There is no legal provision for facilitating securitisation of financial assets of banks and financial institutions Further unlike international banks the banks and financial institutions in India do not have power to take possession of securities and sell them The provisions of the Ordinance would enable banks and financial institutions to realise long term assets manage problem of liquidity asset liability mismataches and improve recovery by exercising powers to take possession of securities sell them and reduce non performing assets by adopting measures for recovery or reconstruction Notwithstanding anything contained in Section or Section A of the Transfer of Property Act any security interest created in favour of any secured creditor may be enforced without the intervention of the <ORG> or tribunal by such creditor in accordance with the provisions of this Act Again we may refer to some part of text of Sub section of Section and the opening part reads In case the borrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the period specified in Sub section the secured creditor may take recourse to one or more of the following measures to recover his secured debt namely a take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale for realising the secured asset take over the management of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease assignment or sale and realise the secured asset appoint any person hereinafter referred to as the manager to manage the secured assets the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor require at any time by notice in writing any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom any money is due or may become due to the borrower to pay the secured creditor so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt Sub section of Section reads The rights of a secured creditor under this Act may be exercised by one or more of his officers authorised in this behalf in such manner as may be prescribed On going through the entire Section of the NPA Act it is clear that it makes no reference to any judicial forum which the secured creditor is required to approach before taking steps as permitted by Sub section By virtue of insertion of amended Sub section A the secured creditor is also required to communicate reasons to the borrower as to why representation of the borrower is not acceptable to the creditor We must therefore say that the learned CJM Aurangabad was completely on wrong foot in observing that the assistance cannot be sought unless there is a decree in favour the secured creditor Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or District Magistrate to assist secured creditor in taking possession of secured asset Where the possession of any secured asset is required to be taken by the secured creditor or if any of the secured asset is required to be sold or transferred by the secured creditor under the provisions of this Act the secured creditor may for the purpose of taking possession or control of any such secured asset request in writing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate within whose jurisdiction any such secured asset Later half of Sub section states that the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate CMM or the District Magistrate DM on such request being made may take possession of such assets and documents relating thereto and forward such assets and documents to the secured creditor Even Section which can be availed of by a secured creditor for the purpose of taking possession of secured assets under the provisions of this Act which is referable to Section does not speak regarding requirement of any decree of a competent court in favour of the secured creditor We have drawn attention of learned Counsel for the petitioner to the titles of the authorities referred to in Section The terminal portion of Section reads the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate within whose jurisdiction any such secured asset or other documents relating thereto may be situated or found to take possession thereof and the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or as the case may be the District Magistrate shall on such request being made to him take possession There is no reference to Chief Judicial Magistrate We have therefore posed a question to Advocate <NAME> for the Petitioner that Section indicates assistance from <ORG> and <ORG> within whose territorial limits the secured assets or documents relating thereto are situated at the time secured creditor desires taking possession of the secured assets There is no reference to the CJM We have therefore expressed that it would be the <ORG> so far as metropolitan area is concerned and where there is a <ORG> appointed and posted which will compel us to accept his proposition that although words used in the section are CMM DM sofar as area beyond metropolitan area is concerned the words CMM can be read as CJM the Magistrates in the metropolitan area which was then called as Presidency Town were designated as Presidency Magistrate Chief Presidency Magistrate and were so referred in the enactments which were passed before coming into force the Code of Criminal Procedure We have arrived at a conclusion that sofar as non metropolitan area is concerned powers vest in <ORG> and not with <ORG> or Judicial Magistrate While upholding the order passed by the <ORG> Aurangabad we have recorded our views on merits and we only record that the <ORG> could not have rejected assistance to the petitioner if he <ORG> otherwise had jurisdiction to entertain such a request on the ground that the secured creditor is required to be armed with a decree from the competent court What is required to be done by <ORG> or <ORG> while considering the request of secured creditor for assistance to take possession of secured assets is evident from the conclusions at serial Nos to drawn by <ORG> at Bombay in the matter of Trade Well supra and which we have already reproduced in earlier part of this judgment We therefore dispose of the writ petitions by confirming refusal by <ORG> Aurangabad of assistance under Section not because the petitioner creditor was not armed with a decree of a competent court but because the <ORG> does not have power to render such assistance We clarify that it will be open for the petitioner to approach the <ORG> and refusal of assistance under Section of the Securitization Act by <ORG> Aurangabad will not be an impediment in <ORG> providing such assistance to the petitioner secured creditor upon demonstration by the secured creditor of fulfilment of requirement as under Section and A of the Act Writ Petitions are disposed of and rule made absolute in above terms
