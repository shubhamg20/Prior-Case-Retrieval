At that time there was a full moon and the light of a gas lamp and several lanterns Though <ORG> held that the omissions amounted to contradictions and that the <NAME> judge had wrongly dis allowed cross examination with respect thereto it found that even after ignoring these two circumstances there were other facts which showed that the culprits had come close to the eye witnesses and that they had unmistaken opportunity of identifying the appellants in the light of the full moon and the lanterns <ORG> accordingly dismissed the application for summoning the eye witnesses holding that no prejudice had been caused to the appellants by the disallowance of the cross examination in respect of omissions and also dismissed the appeals and confirmed the convictions and sentences of the appellants A statement to the police could be used under of the Code only for the purpose of contradicting a statement in the witness box under the second part of Evidence Act but it could not be used for the purpose of cross examining the witness under the first part of A statement made to the police but not reduced to writing could not be used for any purpose not even for contradiction It was incorrect to say that all omissions in regard to important features of the incident which were expected to be included in the statement made before the police should be treated as contradictions In the circumstances of the present case even if the defence had been allowed to put questions concerning the omissions it would not have affected the credibility of the witnesses and no prejudice was caused to appellants by the disallowance of the questions Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> in Criminal Appeal No of and Referred Trial No of arising out of the judgment and order dated September of <ORG> at Etawah in Sessions Trial Nos and of was delivered by <NAME> SUBBA RAO This appeal by special leave raises the question of construction of Code of Criminal Procedure The prosecution case is that a large number of persons armed with fire arms suddenly appeared near a well situated on the southern side of the house of <NAME> and opened fire which resulted in the death of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and injuries to six persons namely <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The topography of the locality where the incident took place is given in the two site plans Ex The prosecution version of the sequence of events that took place on that fatal night is as follows After the dinner there was a music performance in front of the platform of <NAME> house and a number of persons assembled there to hear the music Did you state to the investigating officer about the presence of the gas lantern In regard to the first question the learned Sessions Judge made the following note The cross examining Counsel was asked to show the law which entitles him to put this question The relevant part of the order reads Therefore if there is no contradiction between his evidence in <ORG> and his recorded statement in the diary the latter cannot be used at all But if he had not stated under section anything about the fact there is no conflict and the statement cannot be used to contradict him The two appeals were heard along with the reference made by the learned Sessions Judge under of the Code of Criminal Procedure for the confirmation of the sentence of death awarded to the appellants Before <ORG> a petition was filed by the appellants alleging that the learned Sessions Judge did not allow the Counsel for defence to put omissions amounting to material contradictions to the eye witnesses and therefore the said eye witnesses should be summoned so that the said questions might be put to them That petition was filed on May and on July after the argument in the appeals was closed the petition was dismissed Presumably no attempt was made to press this application either before the appeals were taken up for argument or during the course of the argument but the question raised in the petition was considered by the earned Judges of <ORG> in their judgment The present appeal is by special leave filed against the judgment of <ORG> Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure by its own operation attracts the provisions of of the Evidence Act and under the latter section the whole vista of cross examination on the basis of the previous statement in writing made by the witnesses before the police is open to the accused to illustrate the contention a witness can be asked whether he made a particular statement before the police officers if he says yes the said assertion can be contradicted by putting to him an earlier statement which does not contain such a statement The word contradiction is of such wide connotation that it takes in all material omissions and a Court can decide whether there is one such omission as to amount to contradiction only after the question is put answered and the relevant statement or part of it is marked and therefore no attempt should be made to evolve a workable principle but the question must be left at large to be decided by the Judge concerned on the facts of each case fore they had no fair trial We shall proceed to consider the contentions of the learned Counsel for the appellants in the order in which they were addressed Re The latest amendments were made by Act of which received the assent of the President on August and by notification issued by <ORG> its provisions came into force on and from January We are not concerned in this case with the Amending Act of but only with the Act as it stood before the amendment of In Act of the section corresponding to the present was which read An officer in charge of a <ORG> station or other <ORG> officer making an investigation may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and may reduce into writing any statement made by the person so examined Act of divided the aforesaid into two sections and numbered them as ss and which read Any Police officer making an investigation under this chapter may examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case and may reduce into writing any statement made by the person so examined There was not much difference between the third paragraph of of the Act of and of the Act of except that in the latter Act it was made clear that the prohibition did not apply to a dying declaration or affect the provisions of of the Indian Evidence Act The Code of did not make any change in nor did it introduce any substantial change in the body of except taking away the exception in regard to the dying declaration from it and putting it in the second clause of that section But was amended by Act of and the amended section read No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this Chapter shall if taken down in writing be signed by the person making it nor shall such writing be used as evidence Provided that when any witness is called for the prosecution whose statement has been taken down in writing as aforesaid the <ORG> shall on the request of the accused refer to such writing and may then if the <ORG> thinks it expedient in the interests of justice direct that the accused be furnished with a copy thereof and such statement may be used to impeach the credit of such witness in manner provided by the Indian Evidence Act On the other hand it was contended on behalf of the accused that when the statement of a witness was admittedly reduced into writing it would be unreasonable to allow any oral evidence of the statement to be given when the writing containing the statement could not be proved Section as amended by the aforesaid Act reads No statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of an investigation under this Chapter shall if reduced into writing be signed by the person making it nor shall any such statement or any record thereof whether in a police diary or otherwise or any part of such statement or record be used for any purpose save as hereinafter provided at any inquiry or trial in respect of any offence under investigation at the time when such statement was made Provided that when any witness is called for the prosecution in such inquiry or trial whose statement has been reduced into writing as aforesaid the Court shall on the request of the accused refer to such writing and direct that the accused be furnished with a copy thereof in order that any part of such statement if duly proved may be used to contradict such witness in the manner provided by section of the Indian Evidence Act The effect of the amendment was that the loopholes which enabled the use of the statement made before the police in a trial were plugged and the only exception made was to enable the accused to use the statement of a witness reduced into writing for a limited purpose namely in the manner provided by of the Indian Evidence Act and the prosecution only for explaining the matter referred to in his cross examination If a statement in writing could be used to discredit a witness in the manner provided by those two sections the purpose of the <ORG> would be defeated By Act of the following sub section was added to The police officer may reduce into writing any statement made to him in the course of an examination under this section and if he does so he shall make a separate record of the statement of each such person whose statement he records It is not necessary to notice in detail the changes made in by Act of except to point out that under the amendment the prosecution is also allowed to use the statement to contradict a witness with the permission of the <ORG> and that in view of the shortened committal procedure prescribed copies of the statements of the prosecution witnesses made before the police during investigation are made available by the police to the accused before the commencement of the inquiry or trial The consideration of the provisions of the latest amending Act need not detain us for the present case falls to be decided tinder the Act as it stood before that amendment It is therefore seen that the object of the legislature throughout has been to exclude the statement of a witness made before the police during the investigation from being made use of at the trial for any purpose and the amendments made from time to time were only intended to make clear the said object and to dispel the cloud cast on such intention If one could guess the intention of the legislature in framing the section in the manner it did in it would be apparent that it was to protect the accused against the user of the statements of witnesses made before the police during investigation at the trial presumably on the assumption that the said statements were not made under circumstances inspiring confidence <ORG> in Pakala Narayana Swami The King Emperor found another object underlying the section when they said at If one had to guess at the intention of the <ORG> in framing a section in the words used one would suppose that they had in mind to encourage the free disclosure of information or to protect the person making the statement from a supposed unreliability of police testimony as to alleged statements or both <NAME> describes the procedure to be followed to contradict a witness under of the Evidence Act thus at Resort to section would only be necessary if the witness denies that he made the former statement In that event it would be necessary to prove that he did and if the former statement was reduced to writing then section requires that his attention must be drawn to those parts which are to be used for contradiction It would be doing violence to the language of the proviso if the said statement be allowed to be used for the purpose of cross examining a witness within the meaning of the first part of of the Evidence Act Nor are we impressed by the argument that it would not be possible to invoke the second part of of the Evidence Act without putting relevant questions under the first part thereof To illustrate A says in the witness box that stabbed before the police he bad stated that stabbed His attention can be drawn to that part of the statement made before the police which contradicts his statement in the witness box The contradiction under the section should be between what a witness asserted in the witness box and what he stated before the police officer and not between what he said he had stated before the police officer and what he actually made before him This leads us to the main question in the case i the interpretation of of the Code of Criminal Procedure at thus The proper course is to apply the broad general rule of construction which is that a section or enactment must be construed as a whole each portion throwing light if need be on the rest The true principle undoubtedly is that the sound interpretation and meaning of the statute on a view of the enacting clause saving clause and proviso taken and construed together is to prevail Unless the words are clear the <ORG> should not so construe the proviso as to attribute an intention to the legislature to give with one hand and take away with another To put it in other words a sincere attempt should be made to reconcile the enacting clause and the proviso and to avoid repugnancy between the two As the words in the section declare the intention of the legislature we shall now proceed to construe the section giving the words used therein their natural and ordinary sense The object of the main section as the history of its legislation shows and the decided cases indicate is to impose a general bar against the use of statement made before the police and the enacting clause in clear terms says that no statement made by any person to a police officer or any record thereof or any part of such statement or record be used for any purpose Indeed in view of the aforesaid facts there is a statutory prohibition against police officers taking the signature of the person making the statement indicating thereby that the statement is not intended to be binding on the witness or an assurance by him that it is a correct statement Shortly stated there is a general bar against its use subject to a limited exception in the interest of the accused and the exception cannot obviously be used to cross the bar Further there are occasions when we come across two statements made by the same person at different times and both of them cannot stand or co exist There is an inherent repugnancy between the two and therefore if one is true the other must be false This indicates that there is something in writing which can be set against another statement made in evidence I do not think there is any anomaly in the situation Section of the Evidence Act deals with cross examination in respect of a previous statement made by the witness Section while confining the right to the accused to cross examine the witness in the said manner enables the prosecution to reexamine the witness to explain the matters referred to in the cross examination This enables the prosecution to explain the alleged contradiction by pointing out that if a part of the statement used to contradict be read in the context of any other part it would give a different meaning and if so read it would explain away the alleged contradiction I find myself in complete agreement with the learned Sessions Judge of Ferozepore who observed that a witness cannot be confronted with the unwritten record of an unmade statement The learned Judge gives an illustration of a case of apparent omission which really is a contradiction i a case where a witness stated under of the Code that he saw three persons beating a man and later I Mad In that judgment <NAME> made the following observation at I respectfully agree with the judgment of <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> in which the learned Judge held that a statement under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure cannot be filed in order to show that a witness is making statements in the witness box which he did not make to the police and that bare omission cannot be a contradiction Therefore if there is no contradiction between his evidence in <ORG> and his recorded statement in the diary the latter cannot be used at all But if he had not stated under anything about the fact there is no conflict and the I Mad Any part of such statement which has been reduced to writing may in certain limited circumstances be used to contradict the witness who made it The limitations are strict Only the statement of a prosecution witness can be used and only if it has been reduced to writing only a part of the statement recorded can be used such part must be duly proved it must be a contradiction of the evidence of the witness in Court it must be used as provided in Evidence Act that is it can only be used after the attention of the witness has been drawn to it or to those parts of it which it is intended to use for the purpose of contradiction and there are others In America there is no provision similar to of the Code The two conflicting views may be briefly stated thus i omissions unless by necessary implication be deemed to be part of the statement cannot be used to contradict the statement made in the witness box and ii they must be in regard to important features of the incident which are expected to be included in the statement made before the police The first proposition not only carries out the intention of the legislature but is also in accord with the plain meaning of the words used in the section From the foregoing discussion the following propositions emerge A statement in writing made by a witness before a police officer in the course of investigation can be used only to contradict his statement in the witness box and for no other purpose statements not reduced to writing by the police officer cannot be used for contradiction though a particular statement is not expressly recorded a statement that can be deemed to be part of that expressly recorded can be used for contradiction not because it is an omission strictly so called but because it is deemed to form part of the recorded statement such a fiction is permissible by construction only in the following three cases i when a recital is necessarily implied from the recital or recitals found in the statement illustration in the recorded statement before the police the witness states that he saw A stabbing at a particular point of time but in the witness box he says that he saw A and stabbing at the same point of time in the statement before the police the word only can be implied i the witness saw A only stabbing ii a negative aspect of a positive recital in a statement illustration in the recorded statement before the police the witness says that a dark man stabbed but in the witness box he says that a fair man stabbed the earlier statement must be deemed to contain the recital not only that the culprit was a dark complexioned man but also that be was not of fair complexion and iii when the statement before the police and that before the <ORG> cannot stand together illustration the witness says in the recorded statement before the police that A after stabbing ran away by a northern lane but in the <ORG> he says that immediatly after stabbing he ran away towards the southern lane as he could not have run away immediately after the stabbing i at the same point of time towards the northern lane as well as towards the southern lane if one statement is true the other must necessarily be false On July after the appellants were fully heard that application was dismissed and the detailed reasons for dismissing it were given in the judgment which was delivered on September He would say that the learned Counsel had in fact relied upon all the aforesaid omissions in support of his contention that there was development of the case of the prosecution from time to time and therefore he must have also relied upon the said omissions in the context of the statements made under of the Code of Criminal Procedure on the other hand the fact that the learned Judges considered all the alleged omissions in connection with the said contention and only considered two omissions in regard to the contention based on of the Code is indicative of the fact that the learned Counsel for reasons best known to him did not think fit to rely upon all the alleged omissions It would be seen from the short order made by the learned Sessions Judge at the time each one of the two questions were put that the learned Sessions Judge did not give a general ruling that no omissions in a statement before the police could be put to a witness From that omission in the statement it cannot necessarily be implied that there was no gas lamp in any part of the locality wherein the incident took place nor can it be said that as the witnesses stated that there were lanterns they must be deemed to have stated that there was no gas lamp for the word lantern is comprehensive enough to take in a gas lantern It is also not possible to state that the statements made before the police and those made before the Court cannot co exist for there is no repugnancy between the two as even on the assumption that lantern excludes a gas lantern both can exist in the scene of occurrence The learned Judges assumed that the said process was permissible and even on that assumption they rejected the plea of the learned Counsel for the appellants that there was improvement in the prosecution case In the result we confirm the judgment of <ORG> and dismiss the appeal <NAME> <NAME> The judgment which I am delivering has been prepared by my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> and myself We agree that the appeal be dismissed but would express in our own words the grounds upon which it should be dismissed The main contention advanced on behalf of the appellants was as follows There was no fair trial of the appellants as they had been deprived of the right of cross examination of the prosecution witnesses with reference to their statements made to the police during the police investigation There were several matters with respect to which if questions had been allowed to be put an effective cross examination might have resulted and enabled the appellants to persuade the trial Judge to hold that the witnesses were entirely unreliable In a case of this kind in which the appellants were involved there were only two principal questions which were of vital importance how far the witnesses had improved their story in their evidence in <ORG> from what they had said to the police concerning the occurrence and the existence of opportunity and sufficient light to enable proper identification It could not therefore be said that the trial Judge had done anything which could be rightly characterised as infringement of the provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure or of the Indian Evidence Act or even of the rules of natural justice The principal comment had been that in this report there was no mention of the culprits having advanced from the well towards the open place where villagers had gathered to hear the music Reference is made only to some of the details and not to all the discrepancies pointed out in order to determine whether the alleged improvement in the story of the witnesses in <ORG> from what they are alleged to have stated to the police was with reference to vital matters which went to the root of the prosecution case From the above it seems to us that there is no merit in the appeal Criminal Procedure of and have been referred to by our learned brother <NAME> Section of the Code of made it clear that except for a dying declaration and matters coming within the provisions of of the Indian Evidence Act of no statement of any person made to a police officer in the course of in There was no restric tion as to the extent of the right of an accused to cross examine a prosecution witness concerning his statement to the police It will be seen therefore that until there was no restriction imposed upon the accused as to the extent of his right of cross examination The provisions were intended to protect the accused in that no statement of a witness to the police reduced into writing could be used as evidence against him but the right to cross examine the witness to the fullest extent in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act in order to show that he was unreliable remained unaffected He may also reduce into writing any statement made to him in the course of such examination and if he does so he must make a separate record of the statement of each such person The first restriction is that no statement made by any person to a police officer if reduced into writing be signed by the person making it <ORG> considered the intention to be If one had to guess at the intention of the legislature in framing a section in the words used one would suppose that they had in mind to encourage the free disclosure of the information or to protect the person making the statement from a supposed unreliability of police testimony as to alleged statements or both It also gives a right to the prosecution to use the statement for purposes of reexamination of the same witness but only to explain any matter referred to in the cross examination of the witness The section analysed gives the following result Witnesses can be cross examined as to previous statements in writing or reduced into writing These writings need not be shown to the witnesses or proved beforehand But if the intention is to contradict them by the writings a their attention must be drawn to those parts which are to be used for contradiction This should be done before proving the writings Our learned brother <NAME> restricts the use by the accused of the previous statements to the mechanism of contradiction as detailed in above but says that the accused has no right to proceed under and He deduces this from the words of of the Code of Criminal Procedure where it is provided in order that any part of such statement if duly proved may be used to contradict such witness in the manner provided by section of the Indian Evidence Act We regret we cannot agree and we say this with pro found respect that the accused is not entitled to cross examine but only to contradict There are cases of omissions on a relevant and material point There is an omission of two facts in the first statement viz When some omissions occur there is contradiction in one sense but not necessarily on a relevant matter Reexamination is only permissible where there is cross examination The word contradict has various Meanings and in the Oxford English Dictionary it is stated as To be contrary to in effect character etc The meaning given to the words contradict and contradiction in these Dictionaries must at least include the case of an omission in a previous statement which by implication amounts to contradiction and therefore such an omission is a matter which is covered by the first proviso to and questions in cross In a civil suit where the provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure have no application would it be correct to say that only questions concerning omissions of the kind suggested by our learned brother could be put and none other We cannot see why a question of the nature of cross examination regarding an omission with respect to a matter which the witness omitted to make in his previous statement and which if made would The purpose of cross examination is to test the veracity of the statement made by a witness in his examination in chief as also to impeach his credit According to this interpretation the accused has no right of cross examination in respect of the contradiction This means that no question can be put about the previous statement but only the part in which there is a contradiction can be brought to the witness notice and his explanation if any obtained In other words there is only contradiction and no more This brings us to the consideration of the questions which were asked and disallowed It is to be borne in mind that the statement made to the police is I duly proved either earlier or even later to establish what the witness had then stated The learned Judges of <ORG> ruled out from their consideration that these two circumstances made it possible for the witnesses to recognise the accused but hold that there was ample opportunity even otherwise for the witnesses to do so <ORG> was justified in so doing and there being ample evidence on which they could come to the conclusion that the witnesses had in fact recognised the accused it must inevitably be regarded as one of fact in regard to which this <ORG> does not interfere
