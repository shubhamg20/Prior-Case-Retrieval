Evidence Circumstantial evidence Onus of proof Prosecution must prove every link of the chain and complete chain Infirmity or lacuna in the prosecution cannot be cured by false defence or plea A person cannot be convicted on pure moral conviction False explanation can be used as additional link to fortify the prosecution case subject to satisfaction of certain conditions All the three accused were charged for the alleged offence of murder by poisoning on the night of of <NAME> the newly married wife of the first accused and the appellant herein under section I read with section but did not award any sentence under read with The appellant and the other two accused file Criminal Appeal No against their conviction and the sentences awarded to them The <ORG> filed a Criminal Revision application for enhancement of the sentence awarded to accused and The second part of cl of viz the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death in cases in which the cause of that person death comes into question is not to be found in the English Law For instance where the death takes place within a very short time of the marriage or the distance of time is not spread over more than months the statements may be admissible under The second part of cl of is yet another exception to the rule that in criminal law the evidence of a person who was not being subjected to or given an opportunity of being cross examined by the accused would be valueless because the place of cross examination is taken by the solemnity and sanctity of oath for the simple reason that a person on the verge of death is not likely to make a false statement unless there is strong evidence to show that the statement was secured either by prompting or tutoring It is well settled that the prosecution must stand or fall on its own legs and it cannot derive any strength from the weakness of the defence It is not the law that where there is any infirmity or lacuna in the prosecution case the same could be cured or supplied by a false defence or a plea which is not accepted by a <ORG> There is a vital difference between an incomplete chain of circumstances and a circumstance which after the chain is complete is added to it merely to reinforce the conclusion of the court Where the prosecution is enable to prove any of the essential principles laid down in <NAME> case the High <ORG> cannot supply the weakness or the lacuna by taking aid of or recourse to a false defence or a false plea They should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and There must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused These five golden principles constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence and in the absence of a corpus deliciti The cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence is that a case can be said to be proved only when there is certain and explicit evidence and no pure moral conviction Some of the statements which have a causal connection with the death of <NAME> or the circumstances leading to her death are undoubtedly admissible under section of the Evidence Act but other statements which do not bear any proximity with the death or if at all very remotely and indirectly connected with the death would not be admissible Not that this is done consciously but even unconsciously the love and affection for the deceased would create a phychological hatred against the supposed murderer the court has to examine the evidence of interested witnesses with very great care and caution They are i There is absolutely no reference to suicidal pact or the circumstances leading to the same ii There is no reference even to <NAME> and her illcit relations with the appellant iii There is no mention of the fact that the deceased was not at all willing to go to Pune and that she was sent by force iv The complaints made in the letters are confined to ill treatment loneliness neglect and anger of the husband but no apprehension has been expressed in any of the letters that the deceased expected imminent danger to her life from her husband In fact in the letters she had asked her sister and friend not to disclose her and plight to her parents but while narrating the facts to her parents she herself violated the said emotional promise which appears to be too good to be true and an after thought added to strengthen the prosecution case and vi If there is anything inherent in the letters it is that because of her miserable existence and gross ill treatment by her husband <NAME> might have herself decided to end her life rather than bother her parents It may be very likely that the appellant may have administered the poison potassium cyanide to <NAME> but at the same time a fair possibility that she herself committed suicide cannot be safely excluded or eliminated In the cases of murder by administering poison the <ORG> must carefully scan the evidence and determine the four important circumstances which alone can justify the conviction There is a clear motive for an accused to administer poison to the deceased ii that the deceased died of poison said to have been administered iii that the accused had the poison in his possession and iv that he had an opportunity to administer the poison to the accused This also is eliminated in view of the report of the Chemical Examiner as confirmed by the postmortem that the deceased died as a result of administration of potassium cyanide When the appellant entered the room he must have thought that as she was sleeping she need not be disturbed but when he found that there was no movement in the body after an hour his suspicion was roused and therefore he called his brother from the adjacent flat to send for Dr <NAME> In these circumstances it cannot be said that a reasonable possibility of the deceased having committed suicide as alleged by the defence cannot be safely ruled out or eliminated In these circumstances there was nothing wrong if the appellant and his brother went to a distance of one and a half kilometer to get Apart from the aforesaid comments there is one vital defect in some of the circumstances relied upon by the High <ORG> namely circumstances Nos and As a logical corollary it follows that cannot be held that the act of the accused cannot be explained on any other hypothesis except the guilt of the appellant nor can it be said that in all human probability the accused had committed the murder of <NAME> Ex and Ex it can be safely held that there was a clear possibility and a tendency on the part of the deceased <NAME> to commit suicide due to desperation and frustration There can be no doubt that <NAME> was not only a sensitive and sentimental women was extremely impressionate and the letters show that a constant conflict between her mind and body was going on and unfortunately the circumstances which came into existence hastened her end iv That is appreciating the evidence the High <ORG> has clearly misdirected itself on many points and has thus committed a gross error of law iv That the High <ORG> has relied upon decisions of this <ORG> which are either in applicable or which on closer examination do not support the view of the High <ORG> being clearly distinguishable vi That the High <ORG> has taken a completely wrong view of law in holding that even though the prosecution may suffer from serious infirmities it could be reinforced by additional link in the nature of false defence in order to supply the lacuna and has thus committed a fundamental error or law vii That the High <ORG> has not only misappreciated the evidence but has completely overlooked the well established principles of law and has merely tried to accept the prosecution case based on tenterhooks and slender tits and bits viii It is wholly unsafe to rely on that part of the evidence of Dr <NAME> PW which shows that poison was forcibly administered by the process of mechanical suffociation ix There is no manifest defect in the investigation made by the police which appears to be honest and careful There is no acceptable evidence on record to show that either the appellant or his parents ill treated the desceased <NAME> and that the appellant had any illicit intimacy with PW <NAME> In this case the appellant would have gone to gallows on the basis of the evidence of PW as he would have the <ORG> to believe it and the other evidence if they had been accepted Section Criminal Procedure Code lays down that in every inquiry or trial for the purpose of enabling the accused personally to explain any circumstance appearing in the evidence against him the court may at any stage without previously warning the accused put such questions to him as the court considers necessary and shall after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called for his defence question him generally on the case As a general proposition it cannot be laid down for all purposes that for instance where the death takes place within a short time of marriage and the distance of time is not spread over three or four months the statement would be admissible under Section of the evidence Act As days passed by despite her most laudable attitude she found that things were not what they seem and to quote her own words she was treated in her husbands house as a labourer or as an unpaid maid servant Not only this when she narrated her woeful tale to her sister <NAME> in the letters written to her which would be dealt with in a later part of the judgment she took the abundant care and caution of requesting <NAME> not to reveal her sad plight to her parents lest they may get extremely upset worried and distressed On the other hand the plea of the defence was that while there was a strong possibility of <NAME> having been ill treated and uncared for by her husband or her in laws being a highly sensitive and impressionate woman she committed suicide out of sheer depression and frustration arising from an emotional upsurge Before discussing the facts of the case it may be mentioned that although <ORG> and the trial court have gone into meticulous and minutest matters pertaining to the circumstances leading to the alleged murder of <NAME> yet after going through the judgments we feel that the facts of the case lie within a very narrow compass In order to prove his bona fide the accused relied on the circumstances that as soon as he came to know about the death of his wife he called two Doctors PWs and when they declared that <NAME> had died an unnatural death as the cause of death was not known and therefore the body had to be sent for postmortem he immediately took steps to inform the police He flatly denied the allegation of the prosecution that there was any attempt on his part to persuade <NAME> PW to allow the body of the deceased to be cremated We might state that <ORG> has mentioned as many as circumstances in order to prove that the circumstantial evidence produced by the prosecution was complete and conclusive Some of these circumstances overlap some are irrelevant and some cannot be taken into consideration because they were not put to the appellant in his statement under of the Code of Criminal Procedure in order to explain the effect of the Code of Criminal Procedure in order to explain the effect of the same as we shall presently show of The Evidence Act this <ORG> in the case of <NAME> State of Bihar <NAME> made the following observations The only relevant clause of which may be said to have any bearing is cl which relates to statements made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death II the authors have collected all the cases at one place and indicated their conclusions thus To sum up the test of the relevancy of a statement under Section is not what the final finding in the case is but whether the final finding in the case is but whether the cause of the death of the person making the statement comes into question in the case The expression any of the Circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death is wider in scope than the expression the cause of his death in other words Clause of Section refers to two kinds of statements statement made by a person as to the cause of his death and the statement made by a person as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant has vehemently argued that there was a very strong possibility of the deceased having committed suicide due to the circumstances mentioned in her own letters He has submitted that the so called dying declarations are admissible neither under nor under of the Evidence Act it was submitted by the appellant that the present case is not at all covered by cl of of the Evidence Acts It will be observed that the circumstances are of the transaction which resulted in the death of the declarant We fully agree with the above observations made by the learned Judges Although that would not by itself be sufficient unless there was evidence of incitement to end her life it would be relevant as evidence This is because the natural meaning of the words according to their Lordships do not convey any of the limitations such as that the statement must be made after the transaction has taken place that the person making it must be at any rate near death that the circumstances can only include acts done when and where the death was caused They cannot be said to be circumstances of the transaction which resulted in death the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death in cases in which the cause of that person death comes into question is not be found in the English law This distinction has been clearly pointed out in the case of <NAME> The <ORG> where the following observations were made Clause of of the Indian Evidence Act provides that statements written or verbal of relevant facts made by a person who is dead are themselves rele vant facts when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death in case in which the cause of that person death comes into question It is well settled by now that there is difference between the Indian Rule and the English Rule with regard to the necessity of the declaration having been made under expectation of death For instance where the death takes place within a very short time of the marriage or the distance of time is not spread over more than months the statement may be admissible under The second part of cl of is yet another exception to the rule that in criminal law the evidence of a person who was not being subjected to or given an opportunity of being cross examined by the accused would be valueless because the place of cross examination is taken by the solemnity and sanctity of oath for the simple reason that a person on the verge of death is not likely to make a false statement unless there is strong evidence to show that the statement was secured either by prompting or tutoring This now brings us to a close consideration of the contents of the letters Exhs We propose to examine the contents of the letters for four purposes in order to find out the state of mind and psychological attitude of <NAME> the nature of <NAME> attitude towards her husband and in laws the amount of tension and frustration which seems to be clearly expressed in the letters and to determine <NAME> personal traits and psychological approach to life to determine if she was ever capable of or prone to committing suicide It is pertinent to note that in the first two paragraphs of her letter extracted above there is no indication nor any hint about the conduct of her husband which is a letter dated written by <NAME> to her sister <NAME> which is a letter dated written by the deceased to her close friend <NAME> and which shows her exact feelings changing mood and emotions One reason is that in the house there are many persons and they are elder to me and such I do not dare to do any work independently <NAME> there is nothing in my hands except to weep profusely How he says to me are you tired of me so early What shall I say to such a man But due to moody nature it will take time to pacify the same In the third paragraph she clearly states that all persons in her father in laws place were very good and loving but due to a number of persons in the house she did not get a chance to work independently Again in the same breath towards the end of the paragraph while she says that her husband does not care for her yet she at once changes her mind and says that he cares for her much but due to his moody nature it will take time to pacify him There is no indication that she expected any danger from her husband nor is there anything to show that things had come to such a pass that a catastrophe may have resulted A close reading and analysis of the letter clearly shows at least two things a that she felt extremely depressed that there was a clear tendency resulting from her psychotic nature to end her life or commit suicide Indeed if this was not so how could it be possible that while not complaining against her husband she gives a hint not only to <NAME> but also to <NAME> that she might not live Thus from the recitals in the letters we can safely hold that there was a clear possibility and a tendency on her part to commit suicide due to desperation and frustration At any rate the fact that she may have committed suicide cannot be safely excluded or eliminated In support of our view we extract certain passages from his book The fact is that some people who commit suicide can be classified as psychotic or severely disturbed Revenge fantasies and their association with suicide are well known to people who give ear to those in emotional distress There can be no doubt that <NAME> was not only a sensitive and sentimental woman but was extremely impressionate and the letters show that a constant conflict between her mind and body was going on and unfortunately the circumstances which came into existence hastened her end We have pointed out these circumstances because <ORG> has laid very great stress on the fact that the evidence led by the prosecution wholly and completely excludes the possibility of suicides and the death of <NAME> was nothing but a dastardly murder Some of the statements which have a causal connection with the death of <NAME> or the circumstances leading to her death are undoubtedly admissible under of the Evidence Act as held by us but other statements which do not bear any proximity with the death or if at all very remotely and indirectly connected with the death would not be admissible Not that is done consciously but even unconsciously the love and affection for the deceased would create a psychological hatred against the supposed murderer and therefore the court has to examine such evidence with very great care and caution This now takes us to a consideration of the evidence of the witnesses concerned which read together with the letters form a composite chain of evidence regarding the causes or the circumstance relating to the death of the deceased The witness states that when <NAME> came to Beed with her maternal uncle he found her somewhat uneasy and on making enquiries whether she was happy at her husband house she told him that she was not very happy with her husband since she noticed that her husband was not very much pleased with her and in fact hated her It appears from his evidence that even after hearing the narration from his daughter he advised her to get herself adjusted to the situation and to the atmosphere of her new marital home Since this was more or less a formal visit for expressing his condolences to the bereaved family he left <NAME> at the house of the accused The only part of his evidence on which reliance was placed by the prosecution is that he had noticed <NAME> very much disturbed and uneasy and requested <NAME> father of the accused to allow him to take <NAME> to the house of <NAME> which he did He suggested to <NAME> that as the marriage of his nephew was to be celebrated at Beed on th June <NAME> would come to attend the marriage and at that time he can take <NAME> with him The witness has said many times in his statement that <NAME> was always weeping and crying and the final crisis came when on hearing the talks between him and <NAME> she called him from the staircase and told him that she was not prepared to go to her husband house as she was in a state of extreme fear It is extremely difficult for a person to change a particular bent of mind or a trait of human nature unless there are substantial and compelling circumstances to do so To take the other side of the picture the witness says that when he reached Pune on and visited the place where <NAME> had died he found <NAME> sleeping or lying on the cot and on seeing him he immediately started crying vigorously and making a show of the grief and shock they had received Ultimately I asked him as to what had happened to <NAME> when he told me that since th it was the day of his marriage with <NAME> he and <NAME> were in joyest mood According to him by about a when he got up and after visiting the urinal when returned to the room he found that <NAME> had not got up as usual since according to him she used to wake up at the same time he used to wake up and so he went near <NAME> and called her out when he found her dead There is nothing on the record nor in the evidence to show any circumstance which may have led the witness to arrive at this conclusion There was no reason for the witness to have presumed at that time that <NAME> must have committed the murder of the deceased There were no materials or data before him which could have led him to this inference The second part of the statement made by the witness regarding having sexual intercourse near about midnight seems to us to be inherently improbable This is an additional circumstance to show that even when <NAME> visited <NAME> for the last time she might tell something to her own sister <NAME> or to <NAME> but she would never dare to disclose all the details and put all the cards on the table before her parents a step which she deliberately desisted from coming into existence Great reliance was placed by the Additional Solicitor General on behalf of the respondent on the relevance of the statements of PWs and Secondly he relied on the statements made by the deceased <NAME> to these witnesses about the treatment meted out to her by her husband during her stay at Pune and furnishes a clear motive for the accused to murder her She states that during this visit she found <NAME> cheerful and happy and she did not complain of anything during her stay for days Even so whatever <NAME> had said does not appear to be of any consequence because she the witness herself admits that she did not take it seriously and told <NAME> that since she had entered a new family it might take some time for her to acclimatise herself with the new surroundings She further states that <NAME> requested her to take her to Beed as it was not possible for her to stay in her marital house where she was not only bored but was extremely afraid and scared But the mother of the appellant convinced her that there was nothing to worry about and everything will be alright <NAME> but he told him that as some guests were to visit him he PW can send somebody after days to take <NAME> to <NAME> Thereafter <NAME> told her mother that she was receiving a very shabby treatment from her husband and while narrating her miserable plight she told her about two important incidents which had greatly upset her that she happened to come across a love letter written by PW <NAME> to her husband which showed that the appellant was carrying on illicit relations with PW that on one occasion the appellant told <NAME> that he was tired of his life and did not want to live any more and therefore wanted to commit suicide Despite <NAME> enquiries as to why he wanted to commit suicide he did not give any reason There is no mention nor even a hint in the letters Exhs Indeed if this fact which is of very great importance so far as the lives of both the husband and the wife are concerned would have been there the first thing which <NAME> would have done is to tell <NAME> that matters had reached such a stage as to leave no doubt that her daughter was in an instant fear of death and it was impossible for him to allow his daughter to go to Pune where <NAME> was bent on forcing her to commit suicide or even murder her more particularly because <NAME> admits in her evidence that as all the things she had learnt from <NAME> were serious she had informed her husband about the same who agreed with her One point of importance which might be noticed here and which shows that whatever be the relations with her husband and <NAME> the picture presented by the witness is not totally correct because if such a point of no return had already been reached there was absolutely no question of <NAME> and sending for the appellant and arranging a trip to Ooty Mysore and other place nor would have <NAME> agreed to go to these places There is no reference at all in any of the letters regarding suicidal pact or the illicit relationship of her husband with <NAME> Indeed if he had an evil intention of insulting or injuring the feelings of <NAME> by keeping <NAME> there he would never have asked his mother to send <NAME> also because then the matter was likely to be made public Despite these serious developments both PW and tried to convince <NAME> to accept the assurances given by <NAME> that no harm would come to her and if anything might happen they will take proper care There is no doubt that relations between the appellant and <NAME> were extremely strained may be due to his friendship with <NAME> she may not have felt happy in her marital home as she has clearly expressed in her letters but she did not disclose anything of such great consequence which would have shocked the parents and led them to resist her going to Pune at any cost letter written to her by <NAME> she stated that the only complaint made in that letter was that her husband was not talking to her properly This also shows that the story of suicidal pact and other things had been introduced in order to give a colour or orientation to the prosecution story No witness has gone to the extent of saying that there was any immediate danger to <NAME> life nor did <NAME> say so to PWs and In fact the letters have a different tale to tell particularly in respect of the following matters There is absolutely no reference to suicidal pact or the circumstances leading to the same there is no reference even to Ujvala and her illicit relations with the appellant there is no mention of the fact that the deceased was not at all willing to go to Pune and that she was sent by force the complaints made in the letters are confined to ill treatment loneliness neglect and anger of the husband but no apprehension has been expressed in any of the letters that the deceased expected imminent danger to her life from her husband If there is anything inherent in the letters it is that because of her miserable existence and gross ill treatment by her husband <NAME> might have herself decided to end her life rather than bother her parents Putting all these pieces together a general picture of the whole episode that emerges is that there is a reasonable possibility of <NAME> having made up her mind to end her life either due to frustration or desperation or to take a revenge on her husband for shattering her dream and ill treating her day to day Apart from the spirit of revenge which may have been working in the mind of <NAME> it seems to us that what may have happened is that the sum total and the cumulative effect of the circumstances may have instilled in her an aggressive impulse endangered by frustration of which there is ample evidence both in her letters and her subsequent conduct We might hasten to observe here that in cases of women of a sensitive and sentimental nature it has usually been observed that if they are tired of their life due to the action of their kith and kin they become so desperate that they develop a spirit of revenge and try to destroy those who had made their lives worthless and under this strong spell of revenge sometimes they can go to the extreme limit of committing suicide with a feeling that the subject who is the root cause of their malady is also destroyed This is what may have happened in this case We might extract what <NAME> in his book Death Society and Human Experience has to say Revenge fantasies and their association with suicide are well known to people who give ear to those in emotional distress After a careful consideration and discussion of the evidence we reach the following conclusions on point No that soon after the marriage the relations between <NAME> and her husband became extremely strained and went to the extent that no point of return had been almost reached that it has been proved to some extent that the appellant had some sort of intimacy with <NAME> which embittered the relationship between <NAME> and him That the story given out by PW and supported by PW that when they reached Pune after the death of <NAME> they found appellant weeping and wailing out of grief as this was merely a pretext for shedding of crocodile tears cannot be believed that the story of suicidal pact and the allegation that appellant illicit relations with <NAME> developed to such an extreme that he was so much infatuated with <NAME> as to form the bedrock of the motive of the murder of <NAME> has not been clearly proved the statement of PW that the appellant had told him that during the night on th June he had sexual act with the deceased is too good to be true and is not believable as it is inherently improbable that despite the evidence of PWs and if has not been proved to our satisfaction that the matter had assumed such extreme proportions that <NAME> refused to go to Pune with her father in law <NAME> at any cost and yet she was driven by use of compulsion and persuasion to accompany him that the combined reading and effect of the letters Exhs and and the evidence of PWs and clearly reveal that the signs and symptoms resulting from the dirty atmosphere and the hostile surroundings in which <NAME> was placed is a pointer to the fact that there was a reasonable possibility of her having committed suicide and the prosecution has not been able to exclude or eliminate this possibility beyond reasonable doubt We might mention here that we had to reappreciate the evidence of the witnesses and the circumstances taking into account the psychological aspect of suicide as found in the psychotic nature and character of <NAME> because these are important facts which <ORG> completely overlocked Apparently if proved this appears to be a conclusive evidence against the appellant but here also <ORG> has completely ignored certain essential details which cast considerable doubt on the evidence led by the prosecution on this point The evidence of PW the motor rickshaw driver shows that on the night of the th of June he had brought the deceased alongwith <NAME> and others and dropped them near the Takshila apartments at about The witness was cross examined on several points but we shall accept finding of <ORG> on the fact that on the th of June the witness had dropped the persons mentioned above at about The rest of the evidence is not germane for the purpose of this case He further says that after about minutes he saw the appellant coming on a scooter and while he was parking his scooter the witness asked him why did he come so late to which he replied that he was busy in some meeting We shall accept his evidence in toto but that leads us nowhere Such a conduct on the part of the appellant or the persons belonging to his family is wholly inconsistent with the allegation of the prosecution that the appellant had murdered the deceased It appears that PW <NAME> was also summoned on telephone and when he came at the scene of occurrence he found A <NAME> sitting on the floor of the room and <NAME> hugged him out of grief and told him that <NAME> had died of shock and the Doctors were not prepared to give a death certificate He admitted in his statement at that some proceedings about evasion of octroi duty were pending against him in the Court Apart from this it appears that most of the statements which he made in the <ORG> against <NAME> and the other accused were not made by him before the police These belated statements made in the <ORG> may be summarised thus While in his statement before the court the witness at para states that the death of <NAME> was suspicious yet he made no such statement before the police on being confronted by the statement of PW Similarly he deposed in the court about the statement made to him by <NAME> that he would lose his prestige and therefore the body should be cremated before a but he advised him not to do so unless he has informed the police otherwise his whole family would be in trouble clock when he said that he would spend any amount but wanted to cremate her before a This statement does not appear to be true for the following reasons It is therefore difficult to believe that <NAME> would take such a great risk in laying all his cards on the table knowing full well that the witness was not so friendly as he thought and therefore he might inform the police thereby he would be in a way digging his own grave This would take us to near about a Either there is some confusion in the translation of the word Pahate or in the words a as mentioned in the original Ex However nothing much turns on this except that according to the witness <NAME> must have died around a which is consistent with the evidence of Dr <NAME> that when he examined <NAME> at about a he found her dead and rigor mortis had already started setting in We are not concerned here with the controversy whether the report was admissible under or of the Code of Criminal Procedure but the fact remains that the policd did receive the information that the death took place at a <ORG> seems to have made a capital out of this small incident and has not made a realistic approach to the problem faced by <NAME> and his family Apart from the inherent improbability in the statement of the appellant there is one other circumstance which almost clinches the issue which is extracted below From clinical examination there was no positive evidence of having any recent sexual intercourse just prior to death This positive finding of the Doctor therefore knocks the bottom out of the case made out by the prosecution tion that the appellant had told PWs and about having sexual intercourse with his wife In this connection we might refer to the finding of fact arrived at by <ORG> on this point In view of the above position as is available from the evidence of Dr <NAME> and from the observations made by the medical authorities it will not be possible to say that the existence of the dark red blood in the right ventricle exclusively points out the mechanical suffocation particularly when such phenomenon is available in cases of poisoning by potassium cyanide This also is eliminated in view of the report of the Chemical Examiner as confirmed by the postmortem that the deceased had died as a result of administration of potassium cyanide When the appellant entered the room he must have thought that as she was sleeping she need not be disturbed but when he found that there was no movement in the body after an hour so his suspicion was roused and therefore he called his brother from adjacent flat to send for Dr <NAME> In these circumstances it cannot be said that a reasonable possibility of the deceased having committed suicide as alleged by the defence can be safely ruled out or eliminated This now brings us to an important chapter of the case on which great reliance appears to have been placed by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellant Although the learned counsel for the appellant drew our attention to a number of interpolations in the postmortem report as also the report sent to the Chemical Examiner we are impressed only with two infirmities which merit serious consideration To begin with it has been pointed out that in the original postmortem notes which were sent to Dr <NAME> PW for his opinion there is a clear interpolation by which the words can be a case of suicidal death appear to have been scored out and Dr <NAME> explained that since he had written the words time since death twice therefore the subsequent writing had been scored out by him It seems to us that at the first flush when he wrote the postmortem notes it appeared to him that no abnormality was detected and that it appears to be a case of suicide rather than that of homicide he has added caught between the teeth in ink but in the original there is something else It is obvious that in the carbon copy which was retained by the Doctor the entries must have been made after the copy was sent to the Chemical Examiner A number of comments were made on behalf of the appellant about Dr <NAME> integrity and incorrect reports but subject to what we said we do not find any substance in those contentions This would have been normally done by <NAME> if she had committed suicide In these circumstances there was nothing wrong if the appellant and his brother went to a distance of Km As regards circumstance No <ORG> has presumed that there being no dependable evidence that the information given to the police by PW was false and that the appellant must have told A about the incident on the basis of which he gave instructions to PW Any way we do not want to land ourselves in the field of surmises and conjectures as <ORG> has done Circumstance No also is not relevant because there is no question of taking a false plea of absence from the bedroom at the relevant time as there is no clear evidence on this point Apart from the aforesaid comments there is one vital defect in some of the circumstances mentioned above and relied upon by <ORG> viz As these circumstances were not put to the appellant in his statement under of the Criminal Procedure Code they must be completely excluded from consideration because the appellant did not have any chance to explain them there is a catena of authorities of this Court uniformly taking the view that unless the circumstance appearing against an accused is put to him in his examination under of the or of the Criminal Procedure Code the same cannot be used against him We might mention here an important argument advance by counsel for the appellant and countered by the Additional Solicitor General There is clear evidence led by the prosecution that except for a week or few days of intervals <NAME> always used to live with her husband and she had herself complained that he used to come late at night Moreover it would appear from the evidence of PW In these circumstances it is difficult to accept the argument that the appellant would commit the murder of his wife just on the eve of <ORG> ceremony which he could have done the same long before that ceremony or after the marriage as there was no hurry nor any such impediment which would deny him any opportunity of murdering his wife The law on the subject is well settled for the last decades and there have been so many decisions on this point that the principles laid down by courts have become more or less axiomatic <ORG> was greatly impressed by the view taken by some courts including this <ORG> that a false defence or a false plea taken by an accused would be an additional link in the various chain of circumstantial evidence and seems to suggest that since the appellant had taken a false plea that would be conclusive taken along with other circumstances to prove the case This is trite law and no decision has taken a contrary view Before discussing the cases relied upon by <ORG> we would like to cite a few decisions on the nature character and essential proof required in a criminal case which rests on circumstantial evidence alone It may be useful to extract what <NAME> has laid down in <NAME> case supra It is well to remember that in cases where the evidence is of a circumstantial nature the circumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should in the first instance be fully established and all the facts so established should be consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused In other words there must be a chain of evidence so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground far a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused they should exclude every possible hypothesis except the one to be proved and there must be a chain of evidence so complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and must show that in all human probability the act must have been done by the accused These five golden principles if we may say so constitute the panchsheel of the proof of a case based on circumstantial evidence This indicates the cardinal principle of criminal jurisprudence that a case can be said to be proved only when there is certain and explicit evidence and no person can be convicted on pure moral conviction It will be seen that this Court while taking into account the absence of explanation or a false explanation did hold that it will amount to be an additional link to complete the chain but these observations must be read in the light of what this Court said earlier viz There is a vital difference between an incomplete chain of circumstances and a circumstance which after the chain is complete is added to it merely to reinforce the conclusion of the court Where the prosecution is unable to prove any of the essential principles laid down in <NAME> case the High <ORG> cannot supply the weakness or the lacuna by taking aid of or recourse to a false defence or a false plea We are therefore unable to accept the argument of the Additional Solicitor General Moreover in <NAME> case supra this <ORG> while reiterating the principles enunciated in <NAME> case observed thus If the circumstances proved in the case are consistent either with the innocence of the accused or with his guilt then the accused is entitled to the benefit of doubt In <NAME> case supra this Court held thus Three questions arise in such cases namely firstly did the deceased die of the poison in question secondly had the accused the poison in his possession and thirdly had the accused an opportunity to administer the poison in question to the deceased It is only when the motive is there and these facts are all proved that the court may be able to draw the inference that the poison was administered by the accused to the deceased resulting in his death In the first place it has no doubt been proved that <NAME> died of potassium cyanide and secondly it has also been proved that there was an opportunity to administer the poison On the other hand as indicated above there is clear evidence of PW that potassium cyanide could have been available to <NAME> from the plastic factory of her mother but there is no evidence to show that the accused could have procured potassium cyanide from any available source We might here extract a most unintelligible and extra ordinary finding of <ORG> It is true that there is no direct evidence on these two points because the prosecution is not able to lead evidence that the accused had secured potassium cyanide poison from a particular source Similarly there is no direct evidence to prove that he had administered poison to <NAME> While holding in the clearest possible terms that there is no evidence in this case to show that the appellant was in possession or poison <ORG> observes that this fact may be proved either by direct or indirect circumstantial evidence If the court seems to suggest that merely because the appellant had the opportunity to administer poison and the same was found in the body of the deceased it should be presumed that the appellant was in possession of poison than it has committed a serious and gross error of law and has blatantly violated the principles laid down by this Court Even prior to <NAME> case there are two decisions of this Court which have taken the same view There is no direct evidence in this case that the accused was in possession of Potassium Cyanide or that he administered the same to the deceased On the facts as found by <ORG> it must be held that the second of the three facts which have to be proved in case of poisoning based on circumstantial evidence has not been proved namely that the accused was in possession of the poison that had been found in the body Can it be said in these circumstances when the proof of a very vital fact namely that the accused was in possession of potassium cyanide has failed that the chain of circumstantial evidence is so far complete as not to leave any reasonable ground for a conclusion consistent with the innocence of the accused and that the evidence which remains after the rejection of this fact is such as to show that within all human probability the act must have been done by the accused In the first place the case was decided on the peculiar facts of that case If at all it is an authority it is on the point that this <ORG> is not required to enter into an elaborate examination of the evidence unless there are very special circumstances to justify the same From a detailed scrutiny of the decision cited above <NAME> Case we find that there is nothing in common between the peculiar facts of that case and the present one A careful perusal of that decision shows that this Court did not accept the prosecution case despite circumstances appearing in that case which are almost similar to those found in the present one The reason for a little delay in lodging the FIR has already been explained by us while dealing with the facts In the decision cited above it was clearly held that the case against the accused was not proved conclusively and unerringly and that two reasonable views were possible the relevant portion of which may be extracted thus On a consideration of the evidence and the circumstances referred to above we are satisfied that this is a case in which the circumstantial evidence did not prove the case against the accused conclusively and unerringly and at any rate two reasonable views were possible We have already found in the instant case that taking the prosecution at the highest the utmost that can be said is that two views one in favour of the accused and the other against him were possible On the other hand this decision fully supports the case of the appellant that falsity of defence cannot take the place of proof of facts which the prosecution has to establish in order to succeed On the other hand some of the observations made in these cases support the accused rather than the prosecution This now brings us to the fag end of our judgment As a logical corollary it follows that it cannot be held that the act of the accused cannot be explained on any other hypothesis except the guilt of the appellant nor can it be said that in all human probability the accused had committed the murder of <NAME> It may be very likely that the appellant may have administered the poison potassium cyanide to <NAME> but at the same time a fair possibility that she herself committed suicide cannot be safely excluded or eliminated We also agree with <ORG> that there is no manifest defect in the investigation made by the police which appears to be honest and careful This was a fit case in which <ORG> should have given at least the benefit of doubt to the appellant For the reasons given above we hold that the prosecution has failed to prove its case against appellant beyond reasonable doubt We therefore allow the appeal set aside the judgments of the courts below and acquit the appellant <NAME> of the charges framed against him and direct him to be released and set at liberty forthwith VARADARAJAN This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> in Criminal Appeal No of and Confirmation Case No of dismissing the appeal and confirming the sentence of death awarded to the first accused <NAME> hereinafter referred to as the appellant by the Additional Sessions Judge Pune in Sessions Case No of <NAME> elder brother <NAME> <NAME> is a resident of Pune where he is doing business in the sale of plastic bags for the manufacture of which he has a plastic factory called <ORG> at Beed After <NAME> passed her Sc degree examination in her marriage with the appellant was settled by a formal betrothal ceremony which took place in June <NAME> has stated inter alia that she was feeling lonely though all persons in pune were very good and everybody was loving and that one reason is that there are many elderly persons in the house and therefore she does not dare to do any work independently and the fear which is in her mind every time leads to confusion The appellant reached the flat about minutes later by a scooter whom the night watchman remarked that he was coming rather late he told <NAME> it was because he had a meeting He opined that she might have died three or four hours earlier and stated that there was no external evidence showing the cause of death each under IPC but did not award any sentence under read with The appellant and the other two accused filed appeals against their conviction and the sentences awarded to them The <ORG> filed a criminal revision application for enhancement of the sentence awarded to accused and Hence the appellant alone has come up before this Court on special leave against his conviction and the sentence of death I had the benefit of reading the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> I agree with his final conclusion that the appeal should succeed My learned brother <NAME> <NAME> has rightly rejected every one of those circumstances as not conclusively pointing to the guilt of the appellant including the circumstance that the appellant was last seen with <NAME> before her death on the ground that the case of the prosecution based on evidence of Dr <NAME> that there was any mechanical suffocation of <NAME> has been disbelieved by <ORG> itself and that some entries in the carbon copy Ex of report sent to the Chemical Examiner had been scored and interpolated after his report Ex that he wrote the words time of death twice and not the words can be a case of suicidal death and therefore he scored off one of them is not acceptable at all In these circumstances unless the prosecution excludes the possibility of <NAME> having committed suicide by consuming potassium cyanide poison as rightly pointed out by my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> no adverse inference of guilt can be drawn against the appellant from the fact that he was last seen with <NAME> he being no other than her own husband who is naturally expected to be with her during nights With respect to the learned judges of <ORG> in my view by no stretch of imagination can any of these circumstances be considered to point to nothing but the guilt of the appellant in a case resting purely on circumstantial evidence However since I am unable to persuade myself to agree with my learned brother <NAME> on four points I am writing this separate but concurring judgment giving my view on those points namely ill treatment of <NAME> by the appellant intimacy of the appellant with <NAME> admissibility of <NAME> letters Exs My learned brother <NAME> <NAME> has observed as follows at pages and of his judgment On the other hand the plea of the defence was that while there was a strong possibility of <NAME> having been ill treated and uncared for by her husband and her in laws being a highly sensitive and impressionate woman she committed suicide out of sheer depression and frustration arising from an emotional upsurge Thus there is no acceptable evidence on record to show that either the appellant or his parents ill treat <NAME> even if there is any evidence about any ill treatment of <NAME> by the appellant or his parents it has to be completely excluded from consideration On this point there is the evidence of <NAME> There is no other evidence regarding this alleged illicit intimacy between the appellant and <NAME> The alleged incident in the <NAME>earl Hotel<NAME> according to the case of the prosecution took place on But there is no reference whatever to any such incident in any of the subsequent three letters of <NAME><NAME> Exs However<NAME> at page he has stated that it has been proved to some extent that the appellant had some sort of intimacy with <NAME> and it had embittered the relationship between the appellant and <NAME> Thus<NAME> there is absolutely no reliable or admissible evidence on record to show that the appellant had any intimacy with <NAME> <NAME> Statements written or verbal of relevant facts made by a person who is dead or who cannot be found or who has become incapable of giving evidence or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the Court unreasonable are themselves relevant facts in the following cases When the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death in cases in which the cause of that person death comes into question The oral evidence of these witnesses and these three letters are not as to the cause of <NAME> death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in her death during that night But where there are special circumstances which give a guarantee of trustworthiness to the testimony it is admitted even though it comes from a second hand source Page What is relevant and admissible under clause of this section Section is the statements actually made by the deceased as to the cause of his death or of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death Page A statement must be as to the cause of the declarant death or as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death i the cause and circumstances of the death and not previous or subsequent transaction such independent transactions being excluded as not falling within the principle of necessary on which such evidence is received When a person is not proved to have died as a result of injuries received in the incident in question his statement cannot be said to be a statement as to the cause of his death or as to any of the circumstances which resulted in his death Where there is nothing to show that the injury to which a statement in the dying declaration relates was the cause of the injured person death or that the circumstances under which it was received resulted in his death the statement is not admissible under this clause Page Circumstances of the transaction resulting in his death This clause refers to two kinds of statements i when the statement is made by a person as to the cause of his death or ii when the statement is made by a person as to any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death The expression any of the circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death is wider in scope than the expression the cause of his death Lord <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> has however made it abundantly clear that except in special circumstances no circumstance could be a circumstance of the transaction if it is not confined to either the time actually occupied by the transaction resulting in death or the sense in which the actual transaction resulting in death took place It is confined to only such statements as relate to matters so closely connected with the events which resulted in his death that may be said to relate to circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death Circumstances of the transaction which resulted in his death means only such facts or series or facts which have a direct or organic relation to death Page Circumstances must have some proximate relation to the actual occurrence and must be of the transaction which resulted in the death of the declarant It is not necessary that statement must be made after the transaction has taken place or that the person making it must be near death or that the circumstance can only include the acts done when and where the death was caused It has been suggested that the statement must be made after the transaction has taken place that the person making it must be at any rate near death that the circumstances can only include the acts done when and where the death was caused But statements made by the deceased that he was proceeding to the spot where he was in fact killed or as to his reasons for so proceeding or that he was going to meet a particular person or that he had been invited by such person to meet him would each of them be circumstances of the transaction and would be so whether the person was unknown or was not the person accused But in the carbon copy of the report which was sent to <NAME> Ex he has written caught between the teeth in ink but in the original there is something else It is obvious that in the carbon copy which was retained by the Doctor the entries must have been made after the copy was sent to <NAME> The fact that <ORG> has rejected the case of the prosecution based on Dr <NAME> report and evidence that it was also a case of mechanical suffocation is not one that could be taken into consideration as a mitigating circumstance in judging the conduct of the Doctor who had conducted the autopsy in a case of suspicious death I agree with my learned brother <NAME> that <ORG> has clearly misdirected itself on many points in appreciating the evidence and has thus committed a gross error of law I feel that something has to be stated in the judgment in this case about the way the Investigating officer and the learned Additional Sessions Judge Pune who had tried the case had gone about a their business It is the case of the prosecution itself that <NAME> informed the police accordingly at or a on that day after receipt of telephonic instructions from the third accused at a though he had himself seen the dead body of <NAME> earlier in the appellant flat where he was taken by the third accused who had gone to his flat at about or a and informed him that <NAME> was dead and he <NAME> left the appellant flat a little later at about or a after telling Dr <NAME> that he was going to report to the police lays down that in every inquiry or trial for the purpose of enabling the accused personally to explain any circumstance appearing in the evidence against him the Court may at any stage without previously warning the accused put such questions to him as the court considers necessary and shall after the witnesses for the prosecution have been examined and before he is called for his defence question him generally on the case In the end as I said earlier I agree with my learned brother <NAME> that the appeal has to be allowed Accordingly I allow the appeal and set aside the conviction and sentence awarded to the appellant and direct him to be set at liberty forthwith <NAME> <NAME> I have the advantage of having read the judgments prepared by my learned brothers <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> I agree with the order proposed that the appeal should be allowed and the judgments of the courts below should be set aside and the appellant <NAME> be acquitted of the charges framed against him and he should be released forth with The facts and circumstances have been exhaustively and very minutely detailed in the judgment of my learned Brother <NAME> <NAME> Those have also been set out to certain extent by my Brother <NAME> <NAME> It will therefore serve no useful purpose to repeat these here There is no evidence that the accused was in any way hostile or inamicable towards his sister There is no direct evidence of administering poison There is no evidence either way that either the deceased or the accused had in her or his possession any potassium cyanide As I have mentioned before I have read the two judgments by my two learned brothers and on some points namely four points mentioned in the judgment prepared by my Brother <NAME> On the three points namely ill treatment of <NAME> by the appellant intimacy of the appellant with <NAME> and the conduct of Dr <NAME> who had conducted autopsy on the body of <NAME> I would prefer the views expressed by my learned brother <NAME> On the question of admissibility of <NAME> letters Exs For instance where the death takes place within a very short time of the marriage or the distance of time is not spread over more than months the statement may be admissible under Emphasis by me I would however like to state here that this approach should be taken with great deal of caution and care and though I respectfully agree with <NAME> that the test of proximity cannot and should not be too literally construed and be reduced practically to a cut and dried formula of universal application but it must be emphasised that whenever it is extended beyond the immediate it should be the exception and must be done with very great caution and care As a general proposition it cannot be laid down for all purposes that for instance where a death takes place within a short time of marriage and the distance of time is not spread over three or four months the statement would be admissible under section of the Evidence Act I however respectfully agree with my learned brother when he says that a close analysis and ading of the letter namely Ex that there was a clear tendency resulting from her psychotic nature to end her life or commit suicide Similarly I have some hesitation about the English rendering of Ex which is letter dated th June which has been set out by my learned brother and which has been set out in his judgment which contains the expression I do not know why there is such a dirty atmosphere in the house As the original letter was read out in Court and we had the advantage of that I am inclined to take the view that the correct and the more expressive expression would be I do not know why there is such a foul atmosphere in the house Read in that light and in the context of other factors this letter causes some anxiety In that view of the matter I agree with my learned brothers that the guilt of the accused has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt In the premises as indicated before I agree with the order proposed
