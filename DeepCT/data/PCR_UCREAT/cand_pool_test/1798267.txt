The respondents filed their claims under clause with the Chief Engineer denying their liability to pay any such charges because the <ORG> did not supply constant supply as provided in clause In these appeals by Special Leave it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the constant supply men tioned in clause I cannot mean continuous supply The inabil ity of the <ORG> to supply electrical energy due to power cut or any other circumstance beyond its control as per the demand of the consumer according to the contract will be reflected in and considered as a circumstance beyond the control of the consumer which prevented it from consum ing electricity as per the contract and to the extent it wanted to consume The common question which arises in all these SLPs is that under the agreement arrived at between the consumers and <ORG> there is a clause Of payment of minimum guarantee which indicates that even if the consumer does not consume electricity above the minimum guarantee that it will be incumbent upon the consumer to pay charges for energy which is the annual minimum guarantee provided in the agreement pertaining to Industrial units The relevant facts are that for the years to the bills for annual minimum guarantee were served on the appellants by <ORG> Forbesganj and on receipt thereto the appellants filed their claims as provided under clause of the agreement on the ground that appellant was not liable to pay any such charges because the appellant did not supply constant electricity as provided in the agreement during the period in question and there were tripping load shedding and power cut which resulted in a great loss to the petitioners and as the supply was not in accordance with the agreement liability to pay annual minimum guarantee bills could not be fastened on the consumer The Chief Engineer who was the authority under the agreement negatived the claim and so they filed writ petitions in <ORG> It was also contended that clause of the agreement clearly talks of the payment of annual minimum guarantee charges and there fore it could not be said that because of the power cut or situations beyond the control of <ORG> if the power could not be supplied for all the hours every day the respondent consumer can deny the liability to pay annual minimum guar antee bills It was also contended that in view of clause of the agreement which provides that if there was shortage of supply and that shortage resulted in short supply then the consumer was entitled to a proportionate reduction of the annual minimum guarantee bill as determined by the Chief Engineer <ORG> and consequently the respondent in this case went to the Chief Engineer who ultimately decided on the basis of facts that respondents were not entitled to any proportionate reduction and it was because of this that the petitions were filed before <ORG> Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand contended that clause provides for constant supply of power the variations permitted have been indicated in this clause itself and it is contended that it is only where <ORG> discharges its duty to supply power as contemplated in clause and the consumer because of his difficulties is not able to utilise power even upto the level of minimum guarantee that the liability to pay annual minimum guarantee bills could be fastened on the consumer but if the <ORG> fails to discharge its responsibilities as contemplated in clause of the agreement it could not compel the consumer to pay the annual minimum guarantee It was frankly conceded that in the petition itself originally relief sought was proportionate reduction of the annual minimum guarantee bills but in view of the interpretation of clauses and <ORG> came to the conclusion that there is no liability on the consumer to pay annual minimum guarantee bills as the Electricity <ORG> has failed to supply power as contemplated in clause of the agree ment Clause of the agreement provides for the minimum guarantee and there is no dispute that if the consumer is not able to utilise electricity even upto the level of minimum guarantee This clause provides for payment of charges of minimum guarantee SCR this <ORG> had the occasion to consider a situation of this kind where this <ORG> on this aspect of the matter has observed that where <ORG> fails to supply power because of shortage of energy power cut or any other circumstances as per demand of the consumer according to the contract it will be considered as a circumstance beyond the control of the consumer which prevented it from consuming electricity as per the contract Their Lordships observed as under We are therefore of the view that the inability of the <ORG> to supply electric energy due to power cut or any other circum stance beyond its control as per the demand of the consumer according to the contract will be reflected in and considered as a circumstance beyond the control of the consumer which prevented it from consuming electricity as per the contract and to the extent it wanted to consume It appears that reading clause in the present case clear ly provides for the contingency and it provides for the failure on the part of the supplier and also failure on the part of consumer in the circumstances like strike riot fire flood explosion or act of God or any other reason beyond the control of either of the parties In clause of the agreement this is clearly stated that the authority competent to determine the proportionate reduction is the Chief Engineer and it appears that it was because of this that the respondents consumers approached the Chief Engineer for consideration
