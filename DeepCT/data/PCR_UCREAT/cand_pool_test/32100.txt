Their Lordships have to dispose of two consolidated appeals from a judgment of <ORG> at Patna dated November dealing with certain questions referred to the <ORG> by the Commissioner of Income tax Bihar and Orissa under Section of the Indian Income tax Act The assessee then required the Commissioner under Section to refer to <ORG> certain questions purporting to be questions of law arising out of his order As the assessee was held not to be carrying on the business of moneylending he was assessed in respect of these transactions not under Section which provides for the computation of the profits or gains of a business but under Section which provides for the computation of income profits and gains from other sources This allocation is not necessarily made in the year in which the money has actually been paid to the assessee Fasli being the income of the year of account with which their Lordships are concerned in this appeal the assessing officer again took first the amount shown as credited in that year in the interest register but on this occasion less the sums which he had in the previous year taken into account from the deposit register and which now appeared in the interest register he next examined the deposit register and in the case of sums there shown as received in Fasli but from which the assessee had made no allocation to interest account he himself calculated the proportion of each receipt which represented interest and added the result to the figure obtained under the deduction stated from the interest register The Commissioner states as follows the general question which in these circumstances arises for decision The Commissioner has not attached numbers to the various questions and their Lordships have found it convenient to number those which they have had to consider in the order in which they have dealt with them What the officer is directed to compute is not the assessee receipts but the assessee income and in dubio what the assessee himself chooses to treat as income may well be taken to be income and to arise when he so chooses to treat it The assessee appropriated the whole of the first of these sums to interest and no question arises with regard to it In the circumstances of this case what portion of the amount received from <NAME> in the previous year is legally taxable no sums had been attributed by the assessee to interest out of the payments made to him by the debtor down to the date of the receipt by him from the debtor of the sum of Rs So far as the assessee interest register showed he had not treated himself as having received any interest and so far as that book which he put forward to the revenue authorities as showing the interest which he had received is concerned there was still outstanding the whole sum of Rs In disposing of the first question dealt with above their Lordships have held that the assessee cannot complain if sums which he himself in a particular year treats in his interest register as interest received in that year are also treated by the revenue authorities as income of that year although such sums were in fact received in previous years What is the amount of profits and gains arising out of the payments made by this judgment debtor legally taxable in this year Passing to the further questions raised in the case and omitting a transaction relating to a loan to a Colonel <NAME> as to which the assessee has acquiesced in the decision of <ORG> their Lordships have next to consider the estimate made by the income tax officer of the income received by the assessee in the year of computation from the purchase of properties under mortgage decrees Learned counsel for the assesses has argued that the officer is not entitled to make a guess without evidence and I agree with that contention but in this case the state of affairs in the previous years coupled with the fact that the assessee had a large mortgage loan business and must have enforced mortgages by sale on many occasions afford ample material for the assessment made I would answer the question in the affirmative The other Judges concurred and their Lordships also agree adding only that if the assessee wished to displace the taxing officer estimate it was open to him to adduce evidence of all his purchase transactions during the year and of the financial results thereof which he apparently made no attempt to do The duty of <ORG> under Section is to decide the questions of law raised by the case referred to them by the Commissioner and it is for the Commissioner to state formally the questions which arise There is of course no doubt that a liability to pay interest like a liability to make any other payment may be satisfied by a transference of assets other than cash and a receipt in kind may be taxable income In that case apart from other specialities there was no settlement but merely an open payment to account Here there was an arrangement affecting the whole indebtedness whereby certain assets were accepted in part satisfaction and promissory notes were taken for the balance The Mecca A and there is authority for the proposition that in a question with the revenue the taxpayer is entitled to appropriate payments as between capital and interest in the manner least disadvantageous to himself <NAME> Law Guarantee and Trust Society Limited Ch In the result their Loadships are of opinion that having regard to the nature of the transaction the assessee is entitled to say that he has accepted the first six items in discharge pro tanto of his debtor capital liability and that the capital debt now stands discharged to that extent The Judges of <ORG> agreeing with the Commissioner expressed the view that if there was any receipt of interest it was attributable to the year The assessee subsequently discovered that there were arrears of fixed or dead rent due to the superior landlord to the extent of Rs In this instance their Lordships are concerned with the computation of the profits or losses of a business under Section of the Act for the assessee was carrying on the business of a colliery owner Whether the assessee is legally entitled to deduct the arrears of royalty which had accrued in previous years up to the date of his possession The relevant provisions of the Indian Income tax Act are contained in Section which enacts in Sub section that the profits or gains of a business shall be computed after making the following allowances namely > i any rent paid for the premises in which such business is carried on ix any expenditure not being in the nature of capital expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of earning such profits or gains The Commissioner was of opinion that the question which he had stated should be answered in the negative on the two grounds that admittedly the assessee was entitled to recover from <NAME> the arrears of rent for the period prior to the assessee possession and that royalties were not rent within the statutory meaning <ORG> answered the question in the affirmative holding that royalties may properly be considered as rent that it was a condition without which further mining operations could not be effected that payment should be made of the arrears which were of the nature of a charge in the year and that as the previous tenants had not paid their rent during the period in arrear they had not been able to deduct rent in their returns and there was no reason why when the arrears came to be paid they should not be deducted as though they had accrued in the year in which they were paid It is not rent for any period of his possession nor is it an expenditure incurred by the assessee for the purpose of earning the profits or gains of the colliery business Their Lordships are therefore of opinion that in the circumstances of this transaction the question should be answered in the negative Their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that in these consolidated appeals the appeal of the Commissioner of Income tax so far as relating to the seventh question as above numbered be allowed the judgment of <ORG> reversed and the order of the Commissioner of May restored and as regards the other question on which he appealed be dismissed the appeal of the Maharajadhiraj of Darbhanga be dismissed and the case be referred back to <ORG> in order that effect may be given to the order to be pronounced herein by His Majesty in Council
