Before we consider this case of the claimant we shall briefly state the arguments advanced by the counsel for the appellant Had that not been the position there was no need for the <ORG> to allow the appellant to cross examine the witnesses with permission the counsel submits He has a further case that in any event in view of Clause of the conditions incorporated in the policy the appellant has every right to take up the defence the insured ordinarily can take in a case like this We shall now consider the argument based on Section A Section A reads Where in the course of any inquiry <ORG> is satisfied that i there is collusion between the person making the claim and the person against whom the claim is made or ii the person against whom the claim is made has failed to cbntest the claim it may for reasons to be recorded by it in writing direct that the insurer who may be liable in respect of such claim shall be impleaded as a party to the proceeding and the insurer so impleaded shall thereupon have the right to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that are available to the person against whom the claim has been made This section provides that where in the course of any enquiry <ORG> is either satisfied that there was collusion between the claimant and the person against whom the claim was made or the person against whom the claim was made had failed to contest the claim then the <ORG> for reasons to be recorded in writing can direct that the insurer who will be liable in respect of the claim shall be impleaded as a party to the proceeding and the insurer so impleaded has the right to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that are available to the insured This sub section would suggest that an order under this section enabling an insurer to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that are available to the insured can be passed by the <ORG> only as a sequel to the order directing impleadment of the insurer he would pass on his being satisfied that either there is collusion between the claimant and the insured or the insured has failed to contest the claim the counsel representing the con testing respondents submit This sub section in our view was introduced to safeguard the interests of the insurer which going by Section is not entitled to take any defence which is not specified therein Apart from Section an insurer had no right to get itself impleaded as a party to the action by the claimant against the insured causing the injury In short the only method of avoiding the liability provided for under Sub section is setting up the defences enumerated therein However a literal adherence to the words used in the section namely that an insurer who may be liable in respect of such claim shall be impleaded as a party to the proceeding and the insurer so impleaded shall thereupon have the right to contest would result in the insurer who had already been impleaded under Section not getting a chance to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds available to the insured even if it is established that the insured is hand and glove with the claimant and as such not contesting the claim We therefore are of the view that the insurer who is already a party to the claim petition having been impleaded under Section can also avail of this defence Such an insurer accordingly can move the <ORG> under this sub section and obtain the requisite permission to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds the insured would take If the insurer makes an application in this regard the <ORG> shall consider the same on merits after notice to the claimant and insured and pass appropriate orders in writing enabling the insurer to contest the claim on the grounds available to the insured In the present case there is nothing on record to show that the insurerappellant has obtained such permission from the <ORG> and if that be so the insurer appellant is not entitled to contest the claim on the grounds that are available only to the insured Clause reads No admission offer promise payment or indemnity shall be made or given by or on behalf of the insured without the written consent of the Company which shall be entitled if it so desires to take over and conduct in the name of the <ORG> the defence or settlement of any claim or to prosecute in the name of the <ORG> for its own benefit any claim for indemnity or damages or otherwise and shall have full discretion in the conduct of any proceedings or in the settlement of any claim and the insured shall give all such information and assistance as the Company may require In our view the decision of <ORG> does not lend support to the view taken by <ORG> which provides the basis for the above observation of <ORG> A reference in this connection to the following observations of <ORG> in <ORG> case is profitable at There is another ground on which the learned Solicitor General supported the contention that all defences are open to an insurer excepting those taken away by Sub section He said that before the Act came into force an injured person had no right of recourse to the insurer and that it was Section that made the judgment obtained by the injured person against the assured binding on the insurer and gave him a right against the insurer He then said that that being so it is only fair that a person sought to be made bound by a judgment should be entitled to resist his liability under it by all defences which he can in law advance against the passing of it The Statute has no doubt created a liability in the insurer to the injured person but the statute has also expressly confined the right to avoid that liability to certain grounds specified in it It is not for us to add to those grounds and therefore to the statute for reasons of hardship <ORG> thereafter stated as follows at We are furthermore not convinced that the statute causes any hardship First the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge He can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and this he has full liberty to do Whatever that be the positive declaration of <ORG> namely the Statute has no doubt created a liability in the insurer to the injured person but the statute has also expressly confined the right to avoid that liability to certain grounds specified in it It is not for us to add to those grounds and therefore to the statute for reasons of hardship disentitles the appellant to rely on Clause of the Insurance policy and contend for the position that the said clause reserves its right to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that are available to the insured Sub section A of Section I as construed by us entitled the insurer to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds available to the insured provided the <ORG> grants the requisite permission in terms of the said subsection to the insurer to take up the said defence There is another aspect that should be borne in mind while considering this question and it is this The policy issued by the insurer is a policy of insurance in respect of Third party risk arising out of the use of motor vehicles such as complies with the requirements of Chapter VIII of the Act and includes unless the context requires otherwise a cover note That means any clause or condition in the policy can have force only subject to the provisions contained in Chapter VIII of the Act It therefore follows that an insurer with the permission of the <ORG> alone can contest the claim on all or any of the grounds the insured can raise against the claim
