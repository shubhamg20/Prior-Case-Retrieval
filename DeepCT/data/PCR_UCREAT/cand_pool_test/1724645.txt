Another fact necessary to bear in mind is that the ministrations in the <NAME> temples are entirely in the hands of the direct descendants of the founder and the Gossains of his Kul are the preceptors of the cult taught by him The temple which forms the subject matter of dispute in the present case is stated to have been built about the time of the Indian Mutiny by one <NAME> a descendent of <NAME> and thus a member of his <NAME> He left a widow <NAME> and two daughters <NAME> and <NAME> On the th of August <NAME> was added as a defendant to the suit of Mumsamat <NAME> sons He further alleged that according to the custom in force among the Ballavacharyas daughter sons did not belong to their <ORG> and were debarred from taking part in the ministrations at the temple for the benefit of the worshippers and he claimed that as a collateral relative of <NAME> in the male line he was entitled to succeed him as <NAME> His decision has been affirmed on appeal by <ORG> This rule must from the very nature of the right be subject to the condition that the devolution in the ordinary line of descent is not inconsistent with or opposed to the purpose the founder had in view in establishing the worship But to allow the plaintiffs claim to an admittedly Ballav temple where the rites are performed according to Ballav ritual which it is clearly established they cannot perform would in their Lordships judgment defeat the purpose for which the worship was established It seems to their Lordships that apart from the statements contained in <NAME> letter on which the defendant relied in his written statement he has a clear title according to the customs and usages of <ORG> to the shebaitship of the temple in suit
