They further contend that the injured person being a passenger is not a third party and there is no statutory liability on the part of <ORG> to give compensation to the injured person and that the policy itself does not cover risk to the passenger of the car Clause is as follows Subject to the limits of liability the <ORG> will indemnify the <ORG> against all surri including claimant costs and expenses which the <ORG> shall become legally liable to pay in respect of i death of or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the motor vehicle ii Provided always that a Except so far as is necessary to meet the requirements of Section of the Motor Vehicles Act the <ORG> shall not be liable in respect of death of or bodily injury to any person in the employment of <ORG> arising out of and in the course of such employment He has to look for his compensation to the employer that is the insured and he has to take appropriate proceedings under the Workmen Compensation Act It is further contended that when there is a definite contract between the insured and <ORG> to exclude certain persons who are employed under him then such injured persons cannot claim compensation from <ORG> in respect of injuries caused to them There may be some force in the contention urged by learned Counsel for the appellant still we have to consider and examine the provisions in the Motor Vehicles Act which provide for the insurance of third parties In this connection it is useful to refer to the provisions of Section of the Act In order to comply with the requirements of this Chapter a policy of insurance must be a policy which a insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in Sub section against any liability which may be incurred by him or them in respect of the death of bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place Provided that a policy shall not be required i to cover liability in respect of the death A I ing out of and in the course of his employment of the employee of a person insured by the policy or in respect of bodily injury sustained by such an employee arising out of and in the course of his employment other than a liability arising under the Workmen Compensation Act in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any such employee He has also got a further right to claim compensation under the Workmen Compensation Act In the instant case when the injured man is employed under one who has insured his vehicle and when he sustains an injury in the course of an accident to the vehicle though he has right to get compensation under the Workmen Compensation Act it is not necessary for him to go to <ORG> when he had the right to claim compensation along with his employer under the Motor Vehicles Act Though the employer has got a liability under the general law to pay compensation to the injured person since the employer happens to be the insured as in this case as per the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act <ORG> has to indemnify the employer in spite of the fact that there are provisions in the Policy to exclude a liability of this kind It has been specifically stated that under Section of the Act in order to comply with the requirements of the Chapter relating to insurance of Motor Vehicles against third parties the policy of insurance must be a policy which should comply with the requirements of the Act It is true that Section of the Act gives <ORG> the right to be made a party to defend the action The principle that has been laid down in <ORG> decision is that on the construction of Section <ORG> whenever they are made a party in a claim petition have only the defences enumerated in Section and beyond that they cannot question the award of compensation There appears to be no reason to interfere with the quantum of compensation awarded by the <ORG>
