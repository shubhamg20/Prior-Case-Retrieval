HEADNOTE Sub section Of of the Indian Income tax Act provided the Income tax officer may on his own motion rectify any mistake apparent from the record and shall rectify any such mistake which has been brought to his notice by an assesses Provided that no such rectification shall be made having the effect of enhancing or reducing a refund unless the Income tax Officer has given notice to the assessee of his On August the appellant made an application before the Income tax Officer for rectification of the order under of the Act pointing out certain mistakes in calculation in regard to the depreciation amount The appellant challenged the order dated February on the grounds inter alia that he was not given a written notice of the intended rectification of the written down value that the provisions under which the Income tax Officer acted i of the Act was not meant for the purpose of making corrections in written down values the correct provision being which specifically refers to excessive depreciation and that in any case he had exceeded his jurisdiction under of the Act in calculating the depreciation on the written down value of the buildings and machinery of the appellant acting suo motu and that he could correct only those mistakes which had been pointed out by it It was found that notice was given to the appellant of the intended determination of the written down value though it was not a written notice and that the matter was discussed with its representative that the word record used in the phrase mistake apparent from the record in I of the Act refers not only to the order of assessment but comprises all proceedings on which the assessment order is based and the Income tax Officer is entitled for the purpose of exercising his jurisdiction under to look into the whole evidence and the law applicable to ascertain whether there was an error A mistake contemplated by this section is not one which is to be discovered as a result of an argument but it is open to the Income tax Officer to examine the record including the evidence and if he discovers any mistake he is entitled to rectify the error provided that if the result is enhancement of assessment or reducing the refund then notice has to be given to the assessee and he should be allowed a reasonable opportunity of being heard The appellant before us is a private limited company carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling textiles and the respondent is the Income tax Officer of <ORG> Previous to the year in <ORG> which became a part of the State of Saurashtra there was no income tax On August the appellant made an application for rectification under of the Act The reasons for calculating them on the new basis were set out by the Income tax Officer in his order dated May and they were Less Depreciation On August the appllant made an application under for certain corrections in the calculations and the order thereon was passed on February but no written notice of the intended rectifi cation of the Written Down Value and the depreciation amount was given by the Income tax Officer to the appellant under read with of the Act The appellant requested the Income tax Officer to cancel his previous order and to pass a fresh order correcting onlv those mistakes which had been pointed out by it On the same day the appellant sent another letter asking for the cancellation of the provisional assessment order for and requested for a revised assessment order on the basis of the return filed by it The reply of the Income tax Officer of the same date was that the order was correct and a similar order was made on the second application in regard to the assessment of On April the appellant filed a petition in <ORG> under Arts The appellant has come to this Court by special leave and three questions were raised that no notice as required under was given to the appellant that there was no record on the basis of which the rectifica tion in the Written Down Value of the property could be made and that there was no mistake apparent from the record of the Constitution is a discretionary remedy and <ORG> has always the discretion to refuse to grant any writ if it is satisfied that the aggrieved party can have an adequate or suitable relief elsewhere In this connection the learned Attorney General has further submitted that the order determining the depreciation amount allowable was not final that the effect of the order making the rectification was not of enhancing the assessment or reducing the refund and that the question of depreciation could be raised at the time of assessment in any subsequent year The depreciation allowed to the appellant in the year of assessment when the appellant was assessed as a non resident was Rs In the year there was a loss which was much more than what was allowable on the Written Down Values determined in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance which defined Written Down Value Written Down Value means a In the case of assets acquired in the previous year the actual cost to the assessee In the case of assets acquired before the previous year the actual cost to the assessee less all depreciation actually allowed to him under this Ordinance or allowed under any Act repealed hereby or which would have been allowed to him if the Indian Income tax Act was in force in past On the basis of this Ordinance and the other Statutes and Rules mentioned in his affidavit which have been set out above the Income tax Officer made the various calculations and determined the depreciation amounts which have given rise to the controversy before us But it was argued by counsel for the appellant that according to of the Act the Written Down Value in the case of assets acquired before the previous year mean the actual cost to the assessee less all depreciation actually allowed to him under the Act or under any Act repealed thereby and therefore the provisions of the Saurashtra Ordinance which came to an end when the Act became applicable cannot form the basis of determining the Written Down Value for the purposes of assessment of the years onwards In reply it was submitted that the Written Down Values were calculated and depreciation deter mined for the year and should in subsequent years have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance and they could not become higher for purposes of of the Act merely because the Ordinance was replaced by the Act In this connection reference was made to of the Finance Act of which empowered <ORG> to make provision for the removal of difficulties in giving effect to the provisions of any of the Acts Rules or Orders extended by or of that Act i Finance Act but we are informed that one of those judgments is under appeal to this Court and we therefore do not wish to express any opinion upon the cor rectness or otherwise of this contention raised by the appellant for himself what the actual cost of the machinery had been and that depreciation had to be calculated for every year and it was open to the Income tax Officer not merely to perform a mathematical operation on I The limit to which the Income tax Officer can go back does not stop at the Written Down Value of the previous year but extends up to the figure of the original cost and the method enjoined by is not that the Income tax Officer should merely scale down the Written Down Value of the previous year but that he should take into consideration the actual cost determining it for himself if necessary take also into consideration the allowances granted in the past and then make his own computation as to the Written Down Value for the assessment year with which be is concerned Thus it cannot be said that merely because under some Written Down Value and the depreciation amount have been determined they are a final determination binding for all times to come nor does the determination operate as estoppel or resjudicata for the following years Therefore it cannot be said that there is no other efficacious and adequate remedy open to the appellant to challenge the depreciation amount determined under There are two sections under which an Income tax Officer can act i ss and and the question for decision that arises is whether was open to him Section provides The Commissioner or Appellate Assistant Commissioner may at any time within four years from the date of any order passed by him in appeal or in the case of the Commissioner in revision under section A and the Income tax Officer may at any time within four years from the date of any assessment order or refund order passed by him on his own motion rectify any mistake apparent from the record of the appeal revision assessment or refund as the case may be and shall within the like period rectify any such mistake which has been brought to his notice by an assessee The words used in the section are apparent from the record and the record does not mean only the order of assessment but it comprises all proceedings on which the assessment order is based and the Income tax Officer is entitled for the purpose of exercising his jurisdiction under to look into the whole evidence and the law applicable to ascertain whether there was an error their lordship opinion the case clearly would have fallen within the provisions of section had the Income tax Officer exercised his powers under the section within one year from the date on which the earlier demand was served upon the respondents It was held that under the <ORG> was entitled to rectify the mistake and was competent to pass a consequential order dismissing the appeal instead of allowing it SUPREME COURT REPORTS mistake he is entitled to rectify the error provided that if the result is enhancement of assessment or reducing the refund then notice has to be given to the assessee and he should be allowed a reasonable opportunity of being heard Subsequently there was an amendment of the Act by which the interest became allowable only on the difference between the amount of tax paid and what was actually determined If that be the true position then the order which he made giving credit to the If a mistake of fact apparent from the record of the assessment order can be rectified under we see no reason why a mistake of law which is glaring and obvious cannot be similarly rectified tax Officer had found that in the assessment year there was an apparent arithmetical mistake in the account of the Written Down Value of the pro In our opinion this appeal is without force and we would therefore dismiss it with costs
