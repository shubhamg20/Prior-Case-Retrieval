Before the appellants deposited the amount the respondents who were pre emptors of an equal degree filed a suit to enforce their right of pre emption The appellants contended that the land could be divided between two equal pre emptors only when both the suits were pending before the court at the time of the passing of the decree and that the appellants having obtained the decree and paid the amount got substituted in place of the vendees and the respondents could succeed only by establishing a superior right of pre emption The respondents countered that they had a statutory right under Of the Punjab Pre emption Act to share the land with the appellants and that the appellants having been substituted in place of the vendees Pendente lite were hit by the doctrine of lis pendens and could not claim a higher right than the vendees Held that the respondents suit could not succeed as they lid not have a superior right of pre emption over the appellants who had become substituted in place of the vendees upon payment of the purchase money under their decree This right is lost if before he exercises it another person with an equal or superior right has been substituted in place of the original vendee It does not enlarge the content of this right nor does it introduce any change in the incidents of the right Consequently the appellants were not hit by the doctrine of lis pentlens and they acquired an indefeasible right to the land when they took possession of it after depositing the purchase money in court A conditional decree whereunder the pre emptor gets possession only if he pays a specified amount within a prescribed time and which also provides for the dismissal of the suit in case the condition is not fulfilled cannot bring about the substitution of the decree holder for the vendee before the condition is fulfilled Appeal by Special Leave from the judgment and decree dated April of the former <ORG> in A Nos and of arising out of the judgment and decree dated March of <ORG> Faridkot in Civil Appeal No of against the judgment and decree dated December of <ORG> Faridkot in File No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal by Special Leave against the judgment and decree of <ORG> and <ORG> raises an interesting question pertaining to the Law of Preemption Defendants to contested the suit inter alia on the grounds that the plaintiffs had no right of preemption superior to that of theirs that the suit was barred by limitation and that the whole of the sale consideration had been fixed in good faith and paid On the main issue he found that the said defendants by obtaining a decree for pre emption before the rival claimants had filed their suit had become vendees through <ORG> and so the plaintiffs could not succeed unless they had a superior right The plaintiffs preferred an appeal to On the main question he took the view that defendants to did not exercise their right of pre emption when the present suit was instituted for the reason that by the date of the filing of the suit they had not deposited the purchase money in <ORG> The High <ORG> upheld that part of the decree of the learned District Judge holding that the plaintiffs were entitled to a share in the suit property but remanded the suit to the District Judge to give his findings on the following two questions What was the amount paid by defendants to to the original vendees and whether they paid it in good faith Whether the case would come under cl of the Punjab Pre emption Act hereinafter to be referred to as the Act The learned Counsel for the respondents countered the aforesaid argument by stating that the plaintiffs being pre emptors of equal degree have got a statutory right under of the Pre emption Act to share the land with the appellants and the appellants having been substituted in place of the original vendees pendente lite are hit by the doctrine of lis pendens and therefore they cannot claim higher rights than those possessed by the original vendees at the time of the filing of the suit A concise but lucid statement of the law is given by <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> thus A preferential right to acquire land belonging to another person upon the occasion of a transfer by the latter does not appear to me to be either a right to or a right in that land The secondary right is to follow the thing sold when sold without the proper offer to the pre emptor and to acquire it if he thinks fit in spite of the sale made in disregard of his preferential right The general law of pre emption does not recognize any right to claim a share in the property sold when there are rival claimants Preference being the essence of the right the plaintiff must have a superior right to that of the vendee or the person substituted in his place Relevant provisions of the Act material to the present purpose read thus Section The right of pre emption shall mean the right of a person to acquire agricultural land or village immovable property or urban immovable property in preference to other persons and it arises in respect of such land only in the case of sales and in respect of such property only in the case of sales or of foreclosures of the right to redeem such property Section When any person proposes to sell any agricultural land or village immovable property or urban immovable property or to foreclose the right to redeem any village immovable property or urban immovable property in respect of which any persons have a right of preemption lie may give notice to all such persons of the price at which he is willing to sell such land or property or of the amount due in respect of the mortgage as the case may be Section The right of pre emption of any person shall be extinguished unless such person shall within the period of three months from the date on which the notice tinder section is duly given or within such further period not exceeding one year from such date as the court may allow present to the Court a notice for service on the vendor or mortgagee of his intention to enforce his right of pre emption The section does not confer the right on or against a person who has already exercised the right and ceased to be a preemptor by his being legitimately substituted in place of the original vendee Sections and prescribe the procedure for the exercise of the primary right while confers a power on the <ORG> to join together two or more suits arising out of the same sale so that suitable directions may be given in the decree in regard to the order in which each claimant is entitled to exercise the right Nor can we accept the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants that precludes the <ORG> from giving a decree for pre emption in a case where the two suits were not joined together but one of the suits was decreed separately We do not see that if the plaintiffs were entitled to a right of pre emption they would have lost it by the appellants obtaining a decree before the plaintiffs instituted the suit unless it be held that the decree itself had the effect of substituting them in place of the original vendees This leads us to the main question in this case namely whether the appellants having obtained a consent decree oil January in their suit against the vendees and having paid the amount due under the decree and having taken delivery of the property and thus having got themselves substituted in place of the original vendees can legitimately defeat the rights of the plaintiffs who by reason of the aforesaid substitution were only in the position of pre emptors of equal degree vis a vis the appellants and therefore ceased to have any superior rights It is now settled law in the Punjab that the rule of lis pendens is as much applicable to a suit to enforce the right of pre emption as to any other suit As a corollary to this rule it is laid down that this principle will not affect the right existing before the suit In that case during the pendency of a pre emption suit the vendee sold the property which was the subject matter of the litigation to a person possessing a right of pre emption equal to that of the pre emptor in recognition of that person right of pre emption At the time of the purchase by the person having a superior right of pre emption his right to enforce it was barred by limitation <ORG> held that that circumstance made a difference in the application of the rule of lis pendens Such transfer has not the effect of substituting the subsequent transferee in place of the vendee in the original bargain Even if lie is impleaded as a defendant in such suit he cannot be regarded as anything more than a representative in interest of the original vendee having no right to defend the suit except on the pleas that were open to such vendee himself This case therefore expressly introduces a new element in the applicability of the doctrine of lis pendens to a suit to enforce the pre emptive right There before the institution of the suit for pre emption an agreement to sell the property had been executed by the vendee in favour of another prospective pre emptor with an equal degree of right of pre emption subsequent to the institution of the suit in pursuance of the agreement a sale deed had been executed and registered in the latter favour after the expiry of the limitation for a suit to enforce his own pre emptive right We accept the view expressed by <ORG> and <ORG> in preference to that of <ORG> The appellants instituted their suit to pre empt the said sale on August and obtained a compromise decree on January It would be seen from the aforesaid facts that the appellants right of pre emption was clearly subsisting at the time when the appellants deposited the amount and took possession of the land for they not only filed the suit but obtained a decree therein and complied with the terms of the decree within the time prescribed thereunder VI doctrine of lis pendens and they acquired an indefeasible right to the suit land at any rate when they took possession of the land pursuant to the terms of the decree after depositing in <ORG> the balance of the amount due to the vendors A conditional decree such as that with which we are concerned whereunder a pre emptor gets possession only if he pays a specified amount within a prescribed time and which also provides for the dismissal of the suit in case the condition is not complied with cannot obviously bring about the substitution of the decreeholder in place of the vendee before the condition is complied with But as we have held that the appellants complied with the conditions laid down in the compromise decree they were substituted in the place of the vendee before the present suit was disposed of In the aforesaid view the other questions raised by the appellants do not arise for consideration In the result the appeal is allowed and the suit is dismissed with cost throughout
