The assessee is a company engaged in the business of manufacture of dressers cutting tools and lapping wheels which is a priority industry mentioned in Schedule to the Act Item The company had incurred losses in the earlier years and there was also unabsorbed depreciation of the earlier years Before the <ORG> the department contended that the income of the assessee from the priority industries though amounted to Rs The department also contended that even if there was income from the priority industries and the assessee was entitled to the deduction as claimed by it yet there would be no income liable to tax for the assessment year under appeal and that therefore it would not be possible to work out the relief as claimed by the assessee On the other hand the contention of the assessee was that there was a total income and whether the total income was a positive figure or a negative figure was not material but what was material was whether the income from priority industries was included in the total income or not and that if there was such inclusion the assessee would be entitled to the relief claimed by it It is the correctness of this conclusion of the <ORG> that is being challenged in the form of the question referred to this court extracted already In the case of a company to which this Section applies where the total income as computed in accordance with the other provisions of this Act includes any profits and gains attributable to the business of generation or distribution of electricity or any other form of power or of construction manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the Fifth Schedule there shall be allowed a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent This Section applies to a an Indian company or any other company which has made the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and payment of dividends including dividends on preference shares within India but does not apply to any Indian company referred to in Clause a or to any other company referred to in Clause if such Indian or other company is a company referred to in Section and its total income as computed before applying the provisions of Sub section does not exceed twenty five thousand rupees The language of this Section makes it clear that so long as the total income as computed in accordance with the other provisions of the Act includes any profits and gains attributable to the priority industries the assessee would be entitled to a rebate of per cent Simply as a matter of construction we arc of the opinion that as rightly pointed out by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner neither the residuary income nor the total income has any bearing on the question and that so long as the total income as computed under the provisions of the Act includes profits and gains attributable to the priority industries the assessee will be entitled to the rebate of per cent on the said profits and gains of the priority industries As a matter of fact the language of the Section will itself show that there is no scope for setting off of the earlier years losses or losses arising out of other business activities of the assessec against the profits and gains attributable to the priority industries In this particular case as we have pointed out already the Income tax Officer set off against the profits and gains of the priority industries amounting to Rs It will be observed that the deduction under Section referred to above is allowable in computing the profits and gains from the specified priority industries INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL INCOME AS COMPUTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE other PROVISIONS of the Income tax Act The effect of this provision is that the deduction under Section will be allowed from the profits from the specified priority industries as computed AFTER allowing all the deductions admissible in computing the business income under Sections to of the Income tax Act and also after giving effect to the relevant provisions for set off or carry forward of loss contained in Chapter VI of that Act In such a case a question may arise as to whether the loss of the relevant previous year under a head other than profits and gains of business or profession or the business loss carried forward from earlier years should be set off on a proportionate basis both against the profits from the specified priority industries and the profits from other business activities <ORG> held that the court was unable to agree with the views of <ORG> that the effect of the provision was that the deduction under Section would be allowed from the profits from the specified priority industries as computed after allowing all the deductions admissible in computing the business income under Sections to of the Act It is unnecessary for the purpose of the present case to discuss whether <ORG> was right in this view or not because so far as this case is concerned the profits and gains of the priority industry have been actually computed in accordance with the provisions contained in Sections to of the Act and such computation is not in controversy before this court Consequently the only other question with reference to the circular of <ORG> will be whether the losses of the earlier years could be set off against the profits and gains of the priority industries It is worthwhile pointing out that Sections and occur in Chapter VI under the heading Aggregation of income and sot off or carry forward of loss while the computation of total income arising from different sources occurs in Chapter IV under the heading Computation of total income containing Sections to When the Appellate Assistant Commissioner allowed the appeal preferred by the assessee no further controversy arose in that behalf before <ORG> and therefore we are not expressing any opinion on this aspect Under these circumstances we answer the question referred to this court in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee The assessee will be entitled to its costs Counsel fee is fixed at Rs
