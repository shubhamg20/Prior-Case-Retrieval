This appeal by special leave arises from the judgment of <ORG> made in Writ Appeal No of on March It is stated that after <ORG> had taken possession of the land from the respondents he had handed over the land to the appellant but actual date was not mentioned It is also stated by the appellants that thereafter plots were laid out and were allotted to its members and some members had started construction of their houses The respective contentions give rise to the question whether the view of <ORG> is correct in law The Land Acquisition Andhra Pradesh Amendment Act was enacted with a view to accelerate the pace of acquisitions to provide house sites to the poor and to empower the Collectors to issue notification under Section and the declaration under Section and their publication in the respective district Gazettes and to make payment of compensation to the lands so acquired if the compensation does not exceed Rs and in other cases in installments not exceeding Rs with interest at on such installments This led to further litigation Post notification delay of eight years due to inter departmental correspondence was pressed into service to hold that there was no real urgency They are two steps required to be taken under Section before taking further steps under sub section The time factor is not a vital element and there is no warrant to read the words simultaneously or immediately thereafter in Section If there is publication in the <ORG> and if there is public notice in the locality the requirements of Section must be held to be satisfied unless the two are unlinked from each other by a gap of time so long as it may lead one to the prima facie conclusion of lack of bona fides in the proceedings for acquisition It was held that when the Government exercises power under Section it obviously feels that urgency is such that it does not brook delay and therefore the Government directs that possession of the land be taken immediately on publication of the declaration under Section and followed by notice under Section Delay of eight years on the part of the tardy officials to take further action in the matter of acquisition is not sufficient to nullify the urgency which existed at the time of issuing the notification and to hold that there was never any urgency ln case the substance of such notification was not given in the locality within days from the date of the publication of the notification in the <ORG> it would introduce a fatal infirmity invaliding such notification Thereafter declaration should be published within one year from last of the dates of the publication under Section the question arose whether notification under Section and the declaration under Section get lapsed if the award is not made within two years as envisaged under Section A A Bench of three Judges had held that once possession was taken and the land vested in the <ORG> title to the land so vested in the State is subject only to determination of compensation and to pay the same to the owner Only Section gives power to withdrew from acquisition that too before possession is taken That question did not arise in this case The property under acquisition having been vested in the appellants in the absence of any power under the Act to have The title of the appellants divested except by exercise of the power under Section valid title cannot be defeated The exercise of the power to quash the notification under Section and the declaration under Section would lead to incongruity Consequentially the writ appeal stands dismissed and the order passed by the learned single Judge in the writ petition stands restored
