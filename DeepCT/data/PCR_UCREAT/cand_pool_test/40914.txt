The appeal in respect of some other accused was dismissed as no case had been made out against them beyond any reasonable doubt On appeal by special leave against the conviction and sentence by <ORG> <NAME> that the words substantial and compelling reasons for setting aside an order of acquittal used by this <ORG> in its decisions were intended to convey the idea that an appellate court shall not only bear in mind the principles laid down by <ORG> in <NAME> case but must also give its clear reasons for coming to the conclusion that the order of acquittal was wrong The following results emanate from a discussion of the case law on appeals against acquittal an appellate court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded the principles laid down in <NAME> case afford a correct guide for the appellate court approach to a case disposing of such an appeal the different phraseology used in the judgments of this <ORG> such as substantial and compelling reasons II good and sufficiently cogent reasons and III strong reasons are not intended to curtail the undoubted power of an appellate <ORG> in an appeal against acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion but in doing so it should not only consider every matter on record having a bearing on the questions of fact and the reasons given by the <ORG> below in support of its order of acquittal in arriving at a conclusion on those facts but should express the reasons in its judgment which led it to hold that the acquittal was not justified The High <ORG> approached the instant case from a correct perspective and gave definite findings on a consideration of the entire evidence and in so doing it did not depart from any of the principles laid down by <ORG> in <NAME> case and also gave reasons for holding that the acquittal was not justified Briefly stated the case of the prosecution was as follows There were two factions in village Harnawa one consisting of Rajputs and other of the cultivators of the village Admittedly there were disputes between these two factions in respect of certain fields The learned Sessions Judge held that it had not been established that the accused had a common object to kill the cultivators and that it had also not been proved beyond any reasonable doubt that any of the accused was guilty of a particular offence The appeal was therefore allowed in respect of the nine appellants and dismissed in respect of the others Learned counsel for the appellants contended that the <NAME> Judge came to a reasonable conclusion on the evidence and that the <ORG> had no substantial and compelling reasons to take a different view In recent years the words compelling reasons have become words of magic incantation in every appeal against acquittal The words are so elastic that they are not capable of easy definition with the result their interpretation varied between two extreme views one holding that if a trial court acquitted an accused an appellate court shall not take a different view unless the finding is such that no reasonable person will come to that conclusion and the other accepting only the conscience of the appellate court as the yardstick to ascertain whether there are reasons to compel its interference <ORG> should and will always give proper weight and consideration to such matters as the views of the trial Judge as to the credibility of the witnesses the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused a presumption certainly not weakened by the fact that he has been acquit ted at his trial the right of the accused to the benefit of any doubt and the slowness of an appellate court in disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the advantage of seeing the witnesses Adverting to the facts of the case <ORG> proceeded to state They have no reason to think that <ORG> failed to take all proper matters into consideration in arriving at their conclusions of fact Court has full power to review at large all the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded and to reach the conclusion that upon that evidence the order of acquittal should be reversed The passage relied upon is found at and it reads thus It is well established that in an appeal under section of the Criminal Procedure Code <ORG> has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal was founded but it is equally well settled that the presumption of innocence of the accused is further reinforced by his acquittal by the trial court and the findings of the trial court which had the advantage of seeing the witnesses and hearing their evidence can be reversed only for very substantial and compelling reasons On the facts of that case this <ORG> held we are inclined to hold that the Sessions Judge had taken a reasonable view of the facts of the case and in our opinion there were no good reasons for reversing that view with the observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> case as to matters <ORG> would keep in view when exercising its power under of the Criminal Procedure Code In that case the appellate court set aside an order of acquittal on the ground that the accused had failed to explain the circumstances appearing against him The observations made in respect of the earlier decisions applied to this case also <NAME> as he then was in <NAME> <ORG> again referred to <ORG> decision and affirmed the wide powerof an appellate court and also the proper approach in an appeal against acquittal There <ORG> expressed that there was clearly reasonable doubt in respect of the guilt of the accused on the evidence put before it <NAME> observed that it required good and sufficiently cogent reasons to overcome such reasonable doubt before the appellate court came to a different conclusion In <NAME> case on appeal by special leave this <ORG> said that <ORG> had not kept the rules and principles of administration of criminal justice clearly before it and that therefore the judgment was vitiated by non advertence to and misapprehension of various material facts transpiring in evidence and the consequent failure to give true weight and consideration to the findings upon which the trial court based its decision These observations only restate the principles laid down by this <ORG> in earlier decisions There is no difficulty in applying the principles laid down by <ORG> and accepted by this <ORG> to the facts of each case The words were intended to convey the idea that an appellate court not only shall bear in mind the principles laid down by <ORG> but also must give its clear reasons for coming to the conclusion that the order of acquittal was wrong The foregoing discussion yields the following results an appellate court has full power to review the evidence upon which the order of acquittal is founded the principles laid down in <NAME> case afford a correct guide for the appellate court approach to a case in disposing of such an appeal and the different phraseology used in the judgments of this <ORG> such as i substantial and compelling reasons ii good and sufficiently cogent reasons and iii strong reasons are not intended to curtail the undoubted power of an appellate court in an appeal against acquittal to review the entire evidence and to come to its own conclusion but in doing so it should not only consider every matter on record having a bearing on the questions of fact and the reasons given by the court below in support of its order of acquittal in its arriving at a conclusion on those facts but should also express those reasons in its judgment which lead it to hold that the acquittal was not justified With this background we shall now look at the judgment of the Sessions Judge and that of the High I A Therefter he noticed that all the other eye witnesses with slight and inconsequential variations spoke to the fact of their returning from the banyan tree with lathies swords and guns but he did not give a definite finding whether he accepted that evidence or not though at the fag end of the judgment he found that he could not hold that the assembly of Rajputs had any common object of killing anybody After considering the evidence in the aforesaid manner he came to the following final conclusion I cannot hold that the assembly of Rajputs had any common object of killing anybody Those Rajputs who took part in the rioting have not been truthfully named Innocent persons have been implicated and the cases of those persons who are alleged to have committed any overt acts are also full of doubts The learned Judges of <ORG> observed that it had not the slightest hesitation in holding that the case put forward by the prosecution by and large represented the substantial truth and that the incidents at the banyan tree were true We have also gone through the evidence of <NAME> and <NAME> and we entirely agree with the observations of the learned Judges of <ORG> that their evidence was natural and consistent and that the alleged discrepancies pointed out by the Ses sions Judge were not either contradictions at all or even if they were so they were so trivial as to affect in any way their veracity Having regard to the said evidence they found themselves entirely unable to accept the conclusion of the learned trial Judge that this was a case where a stray beating was given by some individuals on the side of the Rajputs to some individuals on the Bide of the Jats They found on the evidence that appellant <NAME> who was present on the spot was a member of the unlawful assembly and had actually struck <NAME> with his sword as a result of which his three fingers were cut that appellant <NAME> was one of the persons who took a leading part in the beating that appellant <NAME> was undoubtedly one of the participants in the unlawful assembly that appellant <NAME> was armed with a sword and attacked the Jats and that his version that he had been first attacked by the Jats was not true that appellant <NAME> was one of the members of the unlawful assembly and that he had given beatings to that appellant <NAME> struck <NAME> with lathies and that appellant <NAME> appellant <NAME> and appellant <NAME> who admitted their presence at the spot but stated that they were attacked by the Jats were clearly participators in the beating So far as these accused are concerned there is no evidence to show that any of them had a weapon or that they had taken any active part in assaulting one or other of the Jats Now can it be said that as learned counsel for the appellants argues the Judges of <ORG> had ignored any of the principles laid down by <ORG> and subsequently accepted by this Court We think not <ORG> rightly pointed out that there was no reason why the voluminous evidence in support of the general case and why the evidence of the three witnesses <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> should be rejected Indeed they interfered with the judgment of the Sessions Judge as they came to the conclusion that the said judgment in so far as the appellants were concerned was clearly wrong and contrary to the overwhelming and reliable evidence adduced in the case The question now is whether the appellants have made out any case for interference with the judgment of <ORG> under Art Article of the Constitution confers a wide discretionary power on this <ORG> to entertain appeals in suitable cases not otherwise provided for by the Constitution In the present case the High <ORG> has not contravened any of the principles laid down in <NAME> case and has also given reasons which led it to hold that the acquittal was not justified
