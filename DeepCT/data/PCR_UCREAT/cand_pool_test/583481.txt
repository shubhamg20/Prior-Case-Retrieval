This appeal by special leave at the instance of the <ORG> is directed against the judgment and order dated th June delivered by <ORG> at Ahmedabad in Income Tax Reference No of i Whether the <ORG> has not erred in law on facts in holding that the amount of Rs received by the assessee was not taxable as revenue receipt in the hands of the assessee ii Whether the finding of the <ORG> that the receipt relating to liquidated damages cannot be treated as a revenue receipt but must be held to be a capital receipt not exigible to tax is correct in law iii Whether the assessee is entitled to the addition made to the machinery during the year thus determining the capital employed for the purpose of claim under Section of the Income Tax Act At the outset we may note that insofar as question No iii is concerned it was conceded on behalf of the <ORG> before <ORG> that answer to the said question stood concluded in favour of the assessee by the decision of this Court in I Gujarat Vs Elecon Engineering Co The factual background in which the issue covering both the questions has arisen is as follows The assessee engaged in the manufacture of cement etc entered into an agreement with <ORG> <ORG> Bombay hereinafter referred to as the supplier on st September for purchase of additional cement plant from them for a total consideration of Rs As per the terms of contract the amount of consideration was to be paid by the assessee in four instalments During the course of assessment proceedings for the relevant assessment Year a question arose whether the said amount received by the assessee as damages was a capital or a revenue receipt Aggrieved the assessee filed an appeal before <ORG> Appeals but without any success The assessee carried the matter further in appeal to the <ORG> Relying on the ratio of the decisions of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax Nagpur Vs <NAME> and Others and <ORG> Vs Commissioner of Income Tax Calcutta the <ORG> came to the conclusion that the said amount could not be treated as a revenue receipt Mr <NAME> submitted that although the said amount of damages had been received by the assessee under clause of the agreement for breach of contract yet the said amount had been received as compensation for the loss of profit and therefore it is in the nature of a revenue receipt Per contra Mr <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the assessee while supporting the decision of <ORG> submitted that the amount received by the assessee was by way of compensation for delay in the delivery and installation of the plant and had a direct nexus with the capital asset and therefore it was in the nature of a capital receipt The question whether a particular receipt is capital or revenue has frequently engaged the attention of the <ORG> but it has not been possible to lay down any single criterion as decisive in the determination of the question Time and again it has been reiterated that answer to the question must ultimately depend on the facts of a particular case and the authorities bearing on the question are valuable only as indicating the matters that have to be taken into account in reaching a conclusion Various rules have been enunciated as furnishing a key to the solution of the question but as often observed by the highest authorities it is not possible to lay down any single test as infallible or any single criterion as decisive in the determination of the question which must ultimately depend on the facts of the particular case and the authorities bearing on the question are valuable only as indicating the matters that have to be taken into account in reaching a decision Inspector of Taxes <ORG> these questions between capital and income trading profit or no trading profit are questions which though they may depend no doubt to a very great extent on the particular facts of each case do involve a conclusion of law to be drawn from those facts In <ORG> supra dealing with the question whether compensation received by an agent for premature determination of the contract of agency is a capital or a revenue receipt echoing the views expressed in Rai Bahadur Jairam Valji supra and analysing numerous judgments on the point this Court laid down the following broad principle which may be taken into account in reaching a decision on the issue Where on a consideration of the circumstances payment is made to compensate a person for cancellation of a contract which does not affect the trading structure of his business nor deprive him of what in substance is his source of income termination of the contract being a normal incident of the business and such cancellation leaves him free to carry on his trade freed from the contract terminated the receipt is revenue Where by the cancellation of an agency the trading structure of the assessee is impaired or such cancellation results in loss of what may be regarded as the source of the assessee income the payment made to compensate for cancellation of the agency agreement is normally a capital receipt We have considered the matter in the light of the afore noted broad principle We are therefore in agreement with the opinion recorded by <ORG> on question Nos i and ii extracted in Para supra and hold that the amount of Rs received by the assessee from the suppliers of the plant was in the nature of a capital receipt We therefore dismiss the appeal with no order as to costs
