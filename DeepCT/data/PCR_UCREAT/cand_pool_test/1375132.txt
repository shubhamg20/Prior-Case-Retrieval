They are directed against the common judgment dated of a Division Bench of <ORG> by which Writ Appeal Nos of and of filed against the orders dated and of a learned Single Judge of the same court in Writ Petition Nos of and of respectively refusing to quash acquisition of certain land acquired for a public purpose under the Land Acquisition Act the A Act are dismissed Further that on it got published in <ORG> a notification under Section of the A Act and a declaration under Section thereof in respect of the said land as was required under sub section of Section of the A Act Thereafter the District Collector who got published the notice mentioned in Section of the A Act took possession of the said acquired land on as provided for in sub section of Section of the A Act In these circumstances the order made on dispensing with Section A enquiry is set aside and there will be a direction to the Revenue Divisional Officer Nirmal Respondent to give notice to the petitioners and hold Section A enquiry and the proceedings will commence from that point However <ORG> of <ORG> by its judgment delivered on the same day dismissed the appeals rejecting inter alia the fresh ground urged in support of the appeals at the hearing thus The learned counsel for the appellants also submits that in any view of the matter the declaration under Section published on is beyond three years The grievance of the appellants in the present appeals as ventilated before us by their learned counsel is confined to non acceptance by <ORG> of <ORG> the fresh ground argued before it against declaration made on under Section of the A Act as that was made beyond the time allowed under the first proviso to Section inserted by the A Amendment Act We may say it once that the ground so urged in support of the present appeals would merit acceptance if the judgment dated of <ORG> in Writ Petition No of had the effect of restoring ownership of acre guntas of land to the appellants and reviving Section notification which had been published on in respect of that land also as is assumed on behalf of the appellants for the reasons which we shall presently state Section of the A Act and the first proviso inserted under the A Amendment Act on which reliance is placed in support of the ground urged by learned counsel for the appellants in support of their appeals reads when the appropriate Government is satisfied after considering the report if any made under Section A sub section that any particular land is needed for a public purpose or for a company a declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such Government or of some officer duty authorized to certify its orders and different declarations may be made from time to time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the same notification under Section sub section irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or have been made wherever required under Section A sub section Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification under Section sub section i published after the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment and Validation Ordinance of but before the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment Act shall be made after the expiry of three years from the date of the publication of the notification or ii published after the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment Act shall be made after the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the notification Provided Explanation In computing any of the periods referred to in the first proviso the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification issued under Section sub section is stayed by an order of a court shall be excluded As becomes clear from a reading of the said proviso there is a prohibition imposed in the matter of making a declaration under Section in respect of any particular land governed by the notification under Section sub section beyond the respective periods mentioned in clauses i and ii thereof However from the Explanation to the said proviso it becomes clear that either of the periods referred to in clauses i and ii of the proviso could be computed by excluding the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification issued under Section sub section was stayed by an order of court When we come to the facts of the present case which had given rise to Writ Petition Nos of and of in <ORG> there was no order made by court which stayed the taking of any action or proceeding pursuant to Section notification concerned in that Section declaration of the land concerned was made possession of such land was taken under Section resulting in the vesting of the land in the <ORG> and possession of that land in turn had been handed over to the Bhainsa Regulated Market Samiti for whom the same had been acquired even prior to the filing of the writ petitions Then as is assumed on behalf of the appellants in the present appeals Section declaration made on in respect of the appellants land taking the possession of that land under Section and its vesting in <ORG> and the handing over of possession of that land to <ORG> all of which had taken place before the filing of WP Nos of and of are regarded as set aside by the judgment of <ORG> dated in WP No of and Section sub section notification published on of the appellants land is regarded as having been revived by that judgment the ground urged on behalf of the appellants that Section declaration dated made in respect of the appellants land was prohibited under clause of the proviso is well founded and merits acceptance It would be so for the reason that making of a declaration under Section in respect of any particular land covered by a notification published under Section after the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment and Validation Ordinance but before the commencement ofthe Land Acquisition Amendment Act after the expiry of years is clearly prohibited under clause i of the first proviso to Section of the A Act and the impugned declaration dated has been in fact made long after the expiry of years time referred to in clause of the first proviso after the publication of Section sub section notification on Section of the A Act contains a provision which confers on the appropriate <ORG> special powers in relation to the acquisition of land in case of urgency This sub section says when such direction is given a declaration may be made under Section in respect of the land concerned at any time after the date of publication of the notification under Section sub section When once Section declaration is made by operation of sub section of Section such declaration becomes conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or of a company as the case may be and after making such declaration appropriate <ORG> may acquire the land in the manner appearing in the subsequent provisions of the A Act Insofar as the land to be acquired pursuant to the direction of the appropriate <ORG> under sub section of Section which makes Section A inapplicable sub section of Section is required to be followed for the purpose of acquisition of the land concerned In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in Section sub section take possession of any land needed for public purpose The said provision enables the appropriate <ORG> to take possession of the land concerned on the expiration of days from the publication of the notice mentioned in Section sub section notwithstanding the fact that no award has been made in respect of it No doubt when <ORG> took the view that acquisition of the land concerned under Section of the Act was made pursuant to an order of the <ORG> without application of its mind in the matter of making Section A not to apply it was open to it to set aside or quash the subsequent acquisition proceedings except Section notification which had followed and restore the ownership of the land to the appellants land if it had to order fresh enquiry on the basis of Section notification In this state of facts when the previous acquisition of the land of the appellants made under Section of the Act did never stood affected Hence we feel that there is no need to set aside the impugned declaration inasmuch as the earlier acquisition was complete and had resulted in vesting of the land in the State <ORG> and there was no land available for acquisition in the subsequent proceedings which have been carried pursuant to the judgment of <ORG> made in WP No of Therefore in the stated facts although we find that no need arises to declare the impugned declaration as void we clarify that the earlier proceedings which had taken place in respect of the appellants land resulting in its vesting in the State <ORG> free from encumbrances has stood unaffected and any award made by the Collector or be made by him under the A Act shall be regarded as that based on earlier acquisition proceedings Such examination cannot therefore be understood as laying down that notwithstanding the lapse of time or laches in raising a legal ground in a proceeding under Article of the Constitution or a proceeding under Article of the Constitution there is an obligation on the part of the court concerned to examine such fresh ground In fact in relation to acquisition proceeding involving acquisition of land for public purposes the court concerned must be averse to entertain writ petitions involving the challenge to such acquisition where there is avoidable delay or laches since such acquisition if set aside would not only involve enormous loss of public money but also cause undue delay in carrying out projects meant for general public good When a fresh ground of attack to acquisition proceedings even if it involves purely a question of law its entertainment cannot be governed by a principle different from that which governs entertainment of writ petitions before <ORG> or proceedings arising therefrom before this Court under Article of the Constitution In the result these civil appeals are dismissed however without costs
