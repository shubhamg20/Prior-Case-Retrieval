Similarly the words food colors and syrup essences which are descriptive of the class of goods the sales of which are to be taxed under the Act have to be construed in the sense in which they are popularly understood by those who deal in them and who purchase and use them The only question which now falls for determination is the one referred to <ORG> and which has already been reproduced There is no dispute about the turnover Section provides for liability to tax under the Act whereas section A which was inserted by Act of and has thereafter been amended from time to time deals with single point taxation In exercise of the powers conferred by section A of the Sales Tax Act as amended from time to time and in supersession of all previous Notifications on the subject the Governor of Uttar Pradesh is hereby pleased to declare that the turnover in respect of the good specified in the List below shall not with effect from April be liable to tax cept a in the case of goods imported from outside Uttar Pradesh at the point of sale by the importer and in the case of goods manufactured in Uttar Pradesh at the point of sale by the manufacturer and the Governor is further pleased to declare that such turnover shall with effect from the said date be taxed at the rate of one anna per rupee The narrow point requiring decision is whether good colors and syrup essences imported by the dealer from outside fall within the entries and respectively Strong reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in <ORG> <ORG> in which the word perfume was held to include dhoop and dhoop batti In our opinion the Random House Dictionary cannot serve as a safe guide in construing the words used in the List in the Notification in question for the purpose of deciding whether or not the words used in entries nos and cover food colors and syrup essences indeed this Dictionary is apt to be a somewhat delusive guide in understanding the meanings of the words and expressions with which we are concerned in the context in which they are used The words dyes and colors used in entry no and the words scents and perfumes used in entry no have to be construed in their own context and in the sense as ordinarily understood and attributed to these words by people usually conversant with and dealing in such goods Similarly the words food colors and syrup essences which are descriptive of the class of goods the sales of which are to be taxed under the Act have to be construed in the sense in which they are popularly understood by those who deal in them and who purchase and use them In the course of the judgment after referring to certain decisions including the decisions from Australian Canadian and English Courts it was observed The result emerging from these decisions is that while construing the word coal in entry of Part III of Schedule the test that would be applied is what would be the meaning which persons dealing with coal and consumers purchasing it as fuel would give to that word A sales tax statute being one levying a fax on goods must in the absence of a technical term or a term of science or art be presumed to have used an ordinary term as coal according to the meaning ascribed to it in common parlance Viewed from that angle both a merchant dealing in coal and a consumer wanting to purchase it would regard coal not in its geological sense but in the sense as ordinarily understood and would include charcoal in the term coal In view of these and some other decisions the learned counsel for the appellant it may be said in fairness did not dispute that the words with which we are concerned must be construed in the sense which is imputed to them by the persons who deal in and who consume such articles Food colors and syrup essence being themselves known articles of common use the question arises whether the words and expressions used in entries and of the List are intended to take within their fold goods popularly known in common parlance by the names of food colors and syrup essences
