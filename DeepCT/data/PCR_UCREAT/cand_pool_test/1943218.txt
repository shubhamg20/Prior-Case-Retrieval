These writ petitions coming on for hearing on this day upon perusing the petition and the respective affidavits filed in support thereof the order of <ORG> dated and made herein and the counter and reply affidavits filed herein and the records relating to the order in The only question that arises for consideration in these cases is whether it will be open to <ORG> authorities to indulge in what is called best of judgment assessment proceedings The one and only contention urged by Mr Venugopal the learned Counsel for the petitioners is that there is no procedure for best of judgment assessment under the Act especially when the petitioners have resorted to the self removal procedure as contemplated under Rule A mere sample taken on one occasion cannot enable him to levy excise duty which would obviously mean that where there are materials so as to enable the authorities to levy those materials are supplemented by means of best of judgment If the petitioners were earnest nothing prevented them from showing that they would be entitled to the exemption granted under the notification or a lower rate shown in the notification In the absence of it having regard to the random sample test conducted by the department it is always open to them to hold that the petitioners have produced goods belonging to the particular description So long as there is manufacture of those goods specified in Schedule on account of such manufacture the goods become subject to excise duty manufactured on a particular day namely was found to be of NF There were tests and re tests as a result of which ultimately the count came to be reduced to The point to be noticed here is that if it is the case of the petitioners that they are entitled to exemption since the duty for manufacture of yarn of less than NF counts was nil it is their duty to prove so as to enable the authorities to hold that it is eligible for exemption As to under what category the goods manufactured by the petitioners come is a matter of proof by them and not for the authorities to determine by taking samples This will be so albeit there being a provision to make rules under Section xiv for taking samples and in fact the rules have been made to enable the authorities to take samples But as I observed above there is no question of any best of judgment assessment arising here
