This appeal by the plaintiff is against the confirming decree in a suit for permanent injunction restraining the defendant from interfering with the plaintiff possession of a truck It was further agreed that if the plaintiff would fulfil the conditions as laid down in the hire purchase agreement he could exercise the option to become the owner of the said vehicle As there was delay in payment of the monthly instalments the defendant sent a letter to the plaintiff demanding payment of Rs It was also planned that the <ORG> at Jaypore had no jurisdiction to entertain the suit as per clause of the hire purchase agreement and that the suit was not property valued It was also found by it that the claim of the defendant was true and not barred by limita tion but it was held that the suit was not property valued Notwithstanding all these findings he dismissed the appeal because according to him the courts at Jayapore had no territorial jurisdiction the parties having agreed in the hire purchases agreement to vest exclusive jurisdiction in the courts at Rajamundry and the defendant had every right to seize the truck as per the terms of the hire purchase agreement the plaintiff having failed to clear up his case as per Ext Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the appellant does not dispute the correctness of the finding of the courts below that the defendant was the owner of the truck and the plaintiff was the hirer and also the finding of the appellate court that the trial court had pecuniary jurisdiction to try the suit the suit having been correctly valued According to the learned counsel the parties by consent cannot oust the jurisdiction of a court which has territorial jurisdiction to decide the dispute in terms of Section of the Civil Procedure Code in short the His second contention is that the plaintiff having cleared the entire case under the hire purchase agreement by paying all the instalments though irregularly the defendant had no right To take possession of the truck by seizing it in view of the bar laid down in Section of the Hire purchase Act in short the Act In the present case we are not concerned with the provisions contained in Sections to It appears that the plaitniff has instituted the suit at Jaypore because an agent of the defendant came there for the purpose of taking possession of the truck by Seizing it This means that because the course of action arose at Jaypore the plaintiff instituted the suit there A both the parties has agreed that in the event of any dispute arising out of the said agreement the courts at Rajamundry would have jurisdiction such agreements between the parties according to him clearly oust the jurisdiction of any court at Jaypore The question for consideration is whether by consent of parties jurisdiction can be vested in a court having absolutely no jurisdiction in terms of Section and by vesting such jurisdiction whether the courts having jurisdiction would be debarred from exercising such jurisdiction The <ORG> would ordinarily have regard to the choice of the parties but where however the <ORG> whose jurisdiction has been ousted is satisfied that the stipulation would operate harshly is oppressive in character inequitable or unfair for the ends of justice it can relieve the party of the bargain In this case the plaintiff having filed the suit merely for a permanent injunction restraining the defendant from interfering with his possession of the truck in question it would have definitely caused harship to him if he was to run to another State for such relief In that view of the matter the finding of the learned <ORG> District Judge that the courts at Jaypore had no jurisdiction to try the suit is bound to be set aside and accordingly the same is set aside Section deals with the rights of a owner to terminate hire purchase agreement for default in payment of hire or unauthorised act or breach of express condi tions Section deals with the rights of a owner on termination and clause thereof prescribes that subject to the provisions of Sections and and subject to any contract to the contrary the owner shall be entitled to enter the premises of the hirer and seize the goods Section lays down the restriction on owner right to recover possession of goods otherwise than through court and Sub section thereof provides inter alia that where goods have been let under a hire purchase agreement and the statutory proportion of the hire purchase price has been paid whether in pursuance of the judgment of a court of otherwise or tendered by or on behalf of the hirer or any surety the owner shall not enforce any right to recover possession of the goods from the hirer otherwise than in accordance with Sub section or by suit In this case there is no Controversy that all the instalments as provided in the hire purchase agreement Ext So the questions arise whether the owner is entitled to enter into the premises of the hirer and seize the goods in possession of the hirer without terminating the hire purchase agreement and whether he has the right to seize the goods in possession of the hirer where all the instalments as provided in the hire purchases agreement have been paid though irregularly So far as the second question is concerned the answer must also be in the negative because there is nothing in Section to indicate that the provisions contained therein will not apply if the instalments as provided in the hire purchase agreement have been irregularly paid by the hirer and accepted by the owner without any demur Under these circumstances I hold that the owner had no right to enter into the premises of the hirer i the plaintiff and seize the truck in question Since the defendant as stated above had no right to take possession of the truck by seizing it the appellate court should not have dismissed the appeal On the discussions as above the appeal is allowed the judgment and decree of the learned <ORG> are set aside and that of the trial court restored
