The case of the petitioners are that after their appointment under the respondent <ORG> in the year they continued in service till the respondents terminated their services in the year by letter dated nd December on the ground that they had procured employment in lieu of their lands with the specific condition that they will hand over their lands for the use of the company for mining purposes they have failed to fulfill their commitment and vacant possession of the lands were not handed over to the company which frustrated the very purpose of extending the benefit of employment to these petitioners against the said lands As per the petitioners the <ORG> of the <ORG> took a decision on st October for purchasing acres of land required for <ORG> for the purposes of quarrying De pillaring sand stowing bunker etc Petitioners had been working since without any complaint till issuance of the order dated nd December which terminated the services of the petitioners on the aforesaid grounds As it appears while the services of persons were terminated only persons moved before this <ORG> challenging the order dated nd December in WPS No and WPS No However on the other hand on the submissions made by the counsel for the petitioners that they will give specific details of their lands against which they their father claimed and secured employment in the year and also gave workable physical possession of their lands to the satisfaction of the company the company was directed to take a decision in the matter within a period of two months from the date of compliance of the order Petitioner further stated in his representation that he did not have any concern with the land already acquired and nobody claimed any service before the <ORG> against the said land nor they have sold the land to anyone else The said petitioner is not in possession of the land measuring acres <ORG> has also filed suits under the CNT Act for creation of the record of rights in its favour It is further submitted that the counter affidavit filed by the respondents have also confirmed that the service book of the petitioner and Form Register were also prepared which are statutory documents under the Mines Act and have a legal and evidentiary value so far as the question of appointment is concerned JBCJ HC to submit that the statutory Form Register cannot be unilaterally changed in respect of the entries made thereunder specifically in connection with the date of birth He prefaced his argument by drawing attention of this <ORG> to the prayer made in the writ petitions where only a challenge has been made to the order dated th May rejecting the petitioners representation and asking them to allow joining of the petitioners petitioners have asked for stay of the order dated nd December Annexure Learned counsel for the respondents pointed out that upon examination of the representation of the petitioners it reveals that there was no disclosure of the share of the petitioners on the total area of the land indicated in the body of the representation On plot wise examination of the land it was noticed that the land measuring acres were the land acquired in A No in Award Nos and to and He has further placed the report annexed to the supplementary counter affidavit dated th March filed on behalf of the respondent <ORG> on the basis of the documents contained in the land acquisition proceeding of under which such lands were acquired It has been pointed out on his behalf that in respect of petitioner in WPS No both report says that he is not the son of the awardee rather he is friend of the awardee In respect of the petitioner in WPS No remarks have been made that he has no relation with the awardee At the same time it is submitted that in the new report of Deputy Commissioner <NAME> which was prepared on the basis of a enquiry and inspection pursuant to the order passed earlier by this <ORG> there are no details except a single line statement in the case of individual petitioners that either the petitioners are not living on the plot or they are living in some of the cases It is submitted that in deference to the orders passed by this <ORG> respondent <ORG> made serious efforts by constituting a committee to locate the documents relating to the original appointment of the petitioners However if there are records like service excerpts Form Register etc they are subsequent documents prepared in the year which in the absence of original documents raises doubt about the genuineness of these appointment Learned counsel for the respondents points out that there were persons who were appointed in similar and same manner and whose services were terminated in December out of which only persons have come forward in the present batch of writ applications to challenge the orders of rejection of their representation Learned counsel for the respondent <ORG> submits that even if the appointment letters of individual petitioners may not be there with the respondents but at least petitioners could have produced their own appointment letters under which they claimed to have been appointed in the year on the ground that they had lost their lands It has been submitted that the land was acquired through A Case No on behalf of the respondent <ORG> on th May and the same was handed over to the respondent <ORG> through ownership certificate It is submitted that reference has been made of a faded copy of the documents of however such document has not been produced by the respondents which would create adverse inference against them Learned Senior counsel for the petitioners reiterated her submissions made on the point of assailing the new ground of rejecting their representation that the petitioners had not submitted the consent of the co awardees while procuring employment though in the original order of termination the only ground was taken that the actual workable physical possession of the lands were not handed over to the respondent <ORG> by the concerned petitioners Lastly it has been submitted on their behalf that there is no justification for the respondents to terminate the petitioners services after years without any disciplinary inquiry leading to proof of charge of misconduct On the face of it therefore it appears that while the learned <ORG> did not find any reason to interfere with the orders of termination but it left the issue relating to the handing over possession of the lands to the petitioners to be once again established by giving specific details whereupon the respondent company was also directed to take a decision upon the recommendation of the committee The plea of res judicata was also raised earlier on behalf of the respondents in the present writ application as reflected in the order dated th December Pursuant to the said order the matter was placed before the learned Single Judge who had delivered the judgment dated th February in the petitioners case earlier From perusal of the order passed thereafter on nd July it appears that on the question of handing over the possession of the lands by the awardees to the <ORG> the Deputy Commissioner <NAME> was requested to hold an inquiry with the help of Land Acquisition Officer <NAME> Circle Officer of the concerned area and the Estate Officer Sijua Area <ORG> <NAME> in presence of the petitioners or their representative regarding the actual state of affairs with respect to the said land measuring acres including acres of land acquired by the <ORG> by private negotiation regarding A Case No in Mouza Gareria It is therefore evident that though the learned Single Judge on the previous occasion had held that the action of the company was fully justified and needed no interference but the controversy did not die thereafter in view of the specific observations made in the same judgment Subsequent orders passed in the present case earlier also indicated that the question relating to the termination of the petitioners service have been further inquired into In such a case if the matter in dispute decided by the former judgment is conclusive between the same parties attempts to reopen that matter has to be repelled During the proceedings of the instant writ petitions this <ORG> was confronted with two distinct aspect of the matters which required to be examined to come to a conclusion as to whether the petitioners were entitled to relief prayed for or not The first issue which emerges out of the foundational facts arising out of the termination of the petitioners services and the litigations in the two round of writ petitions is on the question as to whether these petitioners had really procured employment in lieu of the lands lost by them or their fathers in the year The second aspect which emerges out as a natural corollary upon examination of the first issue is as to whether petitioners had been validly and legally appointed at the relevant point of time in the year by the respondents or their original appointment itself lacks sanctity The applicant is a co Awardee in respect of award no prepared in A Case No and award Nos to have been declared in respect of houses standing over plot no in the names of different persons Perusal of the report indicates that against the name of individual petitioner several plot numbers have been indicated having different area and totalling different acreage recording in the remarks column as follows in WPS No does not reside the petitioner is the son of the friend of the awardee in WPS No same remarks he does not reside and that the awardee is related to the purchaser in WPS No petitioner is the daughter in law of the awardee and existence of certain houses on plot no and have been found in respect of another plot it appears that it is not in the name of the awardee and there are houses over the same WPS No award is shown in the name of several persons with the remarks that the petitioner is the son of the awardee and does not reside there in WPS No again award is shown in the name of different person with remark that the petitioner is living there in respect of plot no similar remarks have been made against the name of other petitioners though in each of the individual cases there are number of plots shown as also number of awardees in respect of each of the plots A comparison of the findings contained in the report of the Deputy Commissioner Dhanbad the <ORG> and the Land Acquisition Officer Dhanbad shows that there are disputed question of facts involved relating to the claim of individual petitioners While appointments have been shown to be procured against a particular area of land but the acquired land under the awards neither belong to the petitioners nor their fathers alone nor any consent of other co awardees were produced and there are also serious dispute about the actual physical possession of the land by the <ORG> which were acquired A comparative analysis of the findings in different reports on being compared with the findings of the committee which forms the basis of rejection of individual representation of the petitioners shows that there are serious dispute relating to the claim of the petitioners of having handed over the actual workable physical possession of the land to the respondent company in lieu of which employment was obtained He has thereafter filed an affidavit on th June stating that he has minutely examined the entire matter and has found prima facie illegality irregularity committed at different stages in the matter related to employment in lieu of lands of Mouza Garerai under <ORG> of <ORG> It was for this reason this <ORG> made endeavours to find out as to what transpired at that time in the year when the petitioners claimed to have been appointed under the respondents what was the scheme prevalent at the relevant point of time the decision making process relating to their appointment and whether there was any proof of any consent or no objection by the individual co sharers sponsoring the cases of the petitioners appointees In the aforesaid state of disputed questions of fact in respect of both the issues examined by this <ORG> on merits after repelling the plea of res judicata or constructive res judicata raised by the respondents the only conclusion that can be drawn is that in a proceeding under the writ jurisdiction it would not be proper to make any determination thereupon and or issue any writ in the nature of certiorari quashing the orders of rejection impugned in the individual cases and or to reinstate them in service It is also made clear that if the petitioners do so the concerned <ORG> or the <ORG> would arrive at adjudication without being influenced by the observations made in the present case Moreover there are disputed questions of fact involved on the very issue relating to the handing over of the workable physical possession of the lands in favour of the respondents in lieu of which such employment was obtained by individual petitioners in the year The ratio of the judgment rendered in the case of <NAME> and others supra that the issue in the subject matter of challenge cannot be enlarged in a proceeding before this Court do not apply to the facts of the present case In the said case as has been found the writ petitioner had not questioned the selection of the persons who were affected by <ORG> impugned order On consideration of the entire gamut of facts involved it has been found that not only the claim of the petitioners that they had got employment in lieu of handing over the workable physical possession of the land lost by them are based upon the disputed questions of fact but the very genesis of the appointment has been found to be questionable as neither the petitioners have been able to show any appointment letter or documents which form the basis of their appointment in the year nor there are any contemporaneous record in relation to the appointment of the petitioners in the office of the respondents
