In appeal to this Court it was contended that the civil court had no jurisdiction to try the suit HELD By constituting appropriate authorities under the Act and creating a hierarchy of authorities to deal with the problem of levying tax as contemplated by the Act the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain the suit was excluded by necessary implication Jurisdiction of the civil court to try the suit was not barred by A ousting the jurisdiction of the civil court because that section which was not retrospective in operation was incorporated into the Act after the suit was filed For the purpose of making assessment of tax the authorities have power to decide all questions arising before them and the orders of the appellate authorities subject to the exercise of revisional jurisdiction by <ORG> were declared filial The liability to pay tax arose under and by virtue of the provisions of the Act and the quantum of liability was determined under the Act alone Further at the material time there was no express provision in he Act which obliged the taxing authority to exclude from the computation of the taxable turnover the amount of sales tax collected by the dealer I A that civil courts have jurisdiction to examine a case where the provision of the statute have been infringed did not apply in the instant case In this appeal with special leave on behalf of the State of Kerala the principal ground which falls to be determined is whether the jurisdiction of <ORG> to try the suit is excluded No suit or other civil proceeding shall except as expressly provided in this Act be instituted in any court to set aside or modify any assessment made under this Act But this express bar on which counsel for the <ORG> relied did not exclude the jurisdiction of the civil court for A was incorporated in the Travancore Cochin General Sales tax Act by Act of after the suit was instituted by the respondents and by A as incorporated the jurisdiction of the civil court to try a suit properly instituted before it was enacted is not ousted assesee who was taxed in respect of certain sales which took place outside the taxing State sued the State for a decree for refund of the amounts paid by him on the plea that the transactions in respect of which the tax was levied were not taxable under the law This Court held that without a provision like A of the Madras General Sales tax Act the jurisdiction to entertain the suit was not taken away specially where the action of the authorities was wholly outside the law It was observed in that case that finality attached to orders passed in appeal by the Act was a finality for the purposes of the Act and I did not make valid an action which was not warranted by the Act as for example the levy of tax on a commodity which was not taxed at all or was exempt But the jurisdiction of the civil court may be excluded expressly or by clear implication arising from the scheme of the Act Where the <ORG> sets up a special tribunal to determine questions relating to rights or liabilities which are the creation of a statute the jurisdiction of the civil court would be deemed excluded by implication In <ORG> GovernorGeneral in Council <ORG> in dealing with the question whether the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain a suit for refund of income tax may be deemed to be excluded apart from the express exclusion prescribed by of the Income tax Act by the scheme of the Income tax Act observed observed If a statute imposes a liability and creates an effective machinery for deciding questions of law or fact arising in regard to that liability it may by necessary implication bar the maintainability of a civil suit in respect of the said liability This Court held that where the Sales tax Officer by misconceiving the nature of the transactions brings to tax transactions in respect of which the State has no authority to legislate for levying tax because of the ban imposed by Art which in terms enacted that an assessment shall not be called in question in any civil court but the court in Kamala Mills case held that the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain a suit for tax assessed under the Act was excluded expressly and by the clear implication of the Act as well Section as it stood at the relevant time provided for the exercise of revisional jurisdiction by <ORG> against the order of the taxing authorities original as well as appellate For the purpose of making assessment of tax the authorities have power to decide all questions arising before them and the orders of the appellate authorities subject to the exercise of revisional jurisdiction under are declared final Liability to pay tax arises under and by virtue of the provisions of the Act and the quantum of liability may be determined under the Act alone We ought to add that this decision was based on the fact that the said Act at the relevant time did not contain section A which came into force on May and it was section A which was construed by this Court in Firm of Illuri Subbayya Chetty Sons SCR In the judgment in Kamala Mills case it was pointed out that the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain a suit for refund of tax paid in compliance with an order of assessment may be excluded either expressly or necessary implication and as the scheme of the Bombay Sales Tax Act indicated that a complete machinery was set up by constituting appropriate authorities under the Act and creating a hierarchy of authorities to deal with the problem of levying tax as contemplated by the Act jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain the suit was excluded by implication as well as by express enactment within the mischief of the charging section what is the true and real extent of the transactions which are assessable all these and other allied questions have to be determined by the appropriate authorities themselves and so we find it impossible to accept Mr <NAME> argument that the finding of the appropriate authority that a particular transaction is taxable under the provisions of the Act is a finding on a collateral fact which gives the appropriate authority jurisdiction to take a further step and make the actual order of assessment Counsel for the respondents urged that the case of the respondents fall within that exception since the Sales tax Officer in imposing tax liability acted in defiance of the mandatory provisions of the Act and in support of the argument he placed reliance upon of the Rules framed under the Act and the definition of turnover under the Act By turnover means insofar as the definition is relevant the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought by or sold by a dealer whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration Turnover being the aggregate amount for which goods are bought or sold and normally the aggregate amount would include such amount as the purchaser pays to the dealer for the goods the expression aggregate amount for which goods are There is no provision in the Act which may by implication suggest that from the connotation of the expression turnover the sales tax collected in the year of assessment ending March was to be excluded There is thus nothing anamolous in the law treating it as part of the amount on which tax must be paid by him It is found in England and America and there is no reason to think that when the legislatures in India defined turnover to include tax also they were striking out into something quite unknown and unheard of before There was in the Travancore Cochin General Sales tax Act at the material time no express provision which obliged the taxing authority to exclude from the computation of taxable turnover the amount of sales tax collected by the dealer The argument of counsel for the respondents that the taxing authority has infringed a prohibition imposed upon him has therefore no substance The appeal is therefore allowed and the suit is dismissed
