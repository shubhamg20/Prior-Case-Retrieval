Being aggrieved by the decision of <ORG> the respondents filed a writ petition in <ORG> <ORG> was also directed to consider the request of the respondents for exemption in accordance with the directions issued by <ORG> in the earlier Writ Petition No of filed by the respondents Disposing of the appeal the <ORG> HELD Per <NAME> There were two different aspects of the case to be considered The appellants contended that in this case there was no ground for lifting the corporate veil urging that there was no warrant either in law or in fact to lift the corporate veil and treat <ORG> plant as <ORG> own source of generation In this case indubitably it is correct that <ORG> was brought into existence by <ORG> in order to fulfil the condition of industrial licence of <ORG> through production of aluminium Whenever felt necessary the <ORG> or the <ORG> themselves had lifted the corporate veil and treated <ORG> and <ORG> as one concern and the generation in <ORG> as the own source of generation of <ORG> In view of the ceilings prescribed the power conferred upon the <ORG> under Section of the Act by itself is valid and does not amount to excessive delegation Price fixation which is ultimately the basis of rise in cost because of the rise of the electricity duty is not a matter for investigation of <ORG> Sub section of section of the Act in the set up is quasi legislative and quasi administrative in so far as it has power to fix different rates having regard to certain factors and in so far as it has power to grant exemption in some cases is quasi legislative in character <ORG> was right only to the limited extent that all the relevant considerations must be taken into account and the power should not be exercised on irrelevant considerations but singular consideration which <ORG> had missed in this case is the factors namely the prevailing charges for the supply of energy in any area the generating capacity of any plant the need to promote industrial production generally or any specified class thereof and other relevant factors cannot be judged disjointly The exercise of power whether legislative or administrative will be set aside if there is manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary Similarly if the power has been exercised on a non consideration or non application of mind to relevant factors the exercise will be regarded as manifestly erroneous If a power legislative or administrative is exercised on the basis of facts which do not exist and which are patently erroneous such exercise of power will stand vitiated The <ORG> had taken note of all these factors and considering the prevailing practice of levy of electricity duty in other <ORG>s as well as the provisions of section the <ORG> came to the conclusion that there was no justification for allowing exemption from electricity duty to <ORG> and did not commit any error However his Lordship observed that it was unnecessary to pursue this aspect further as his Lordship agreed with the conclusion of <NAME> that in this case the respondent representations had been fully considered and the requirements of natural justice had been fulfilled and that there was no warrant to interfere with the order of <ORG> The following Judgments of the Court were delivered <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment and order of <ORG> dated th September In the proviso to section of the principal Act after clause a new clause was inserted which provided for non levy or exemption from the payment of electricity duty on the energy consumed by a consumer in a scheduled industry By virtue of sub section of section the Amendment Act provided that the Act would be deemed to have come into force with effect from st April The amended provisions of Act No of came into force from st April Section of the principal Act was substituted by a new section which provided that there would be levied and paid to <ORG> a duty called electricity duty on the energy sold to a consumer by a licensee <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> there would be a duty on the consumption of energy by a licensee or the <ORG> in or upon the premises used for commercial or residential purposes or in or upon any other premises except in the construction maintenance or operation of his or its works and there would be a duty upon the consumption of electricity by any other person from his own source of generation Provided that such notification issued after October but not later than March may be made effective on or from a prior date not earlier than October Where the amount of electricity duty is not paid by <ORG> within the prescribed period as aforesaid the licensee the <ORG> or other person mentioned in clause of sub section as the case may be shall be liable Section of the Act provides as follows Exemptions <ORG> had in the meantime obtained a sanction under section of the Indian Electricity Act to engage in the business of supply of electricity to the second respondent <ORG> By virtue of section which defines a licensee for the purposes of the Duty Act to mean any person licensed under Part II of the Indian Electricity Act and includes any person who has obtained sanction from the State Government under section In other words clause a of sub section of section of the Act as amended came into operation and a levy of duty would take place on the energy sold to a consumer by a licensee Of its supplies to <ORG> In exercise of the powers conferred by the Amendment Ordinance Ordinance No of the provisions of which were re enacted in Act No of the Governor on or about th August passed an order that with effect from st September the electricity duty on industrial consumption would be levied at one paisa per unit There was further notification dated th September issued in the name of the Governor modifying the terms of the notifications dated th August and th August There was an agreement on th December with <ORG> and <ORG> to supply and Of power On st July there was an agreement between <ORG> and <ORG> to supply Of power On th August the Ordinance No of was promulgated further to amend the Electricity Duty Act which came into force from st September By the aforesaid amendment provisions of sections and were substituted by new sections sections A and were omitted and there were several amendments in various sections of the original Act On st September the provisions of the ordinance amending Electricity Duty Act came into force <ORG> by its judgment on th May in the Writ Petition No of quashed the order of <ORG> and directed <ORG> to reconsider the application of the respondents for exemption in the light of the observations made in that judgment In compliance with <ORG> judgment dated th May on th April respondents were given an opportunity of hearing by <ORG> He submitted his report It did not have any adverse effect on the profitability of <ORG> since such a levy has been included in the cost in fixing the selling prices of <ORG> products by the <ORG> Personal hearing was given to the respondents in view of the directions given by <ORG> There was an agreement on th April between <ORG> and the <ORG> regarding main supply and stand by Emergency Supply A personal hearing was given to the respondents in compliance with the directions issued by <ORG> A personal hearing was again given to the respondents to submit their submissions in support of their application for exemption <ORG> was also directed to consider the request of the respondents for exemption in accordance with the directions issued by <ORG> in Writ Petition No of and also in the light of the observations made in the judgment after affording an opportunity of personal hearing to the respondents Being aggrieved thereby the appellants have come up in appeal to this Court There are two different aspects The second aspect is whether the order passed by the State Government having regard to the nature of the order passed was in accordance with the principles of natural justice in so far as the same were applicable to the facts of this case It is well settled that in interpreting items in statutes whose primary object is to raise revenue and for which purpose they classify diverse products articles and substances resort should be had not to the scientific and technical meaning of the terms or expressions used but to the meaning attached to them by those dealing in them Thereafter the respondent made another application for exemption under section of the Act Was <ORG> right is the question involved in this appeal Our attention was drawn to certain facts appearing in Vol Reference may be made to page of Vol Reference may be made to pages of Vol On this important basis <ORG> was granted permission to set up captive power plant It was submitted on behalf of the respondents and in our opinion rightly that the words own source of generation could not have one meaning for power cuts and another meaning for concession exemptions under the same law SCR that this Court proceeded on the basis that Renusagar had its own source of generation All these factors have to be borne in mind in considering whether Renusagar was <ORG> own source of generation Counsel for the respondents drew our attention to the fact that in the manufacture of aluminium electrical energy is raw material and between to units of energy are required for the production of ton of aluminium Ambit of section is wider than the old section in view of the addition of the words source of generation which must be given their full meaning It should be borne in mind that the expression own source of generation which has not been defined in the Duty Act or Act cannot be regarded as a term of art Alternatively it was submitted that if the three clauses were to be treated as independent of each other then the result of construction that each provision would yield to special provisions applied should be applied as a part and parcel of harmonious construction of this section It was further contended on behalf of the respondents that interpretation of section of the Act would not depend on the manner in which a person might choose to organise his affairs Further that there was no rational distinction having a nexus with the object of the Duty Act where a person generating electrical energy himself was consuming the same and a person who engaged another person to generate electrical energy exclusively for and on behalf of his complete control and who consumes all the electrical energy so generated Hence it was contended that a construction of the Duty Act which would make such a distinction must be avoided This naturally brings us to the question of lifting the corporate veil or piercing the corporate veil as we often call it On behalf of the appellants however it was very strongly urged that in this case there was no ground for lifting the corporate veil and <NAME> learned Additional Advocate General State of who was assisted by <NAME> submitted before us elaborate arguments and made available to us all the relevant documents urged that there was no warrant either in law or in fact to lift the corporate veil and to treat Renusagar plant as <ORG> own source of generation While delivering the Judgment in that case <NAME> referred to the observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> KB where Lord <NAME> had observed that the <ORG> and the corporation were different and the servants of the corporation were not civil servants <NAME> relied on the aforesaid observations and referred to <ORG> pages where it was stated that there were only two cases where the <ORG> had disregarded the separate legal entity of a Company and that was done because the company was formed or used to facilitate the evasion of legal obligations He states that the principle of company separate legal entity has on the whole been fully applied by the <ORG> since <ORG> case Indubitably in this case there was no question of evasion of taxes but the manner of treatment of the power plant of Renusagar as the power plant of <ORG> and the <ORG> taking full advantage of the same in the case of power cuts and denial of supply of power to <ORG> in our opinion underline the facts and as such imply acceptance and waiver of the position that Renusagar was a power plant owned by <ORG> He referred us to the well known case of <ORG> A Salomon Co Shri <NAME> also drew out attention to the Bank Voor Handel En Scheepvaart <NAME> QB where in the context of the international law property belonging to or held on behalf of a Hungarian national came up for consideration and the distinction between a shareholder and a company was emphasised and highlighted In <ORG> <NAME> KB <ORG> in England while dealing with an English company carrying on business in the Owned of the shares in a foreign company which gave it a preponderating influence in the control election of directors etc The remaining shares in the foreign company were however held by independent persons and there was no evidence that the English company had ever attempted to control or interfere with the management of Lord <NAME> at page of the report has made certain interesting observations which are worth repeating in the context of the instant case Professor <NAME> in his book on company law says there is evidence of a general tendency to ignore the separate legal entities of various companies within a group and to look instead at the economic entity of the whole group I would allow the appeal accordingly In order to resolve this matter it will be necessary for me to refer in some detail to the facts <NAME> also observed at page as follows Even if this were not right there is the further argument advanced on behalf of the claimants that there was so complete an identity of the different companies comprised in the so called group that they ought to be regared for this purpose as a single entity the parent company and they had a common interest in maintaining on the property concerned the business of the group I cannot read the clause as compelling the board to assign duties to the respondent in relation to the business of every company in the group Nor can I read it as compelling the board to assign him duties in relation to the business of the appellant company It is true that each company in the group is in law a separate entity the business whereof is to be carried on by its own directors and managing director if any but there is no doubt that the appellant company by taking any necessary formal steps could make any arrangements they pleased in regard to the management of the business of for instance <ORG> All where Viscount Simonds of <ORG> observed at pages as follows My Lords it may be that the acts of the society of which complaint is made could not be regarded as conduct of the affairs of the company if the society and the company were bodies wholly independent of each other competitors in the rayon market and using against each other such methods of trade warfare as custom permitted I have expressed myself strongly in this case because it appears to me to be a glaring example of precisely the evil which <ORG> intended to remedy The company through the knowledge the experience the connexions the business ability and the energies of the respondents had built up a valuable goodwill in which the society shared and which there is no reason to think would not have been maintained if not increased with the co operation of the society It may not be possible for the legal remedies that would follow in the case of a partnership to follow here but the principle has I think valuable application to the circumstances of this case <NAME> drew out attention to the decision in <ORG> <NAME> Inspector of Taxes TC where at page of the report <NAME> Observed that where you have a wholly owned subsidiary and both the parent company and wholly owned subsidiary enter into trading relationships there is of course a dual relation but you cannot for the purposes of tax disregard the fact that there are in fact two entities and two trades that is to say the trade of each company Here indubitably we are of the opinion that it is correct that <ORG> was brought into existence by <ORG> in order to fulfil the condition of industrial licence of <ORG> through production of aluminium In spite of repeated requests made by <ORG> the State did not take any decision on the said application of <ORG> and also purported to raise and enforce demands under the Duty Act against <ORG> On th May <ORG> delivered judgment quashing the aforesaid rejection and asking <ORG> to consider the matter afresh in accordance with law and in accordance with the directions contained in the said judgment <ORG> passed an order on th September quashing the order As we have read the said provisions it appears to us that the dominance of public interest is significant and we refer to the various factors namely a prevailing charges for supply of energy in any area the generating capacity of any plant the need to promote industrial production generally or any specified class therof and other relevant factors and then taking all these factors into consideration in public interest to fix different rates of electricity duty in relation to different classes of consumption of energy or allow any exemption from payment thereof <NAME> for the respondents is right that in view of the ceilings prescribed the power conferred upon the <ORG> under section of the Act by itself is valid and does not amount to excessive delegation where at page of the report while dealing with the facts of that case Justice <NAME> observed that as it was seen in that case the conflict raged over questions that at heart involved problems of statutory construction and cost accounting whether an operating deficit in the auxiliary or supporting activities was a legitimate cost in maintaining and operating the Canal for purpose of the toll formula There the writ petition involved the claim for withdrawal of fixed dose combinations and withdrawal of licences of manufacturers engaged in manufacture of about drugs which have been licensed by <ORG> the issues that fell for consideration are not only relating to technical and specialised matters relating to therapeutic value justification and harmful side effects of drugs but also involved examination of the correctness of action taken by respondents and therein on the basis of advice the matter also involved the interest of manufacturers and traders of drugs as also the interest of patients who require drugs for their treatment The technical aspects which arose for consideration in a matter of that type could not be effectively handled by a court This <ORG> also reiterated that similarly the question of policy which was involved in the matter was also one for <ORG> keeping the best interest of citizens in view to decide The said order read as follows The <ORG> has also emphasized that <ORG> is spending a huge sum of money in foreign exchange to meet the requirements of aluminium in India with a view to increasing the aluminium production by <ORG> should be made available at cheap rate and exemption should be granted to the <ORG> from payment of electricity duty The Central <ORG> thereafter issued notification thereunder He referred to the fact that due to the proliferation of delegated legislation there is a tendency for the line between legislation and administration to vanish into an illusion Administrative quasi judicial decisions tend to merge in legislative activity and conversely legislative activity tends to fade into and present an appearance of an administrative or quasi judicial activity Any attempt to draw a distinct line between legislative and administrative functions it has been said is difficult in theory and impossible in practice It appears to us that sub section of section of the Act in the set up is quasi legislative and quasi administrative in so far as it has power to fix different rates having regard to certain factors and in so far as it has power to grant exemption in some cases in our opinion is quasi legislative in character <ORG> was right only to the limited extent that all the relevant considerations must be taken into account and the power should not be exercised on irrelevant considerations but singular consideration which <ORG> in our opinion seems to have missed in the judgment under appeal is these factors namely the prevailing charges for supply of energy in any area the generating capacity of any plant the need to promote industrial production generally or any specified class thereof and other relevant factors cannot be judged disjointly It read as follows In settling rents under this section the Collector shall presume unless the contrary is proved that the existing rent or rate of rent is fair and equitable and shall have regard to the provisions of this Act for determining rates of rent payable by a ryot <ORG> observed at page of the report as follows Having regard to the long time that had elapsed since the last tentative settlement of rent in to the prodigions rise in prices that had taken place since then and to the general economic improvement of this part of the country <ORG> considered that an enhancement of per cent would not be oppressive and directed the <ORG> officer to reduce to that figure the enhancement of per cent which he had made This view of the effect of the direction to have regard to the provisions of the Act for determining rates of rent payable by a ryot is supported by the decision of <ORG> in Mad It is also confirmed by certain observations of Reilly in at where the learned Judge said Where the settling officer has to deal only with such questions as would arise in a suit for commutation for enhancement or reduction of money rent under he must be guided by the appropriate principles as set out in the Act but there is no doubt that his settlement may embrace a much wider field of question and whenever he has not merely to adjust the lawful rent but to fix what is fair and equitable in variation from the lawful rent which can be exacted in a suit his settlement is clearly something which no civil Court could do unless specially empowered <ORG> was of the view at page of the judgment that there was a mandatory duty to consider the factors mentioned hereinbefore The expression having regard to only obliges the <ORG> to consider as relevant data material to which it must have regard to We have examined the correspondence that passed between the parties and we are of the opinion that there was no violation of the principles of natural justice because the relevant datas were made available to the appellants The exercise of power whether legislative or administrative will be set aside if there is manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary Similarly if the power has been exercised on a non consideration or non application of mind to re levant factors the exercise of power will be regarded as manifestly erroneous If a power whether legislative or administrative is exercised on the basis of acts which do not exist and which are patently erroneous such exercise of power will stand vitiated On this aspect our attention was drawn on behalf of the respondents at pages of the judgment in Volume It was submitted that the assumption that electricity duty was included in the prices of <ORG> fixed by <ORG> formed a basic and a very important consideration in the making of the impugned order It is true that <ORG> has made profits much more than it had before the imposition of the duty <ORG> is being supplied with electrical energy at a very nominal rate and taking into consideration the prevailing practice of levy of electricity duty in other <ORG>s as well as the provisions stated in section the Government have come to the conclusion that there is no justification for allowing exemption from electricity duty to Union of India where at page of the report this <ORG> observed that in the ultimate analysis the mechanics of price fixation has necessarily to be left to the judgment of the executive and unless it is patent that there is hostile discrimination against a class of operators the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid State of Ors this Court was dealing with the Essential Commodities Act and the Sugarcane Control order and observed that in determining the reasonableness of restrictions imposed by law in the field of industry trade or commerce the mere fact that some of the persons engaged in a particular trade may incur loss due to the imposition of restrictions will not render them unreasonable because it is manifest that trade and industry pass through periods of prosperity and adversity on account of economic social or political factors There is scope for trial and error in such sphere The principles of these cases will have no application to the facts of this case Reference was made to the observations in the case of <ORG> where at page of the report this <ORG> observed that the power to grant exemption to factories from payment of additional price is intimately connected with the right of sugarcane growers to claim additional price We therefore allow the appeal to the extent indicated above and set aside the judgment of <ORG> to that extent and restore <ORG> impugned order subject to the modification of the bills on the basis of own source of generation The appeal is disposed of in those terms On the second issue I think it is difficult to define the Precise nature of the power conferred on <ORG> under Section of the Electricity Duty Act and A have doubts whether the sub section can at all be interpreted as conferring a right on individual consumers to require that in the light of the material adduced by them the rates applicable to them should have been fixed differently or that they should have been exempted from duty altogether However it is unnecessary to pursue this aspect further as I agree with the conclusion of my learned brother that in this case the respondent representations have been fully considered and the requirements of natural justice have been fulfilled and that there is no warrant to interfere with the order of <ORG>
