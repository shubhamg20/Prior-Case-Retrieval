By Section of the same Act any general rules for regulating the practice and proceedings of <ORG> made and issued by the Judges of that Court were to be sent to <ORG> for approval Then there was the power of <ORG> to prohibit <ORG> from proceeding where it was acting without jurisdiction or in excess of jurisdiction and there was the power of reserving questions of law or equity for the opinion of <ORG> and the obligation to do so in oases above the value of Rs For the above reasons Mr Justice <NAME> held that <ORG> though not subject in all respects or perhaps generally to the superintendence of <ORG> nor strictly speaking subject to its appellate jurisdiction at all was so far subject to its superintendence as to give the latter <ORG> under Clause of the Letters Patent power to remove and try and determine any suit pending in the former <ORG> when <ORG> for purposes of justice should think proper to do so But this may well have been for the sake of greater caution and it is quite possible that the <ORG> in framing the Presidency Small Cause Courts Act of had in mind the decision of Mr Justice <NAME> which was delivered in For instance Section of Act XV of declares that <ORG> shall have in respect of <ORG> the same powers as it has under the Charter Act in respect of Courts subject to its appellate jurisdiction and these powers include the power to make and issue general rules for regulating the practice and proceedings the same power being given by Section of the Act Not only is it stated in the preamble of Act II of that it is expedient to provide for the superintendence or revision of certain of the judgments and proceedings of the Resident at Aden by <ORG> but the Act provides in Section that <ORG> shall have power to make and issue general rules for regulating the practice and proceedings of <ORG> and also to frame forms It would seem therefore that the <ORG> expressly intended that <ORG> should have superintendence over <ORG> There is no appeal from decisions or orders civil or criminal of the Resident Sections and of Act II of But nevertheless <ORG> may have superintendence over the Resident <ORG> and it is clear from Sections to of the Act II of that in certain oases a litigant in the Resident <ORG> has of right what is practically an appeal to <ORG> Mr <NAME> would have us read Clause of the Letters Patent and Section of the Charter Act together so strictly that <ORG> can have no superintendence over a <ORG> unless an appeal properly so called lies from the decisions of such <ORG> to <ORG> For these reasons I think that this <ORG> has jurisdiction under Clause of the Letters Patent and I would make the rule absolute Costs to abide the result This is an application made by <NAME> under Section of the Amended Letters Patent of for a transfer to this Court of the suit filed by the applicant in <ORG> at Aden against the opponent the Municipal Officer at Aden It is contended however that the power of superintendents given by the Act to this <ORG> is not a judicial but a purely ministerial power It is true that according to Section of the Act no appeal lies to this <ORG> from any decision or order of the Resident but the power given to this <ORG> to hear and pass judgments in certain cases mentioned in the said Section when those oases are referred to this <ORG> as prescribed thereby is undoubtedly a judicial not a purely ministerial power Cases so referred to this <ORG> have to be heard under Section by two or more Judges and this <ORG> has to give Judgment in every case It is this <ORG> which in effect decides the case it is the tribunal which gives judgment and according to Section that judgment is an order of the <ORG> Section of the Letters Patent ordains That the said High <ORG> of Judicature at Bombay shall have power to remove and to try and determine as a <ORG> of Extraordinary Original Jurisdiction any suit being or falling within the jurisdiction of any <ORG> whether within or without the Presidency of Bombay subject to its superintendence when the said High <ORG> shall think proper to do so either on the agreement of the parties to that effect or for purposes of justice the reasons for so doing being recorded on the proceedings of the said High <ORG> taking the Act and the Letters Patent together the High <ORG> has superintendence where it has appellate jurisdiction and has appellate jurisdiction where it has superintendence The view taken by <ORG> in the case just cited was this Where there is an appeal to the <ORG> allowed by any law or regulation in hearing the appeal it exercises its appellate jurisdiction but the same jurisdiction may be exercised and is as a matter of fact exercised for all practical purposes where the <ORG> decides a suit referred to it by law oh Questions both of fact and of law That was the view taken by <NAME> and <NAME> JJ That decision was noticed in terms of approval by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> and I see no reason to dissent from the view there taken and the remarks of <NAME> <NAME> in his judgment in that case that a power of revision is not an incident of appellate powers but on the contrary can only be exercised where there is no appeal were relied upon The inclusion of the power to hear appeals under the Civil Procedure Code necessarily implied the exclusion of the power to act in revision under Section of that Code It follows then from these considerations that <ORG> is a <ORG> subject to the superintendence of this <ORG> within the meaning of Section of the Amended Letters Patent of The fact that the superintendence is of a partial and limited character cannot affect the question We have no doubt that that circumstance is not likely to weigh with him in drying and deciding the case but the decided oases show that if a party has reasonable grounds for apprehending that the Judge who is to try his case is likely to be biased he is entitled to a transfer of the case from that Judge
