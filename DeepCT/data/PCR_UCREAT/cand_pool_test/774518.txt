It is a statutory definition enacted for the purpose of the aforesaid Control Order which uses the expression <NAME> Sugar It has nothing to do with the moaning and content of the term <NAME> as used by the trade in Or to turn the headlights on the observations made in each of the decisions The petitions were dismissed by a Single Judge and that decision was confirmed by <ORG> There is no material even to show that this nomenclature was known to the petitioners or to the traders themselves there to before There is nothing in the definition of Producer contained in of the Act which would justify overriding the clear language of the statutes read in the light of the perspective of the Act and the history of the levy And this <ORG> has consistently taken the view that in the matter of classification the <ORG> has a wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and that a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others The <NAME> sugar produced by the petitioners in their mills with the aid of power in the open pan process by employing large number of employees to whom the Industrial Disputes Act Minimum Wages Act Factories Act The prefatory note and the preamble can be looked into in the present case as there is dispute between the parties on the question whether <NAME> sugar produced by the petitioners which is not included in the schedule or definition of agricultural produce in the Adhiniyam while <NAME> is mentioned in the definition of agricultural produce in a thereof can be the subject matter of levy of market fee under the Adhiniyam Both Plantation While Sugar and <NAME> Sugar are industrial products and there is discrimination against <NAME> Sugar in seeking to subject it to the levy under the Adhiniyam leaving out plantation White Sugar Laxmi <NAME> Etc In the process of manufacture of Khandsari sugar there is not only a physical change of the sugarcane used but also a chemical change and the white crystalline sugar of per cent sucros purity is obtained after drying grading and vagging by eliminating all the ingredients of sugarcane except sucros The <ORG> applies to agricultural products which according to a are such items of produce of agriculture horticulture viticulture sericulture pisciculture animal husbandary or forest as are specified in the schedule and include and mixture of two or more such items and also include any such item in processed form and further include gur rab shakkar Khandsari and jaggery The khandsari sugar produced by the petitioners who hold licence for operating hydraulic power crushers is not khandsari but crystalline sugar as produced by sugar mills It is in these circumstances that the petitioners have prayed for declaration of the provisions of the Adhiniyam as being ultra vires the Constitution and for the issue of a writ of mandamus restraining the respondents from realising market fee and licence fee from the petitioners under the Adhiniyam Khandsari is the short form of Khandsari sugar in the Adhiniyam and the notification and there is nothing like khandsari different from khandsari sugar in any of the concerned laws or in common parlance There is no chemical change in the process adopted by the petitioners in the manufacture of Khandsari sugar and there is nothing like desi Khandsari sugar It is true that khandsari sugar manufactured by the petitioners contains more than per cent sucros but it is denied that the sugar manufactured by the petitioners is not khandsari or that it is crystalline sugar as produced by sugar mills or that the khandsari sugar produced by the petitioners is not physically and chemically different from the sugar produced by mills The produce manufactured by the petitioners is processed form of sugarcane namely sugarcane from which the chaff has been removed and the sweet material has been retained for human consumption Gur rab jaggery and khandsari sugar are all manufactured by the open pan process while sugar produced by mills is manufactured by the vacuum pan process There is no discrimination against the petitioners and of the Adhiniyam is not violative of Art There is no levy on khandsari and it is sold in the open market whereas per cent of the sugar produced in the mills by the vacuum pan process is taken by <ORG> for feeding the public distribution system by levy and the remaining per cent along is left with the factories for free sale through wholesale dealers approved under the control orders Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioners advanced arguments in these petitions under three main heads namely i whether khandsari sugar manufactured by the petitioners in their mills by the open pan process is an agricultural produce covered by the Adhiniyam as amended by the Ace of ii whether khandsari sugar manufactured by the petitioners in their industrial units employing a large number of workmen to whom the Industrial Disputes Act Employees Provident Fund Act Factories Act and Minimum Wages Act apply and which is subject to levy of excise duty under the Sugar Special Excise Duty Act is subject to the levy of market fee under the Adhiniyam and iii whether on account of the interpretation of the Adhiniyam khandsari sugar manufactured by the petitioners could be said to be subject to the levy of market fee under the Adhiniyam there is any difference between khandsari sugar produced by the petitioners in the open pan process and the plantation white sugar produced by the other mills in the vacuum pan process and there is no discrimination between khandsari sugar sought to be subjected to the levy of market fee under the Adhiniyam and the plantation white sugar produced by the vacuum pan process which is not subject to the levy under the Adhiniyam On the third point he submitted that there is no difference between the khandsari sugar produced by the petitioners in their mills by the open pan process and the plantation white sugar produced by the other mills by the vacuum pan process except that khandsari sugar is produced by the open pan process while the plantation white sugar is produced by the vacuum pan process and the difference in the composition of the two products is only as regards CAO filterability and conductivity and consequently there is discrimination hit by Art will be attracted only in the case of identity and there is difference between Khandsari sugar and plantation white sugar and therefore there is no question of discrimination On the question of discrimination he submitted that plantation white sugar manufactured by the vacuum pan process does not require regulation unlike khandsari sugar produced by the open pan process and that if that is so there is no question of discrimination in not subjecting the plantation white sugar to the levy of market fee under the Adhiniyam On the question of discrimination he submitted that whatever was considered necessary to be regulated was included in the schedule to the Adhiniyam and that there is no discrimination in not subjecting plantation white sugar produced by the vacuum pan process to the levy of market fee under the Adhiniyam Section of the <ORG> defines a producer as meaning a person who whether by himself or through hired labour produces rears or catches any agricultural produce not being a producer who also works as a trader broker or dalal commission agent or arhatiya or who is otherwise ordinarily engaged the business of storage of agricultural produce Thus it is seen from the definition of producer and trader in the <ORG> that emphasis is on the product produced reared or caught by agriculturists whether by their own or through hired labour and that such producer does not include a producer who also works as a trader broker dalal commission agent or arhatiya or who is otherwise ordinarily engaged in the business of storage of agricultural produce In Annexure VIII to the counter affidavit filed in of it is stated that the improved process of khandsari manufacture as evolved by <ORG> of <ORG> Kanpur is a simplified form of the single sulphitation process as employed in the vacuum pan factories and that as a result of the improvements it is now possible to get a recovery of to per cent of sugar on cane of average quality and the first sugar produced is quite comparable to ordinary grade crystal sugar produced by the vacuum pan process Thus it would appear that what is sought to be subjected to the levy of market fee under the Adhiniyam is khandsari produced by the agriculturist or producer of sugarcane in the old indigenous method and not khandsari sugar produced by persons like the petitioners in their modern mills by the open pan process Mr <NAME> conceded in the course of his arguments that protection of the agricultural producer was the object when the original idea of the <ORG> started and he submitted that the object has now become widened and it is now not a legislation for protecting the interests of only agricultural producers and that it has become a marketing legislation under entry of List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and industrial products also can be included in the schedule There is a further implied submission in this argument of Mr <NAME> that khandsari sugar is an industrial product as it undoubtedly is Therefore it is not possible to accept the argument of Mr <NAME> that the <ORG> originally intended to protect the interests of agricultural producers has become a marketing legislation under entry of List II in the Seventh Schedule by the mere fact of inclusion of one or more industrial products in the definition of agricultural produce in a of the <ORG> The prefatory note and the preamble can be looked into only in the present case as there is dispute between the parties on the question whether khandsari sugar produced by the petitioners which is not included in the schedule or definition of agricultural produce in the <ORG> while khandsari is mentioned in the definition of agricultural produce in a thereof can be the subject matter of levy of market fee under the <ORG> It is admitted by Dr <NAME> that the petitioners factories are working under licences and that it is not obligatory on agricultural producers producing khandsari in the indigenous method to obtain licences for producing the same Reference is made at page in the judgment of my learned A brother <NAME> in these Writ Petitions to the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> in Special Appeal No of filed against the decision of a Single Judge of that court in No of The reliefs claimed in that Writ Petition were a writ of certioraris quashing the Ordinance of which was replaced by the Amendment Act of and a writ of mandamus directing the respondents State of Uttar Pradesh and others not to enforce the Ordinance against the petitioners therein The State Government issued a notification dated under of the <ORG> declaring their intention to regulate the sale and purchase of specified agricultural produce in the areas including the New Mandi Muzaffarnagar The points raised in the aforesaid Special Appeal No of were <ORG> was not competent to enlarge the definition of agricultural produce so as to include gur rab shakkar khandsari and jaggery within the term agricultural produce <ORG> had no legislative competence to enact the Amendment Act of as that Act was with reference to subject of industries the control of which lay with <ORG> as declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest within the meaning of entry of List I to the Seventh Schedule The provisions of the Amendment Act of are repugnant to the Industries Development and Regulation Act The provisions of the Amendment Act of are discriminatory as vacuum pan sugar is not included in the definition of agricultural produce in a and The provisions of the Amendment Act of infringe the fundamental right guaranteed by Art <ORG> held in Special Appeal No of relying upon this <ORG> decision in <NAME> State of Punjab that in view of the extended definition of agricultural produce after the Amendment Act of an enquiry whether gur rab shakkar and khandsari are agricultural produce or not is beyond the purview of the <ORG> and that there is no discrimination as there is essential difference between gur rab shakkar and khandsari under one head and vacuum pan sugar on the other as the former are manufactured by the open pan process and the latter is manufactured by the vacuum pan process and the vacuum pan process sugar industry is in existence since and involves big sugar factories whereas industries producing khandsari sugar by open pan process are of recent origin and those units carry on small scale business It is sufficient to say that in my view that decision relates to the necessity to obtain a licence under the Adhiniyam for dealing in khandsari sugar and certain other commodities introduced into the definition of agricultural produce by the Ordinance which was replaced by the Amendment Act of and it had nothing to do with the liability of khandsari sugar manufacturers sellers to pay market fee under the Adhiniyam On the question of discrimination Mr <NAME> submitted that plantation white sugar produced is by the vacuum pan process in the same manner as khandsari sugar is produced by the open pan process and that there is major difference between the two industrial products and there is discrimination in so far as plantation white sugar is not sought to be subjected to the levy of market fee under the Adhiniyam where only khandsari sugar is AIR SC He submitted that the difference A in the process of manufacture alone is not a distinguishing factor and that the difference in the process of manufacture cannot be a ground for holding that there is no discrimination if the levy could be made on khandsari sugar under the <ORG> leaving plantation white sugar out of its purview where it is observed at page that the restriction may be partial complete permanent or temporary but this must bear a close nexus with the object sought to be achieved But it must be remembered that the <ORG> is concerned with the levy of market fee on a variety of products namely agricultural produce and that if khandsari sugar produced by the petitioners in their mills by the open pan process out of sugarcane juice could be brought under the purview of the <ORG> it is difficult to understand how plantation white sugar for the production of which also sugarcane is the raw material could be exempted from the levy Mr <NAME> submitted that plantation white sugar produced by the vacuum pan process does not require regulation and therefore there is no discrimination in not subjecting it to the levy under <ORG> Similarly Dr <NAME> submitted that whatever was considered necessary to be regulated was brought under the <ORG> and that there is no discrimination Both plantation white sugar and khandsari sugar are industrial products and there is clear discrimination in my view against khandsari sugar in seeking to subject it to the levy under the Adhiniyam leaving out plantation white sugar THAKKAR The petitioners in the Present group of fourteen Writ petitions under Art of the Constitution of India are owners of Khandsari factories in Uttar Pradesh They seek appropriate relief on the premise that what they produce is Khandsari Sugar and not Khandsari which is covered by the definition of Agricultural Produce in section a of Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam Act hereinafter referred to as the Act which read as under agricultural produce means such items of produce of agriculture horticulture viticulture apiculture sericulture pisciculture animal husbandry or forest as are specified in the Schedule and includes admixture of two or more of such items and also includes any such item in processed form and further includes gur rab shakkar khandsari and jaggery Accordingly they contend that they are not liable to obtain a licence under Rule of the Rules framed in exercise of powers under section of the Act or to pay the licence fees Rs Writ Petition No of in <ORG> challenging the validity of the inclusion of Khandsari in the definition of agricultural produce contained in section a The challenge was made on several grounds but no distinction was sought to be made between Khandsari produced indigenously on the one hand and Khandsari produced in the factories like the petitioners factories on the other hands by calling the latter as Khandsari Sugar It has nothing to do with the meaning and content of the term Khandsari as used by the trade in Since the term Khandsari has not been defined by the Act it must be construed in its popular sense Or to turn the headlights on the observations made in each of the decisions Suffice it to say that the challenge was made on five grounds indicated in the judgment and that none of these grounds pertained to the aspect relating to the meaning and content of the term <NAME> There is no material for holding that the petitioners sell their product under the name <NAME> Sugar to the traders There is no material even to show that this nomenclature was known to the petitioners or to the traders themselves there to before The contention that the article produced by the petitioners is not <NAME> must therefore be firmly and unhesitatingly negatived and to render them immune from exploitation as indicated by the prefatory note and by the provisions contained in sections i ii iii iv viii etc The Act has many more objects and a much wider perspective such as development of new market areas efficient collection of data and processing of arrivals in Mandis with a view to enable <ORG> to give substantial economic assistance to establish various markets in Uttar Pradesh as also protection of consumers and even traders from being exploited in the matter of quality weight and price This needs no elaboration in view of the pronouncements of this Court There is therefore no merit in this nuance of the challenge The petitioners have next contended that having regard to the definition of Producer contained in section of the Act this Act could not have been intended to cover the article produced by them We do not see anything in the definition which would justify overriding the clear language of the statute read in the light of the perspective of the Act and the history of the levy We have therefore no hesitation in repelling this contention Lastly section a of the Act has been challenged on the ground that it is discriminatory and violative of Art It would appear from the affidavit that the most superior variety might perhaps be approximate in appearance to the plantation sugar manufactured by the sugar mills but would all the same fetch a somewhat lesser price than the price fetched by plantation sugar It is a different commercial product known by a different name in the trade Be that as it may the argument that unless both are regulated under the Act Art This Court has had several occasions to deal with a similar problem in the context of taxing statutes And this Court has consistently taken the view that is the matter of classification the <ORG> has a wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and that a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others It true than for a short period <NAME> was also subjected to levy under <NAME> Sugar Levy Order of on a relatively small portion of its production That however makes little difference from the standpoint of challenge to section a of the Act on the ground that Mill sugar is not included in the definition of agricultural produce and not subjected to the provisions of the Act So also the mere fact that both are sweetening agents will not justify condemnation of the classification which is based on a totality of the factors of differentiation There is therefore no substance in the challenge from the standpoint of Art The <ORG> will not impose on itself this responsibility if not for any A other reason than for the reason that it is beyond its province The arguments advanced on this wavelength need not therefore detain us any a longer Rule issued in each of the petitions will stand discharged There will be no order regarding costs
