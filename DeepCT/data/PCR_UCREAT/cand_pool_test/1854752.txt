By another notification dated th September the Government delegated its powers to the Director Civil Supplies to issue orders under the Act The respondents instituted a suit for the refund of the amount deposited by them towards <ORG> and Rs If it is not possible to identify the persons on whom had the burden been placed for payment towards the Fund the amount of the Fund can be utilised by the Government for the purpose for which the Fund was created namely the development of sugarcane There is no question of refunding the amount to the Respondents who had not eventually paid the amount towards the Fund The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The present appeal by certificate is directed against the judgment deted th April of <ORG> Indore Bench The facts leading to this appeal are brief By a notification No XXX dated th September <ORG> in exercise of the Powers vested under the said Act included sugar in the list of articles as an essential commodity By another notification No XXX dated the th September <ORG> delegated its powers to issue orders under the said Act in favour of the Director Civil Supplies Madhya Bharat The appellant made several demands on the respondents the proprietors of <ORG> to credit such difference in the account of <ORG> and the respondents ultimately deposited Rs under protest On the th September the respondents instituted a suit in the court of Fifth Additional District judge Indore against the erstwhile State of Madhya Bharat for the refund of the sum of Rs OF the Constitution was illegal and invalid that the provisions of Sugar Control Order did not empower the Director of Civil Supplies to fix any price other than ex factory wholesale or retail price or to fix a price which be called supply price or to impose and collect levy as Sugar Fund that is was illegal and unconstitutional for the Director of Civil Supplies to fix different ex factory prices for different sugar mills in the same <ORG> that it was illegal and unconstitutional to collect money through certain mills for creating Sugar Fund when other factories in the same <ORG> were being exempted from doing so that there was clear discrimination in fixing ex factory price of sugar in respect of respondents mill lower than ex factory price fixed for certain other mills in the <ORG> without there being a rational basis for the same and that the levy and collection of certain money from the respondents being without lawful authority and without legislative competence the <ORG> was bond to refund the same The trial court decided all the issues against the plaintiffs and consequently it dismissed the suit But in the instant case levy of Sugar Fund was imposed by means of an order which was published for the first time in <ORG> dated th January two days after the Constitution came into force Thus in the opinion of <ORG> the <ORG> had levied and collected under the purported legal authority certain money from the plaintiffs for which it had no legislative competence to do and therefore the <ORG> must restore the same to the persons from whom it was collected and cannot keep the same on the ground that plaintiffs too have been wrongly allowed to collect and that the persons who could claim the same were the corresponding purchasers from the respondents was perfectly lawful and proper and there was no discrimination as contemplated by Art the dealers applied under of the Act for refund of tax paid on the ground that sales outside the State were not taxable under cl a of Art The Orissa Sales Tax Act was however amended in with retrospective effect incorporating A which provided that refund could be claimed only by the person from whom the dealer had realised the amount by way of sales tax or otherwise On these facts it was held by this Court that under A of the Act incorporated by the Orissa Sales Tax Amendment Act refund of tax which the dealer was not liable to pay could be claimed by the person from whom the dealer had actually realised it whether as sales tax or otherwise and not by the dealer This Court however took the view that the term mistake under of the Indian Contract Act comprises within its scope a mistake of law as well as a mistake of fact and that under that section a party is entitled to recover had the occasion to consider the question of refund to the dealers in a similar situation and it observed We do not see how a mere declaration that the levy and collection of fee in excess of Rs per hundred would automatically vest in the dealer the right to get at the excess amount when in fact he did not bear the burden of it and when the moral and equitable owner of it was the consumer public to whom the burden had been passed on The principles laid down in the aforesaid cases were based on the specific provisions in those Acts but the same principles can safely be applied to the facts of the present case inasmuch as in the present case also the respondents had not to pay the amount from their coffers If it is not possible to identify the persons on whom had the burden been placed for payment towards the Fund the amount of the Fund can be utilised by the Government for the purpose for which the Fund Was created namely development of sugarcane There is no question of refunding the amount to the respondents who had not eventually paid the amount towards the Fund In the circumstances of the case the parties shall bear their own costs
