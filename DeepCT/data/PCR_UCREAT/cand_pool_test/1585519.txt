These appeals by special leave are preferred by the State Government against the judgment and order of <ORG> dated May acquitting the respondents <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> of offences punishable under Section read with Section and under Sections and of the Indian Penal Code for the commission of which the Civil Sessions Judge <NAME> by his judgment dated September had sentenced them to death on the first count and rigorous imprisonment for a period of years under the remaining three counts We have with the assistance of learned counsel appearing for the parties gone through the judgment of <ORG> as well as the evidence of the material prosecution witnesses This was a case where during the night between December there was a brutal and dastardly murder of <NAME> a millionaire and his wife Smt a The Report stated that the list of the looted property will be furnished later and contains the following recitals on which there was quite some discussion at the Bar We saw that all the articles were lying scattered in the big room and the small room close by was locked SCC in somewhat similar circumstances where the servant betraying the trust of his employer strangulated the mistress of the house and decamped with her gold and silver ornaments which were later recovered the presumption arising under Illustration a to Section of the Evidence Act is that not only the accused if their complicity is proved committed the murder of the deceased <NAME> and his wife <NAME> but also committed robbery of the gold and silver ornaments which formed part of the same transaction There is much to be said for the contrary view expressed by the learned Judges of <ORG> who have in their judgment carefully marshalled the evidence and drawn out serious infirmities in the prosecution case Ka made by the accused <NAME> before <NAME> PW Magistrate First Class Farrukhabad on January and the fact that he had sold a gold ring to <NAME> PW We shall first take up the appeal against the respondent <NAME> who had been found guilty by the learned Sessions Judge of a charge under Section of the Indian Penal Code There is not an iota of evidence to establish that the three accused prior to the commission of the offences had conspired together with the accused <NAME> and got forged from him the ruqqa Exh There is nothing to show that the accused <NAME> had been associating with the other accused That takes us to the appeal against the three respondents <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> In support of its case that the three accused had effected an entry into the house of the deceased on the fateful evening at about the prosecution has examined witnesses namely <NAME> servant of the deceased <NAME> <NAME> PW old rnunim of the deceased who had started a safara business of his own Dr <NAME> Lal PW Homeopath who had his shop in line with the sadar darwaza of the house of the deceased and <NAME> PW a shopkeeper nearby <ORG> on a careful consideration of these witnesses found considerable doubt as to their credibility as truthful witnesses and has given weighty and cogent reasons for discarding their evidence In the first place it is difficult to believe that the deceased would have relieved his old servant <NAME> PW when at least one unknown person namely the accused <NAME> was present inside the house and there was no evidence to show that he knew him from before He further states that he took the jhola and passed it on to the deceased and as he was about to leave he saw the three accused <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> in the passage leading to the sadar darwaza and that they had come with a note Exh There was no need for them to have taken a letter of introduction when two of them were known to the deceased He admits that he had given the particulars of the stolen gold and silver ornaments from the pawn register We would have unhesitatingly maintained the conviction of the respondents <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> for these offences as also the sentence of death passed on them by the learned Sessions Judge if the evidence led by the prosecution to establish the recovery and seizure of the stolen property was credible and worthy of acceptance Unfortunately for the State <ORG> has in its judgment brought out serious infirmities in the prosecution case which create considerable doubt and suspicion about the complicity of the accused in the commission of the crime and the alleged recovery of the stolen property made at their instance We feel it would be better to set out in extenso the portions of the judgment dealing with the various circumstances appearing from the prosecution evidence which make the alleged recoveries not free from suspicion In the first instance there is evidence to show that valuable ornaments were found spread out inside and outside the main living room but we have been left guessing as to what happened to these It is obviously hit by Section read with Section of the CrPC We still proceed on the basis of two hypothesis one advanced by the learned counsel for the appellants to the effect that suspicion against the appellants <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> came into existence not on December or even in day time on December but sometime in the night between December th or on December and then the activities started and the second one advanced by the learned Deputy Government Advocate that the names of these three suspects were known latest by midday of December and attempts were made to arrest them but this attempt had failed It will be natural in the circumstances therefore for them to start guessing as to who could be the possible culprits <NAME> would only question <NAME> the domestic servant of the deceased as to when he had left the house in the proceeding night and as to what intruders were there and to imagine that nothing of the sort will be done would be rather improbable He also knew that they had come for the ostensible purpose of pawning ornaments but he himself had not seen any with them He started recording statements of witnesses who could possibly throw some light On the other hand let us assume that he had evidence before him by about mid day on December that these three suspects had a possible hand in the crime he would move in a frantic and hectic manner to get hold of them This was not done and that again is consistent with the fact that the Investigating Officer had no clues in his hand and would be consistent with the fact that he knew and still did not take the steps which any prudent Investigating Officer would have taken We agree with these observations made by <ORG> The testimony of the Investigating Officer <NAME> <NAME> shows that while he was recording the statements of the witnesses they revealed certain information on the basis of which he suspected the involvement of the accused He then took the accused <NAME> and members of his family in a truck for the house of <NAME> in village Akbarpur but he was not to be found On the next day i on the rd he recorded the statement of <NAME> PW and the other witnesses at the Police Station On interrogation he revealed that he had sold a gold ring to <NAME> at Farrukhabad and offered to hand There are however certain mysterious circumstances He therefore despatched a team of sub inspectors to village Behta at If that be so then there was no reason for him to wait till a i for nine hours Ka before <NAME> Magistrate First Class Farrukhabad on the nd and confessed that he had sold a gold ring to <NAME> PW There is no legal evidence to sustain their conviction for the offences with which they were charged That was also the stand of the learned counsel appearing for the respondents
