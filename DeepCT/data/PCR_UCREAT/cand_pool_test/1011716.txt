ORDER The assessee who is a wealthy nobleman and a landed proprietor also carries on the business of money lending The defendant denied that there was any such contract as alleged by the plaintiffs or that he was liable to them In the course of the assessment of the year the assessee claimed to deduct a sum of Rs on account of expenses incurred in connection with the suit in that year In the present assessment year the assessee claims to deduct the sum of lacs and odd already mentioned above as legal expenses incurred in connection with the suit during the year of assessment These findings were that there was no agreement between the late Maharaja and the <ORG> to finance the latter and that the suit was the outcome of a conspiracy to defraud him of large sums On behalf of <ORG> on the other hand it was contended that as there was no contract between the late Maharaja and the <ORG> the suit had nothing to do with the Maharajas money lending transactions and must be regarded merely as the kind of false suit to which a wealthy person is exposed by reason of his wealth The allowance mentioned in clause ix is expenditure not being in the nature of capital expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of earning such profits or gains It is contended that the sum claimed to be deducted is expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of earning the profits which have been assessed to tax The late <NAME> was a shareholder in <ORG> and there is no dispute that in the <ORG> was in very serious financial difficulties The Court which decided the suit held that there was no agreement by the late Maharaja to finance the company beyond the sum of Rs The Income tax authorities declined to allow the deduction claimed by the assessee in connection with the costs of this suit When the debtor defaulted in repayment of that loan the assessed sued him and in execution of the decree obtained in the suit he took possession of the debtors business and continued it There was another transaction of the same kind with Dr <NAME> of Bombay and with the same result The Commissioner also distinguishes the three first mentioned instances on the ground that in those instances the assessee acquired the business of the debtors whereas in the case under discussion he merely assumed the management of the debtors business The conclusion I have come to is that there is no essential difference between taking over the debtors property for the purpose of preventing the loss of sums advanced and the taking over of the management of the debtors business for the same purpose and I therefore hold that the alleged transaction with <ORG> was not foreign to the money lending business of the assessee and his father The next and more difficult question is whether the costs of defending the suit can be regarded as expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of earning the profits of the business so as the attract the provisions of clause ix sub section of Section of the Act On behalf of the <ORG> it is contended that the expenditure was not for the purpose of earning the profits of the assessees business at all and even if it can be so regarded it was not solely for that purposes but mainly for repelling allegations affecting the late Maharajas honour and for protecting his business against loss of capital That decision has no application to the facts of the present case I think it follows as a consequence that if expenditure incurred for securing the assessee against possible loss of his business stock and stores that is his stock in trade is allowable expenditure should not be disallowed when it is incurred for the purpose of repelling an actual attack on the assessees stock in trade It was because the late <NAME> lent money to the Company that an opportunity was afforded to the plaintiffs to allege that the advance of lacs of rupees actually made was only a part performance of a contract the scope of which was very much wider The assessee is entitled to his costs and to the refund of the one hundred rupees deposited for the reference <NAME> <NAME> I agree with the view taken by my learned brother If spending money to recover this ten lacs is treated as not being in the nature of capital expenditure and incurred solely for the purpose of earning the profits or gains of the money lending business then I cannot see why money spent in defending a false claim arising out of the same transaction is not to be treated upon the same basis That version might have been an almost completely false version of what took place but it cannot be denied that it was built up upon the transaction in which the loan of ten lacs was made If the <NAME> was to show a profit upon this transaction it was not only necessary for him to sue for recovery but also to defend any false claims which might have been based on the transaction Having regard to this principle the ruling in In re <ORG> I I Lah It seems to me that there is little distinction between expenses incurred by <ORG> in defending such a suit for compensation based as it would be upon the implied contract for safe carriage and the expenses incurred by a money lender in defending a false claim based upon one of his money lending contract
