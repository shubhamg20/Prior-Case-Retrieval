The learned Judge of the <ORG> below was of opinion that the assessment was made upon a wrong principle but he considered that in making it the Commissioners were acting within their powers and consequently he had no authority to interfere It is an authority derived from the old Supreme <ORG> and is similar to that which was exercised by the <ORG> of Queen Bench in England and if the Commissioners in this case were exceeding their jurisdiction in making the assessment it seems clear that we have the power to quash it upon certiorari notwithstanding the provision in Section in the Calcutta Municipal Consolidation Act Then by Section they are to impose upon all houses and land within the town of Calcutta certain annual rates arid amongst others a house rate which is to be calculated on the annual value of such house and land and lastly by Section the estimated gross annual rent at which any such house or land might reasonably be expected to let from year to year shall for the purpose of any rate to be imposed under the Act be held and deemed to be the annual value of such house or land The rates which the Commissioners impose are to be calculated on the annual value of the property rated Section and what is meant by the annual value of the property rated is the gross annual rent at which such property might be expected to let from year to year Section and I assessed the gross annual rent at which the said house and premises might reasdnably be expected to let from year to year at Rs It seems to me that this statement of <NAME> is virtually uncontradicted I am satisfied from the affidavits that the Commissioners adopted the assessment of their own surveyor based as they knew it was upon a percentage of the estimated cost of the buildings in entire disregard of the principle which they were bound by law to adopt as the basis of their assessment namely the gross annual rent at which the house might be expected to let from year to year In this it seems to me they acted beyond their powers They had no right whatever to make the assessment upon any other basis than that which the Act prescribes The principle of rating upon which the Commissioners are directed to proceed is the same which is adopted in England and similar difficulties arise there in the case of gentlemen parks and mansions which are laid out for residential purposes and not for sale or letting As they have failed to do so in this instance I think that the order of the <ORG> below should be reversed and that the rule nisi for the certiorari against the <ORG> should be made absolute I take the same view of the facts as the Chief Justice has taken and on the facts it is abundantly clear that the assessment upon the applicants was improperly made This question is not free from difficulty but I have come to the conclusion that the error committed does go to jurisdiction That section only gives power to fix the general standard of rating and has nothing to do with the assessment of the individual properties upon which the rates are to be charged This is dealt with in Section which says The Commissioners shall as provided in Section impose upon all houses and land within the town the following annual rates which shall be calculated on the annual value of the said houses and lands Now if we had nothing but these words to guide us I should say that in such an act value must mean money value and that the annual value of a house must mean the annual money benefit derivable from it and could not mean any percentage on its cost It says The estimated gross annual rent at which any house or land liable to rate under this Act might reasonably be expected to let from year to year shall for the purposes of any rate to be imposed under this Act be held and deemed to be the annual value of such house or land The value of land so estimated shall not include the value of any machinery thereupon
