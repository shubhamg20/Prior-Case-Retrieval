If <ORG> is not satisfied that the statements contained in the case are sufficient to enable it to determine the questions raised thereby the <ORG> may refer the case back to <ORG> by which it was stated to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the <ORG> may direst in that behalf Where a reference is made to <ORG> on the application of an assessee costs shall be in the discretion of the <ORG> We shall now state the grounds for our ruling on the question of procedure and then give our decision on the points raised in the Reference Under Section the Commissioner may pass such order as he thinks fit by way of confirmation reduction enhancement or cancellation of the assessment Section next authorises <ORG> to call for the record of any assessment proceeding which has been taken by any Officer subordinate to it and to make such enquiry and to pass such orders thereon as it thinks fit Section empowers <ORG> to make a reference to <ORG> either on it own motion that is when it has seizin of the proceeding under Section or on reference from any Revenue Officer subordinate to it that is while the proceeding is still before the Collector or the Commissioner Section further provides that <ORG> shall make such reference on the application of the assessee unless it is satisfied that the application is frivolous or that a reference is unnecessary When such a reference has been made the opinion pronounced by <ORG> cannot be ignored because it is made obligatory on <ORG> concerned to decide the case conformably to the judgment of <ORG> This does not justify the inference that the <ORG> has no power to revise proceedings or to hear references There is thus no escape from the conclusion that <ORG> exercises not an original but an appellate jurisdiction when it entertains a reference under Section of the Indian Income Tax Act A distinction may thus legitimately be drawn between a reference made in connection with an assessment on a person who resides in the town of Calcutta that is within the limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this <ORG> and a reference made in connection with an assessment on a person who resides beyond the limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of his <ORG> that <NAME>s had no right of audience in <ORG> in cases sent up for trial under Act XIV of where the <ORG> was equally divided in opinion upon the question whether <NAME>s were entitled to be heard in a proceeding under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code instituted in a <ORG> Small Cause <ORG> and brought up before <ORG> in the exercise of its revisional jurisdiction or of its power of superintendence Nor is any light thrown on the point before us by the practice in connection with references under Section of the Indian Stamp Act such references so far as we have been able to discover have hitherto been made mostly in connection with matters arising within the limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this <ORG> and in such cases claim to a right of audience would not ordinarily be put forward by <NAME>s but in one instance at least Reference under Stamp Act where the question arose in relation to <ORG> from the <ORG> Counsel appeared with a <NAME> at the hearing We have next to consider the questions referred by <ORG> to this Court for decision Is selami or premium agricultural income within the meaning of Section of the Indian Income Tax Act when charged Section a lays down that agricultural income means any rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes and is either assessed to land revenue or subject to a local rate assessed and collected by officers of Government as such The assessee contends that the incomes mentioned in the two questions are exempt from assessment as they constitute agricultural income within the meaning of the definition just given It is not necessary to hold that such Salami is rent within the meaning of the definition given in the Bengal Tenancy Act or the Transfer of Property Act From this point of view we must hold that the premium paid for the settlement of waste lands or abandoned holdings may reasonably be regarded as rent or revenue derived from land within the meaning of that expression as used in the definition of agricultural income in Section a The money is paid by the transferee to the landlord to purchase peace so that he may not contest the validity of the transfer The item uttarayan is a voluntary payment made by tenants at one piece per rupee of their rent for expenses of the Bastu Puja on the Uttarayan Sanskranti day the list day of the Bengali month Pous and for distribution of sweets and oranges to all servants of the estate <ORG> officers and local residents
