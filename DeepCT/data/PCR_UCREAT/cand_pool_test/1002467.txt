Section provides for the conditions for the grant of licence Sections and of the Act empower <ORG> and the Excise Commissioner subject to the previous sanction of the <ORG> to make rules On the day following the day when the licences were granted <ORG> issued a notification under A and of the Sales Tax Act superseding the earlier notification exempting the payment of sales tax and imposing sales tax on the turnover in respect of country spirit at the rate of per rupee The respondents having failed to lift and sell the minimum quotas of liquor the appellant called upon them to pay by way of compensation the amount of excise duty on the shortfalls The respondents in special appeals also challenged the notification issued under the sales Tax Act on the ground that <ORG> did not announce at the time of the action that the earlier notification was likely to be withdrawn and that the appellant informed the respondents at the time of the auction that there was no sales tax on the sale of country liquor The appellants were therefore estopped from making the demand in respect of the sales tax and recovering the same from them The facts leading to these appeals are The State of Uttar Pradesh has under the Excise Act Act No IV of herein after referred to as the Act which contains provisions relating to all aspects and manifestations of intoxicating liquors and intoxicating drugs that is to say their import export transport manufacture sale and possession the exclusive right or privilege of manufacturing and selling liquor in that State Sections and of the Act empower the State <ORG> and the Excise Commissioner subject to the previous sanction of the <ORG> to make rules for the purposes set out therein On the day following the commencement of the aforesaid licences i on April <ORG> issued Notification No ST under section A and of the sales Tas Act superseding the earlier Notification No ST dated April issued under section of the Sales Tax Act and imposing sales tax on the turnover in respect of the country spirit at the rate of ten paise per rupee at the point of retail sale with immediate effect liquor were likely to be subjected to the levy of sales tax during the excise year and in reply to the query made by them at the time of the auction they were told by the authorities that there was no sales tax of the sale of country liquor the appellants herein were estopped from making the demand in respect of sales tax and recovering the same from them The common question of law that arises for determination in all these appeals is whether the condition incorporated in the licences of the respondents that they would lift the fixed minimum quantity of liquor and sell the same at their allotted shops and in case of their default or failure to so they would be liable to pay compensation equal to the amount of excise duty leviable on the unlifted quantity is valid and enforceable Thus the aforesaid question arising for determination by us stands already settled by the ratio of the decision of this Court in <NAME> case supra It will also be noticed that neither section nor section nor any other provision of the Act authorises the levy of the amounts sought to be recovered from the respondents We have therefore not the lightest hesitation in holding that the demand made by the appellants though disguised as compensation is in reality a demand for excise duty on the unlifted quantity of liquor which is not authorised by the provisions of the Act Therefore as a general rule the doctrine of estoppel will not be applied against the <ORG> in its governmental public or sovereign capacity Approving the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> where the observations of Lord <NAME> in <NAME> Minister of Pensions that the action of the War office which was an agent of the <ORG> in assuming authority over the matter and assuring the appellant who had been serving on the army that his disability had been accepted as attributable to military service bound the <ORG> and through the <ORG> the Minister of Pensions who while administering the Royal warrant issued by the <ORG> has to honour all assurances given by or on behalf of the <ORG> were unequivocally disapproved by observing that the character or an act done by an officer of a Government however high or low in the hierarchy in face of a statutory prohibition is not affected by the fact that it had been induced by a misleading assumption of authority and neither a Minister The courts will only bind the Government by its promises to prevent manifest injustice or fraud and will not make the Government a slave of its policy for all times to come when We may as well refer here to the celebrated decision Of <ORG> of the United States in <ORG> <NAME> In that case where the agents of the petitioner a wholly <ORG> owned <ORG> created by the Federal Crop Insurance Act to insure producers of wheat against loss in yields due to unavoidable causes including drought advised the respondents in ignorance of and contrary to the duly promulgated controlling regulation which expressly precluded insurance coverage of spring wheat re seeded on winter wheat acreage that their entire acres spring wheat crop including the spring wheat which had been reseated on winter wheat acreage in the crop year was insurable by the <ORG> and recommended to the <ORG> ranch office acceptance of the respondents formal application which however did not disclose that any part of the insured Crop was reseeded and the <ORG> accepted the application and a few months later most of the respondents crop was destroyed by drought and the <ORG> on the loss being notified to them refused to pay the loss on the ground that the wheat crop insurance regulations expressly prohibited the insurance of spring wheat which was re seeded on winter wheat acreage the <ORG> by majority held that though a private insurance <ORG> would be bound on similar facts The following observations made by the court in <ORG> <NAME> supra are worth quoting It is too late in the day to urge that the Government is just another private litigant for purposes of charging it with liability whenever it takes over a business therefore conducted by private enterprise or engages in competition with private ventures Whatever the form in which the Government functions anyone entering into an arrangement with the Government takes the risk of having accurately ascertained that he who purports to act for the Government stays within the bounds of his authority And this is so even though as here the agent himself may have been unaware of the limitations upon his authority Men must turn square corners when they deal with the Government does not reflect a callous outlook It merely expresses the duty of all courts to observe the conditions defined by <ORG> for charging the public treasury Accordingly Appeals Nos to of are partly allowed and it is held that the demand made by the appellants from the respondents in these appeals in respect of sales tax on the turnover of sales of country spirit made by them between April and March was valid and could not be struck down
