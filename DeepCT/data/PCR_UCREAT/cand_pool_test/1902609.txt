Since the claim required examination by the Income tax Officer the <ORG> remanded the matter to the Income tax Officer to find out whether the impugned amount was or was not statutorily payable before the end of the accounting year on March and to allow the relief accordingly On these facts the following question has been referred to this court Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> is justified in law in directing the Income tax Officer not to make addition of Rs We record our appreciation of such assistance By the Finance Act Section of the Income tax Act was inserted and the provisions came into force with effect from April The relevant provision as it stood before the amendment is extracted below For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that where a deduction in respect of any sum referred to in Clause a or Clause of this section is allowed in computing the income referred to in Section of the previous year being a previous year relevant to the assessment year commencing on the st day of April or any earlier assessment year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred by the assessee the assessee shall not be entitled to any deduction under this section in respect of such sum in computing the income of the previous year in which the sum is actually paid by him In the Budget Speech of the Finance Minister had stated as follows at of ITR St Several cases have come to notice where taxpayers do not discharge their statutory liability such as in respect of excise duty employer contribution to provident fund Employees State Insurance Scheme etc For the purpose of their income tax assessments they none the less claim the liability as deduction even as they take resort to legal action thus depriving the <ORG> of its dues while enjoying the benefit of non payment There are cases where taxpayers do not discharge their statutory liability such as in respect of excise duty employer contribution to provident fund Employees State Insurance Scheme etc For the purpose of their income tax assessments they claim the liability as deduction on the ground that they maintain accounts on mercantile or accrual basis To curb this practice the Finance Act inserted Section to provide that the deduction for any sum payable by the assessee by way of tax or duty under any law for the time being in force irrespective of whether such tax or duty is disputed or not or any sum payable by the assessee as an employer by way of contribution to any provident fund or superannuation fund or gratuity fund or any other fund for the welfare of employees shall irrespective of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred be allowed only in computing the income of that previous year in which such sum is actually paid by him for the assessment year or any earlier year in which the liability to pay was incurred cannot in respect of that liability be allowed as deduction in the assessment year or any subsequent year on the ground that he has actually made a payment towards such liability in that year Section was intended to apply to cases where the statutory liability remained undischarged though the assessee in such a case was entitled to claim deduction on the ground that he maintains his accounts on mercantile or accrual basis But the question still remains as to whether the provision in Section is applicable to a case where the statutory liability has been discharged by the assessee within the period prescribed under the law even though such payment is made after the close of the relevant previous year In other words the question is whether tax or duty if paid by the assessee in terms of the statute imposing obligation to pay such tax or duty even though such payment is made in the next succeeding previous year the assessee is entitled to deduction of such liability for the assessment year relevant to the previous year in which such liability was incurred The provisions of the sales tax law of the <ORG> will apply mutatis mutandis in relation to filing of returns and provisional assessment advance payment of tax etc We may therefore consider the provisions of the Bengal Finance Sales Tax Act Section sub section of the said Act states that every dealer to whom sub section does not apply with which we are not concerned in this case shall if his gross turnover calculated from the commencement of any year exceeds the taxable quantum at any time within such year be liable to pay tax under the Act on the expiry of two months from the date on which such gross turnover first exceeds the taxable quantum on all sales effected after such expiry Rule of the Bengal Sales Tax Rules provides that every registered dealer other than those referred to in rule shall furnish returns quarterly within days from the expiry of each quarter Rule of the said Rules provides that every dealer for whom quarterly returns have been prescribed shall pay the tax and surcharge due and additional surcharge if any due for any quarter before furnishing the return for that quarter Along with the return he has also to pay the tax due on the basis of such return Therefore if the period of quarterly return ends on st March of a year a dealer will as a matter of course get days time from the expiry of that date to make payment of the tax due and submit the return along with the receipt showing the payment of such tax computed in accordance with the return If the construction which is suggested by the <ORG> is accepted in that event although the assessee has incurred the liability and th time to make payment of such liability has not yet expired the assessee will be disentitled to the benefit of deduction although he discharges the liability within the time allowed by the relevant statute Our attention has been drawn to the amendments which have been made in Section which according to the <ORG> would show that the intention of the <ORG> was not to permit any deduction of any liability incurred during the previous year unless such liability is discharged within the relevant previous year The Finance Act has introduced the following provisos Provided that nothing contained in this section shall apply in relation to any sum referred to in Clause a which is actually paid by the assessee on or before the due date applicable in his case for furnishing the return of income under Sub section of Section in respect of the previous year in which the liability to pay such sum was incurred as aforesaid and the evidence of such payment is furnished by the assessee along with such return Provided further that no deduction shall in respect of any sum referred to in Clause be allowed unless such sum has actually been paid during the previous year on or before the due date as defined in the Explanation below Clause va of Sub section of Section The Memorandum explaining the provisions in the Finance Bill clarified the object of insertion of the first proviso see ITR St Under the existing provisions of Section of the Income tax Act a deduction for any sum payable by way of tax duty cess or fee etc The original Section as it stood on April could not be literally applied to a case where the last day of the last quarter under the sales tax statute coincides with the last day of the previous year If the Quarterly return period for the last quarter ends on March as is the case here a dealer could only pay the tax for the said quarter earliest on April which falls in the subsequent previous year the assessee shall be entitled to claim deduction if the same has been paid on or before the due date The question therefore is whether the object of the amendments made to Section would apply prospectively from the assessment year or from the assessment year The Memorandum explaining the provisions of the Finance Bill put forward the following reasons for insertion of the said Explanation see ITR St Certain courts have interpreted the provisions of Section in a manner which may negate the very operation of this section The interpretation given to these words is that the amount payable in a particular year should also be statutorily payable under the relevant statute in the same year Having regard to the intent and purport of the provisions of Section and the amendments made from time to time which we have already indicated this Explanation must be held to be only clarificatory in nature and will be effective retrospectively When the section as a whole is read the amendments by way of provisos and Explanations are considered when both textual and contextual interpretations are taken into account and a harmonious construction is made it would be evident that the intention was that the assessee who collects sales tax etc There is nothing mentioned in the proviso that it would be retpospec tive Against the very specific mention of the date of its operation it was difficult to say that it was intended to apply restrospec tively either by construction or by necessary implication There was no material to say that the proviso is declaratory In the present case having regard to the object of Section it must be held that the provisos and the Explanation have been added as and by way of interpretation clause The object as we have said is to suppress the mischief of getting deduction of liability without discharging such liability and not for the purpose of denying relief to an assessee who discharges the liability incurred The provisos and the Explanation added to Section supplied an omission and were intended to remove an impossibility of performance and therefore cannot be said to be prospective in operation In other words in our view upon a textual interpretation of the provisos and the Explanation it must be held that the benefit of deduction will be allowed so long as the assessee makes the payment of the tax which could not have been paid in the previous year even if the assessee intended to pay because of the statutory requirement governing such payment The <ORG> however shall direct the Assessing Officer to dispose of the matter in the light of the observations contained in this judgment after ascertaining the factual position Subject to the aforesaid we answer the question in this reference in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee
