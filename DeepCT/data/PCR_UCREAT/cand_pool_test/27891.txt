Section of the Act provided that the value of an article for the purposes of duty shall be a the wholesale cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality was sold or was capable of being sold at the time removal of the article chargeable with duty from the factory or any other premises of manufacture or production for delivery at the place of manufacture or production or where such price was not ascertainable the price at which an article of the like kind and quality was sold or was capable of being sold at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from such factory or other premises for delivery at the place of manufacture or production provided that the value of an article for the purposes of duty shall subject to the other provisions of this section be deemed to be the normal price thereof that is to say the price at which such goods were ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer was not a related person and the price was the sole consideration for the sale and where the normal price of such goods was not ascertainable for the reason that such goods were not sold or for any other reason the nearest ascertainable equivalent thereof determined in such manner as may be prescribed The Central issue which arose between the <ORG> and the assessees in these appeals was whether the value of an article for the purposes of the excise levy must be determined by reference exclusively to the manufacturing cost and the manufacturing profit of the manufacturer as contended by the assessees or should be represented by the entire wholesale price charged by the manufacturer which consisted of not merely his manufacturing cost and his manufacturing profit but included post manufacturing expenses and post manufacturing profit arising between the completion of the manufacturing process and the point of sale by the manufacturer The other points of dispute were principally in respect of the connotation of the expression related person in the new as well as the nature of the deductions which could be claimed by the assessee as post manufacturing expenses and post manufacturing profit from the price for the purpose of determining the value While the levy in this country has the status of a constitutional concept the point of collection is located where the statute declares it will be It is true that the standard adopted as the measure of the levy may indicate the nature of the tax but it does not necessarily determine it When enacting a measure to serve as a standard for assessing the levy the legislature need not contour it along lines which spell out the character of the levy itself A broader based standard of reference may be adopted for the purpose of determining the measure of the levy Any standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the levy Where however the excisable article is not sold by the assessee in wholesale trade but for example is consumed by the assessee in his own industry the case is one where under the old a the value must be determined as the price at which the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is capable of being sold in wholesale trade at the time and place of removal A Where the wholesale price of the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is not ascertainable then pursuant to the old the value of the excisable article shall be the price at which the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold by the assessee at the time and place of removal or if the excisable article is not sold or is not capable of being sold at such place then the price at which it is sold or is capable of being sold by the assessee at any other place nearest thereto In every case the fundamental criterion for computing the value of an excisable article is the price at which the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold by the manufacturer and it is not the bare manufacturing cost and manufacturing profit which constitutes the basis for determining such value A The argument that the assessment on the manufacturer by reference to the sale price charged by his distributor is wholly incompatible with the nature of excise has no force The Explanation to provides that the expression relative has the same meaning as in the Companies Act Here again regard must be had to the Explanation which provides that the expression holding company and subsidiary have the same meanings as in the Companies Act The true position under the Central Excises and Salt Act as amended by Act XXII of is as follows i The price at which the excisable goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal as defined in subsection of section is the basis for determination of excisable value provided of course the buyer is not a related person within the meaning of sub section of section and the price is the sole consideration for the sale For the purpose of determining the value broadly speaking both old a and the new a speak of the price for sale in the course of wholesale trade of an article for delivery at the time and place of removal namely the factory gate Consequently where the sale is effected at the factory gate expenses incurred by the assessee upto the date of delivery on account of storage charges outward handling charges interest on inventories stocks carried by the manufacturer after clearance charges for other services after delivery to the buyer namely after sales service and marketing and selling organisation expenses including advertisement expenses marketing and selling organisation expenses and after sales service promote the marketability of the article and enter into its value in the trade Where the sale in the course of wholesale trade is effected by the assessee through its sales organisation at a place or places outside the factory gate the expenses incurred by the assessee upto the date of delivery under the aforesaid heads cannot on the same grounds be deducted The assessee will be entitled to a deduction on account of the cost of transportation of the exciseable article from the factory gate to the place or places where it is sold The cost of transportation will include the cost of insurance on the freight for transportation of the goods from the factory gate to the place or places of delivery If seems to us that the degree of secondary packing which is necessary for putting the excisable article in the condition in which it is generally sold in the wholesale market at the factory gate is the degree of packing whose cost can be included in the value of the article for the purpose of the excise levy <NAME> On May we made an order setting forth the legal position in respect of various aspects of the levy of excise duty under the Central Excises and Salt Act both before its amendment by the Central Excises and Salt Amendment Act Sub of provides that duties of excise shall be levied and collected on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India at the rates set forth in the First Schedule Where under this Act any article is chargeable with duty at a rate dependent on the value of the article such value shall be deemed to be a the wholesale cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from the factory or any other premises of manufacture or production for delivery at the place of manufacture or production or if a wholesale market does not exist for such article at such place at the nearest place where such market exists or where such price is not ascertainable the price at which an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold by the manufacturer or producer or his agent at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from such factory or other premises for delivery at the place of manufacture or production or if such article is not sold or is not capable of being sold at such place at any other place nearest thereto Where under this Act the duty of excise is chargeable on any excisable goods with reference to value such value shall subject to the other provisions of this section be deemed to be a the normal price thereof that is to say the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale Provided that i where in accordance with the normal practice of the wholesale trade in such goods such goods are sold by the assessee at different prices to different classes of buyers not being related persons each such price shall subject to the existence of the other circumstances specified in clause a be deemed to be the normal price of such goods in relation to each such class of buyers ii where such goods are sold by the assessee in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal at a price fixed under any law for the time being in force or at a price being the maximum fixed under any such law then notwithstanding anything contained in cl iii of this proviso the price or the maximum price as the case may be so fixed shall in relation to the goods so sold be deemed to be the normal price thereof iii where the assessee so arranges that the goods are generally not sold by him in the course of wholesale trade except to or through a related person the normal price of the goods sold by the assessee to or through such related person shall be deemed to be the price at which they are ordinarily sold by the related person in the course of wholesale trade at the time of removal to dealers not being related persons or where such goods are not sold to such dealers to dealers being related persons who sell such goods in retail where the normal price of such goods is not ascertainable for the reason that such goods are not sold or for any other reason the nearest ascertainable equivalent thereof determined in such manner as may be prescribed The provisions of this section shall not apply in respect of any excisable goods for which a tariff value has been fixed under sub section of Section a assessee means the person who is liable to pay the duty of excise under this Act and includes his agent place of removal means i a factory or any other place or premises of production or manufacture of the excisable goods or ii a warehouse or any other place or premises wherein the excisable goods have been permitted to be deposited without payment of duty from where such goods are removed related person means a person who is so associated with the assessee that they have interest directly or indirectly in the business of each other and includes a holding company a subsidiary company a relative and a distributor of the assessee and any sub distributor of such distributor contained or wound ii does not include the amount of the duty of excise sales tax and other taxes if any payable on such goods and subject to such rules as may be made the trade discount such discount not being refundable on any account whatsoever allowed in accordance with the normal practice of the wholesale trade at the time of removal in respect of such goods sold or contracted for sale wholesale trade means sales to dealers industrial consumers <ORG> local authorities and other buyers who or which purchase their requirements otherwise than in retail The points raised are not without difficulty but we have had the advantage of hearing counsel of eminence on both sides and we are grateful to them for the considerable assistance they have given us throughout the hearing of these cases It is said that the criterion adopted in clause a succeeds in producing uniform taxation whether the assessees are manufacturers who sell their goods in wholesale semi wholesale or in retail whether they have a vast selling and marketing net work or have none whether they sell at depots and branches or sell at the factory gate and whether they load the ex factory price with post manufacturing expenses and profits or do not do so It is conceded however that under the new a there is no attempt to preserve uniformity as regards the amount of duty between one manufacturer and another but it is urged that the basis on which the value is determined is constituted by the same conceptual criterion that post manufacturing expenses and post manufacturing profit must be excluded It is pointed out that factors such as volume quantity and weight which enter into the measure of the tax are intimately linked with the manufacturing activity and that the power of <ORG> under Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution to legislate in respect of value is restricted by the conceptual need to link the basis for determining the measure of the tax with the very nature of the tax <NAME> the learned Solicitor General of India when these cases were heard and now the Attorney General of India has strongly contended that the value of an excisable article for the purposes of the levy must be taken at the price charged by the manufacturer on a wholesale transaction the computation being made strictly in terms of the express provisions of the statute and he says there is no warrant for confining the value to the assessee manufacturing cost plus manufacturing profit According to him although excise is a levy on the manufacture of goods it is open to <ORG> to adopt any basis for determining the value of an excisable article that the measure for assessing the levy need not correspond completely to the nature of the levy and no fault can be found with the measure so long as it bears a nexus with the charge Besides this fundamental issue there are other points of dispute principally in respect of the connotation of the expression related person in the new as well as the nature of the deductions which can be claimed by the assessee as post manufacturing expenses and post manufacturing profit from the price for the purpose of determining the value The submissions made by learned counsel for the parties in support of their respective contentions cover a wide area and several questions of a fundamental nature have been raised Both Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act under which the original Central Excises and Salt Act was enacted and Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution under which the Amendment Act of was enacted refer to Duties of excise on goods manufactured or produced in India The ultimate incidence of an excise duty a typical indirect tax must always be on the consumer who pays as he consumes or expends and it continues to be an excise duty that is a duty on home produced or home manufactured goods no matter at what stage it is collected emphasis supplied <ORG> where <ORG> observed There is in theory nothing to prevent <ORG> from imposing a duty of excise on a commodity as soon as it comes into existence no matter what happens to it afterwards whether it be sold consumed destroyed or given away A taxing authority will not ordinarily impose such a duty because it is much more convenient administratively to collect the duty as in the case of most of the Indian Excise Acts when the commodity leaves the factory for the first time and also because the duty is intended to be an indirect duty which the manufacturer or producer is to pass on to the ultimate consumer which he could not do if the commodity had for example been destroyed in the factory itself It is the fact of manufacture which attracts the duty even though it may be collected later the Central Provinces and Berar Act No This <ORG> then summarised the law as follows Excise duty is primarily a duty on the production or manufacture of goods produced or manufactured within the country While the levy in our country has the status of a constitutional concept the point of collection is located where the statute declares it will be That it is a levy on excisable goods produced or manufactured in India is mentioned in terms in the section itself Section of the Act provides the measure by reference to which the charge is to be levied It was pointed out that although the same standard was adopted as a measure for the two levies the levies remained separate and distinct imposts by virtue of their nature It is true that the standard adopted as the measure of the levy may indicate the nature of the tax but it does not necessarily determine it where the relationship was succinctly described thus It may be and is often so that the tax on circumstances and property is levied on the basis of income which the assessee receives from his profession trade calling or property It is apparent therefore that when enacting a measure to serve as a standard for assessing the levy the <ORG> need not contour it along lines which spell out the character of the levy itself Viewed from this standpoint it is not possible to accept the contention that because the levy of excise is a levy on goods manufactured or produced the value of an excisable article must be limited to the manufacturing cost plus the manufacturing profit We are of opinion that a broader based standard of reference may be adopted for the purpose of determining the measure of the levy Any standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regarded as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the levy Under the old a the value of the excisable article was deemed to be the wholesale cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality was sold or was capable of being sold at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from the factory or any other premises of manufacture or production for delivery at the place of manufacture or production or if a wholesale market did not exist for such article at such place then delivery was envisaged at the nearest place where such market existed declared that where such price was not ascertainable the value would be deemed to be the price to be the price at which an article of the like kind and quality was sold or was capable of being sold by the manufacturer or producer or his agent at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from such factory or other premises for delivery at the place of manufacture or production and if such article was not sold or was not capable of being sold at such place at any other place nearest thereto Then there was an explanation which declared that no abatement or deduction would be allowed except in respect of trade discount and the duty payable at the time of the removal of the article from the factory We are concerned with and we find nothing there which clothes the provision with a dual character a charging provision as well as a provision defining the measure of the charge At this stage it would be advantageous to refer to certain decisions which have some bearing on the proper construction of cl a and cl of the old a and substantially comparable with the two clauses of the old of the Central Excises and Salt Act The Privy council observed that there was no other oil in Bombay which could be said to be of the like kind and quality as the oil imported by the appellants and therefore the relevant wholesale cash price for the appellants if there be such price was to be found in the actual sales of those oils in Bombay by the appellants themselves provided that such sales had taken place It was contended for the appellants that goods of the like kind and quality in cl a was a phrase which suggested other goods than that under assessment and therefore the price fetched by the goods themselves must be disregarded or should be considered only to see what price other similar goods would have realised And what is important <ORG> further observed But if there is an actual price for the goods themselves at the time and place of importation and if it is a wholesale cash price less trade discount the clause is not inapplicable for want of sales of other goods But the goods under assessment may under cl a be considered as members of their own class even although at the time and place of importation there are no other members These two cases illustrate the fundamental distinction between provisions such as the two clauses of of the Central Excises and Salt Act Great reliance has been placed by the assessees on two important decisions of this Court in support of the contention that only the manufacturing cost and the manufacturing profit can be taken into account for assessing the value of an excisable article If there was an actual price for the goods themselves at the time and place of sale and if that was a wholesale cash price the clause was not inapplicable for want of sale of other goods of a like kind and quality The section makes it clear that excise is levied only on the amount representing the manufacturing cost plus the manufacturing profit and excludes post manufacturing cost and the profit arising from post manufacturing operation namely selling profit What the <ORG> intended to say was that the entire cost of the article to the manufacturer which would include various items of expense composing the value of the article plus his profit on the manufactured article which would have to take into account the deduction of allowed as discount would constitute the real value had to be arrived at after off loading the discount of which in fact represented the wholesale dealer profit A careful reading of the judgment will show that there was no issue inviting the <ORG> decision on the point now raised in these cases by the assessees The question arose as to how the value of the dyestuffs manufactured by the appellants should be determined under The appellants contended that the value should be the price at which the appellants sold in wholesale to the two wholesale buyers less a uniform trade discount of It was explained The value of the goods for the purpose of excise must take into account only the manufacturing cost and the manufacturing profit and it must not be loaded with post manufacturing cost or profit arising from post manufacturing operation If the price charged by the whole sale dealer who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and sells them in wholesale to another dealer were taken as the value of the goods it would include not only the manufacturing cost and the manufacturing profit of the manufacturer but also the wholesale dealer selling cost and selling profit and that would be wholly incompatible with the nature of excise It may be noted that wholesale market in a particular type of goods may be in several tiers and the goods may reach the consumer after a series of wholesale transactions For instance in a textile trade a manufacturer may sell his entire production to a single wholesale dealer and the latter may in his turn sell the goods purchased by him from the manufacturer to different wholesale dealers at State level and they may in their turn sell the goods to wholesale dealers at the district level and from the wholesale dealers at the district level the goods may pass by sale to wholesale dealers at the city level and then ultimately from the wholesale dealers at the city level the goods may reach the consumers If excise were levied on the basis of second or subsequent wholesale price it would load the price with a post manufacturing element namely selling cost and selling profit of the wholesale dealer Secondly this would also violate the concept of the factory gate sale which is the basis of determination of value of the goods for the purpose of excise There can therefore be no doubt that where a manufacturer sells the goods manufactured by him in wholesale to a wholesale dealer at arms length and in the usual course of business the wholesale cash price charged by him to the wholesale dealer less trade discount would represent the value of the goods for the purpose of assessment of excise The price received by the wholesale dealer who purchases the goods from the manufacturer and in his turn sells the same in wholesale to other dealers would be irrelevant to the determination of the value and the goods would not be chargeable to excise on that basis When it refers to post manufacturing expenses and post manufacturing profit arising from post manufacturing operations it clearly intends to refer not to the expenses and profits pertaining to the sale transactions effected by the manufacturer but to those pertaining to the subsequent sale transactions effected by the wholesale buyers in favour of other dealers The problem presented itself again to <ORG> in <ORG> supra and while taking note of what it had said in the earlier case <ORG> laid down that where the excisable goods constituted a class of their own and it was not possible to say that other manufacturers produced goods of that kind and quality the goods under assessment could be considered as members of their own class for the purpose of a even although at the time and place of importation there were no other members The price obtained for them it was said would correctly represent the price obtainable for goods of the like kind and quality at the time and place of importation If there was an actual price for the goods themselves at the time and place of sale and if that was a wholesale cash price the clause was not inapplicable for want of sale of other goods of a like kind and quality It seems to us that the more practical way of looking at the problem is that there are very few cases indeed where two manufacturers produce an article of the like kind and quality An instance has been supplied by learned counsel for the assessees and we are referred to the case of a factory which manufactures identical electric bulbs for supply to a number of companies who sell them in the market under their own distinctive trade names There is the further consideration that the wholesale cash price charged by the assessee must be ascertained on the basis that the sale to the wholesale dealer is at arm length Where however the excisable article is not sold by the assessee in wholesale trade but for example is consumed by the assessee in his own industry the case is one where under the old a the value must be determined as the price at which the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is capable of being sold in wholesale trade at the time and place of removal Finally where the wholesale price of the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is not ascertainable then pursuant to the old the value of the excisable article shall be the price at which the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold by the assessee at the time and place of removal or if the excisable article is not sold or is not capable of being sold at such place then the price at which it is sold or is capable of being sold by the assessee at any other place nearest thereto In every case the fundamental criterion for computing the value of an excisable article is the price at which the excisable article or an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold by determining such value Clause a of the new speaks of the value being the normal price that is to say the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale Under the new the phrase place of removal was defined by not merely as the factory or any other place or premises of production or manufacture of the excisable goods from where such goods are removed but was extended to a warehouse or any place or premises wherein the excisable goods have been permitted to be deposited without payment of duty and from where such goods are removed The normal price mentioned in the new a is the price at which the goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee in the course of wholesale trade It may also be according to the second proviso to the new a the price fixed as the wholesale price under any law or the maximum price where the law fixes a maximum We have examined the principles of an excise levy and have considered the statutory construction of the Act before and after its amendment in view of the three propositions formulated on behalf of the assessees as principle constituting the essential characteristics of a duty of excise It is not necessarily involved at the stage of sale of the article by the manufacturer because we find for example that under the amended of the Central Excises and Salt Act different tariff values may be fixed not only a for different classes of descriptions of the same excisable goods but also for excisable goods of the same class or description i produced or manufactured by different classes of producers or manufacturers or ii sold to different classes of buyers Under cl iii where the goods are sold in the course of wholesale trade by the assessee to or through a related person the normal price shall be the price at which the goods are sold by the related person in the course of wholesale trade at the time of removal to dealers not being related persons or where such goods are not sold to such dealers to dealers being related persons who sell such goods in retail The verity of the three principles propounded by learned counsel for the assessees has been as indeed it had to be examined in the context of the Act before and after its amendment We have come to the conclusion after carefully weighing the matter that on a true construction of its provisions in the context of the statutory scheme the old a should be considered as applicable to the circumstances of the particular assessee himself and not of manufacturers generally Learned counsel for the assessees urged that the expression normal price in the new a means the price normal for the purposes of the excise duty and that it is said means the manufacturing cost plus the manufacturing profit It bas the following properties it must not be contrary to the principal clause it must neither increase nor diminish it but where the principal clause is general in terms it may restrict it and reference has been made to <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> It is the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale Learned counsel for the assessees contended that the new a also levies excise on the basis of a conceptual value which must exclude post manufacturing profit and in support of that submission he has adduced a number of reasons When that is so the fundamental basis on which the argument has been raised on behalf of the assessees cannot survive Clearly when the Court referred to the calculation of the duty according to the quantity or value of the goods it referred disjunctively to the nature of the levy and it is the nature of the levy not the value for assessing the levy which it had in mind when it pointed to the goods having been produced or manufactured and observed that the nature of the levy is not related to or dependent on any commercial transaction The following observation of <NAME> <NAME> in The Central Provinces and Berar Sales of Motor Spirit and Lubricants Taxation Act supra was also placed before us In my opinion the power to make laws with respect to duties of excise given by the Constitution Act to <ORG> is to be construed as a power to impose duties of excise upon the manufacturer or producer of the excisable articles or at least at the stage of or in connection with manufacture or production and extends no further He construed it as a power to impose the duty upon the manufacturer or producer and explained that the levy related to the manufacture or production and to no further stage It was the nature of the levy which was adverted to by the learned Chief Justice namely that it was a levy on goods manufactured or produced The new a provides that the value shall be deemed to be the normal price and the normal price is defined as the price at which the goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee in the course of wholesale trade where the buyer is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale The third proviso to the new a provides that where the assessee so arranges that the goods are generally not sold by him in the course of wholesale trade except to or through a related person the normal price of the goods sold by the assessee to or through such related person shall be deemed to be the price at which they are ordinarily sold by the related person in the course of wholesale trade at the time of removal to dealers not being related persons or where such goods are not sold to such dealers to dealers being related persons who sell such goods in retail The new defines the expression related person as follows related person means a person who is so associated with the assessee that they have interest directly or indirectly in the business of each other and includes a holding company a subsidiary company a relative and a distributor of the assessee and any sub distributor of such distributor Learned counsel for the assessees contends that the provisions regarding related persons are wholly unnecessary because to counter act evasion or avoidance any artificially arranged price between the manufacturer and his wholesale buyer can be rejected in any case under and we are referred to the observations of this Court in <ORG> supra and <ORG> supra It is urged on behalf of the assessee that the provisions are whimsical and arbitrary and cannot be said to be reasonably calculated to deal with the issue of evasion or avoidance of excise It is contended for the assessees that the definition of the expression related person is so arbitrary that it includes within that expression a distributor of the assessee It is urged that the provision falls outside the ambit of Entry of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution inasmuch as it is wholly inconsistent with the levy of excise and if it is attempted to seek support for the provision from the residuary Entry of List as a non descript tax the attempt must fail because there is no charging section in the Central Excises and Salt Act empowering the levy of such non descript tax nor any machinery provision in the Act for collection such a tax The validity of the provisions is assailed also on the ground that it violates Articles and of the Constitution But it seems to us unnecessary to enter into that question because we are satisfied that the provision in the definition of related person relating to a distributor can be legitimately read down and its validity thus upheld It will be noticed that the Explanation provides that the expression relative has the same meaning as in the Companies Act As regards the other provisions of the definition of related person that is to say a person who is so associated with the assessee that they have interest directly or indirectly in the business of each other and includes a holding company a subsidiary company Here again regard must be had to the Explanation which provides that the expression holding company and subsidiary have the same meanings as in the Companies Act i The price at which the excisable goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal as defined in sub section of section is the basis for determination of excisable value provided of course the buyer is not a related person within the meaning of sub section of section and the price is the sole consideration for the sale We now proceed to the question whether any post manufacturing expenses are deductible from the price when determining the value of the excisable article The new also contains sub ii which declares that the expression value in relation to any excisable goods does not include the amount of the duty of excise sales tax and other taxes if any payable on such goods and subject to such rules as may be made the trade discount such discount not being refundable on any account whatsoever allowed in accordance with the normal practice of the wholesale trade at the time of removal in respect of such goods sold or contracted for sale It is apparent that for the purpose of determining the value broadly speaking both the old a and the now a speak of the price for sale in the course of wholesale trade of an article for delivery at the time and place of removal namely the factory gate where the price contemplated under the old a or under the new a is not ascertainable the price is determined under the old or the new Consequently where the sale is effected at the factory gate expenses incurred by the assessee up to the date of delivery on account of storage charges outward handling charges interest on inventories stocks carried by the manufacturer after clearance charges for other services after delivery to the buyer namely after sales service and marketing and selling organisation expenses including advertisement expenses cannot be deducted Where the sale in the course of wholesale trade is effected by the assessee through its sales organisation at a place or places outside the factory gate the expenses incurred by the assessee upto the date of delivery under the aforesaid heads cannot on the same grounds be deducted But the assessee will be entitled to a deduction on account of the cost of transportation of the excisable article from the factory gate to the place or places where it is sold The cost of transportation will include the cost of insurance on the freight for transportation of the goods from the factory gate to the place or places of delivery We shall proceed on the basis that the position in regard to the cost of packing is the same under the Act both before and after the amendment of the Act i reads For the purposes of this section value in relation to any excisable goods i where the goods are delivered at the time of removal in a packed condition includes the cost of such packing except the cost of the packing which is of a durable nature and is returnable by the buyer to the assessee It seems to us that the degree of secondary packing which is necessary for putting the excisable article in the condition in which it is generally sold in the wholesale market it the factory gate is the degree of packing whose cost can be included in the value of the article for the purpose of the excise levy Learned counsel for the parties have drawn our attention to a number of decisions rendered by different <ORG> on some of the points raised before us
