As the report in the present case was made by a police officer it could not be taken cognizance of under cls ii A report under I is not a charge sheet but a report made under satisfies the provisions of I I as the police officer who makes it is also a public servant The appellant then raised two preliminary objections the first was that as the commodity was obtained and disposed of at Bombay <ORG> had no jurisdiction to try him In so far as the trial of the alleged offence under <ORG> is concerned there is no objection to its trial under A Code of Criminal Procedure That provision is made for the procedure to be adopted in cases instituted on a police report If he comes to the conclusion that the charge is groundless he must discharge him On the other hand if he is of the opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence triable under this Chapter which he is competent to try and which in his opinion could be adequately punished by him he must frame a charge in writing against the accused and after explaining it to him record his plea and proceed according to it Under Criminal Procedure Code it is provided as follows In any case instituted otherwise than on a police report when the accused appears or is brought before a Magistrate such Magistrate shall proceed to hear the complainant if any and take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution Provided that the Magistrate shall not be bound to hear any person as complainant in any case in which the complaint The Magistrate shall ascertain from the complaint or otherwise the names of any persons likely to be acquainted with the facts of the case and to be able to give evidence for the Under Criminal Procedure Code if upon taking all the evidence referred to in the section just quoted and making such examination if any of the accused as the Magistrate thinks necessary he finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction the Magistrate can discharge him On the other hand if it appears to the Magistrate that there are grounds for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which the Magistrate is competent to try and which in his opinion could be adequately punished by him he frames a charge against him and records a plea If the accused does not plead guilty the Magistrate gives him time to state which of the prosecution witnesses be wishes to cross examine if any and if he says that he does so the witnesses are recalled and are allowed to be cross examined It is pointed out that under cognizance of an offence is taken in different ways a upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute an offence upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer and upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon the Magistrate own knowledge or suspicion that such offence has been committed The appellant submits that either the two charges should be split up or the two offences should be tried under the procedure laid down by of the Code of Criminal Procedure as the procedure under A Criminal Procedure Code does not afford the accused the chance of a second crossexamination which of the Code gives and there is prejudice to him in the trial of the offence under of the Essential Commodities Act In our judgment the meaning which is sought to be given to a police report is not correct In a distinction is made between the classes of persons who can start a criminal prosecution Under the three clauses of to which we have already referred criminal prosecution can be initiated i by a police officer by a report in writing ii upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon the Magistrate own knowledge or suspicion and iii upon receiving a complaint of facts We are thus concerned to find out whether the report of the police officer in writing in this case can be described as a complaint of facts or as information received from any person other than a police officer The term complaint in this connection has been defined by the Code of Criminal Procedure and it means the allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action under this Code that some person whether known or unknown has committed an offence but it does not include the report of a police officer It therefore follows that Criminal Procedure Code can only apply to those cases which are instituted otherwise than on a police report that is to say upon complaints which are not reports of a police officer or upon information received from persons other than a police officer No Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under this Act except on a report in writing of the facts constituting such offence made by a person who is a public servant as defined in section of the Indian Penal Code The police officer was investigating under of the Code of Criminal Proce dure an offence under Indian Penal Code which was based on the same facts as the offence under of the Essential Commodities Act Where the information discloses a cognizable as well as a non cognizable offence the police officer is not debarred from investigating any non cogniz able offence which may arise out of the same facts case to which we have last referred there was a provision in the Opium Act as amended in Bengal which provided that a report in writing by an officer of the <ORG> <ORG> or <ORG> shall be enquired into and tried as if such report was a report in writing made by police officer under cl of of the Code of Criminal Procedure We dismiss the appeal
