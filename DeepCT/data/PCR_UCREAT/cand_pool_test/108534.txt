This is a judgment debtors appeal against an order of the learned Additional District Judge of Moradabad dated th August allowing an appeal of the decree holder respondent against the order of the <ORG> dismissing an application for preparation of a final decree The suit was decreed in terms of a compromise according to which the decretal amount was made payable in twelve half yearly instalments In that ruling it was held that there was nothing in Article limitation Act which indicated that the decree holder right to apply for a final decree accrued only once rather a new cause of action accrued upon every fresh default and not only once on the occurrence of the first default The lower appellate Court therefore ordered that the decree holder was to have a final decree prepared in respect of the last five instalments which fell due within three years of the making of the application and remanded the case to <ORG> for the preparation of a final decree The decree holder has submitted to this order but the judgment debtors have come up in appeal to this Court It has been contended before us by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the judgment debtors appellants that the cause of action for preparation of the final decree accrued only once and that was on the first default in the payment of two consecutive instalments that is to say on and that therefore the application was time barred under Article Limitation Act But before we do so it will be well if we take note of similar provisions under different Articles of the Limitation Act Article On a promissory note or bond payable by instalments years When a default is made unless where the payee or obligee waives the benefit of the provision and then when fresh default is made in respect of which there is no such waiver Where the application is to enforce any payment which the decree or order directs to be made at a certain date such date The contention of the defendants in that case was that Clause providing a period of years applied and that the cause of action arose on the date when the property was sold in execution of the decree Sir <NAME> delivering the judgment of <ORG> held that Clause applied and the suit was within time but he also made observations to the following effect Their Lordships must not be supposed in coming to this decision to give any countenance to the argument of Mr <NAME> that this suit would have been barred if the limitation of years under Clause tad been applicable to it There was a default clause to the following effect If we fail to pay the interest aforesaid in any month on the principal by the end of the stipulated period as specified above or no payment is made in a year the mortgagee shall under all these circumstances be at liberty to realise the entire amount with the interest aforesaid in a lump sum through <ORG> by means of a suit from the mortgaged and other moveable and immoveable property and the persons of us the executants He thought that the clause in question was clearly inserted for the benefit of the creditor and that it was at his option to treat the money as being immediately due or not Sir <NAME> Hears and Sen had a case in which the facts were these A mortgage bond executed on was payable in three years I to which we shall refer presently there is no difference in principle between the principal money becoming due immediately upon the default by the mortgagor in payment of interest or of an instalment and it becoming due upon the breach of any other condition to which a similar provision is attached there was a default in payment of interest the default clause giving the mortgagees right without waiting for the expiry of the stipulated period to enforce the security <ORG> held that under a clause in the above form a single default on part of the mortgagors without any act of election cancellation or other form of response or acceptance on the part of the mortgagees and even it would appear against their desire operates eo instanti to make the money secured by the mortgage become due so that all right of action in respect of the security is finally barred twelve years later that is in the present case on there was a decree which provided that the husband would pay Rs There was default in payment on several occasions More than three years after the first default the decree holder applied on the basis of a fresh default for recovery of the amount then due and also for recovery of possession over the disputed property that to the application for delivery of possession over the property Article was the only article that was applicable and their Lordships of <ORG> must have had that article in their minds when they decided that case In that case there was a decree based on a compromise by which the decretal amount was made payable by instalments There was default in the payment of several instalments The decree holder filed an application for execution more than three years after the first default The matter came up before <ORG> which referred five questions for decision by <ORG> concurred with <NAME> in holding that If the application for execution is one for the remaining unpaid balance of the decretal amount under the default clause it is not governed by Article at all but by Article and limitation will run from the date of the last of any two successive defaults the decree holder being entitled for an order for whole balance due less the amount of any individual instalments which regarded as individual instalments are already barred by limitation and that in cases of this description it is undesirable to interpret the application too strictly and that the Court may well pay regard to the substance of the application In our opinion this case lays down the following propositions Where there is a default clause the decree holder has a right to apply for recovery of the whole amount upon the happening of any default That even where the default clause has come into operation by default in payment the individual instalments as and when they fall due do not become extinct and the provision with regard to their payment remains intact and may be enforced and That it is immaterial that the default clause is worded as expressly giving an option to the decree holder to apply for the recovery of the whole amount on the happening of a default or whether it pro vides that on the happening of a default the whole amount shall become due or payable The matter which was left undecided in <NAME> case Ind In that case the mortgage deed provided that the principal sum would be paid within six years and the stipulated interest every year and further that in case of default in punctual payment of interest the mortgagee shall within the expiry of the stipulated period of six years have power to realise the entire mortgage money and the remaining interest and compound interest due to him in a lump sum through <ORG> by sale of the mortgaged property There was default in payment of interest but the mortgagee did not avail himself of the option given to him Sir <NAME> delivering the judgment of the Board observed as follows There can be no doubt as pointed out by Lord <NAME> a proviso of this nature is inserted in a mortgage deed exclusively or the benefit of the mortgagees and that it purports to give them an option either to enforce their security at once or if the security is ample to stand by their investment for the full term of the mortgage They are not prepared to hold that the mortgagor could in this way take advantage of his own default they do not think that upon such default he would have the right to redeem and in their opinion the mortgage money does not become due within the meaning of Art Limitation Act until both the mortgagor right to redeem and the mortgagee right to enforce his security have accrued This would of course also be the position if the mortgagee exercised the option reserved to him The clause there under consideration differed widely from that now before their Lordships and indeed from the clauses with which <ORG> had to deal the question for decision would have fallen in India not under Article but under Article which is in very special terms and Section of the statute of James with which the <ORG> was concerned made the time to run not from the date when the money became due If in the Indian eases the question were when did the mortgagee cause of action arise i when did he first become entitled to sue for the relief claimed by his suit their Lordships think that there might be much to be said in support of the Allahabad decisions Judged by the Indian criterion when the money sued for became due upon the best consideration their Lordships have been able to give to this difficult question they think that the decision of the Chief <ORG> of Oudh was wrong and that they should have held that the appellant suit was within time It will be observed that the reasoning upon which the decision was based was that where a default clause is inserted in a bond exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagee and gives him an option to either enforce the security at once or if the security is ample to stand by his investment for the Full term of the mortgage the mortgagee is not bound to sue at once upon the happenning of the default but may wait and sue when the time fixed for the payment expires It is true that while distinguishing the case of <NAME> <NAME> supra their Lordships have observed that If in the Indian cases the question were did the mortgagee cause of action arise i when did he first become entitled to sue for the relief claimed by his suit their Lordships think that there might be much to be said in support of the Allahabad decisions we do not think that when their Lordships themselves did not decide the question finally the <ORG> in India should feel bound by observations of that nature <ORG> of this Court had to consider Article read with Article There was a mortgage which provided that the principal sum would be paid in eight years and the stipulated interest every month and further that if the interest for one full year remained unpaid the mortgagee shall be at liberty to recover the principal and interest without waiting for the expiry of the stipulated period No interest was paid and there was default at the expiry of one year but the mortgagee did not avail himself of the option given to him It was contended that since in Article time began to run from the date when the money became payable limitation would begin to run when the money first became payable by the mortgagor that is <NAME> observed I take the pronouncement of their Lordships to mean that a clause of this nature is exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagee and gives him a perfect option or liberty to sue for his money or to stand by his investment for the full term of the mortgage and so long as the mortgagee does not by means of any act of election cancellation or other form of response or acceptance make the money become due time does not begin to run against him King <NAME> agreed with him His Lordship observed that their Lordships of <ORG> in <NAME> case laid stress upon the point that the provision enabling the mortgagees to sue before the expiry of the stipulated period is inserted exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagees giving them an option either to enforce their security at once or to stand by their investment for the full term I take this to mean that the mortgagee has an option of treating the money as having become due by demanding or suing for it and it does not become due unless he exercises his option even though the mortgagor may already have a right to redeem in accordance with the terms of the mortgage contract If we hold that time begins to run for a suit to enforce the mortgage from the date of the first default that gives an optional cause of action then it could not be said that the provision is inserted exclusively for the mortgagee benefit He would have to sue within twelve years from the date of the first default although he might prefer to stand by his investment for the full term and then sue within twelve years from the expiry of that term He might indeed be compelled to sue before the expiry of the full term if the term were years or more In my view therefore the question whether the mortgagor has a right to redeem before the expiry of the stipulated period is immaterial Time does not begin to run against the mortgagee before the expiry of that period unless he avails himself of the option inserted exclusively for his benefit <NAME> also held to the same effect These two grounds were money does not become due unless mortgagor is at liberty to pay and the mortgagee is at liberty to sue and the mortgagee having an option to claim immediate payment avails himself of the option by claiming it before the expiry of the term His Lordship further considered the sentence relating to the accrual of the cause of action in <NAME> <NAME> case beginning If in the Indian cases the question were and observed that it did not affect the decision even though the language of the statute was when the money be came payable and not when the money became due I was that whenever a default clause is intended exclusively for the benefit of the mortgagee the mortgagor cannot take advantage of his own default in payment and the mortgagee can stand by his investment for the full term and his right to realise the amount will not be affected by his inaction This case further lays down that there is no particular difference between the words becoming due and money becoming payable and that the sentence in the judgment in <NAME> case beginning If in the Indian case Now there is no essential difference between the phrase the amount becomes payable and the right to sue or to apply accrues The considerations that weighed with their Lordships in the above <ORG> case to our minds equally apply to the present case however there was a compromise decree fixing payments of certain instalments on specified dates <NAME> and <NAME> held that the decree holder right to receive the instalments as and when they fell due was not barred but that his right to enforce the payment of all the instalments that might remain unpaid in the event of two successive instalments remaining unpaid was time barred It was held that the language of the Article was quite different from that of Article or Article <NAME> and <NAME> observed that unless there was waiver the Article became applicable on the first default There was a preliminary mortgage decree directing payment by instalments and farther that on default in payment of three instalments the decree holder was entitled to apply for a final decree This leads us to a consideration of the last case in this series They distinguished the case in <NAME> <NAME> A I Oudh on the ground that in that case the preliminary decree conferred an option on the decree holder to obtain a final decree on default of any one instalment when the entire amount unpaid became payable and observed that if there was anything in the judgment of <ORG> which may be said to be in conflict with the view that the expression when the right to apply accrues meant when the right to apply first accrues they would dissent from that decision Their Lordships emphasised that in the case before them there was no option contained in the decree and it was for that reason that they held that the application for a final decree was time barred Thus it would seem that although their Lordships emphasised the fact that under Article when the right to apply accrues mean when the right to apply first accrues their Lordships were of the opinion that where there was an option in the decree holder to take advantage of the default clause or not to take advantage of it he could stand by his investment for the full term but where there was no option for the decree holder he could not wait and limitation would start to run from the first default It appears to us therefore that the decisions of this <ORG> cannot be reconciled and in our opinion the case should be referred to a larger Bench in order that a final and authoritative decision may be given on the following questions Whether in such a case the right to apply for a final decree in respect of the instalments not barred by limitation as individual instalments remains intact in spite of the omissions to take advantage of the default clause Whether the answers to the above two questions would be affected if the default clause instead of being worded as the decree holder shall have a right to apply or the decree holder shall have the option to apply is worded as the entire decretal amount shall become payable or the entire decretal amount shall become due or the judgment debtor shall pay the entire decretal amount even though in all these cases the default clause be intended for the benefit of the decree holder We therefore order that the case may be laid before the Hon ble the Acting Chief Justice for the constitution of a Full Bench for a decision of the above questions The following questions have been referred to us for decision by a Bench of the Court After stating the questions referred his Lordship continued On a decree was passed in favour of the creditor respondent The amount found due was made payable in sis monthly instalments An objection was taken to the preparation of the final decree by the judgment debtors on the ground that the application was time barred because on failure of payment of two instalments a right to apply for the preparation of final decree had accrued to the decree holder on <ORG> held that the application for the preparation of a final decree was time barred but as in its opinion the decree was a final decree and no application for preparation of a final decree was necessary it held that the decree holder may apply for execution It however allowed the appeal in part against the order dismissing the application for preparation of a final decree But where there are different causes of action or where after the accrual of one cause of action another cause of action arises by reason of a change in the circumstances the right to apply can be said to arise upon the accrual of each of the causes of action Let us take a case in which the decree is for the payment of a certain amount by instalments with a condition that if a certain number of instalments say two are not paid in time the whole amount will become payable forthwith But when the whole of the amount has fallen due can the decree holder apply for the instalments alone ignoring the fact that the whole amount has fallen due by reason of the breach of the condition To my mind the answer must depend upon whether the condition gives an option to the decree holder or not If he has no option at all then the provision for payment by instalments ceases to exist and no longer is there any right in the decree holder to apply in respect of the instalments and he must apply for the enforcement of the condition alone But if the decree holder has an option to enforce the condition or not to enforce it there is no reason why he should not be able to waive the condition and enforce payment of the instalments as and when they fall due Again if there is no option with the decree holder to waive or condone the default made in payment of the instalments so that the condition comes into operation in spite of his desire to the contrary there can be only one cause of action for applying on the basis of the condition and he cannot waive one default and apply on the basis of a second or subsequent default But when the condition gives an option to the decree holder whether to enforce it or not to enforce it and entitles him to waive or condone the default the question is whether even in such a case the decree holder is bound to apply for the recovery of the whole amount due under the condition on the very first default or he can waive the default and apply on the basis of a subsequent default Of course in such a case he cannot claim to recover instalments already barred by time To hold that he is bound be apply on the very first default is to hold that he has no option which would be to deny the very hypothesis upon which the question is posed It is said that the right to apply must mean the first right to apply and that therefore even though there is an option in the decree holder to enforce the default clause or not to enforce it still he must apply upon the very first default It seems to me that if the decree holder has a right to waive or condone the default he can avail of the second default and then apply because his right to apply upon each subsequent default when the previous defaults have been waived is based upon a different cause of action The first cause of action arose when there was default in the payment of the first two instalments is a principle which is applicable not only to a case falling under Article but to all cases wherever there is an option given to a creditor or decree holder to waive a default because it is based on equity and justice Adopting the observations of their Lordships to the case in hand it may be said that the condition being exclusively for the benefit of the decree holder it purports to give him an option either to enforce it at once or not to enforce it and to recover the instalments as stipulated If on the default of the judgment debtor by the breach of the terms of the decree providing for payment of instalments the right to apply for the final decree accrues once and for all it is clear that the intention of the parties is defeated and what was intended to be for the benefit of the decree holder is turned to his disadvantage and leaves no option to him The observations of their Lordships that If In the Indian cases the question were when did the mortgagee cause of action arise i when did he first become entitled to sue for the relief claimed by his suit their Lordships think that there might be much to be said in support of the Allahabad decision should not be taken to mean that their Lordships finally decided that the mortgagee cause of action arose on the first default even though the mortgagee had a right to waive or condone the first default In that case there was a decree against the husband in favour of the wife directing the husband to pay Rs There was default on several occasions More than three years after the first default the decree holder applied on the basis of a fresh default for recovery of the amount then due and also for the recovery of possession over the disputed property It was held that the decree holder was entitled not only to the instalments claimed but also to the delivery of possession of the disputed property and that the application for delivery of possession was made within time The application for delivery of possession of the property could only be under Article Limitation Act and this case therefore is a direct authority upon the points arising in the present case and I respectfully agree with what was held in that case The principles I have discussed above would apply not only to Article but also to other Articles in the Limitation Act in which the amount is payable by instalments and there is a default clause Arts In these two cases when the learned Judges stated that the cause of action arose on each subsequent default I have no doubt that they had the principle of waiver in their minds There was no express statement that the instalment arrangement shall cease and there was nothing to show that the default clause was not for the benefit of the creditor but was equally intended for the benefit of the debtor There is only one more case Chuni Lal Motiram <NAME> A I Bom which needs consideration as it was decided after the referring order was made On the decree holder filed an application for execution of the whole amount then due on the ground that there has been a default in payment of the first and second instalments With respect the decision in that case was right but there are certain observations which require comment Said their Lordships In would of fallacious to argue that in case of each default there is a separate right which accrues to the decree holder There may be subsequent defaults but the right having once accrued to the decree holder limitation would run notwithstanding the subsequent default and subsequent default would not give him further rights the right having already accrued to him when the first default took place After making these observations the learned judges pointed out that in the case before them no question of waiver or condonation arose as the decree holder treated the first default made by non payment of two instalments as a default under the decree and it was on the basis of that default that he filed his darkhast of claiming the whole amount due under the decree Say they Where the parties agree not to treat failure on the due date as a default then in the eye of law there is no default at all and limitation does not begin to run and the parties will be estopped from saying that there was default when they did not in fact treat it as such With all respect there is a contradiction in terms in saying that a party has an option to waive or condone a default and yet he cannot exercise his right without the consent of the debtor or judgment debtor The acceptance of the payment amounted to a waiver or condonation of the default by the decree holder and the payment of the amount precluded the judgment debtor from asserting that there was no such waiver or condonation But the waiver which in order to be effective must be based on fresh contract or estoppel is not the waiver of an advantage under an optional clause Where a creditor asserts that he has waived or condoned previous defaults and applies to enforce the default clause upon the happening of a subsequent default he is entitled to do so unless it could be shown by his previous conduct that he has already exercised his option in a different manner I would therefore answer the questions referred to us as follows in Article Limitation Act must mean the first default giving rise to the particular cause of action on the basis of which the application for a final decree is made unless there has been a waiver express or implied of the first default in which case the words when the right to apply accrues would mean the next succeeding default which is not waived but the decree holder will have a right to apply for realisation of each successive instalment as it falls due provided the decree is not so worded that the only right left to the decree holder after the first default is to realise the whole decretal amount My answer to the second question is the same that is the right to apply for a final decree in respect of the instalments not barred by limitation as individual instalments would remain intact in spite of the omission to take advantage of the default clause provided the default clause is not so worded that the decree holder has a right to rely on that alone and the decree after the default ceases to be an instalment decree It is immaterial that the default clause is worded as the decree holder shall have a right to apply or as the decree holder shall have the option to apply or as the entire decretal amount shall become payable or as the entire decretal amount shall become due or as the judgment debtor shall pay the entire decretal amount as in all such cases the default clause is to be interpreted liberally and for the benefit of the decree holder and the rights of the decree holder mentioned by us in our answers to questions and will not be affected I have had the advantage of going through the judgment prepared by brother <NAME> and it is not necessary for me to deal with the questions at length If the decree ceases to be an instalment decree on default and the only relief avail able to the decree holder is the relief for realisation of the whole amount the application must be made within three years of the date on which the default was made giving rise to a right to recover the whole amount If however the default clause gives the decree holder a mere right or an option there appears to be no reason why he should not avail himself of the option and choose his remedy If however the decree provided that it would be payable by instalments but in case of default of two instalments the decree holder will have the further right to recover the whole amount at once or to let the judgment debtor pay by instalments fixed in the decree the decree holder will have clearly the right to apply for a final decree for the whole amount on the date of the second default or he can apply for a final decree for each amount remaining unpaid as it fell due When interpreting a decree in such a casa I would unless the terms of the decree clearly rule out such an interpretation rather hold that it was an option given to the decree holder than that the instalment decree had ceased to be an instalment decree and the decree holder was compelled to realise the whole amount in a lump sum It must further be remembered that on a claim being time barred it does not get extinguished unless such a claim comes under Section Limitation Act which applies to suits for possession of property and provides that on the determination of the period fixed for such a suit the right to such property is extinguished If therefore there are a number of causes of action given to a decree holder and those causes of action are not extinguished by the terms of the decree there is no reason why for the relief appropriate to the cause of action the decree holder cannot come to <ORG> within three years of the date when the right to apply for the particular relief claimed accrued to him A case may arise however in which defaults have been made in payment of instalments giving rise to a right in the decree holder to claim the whole amount but before the decree holder could bring such a claim the judgment debtor had paid up the instalments with reference to which he had defaulted and the decree holder had waived the default with the result that he had no longer the right to rely on the default clause thereafter if on a later date fresh defaults are made would the decree holder have the right to rely on the fresh defaults and bring a suit for realisation of the whole amount then due As at present advised I consider that the decree holder having waived the default the cause of action on the earlier defaults had ceased to exist and the decree holder can rely on the subsequent defaults claim that there was a fresh cause of action and apply within three years from the date when the fresh cause of action accured in his favour In this connection I would like to point out that though there is a difference in the language of Article and Article and while under Article a creditor can waive a default and the cause of action would then arise on the date the next default not so waived is made Article provides for three years from the date when the right to apply arises and makes no mention about waiver of a right to apply to my mind the difference in the language does not make any difference in the case of decree payable by instalments After there was no question of the plaintiff being able to rely on the default clause If the decree is interpreted in the sense that it had not ceased to be an instalment decree and it was therefore open to the decree holder not to avail himself of the option given to him to rely on the default clause and claim the whole amount the application for preparation of a final decree made on would not be time barred about the instalments which fell due within three years from the said application I therefore agree with my learned brother that the decree holder was entitled to have a final decree passed in his favour for the instalments which had not already become time barred and would answer the questions referred to us in the manner proposed by him The words when the right to apply accrues in the third column in Article Limitation Act must mean the first default giving rise to the particular cause of action on the basis of which the application for a final decree is made unless there has been a waiver express or implied of the first default in which case the words when the right to apply accrues would mean the next succeeding default which is not waived but the decree holder will have a right to apply for realisation of each successive instalment as it falls due provided the decree is not so worded that the only right left to the decree holder after the first default is to realise the whole decretal amount The answer to the second question is the same that is the right to apply for a final decree in respect of the instalments not barred by limitation as individual instalments would remain intact in spite of the omission to take advantage of the default clause provided the default clause is not so worded that the decree holder has a right to rely on that alone and the decree after the default ceases to be an instalment decree It is immaterial that the default clause is worded as the decree holder shall have a right to apply or as the decree holder shall have the option to apply or as the entire decretal amount shall become payable or as the entire decretal amount shall become due or as the judgment debtor shall pay the entire decretal amount as in all such cases the default clause is to be interpreted liberally and for the benefit of the decree holder and the rights of the decree holder mentioned by us in our answers to questions and will not be affected
