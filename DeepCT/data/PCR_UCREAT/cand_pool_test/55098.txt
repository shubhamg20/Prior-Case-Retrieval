Clause of the Settle ment dated January which related to payment of bonus provided i that no profit sharing bonus shall be paid but the <ORG> may subject to such directions as <ORG> may issue from time to time grant any other kind of bonus to its Class III and Class IV employees ii that an annual cash bonus will be paid to all Class III and Class IV employees at the rate of of the annual salary actually drawn by an employee in respect of the financial year to which the bonus relates and iii that save as provided therein all other terms and conditions attached to the admissibility and payment of bonus shall be as laid down in the Settlement on bonus dated June Pursuant to this decision <ORG> was advised by <ORG> <ORG> of India that no further payment of bonus should be made to its employees without getting the same cleared by the <ORG> Thereupon <ORG> moved <ORG> for issue of a writ directing the <ORG> to act in accordance with the terms of the Settlement dated January read with administrative instructions dated March and not to refuse to pay cash bonus to Class III and Class IV employees A single Judge of <ORG> allowed the writ petition In the Letters Patent Appeal the <ORG> stated that in view of the impugned Act there was no necessity for proceeding with the appeal and hence <ORG> made no order in the appeal It was contended on their behalf that even if the impugned Act rendered cl ii ineffective with effect from April it did not have the effect of absolving the Life Insurance <ORG> from its obligation to carry out the writ of Mandamus issued by <ORG> and that the right of Class III and Class IV employees to annual cash bonus for the years and under Cl ii of the Settlement was property and since the impugned Act provided for compulsory acquisition of this property One of the tests laid down was whether the decision is of a kind which requires hearing to be given to the parties i whether it involves a quasi judicial procedure Even if legislation can remove the basis of a decision it has to do it by an alteration of general rights of a class but not by simply excluding two specific settlements between the <ORG> and its employees from the purview of of the Industrial Disputes Act which had been held to be valid and enforceable by <ORG> The best way to give vitality and effect to them is to use them as criteria of reasonableness a Articles and A provide that as soon as the Proclamation of emergency cease to operate the effect of suspension must vanish except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have effect The term things done or omitted to be done should be interpreted very narrowly The impugned Act violates Art Section of the impugned Act merely provided that the provisions of the Settlement in so far as they related to payment of annual cash bonus to Class in and Class IV employees shall not have any force or effect and shall not be deemed to have had any force or effect from April By the time the Letters Patent Appeal came up for hearing the impugned Act had already come into force and the <ORG> could have successfully contended in the appeal that since the Settlement in so far as it provided for payment of annual cash bonus was annihilated by the impugned Act with effect from st April and so the employees were not entitled to bonus for the year and hence no writ of Mandamus could issue against the <ORG> directing it to make payment of bonus If such contention had been raised there is little doubt that the judgment of the single Judge would have been upturned The argument on behalf of the <ORG> that on a proper interpretation of the clauses annual cash bonus payable under cl ii was by reason of cl i subject to the directions issued by <ORG> from time to time and the <ORG> having stopped further payment of bonus the employees were not entitled to claim annual cash bonus is erroneous The employees had absolute right to receive annual cash bonus from the <ORG> in terms of el Although under regulation of the Service Regulations non profit sharing bonus could be granted subject to the directions of <ORG> and if the <ORG> issues a direction to the contrary bonus could not be paid by the <ORG> in the instant case as provided in cl of the Settlement <ORG> approved the payment of bonus under cl ii That having been done it was not competent to <ORG> thereafter to issue another contrary direction which would have the effect of compelling the <ORG> to commit a breach of its obligation under of the Industrial Disputes Act to pay annual cash bonus under clause ii The overriding power given to <ORG> to issue directions from time to time contained in cl i is conspicuously absent in cl ii This specific provision is made subject only to the approval of <ORG> which was obtained On the date when the impugned Act came into force each of the employees was entitled to a debt due and owing to him from the <ORG> So long as the acquisition sub serves a public purpose it would satisfy the requirement of Art There is a fundamental distinction between a chose in action and money of service to such extent and in such manner as it thinks fit and if the alteration is not acceptable to any employee the <ORG> may terminate his employment by giving him compensation equivalent to three months remuneration unless the contract of service with such employee provides for a shorter notice of termination Explanation The compensation payable to an employee under this sub section shall be in addition to and shall not affect any pension gratuity provident fund money or any other benefit to which the employee may be entitled under his contract of service Section of the Act shows that <ORG> had ample power to revise the scales of remuneration and other terms and conditions of service if it was satisfied that the interest of the <ORG> or the policy holders demanded this It is proposed to set aside with effect from the st April these provisions of the settlement arrived at between the <ORG> and its Class III and Class IV employees on th January to enable the <ORG> to make ex gratia payments to such employees at the rates determined on the basis of the general Government policy for making ex gratia payments to the employees of the non competing public sector undertakings One of the tests laid down there was whether the decision is of a kind which requires hearing to be given to the parties or in other words involves at least a quasi judicial procedure which the <ORG> does not in exercise of its legislative power follow Even if legislation can remove the basis of a decision it has to do it by an alteration of general rights of a class but not by simply excluding two specific settlements between the <ORG> and its employees from the purview of the section of the Industrial Disputes Act which had been held to be valid and enforceable by <ORG> If <ORG> steps in to set aside such a settlement which <ORG> could much more reasonably have examined after going into the need for it or for its revision the question also arises whether it violates the fundamental right to property guaranteed under Article of the Constitution inasmuch as the right to get bonus is part of wages and by its deprivation a judicially recognised right to property is taken away and not saved by the provisions of Article of the Constitution A restriction upon a right may even cover taking away of the right to increased remuneration in the interests of the general public Where was the question of any restriction here in the interests of the general public it seems a pure and simple case of a deprivation of rights of Class III and Class TV employees without any apparent nexus with any public interest After defining the settlement as the one which was arrived at between the <ORG> and their workers on under section read with clause of section of the Industrial Disputes Act and the similar further settlement of section lays down <NAME> Notwithstanding anything contained in the Industrial Disputes Act the provisions of each of the settlements in so far as they relate to the payment of an annual cash bonus to every Class III and Class IV employees of the <ORG> at the rate of fifteen per cent of his annual salary shall not have any force or effect and shall not be deemed to have any force or effect on and from st day of April I find my self in complete agreement with my learned brother <NAME> that to give effect to the judgment of <ORG> is not the same thing as enforcing a right under Article of the Constitution Apart from the consideration mentioned above there are also other considerations put forward with his usual vehemence by Mr <NAME> who relies upon the directive principles of the <ORG> Policy as part of the basic structure of our Constitution It was held there at Under our jurisprudence the Government is not exempt from liability to carry out the representation made by it as to its future conduct and it cannot on some undefined and undisclosed ground of necessity or expediency fail to carry out the promise solemnly made by it nor claim to be the judge of its own obligation to the citizen on an ex parte appraisement of the circumstances in which the obligation has arisen I have however thought it to be my duty to indicate my line of thinking briefly as I have my doubts whether Article A is not an effective answer to complete reliance upon Article of the Constitution It is true that the right to receive bonus which had been recognised by <ORG> both by its orders and conduct under a settlement is a right to property The provision reads as follows A Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a <ORG> evened or controlled by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property I have however no doubt that the conclusion reached by my learned brother <NAME> is quite correct inasmuch as the benefits of the rights recognised by the judgment of <ORG> could not be indirectly taken away by section of the Act selectively directed against specified settlements only Both Articles and A provide that as soon as a proclamation of emergency ceases to operate the effect of suspension must vanish except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the law so ceases to have effect The things done or omitted to be done could certainly not mean that the rights conferred under the settlements were washed off completely as the learned Attorney General suggested If the law was not validated but only its invalidation was suspended we should not give any wider effect to the suspension I think we should interpret things done or omitted to be done very narrowly BHAGWATI These writ petitions are filed by employees of <ORG> challenging the constitutional validity of <ORG> Modification of Settlement Act It would be enough to refer to section which confers power on <ORG> to make regulations with the previous approval of <ORG> make regulations not in consistent with the Act to provide for all matters for which provision is expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Act and sub section enacts that in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the power conferred under sub section such regulations may provide for the method of recruitment of employees and agents of the <ORG> and the terms and conditions of service of such employees or agents bb the terms and conditions of service of persons who have become employees of the Corporation under subsection of section <ORG> has in exercise of the power conferred under clauses and bb of sub section There is only one Regulation which is material for our purpose and that is Regulation which is in the following terms The <ORG> may subject to such directions as <ORG> may issue grant non profit sharing bonus to its employees and the payment thereof including conditions of eligibility for the bonus shall be regulated by instructions issued by the Chairman from time to time It appears that right from Settlement were arrived at between <ORG> and its employees from time to time in regard to various matters relating to the terms and conditions of service of Class III and Class IV employees including bonus payable to them The Settlement provided for various matters relating to the terms and conditions of service but we are concerned only with Clause which made provision in regard to bonus However the <ORG> may subject to such directions as <ORG> may issue from time to time grant any other kind of bonus to its Class III IV employees It is also necessary to reproduce here Clause as that has some bearing on the controversy between the parties PERIOD OF SETTLEMENT This Settlement shall be effective from st April and shall be for a period of four years i from st April to st March There was no dispute that for the first two years st April to st March and st April to st March <ORG> paid bonus to its Class III and Class IV employees in accordance with the provisions of Clause ii of the Settlement read with the administrative instructions dated th March On th September an Ordinance was promulgated by the President of India called the Payment of Bonus Amendment Ordinance which came into force with immediate effect Subsequently this Ordinance was replaced by the Payment of Bonus Amendment Act which was brought into force with retrospective effect from the date of the Ordinance namely th September in each case and such payment will be subject to a maximum of and pursuant to this decision <ORG> was advised by <ORG> that no further payment of bonus should be made to the employees without getting the same cleared by the <ORG> <ORG> protested against this stand taken by <ORG> and pointed out that <ORG> was bound to pay bonus in accordance with the terms of the Settlement and the direction not to pay bonus was clearly illegal and unjustified <ORG> preferred a Letters Patent Appeal against the judgment of the learned Single Judge but in the mean time the impugned Act bad already come into force and it was therefore stated on behalf of <ORG> before <ORG> that there was no necessity for proceeding with the appeal and hence <ORG> made no order in the appeal Section gave the short title of the impugned Act section contained definitions and section which was the operative section provided as follows Notwithstanding anything contained in the Industrial Disputes Act the provisions of the settlement in so far as they relate to the payment of an annual cash bonus to every Class III and Class IV employees of the <ORG> at the rate of fifteen per cent of his annual salary shall not have any force or effect and shall not be deemed to have had any force or effect on and from the st day of April Since the impugned Act did not set at naught the entire settlement dated th January but merely rendered without force and effect the provisions of the Settlement in so far as they related to payment of annual cash bonus to Class III and Class IV employees and that too not from the date when the Settlement became operative but from st April it was said to be a statute modifying the pro visions of the Settlement There were two grounds on which the constitutionality of the impugned Act was assailed on behalf of the petitioners and they were as follows A The right of Class III and Class TV employees to annual cash bonus for the years st April to st March and st April to st March under clause ii of the Settlement was property and since the impugned Act provided for compulsory acquisition of this property without payment of compensation the impunged Act was violative of Article of the Constitution and was hence null and void The impugned Act deprived Class III and Class IV employees of the right to annual cash bonus for the years st April to st March and st April to st March which was vested in them under clause ii of the Settlement and there was therefore clear infringement of their fundamental right under Article and since this deprivation of the right to annual cash bonus which was secured under a Settlement arrived at as a result of collective bargaining and with full and mature deliberation on the part of <ORG> and <ORG> after taking into account the interests of the policy holders and the community and with a view to approximating towards the goal of a living wage as envisaged in Article of the Constitution amounted to an unreasonable restriction the impugned Act was not saved by Article and hence it was liable to be struck down as invalid We shall proceed to consider these grounds in the order in which we have set them out though we may point out that if either ground succeeds it would be unnecessary to consider the other The contention was that since <ORG> had by its judgment dated st May issued a writ of Mandamus directing <ORG> to pay annual cash bonus to Class III and Class IV employees for the year st April to st March along with their salary for the month of April as provided by the Settlement and this judgment had be come final by reason of withdrawal of the Letters Patent Appeal preferred against it <ORG> was bound to obey the writ of Mandamus and to pay annual cash bonus for the year st April to st March in accordance with the terms of clause ii of the Settlement There was according to the petitioners nothing in the impugned Act which set at naught the effect of the judgment of <ORG> or the binding character of the writ of Mandamus issued against <ORG> It is significant to note that there was no reference to the judgment of <ORG> in the Statement of Objects and Reasons nor any non obstante clause referring to a judgment of a court in section of the impugned Act Section of the impugned Act provided that the provisions of the Settlement in so far as they relate to payment of annual cash bonus to Class III and Class IV employees shall not have any force or effect and shall not be deemed to have had any force or effect from st April But the writ of Mandamus issued by <ORG> directing <ORG> to pay the amount of bonus for the year st April to st March remained untouched by the impugned Act By the time the Letters Patent Appeal came up for hearing the impugned Act had already come into force and <ORG> could therefore have successfully contained in the Letters Patent Appeal that since the Settlement in as far as it provided for payment of annual cash bonus was annihilated by the impugned Act with effect from st April Class III and Class IV employees were not entitled to annual cash bonus for the year st April to st March and hence no writ of Mandamus could issue directing <ORG> to make payment of such bonus If such contention had been raised there is little doubt subject of course to any constitutional challenge to the validity of the impugned Act that the judgment of the learned Single Judge would have been upturned and the Writ petition dismissed It is true that there are certain observations in this decision which seem to suggest that a court decision may cease to be binding when the conditions on which it is based are so fundamentally altered that the decision could not have been given in the altered circumstances But these observations have to be read in the light of the question which arose for consideration in that case But it is a judgment giving effect to the right of the petitioners to annual cash bonus under the Settlement by issuing a writ of Mandamus directing <ORG> to pay the amount of such bonus Now to the grounds of constitutional challenge Re Ground A This ground raise the question whether the impugned Act is violative of clause of Article This clause provides safeguards against compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property by laying down conditions subject to which alone property may be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned and at the date when the impugned Act was enacted it was in the following terms No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for acquisition or requisitioning of the property for an amount which may be fixed by such law or which may be determined in accordance with such principles and given in such manner as may be specified in such law and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the amount so fixed or determined is not adequate or that the whole or any part of such amount is to be given otherwise than in cash Clause in this form was substituted in Article by the Constitution Twenty fifth Amendment Act and by this amending Act clauses A and were also introduced in Article and they read as follows A Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of Property notwithstanding that it does any person of his property The first question which arises for consideration on this <ORG> submitted that at the date when the impugned Act was enacted Class III and Class IV employees had no absolute right to receive annual cash bonus either for the year st April to st March or for the year st April to st March and there was therefore no property which could be compulsorily acquired under the impugned Act The argument of <ORG> was that <ORG> Staff Regulations which laid down the terms and conditions of services inter alia of Class III and Class IV employees did not contain any provision for payment of bonus except Regulation and since under this Regulation grant of annual cash bonus by <ORG> was subject to such directions as <ORG> might issue the right of Class III and Class IV employees to receive annual cash bonus could not be said to be an absolute right It was a right which was liable to be set at naught by any directions that might be issued by <ORG> and in fact <ORG> did issue a direction to <ORG> not to make payment of bonus to the employees without getting the same cleared by the Government and consequently Class III and Class IV employees had no absolute right to claim bonus The result according to <ORG> also followed on a proper interpretation of clauses i and ii of the <ORG> for it was clear on a proper reading of these two clauses that annual cash bonus payable to Class III and Class IV employees under clause ii was by reason of clause i subject to such directions as <ORG> might issue from time to time and <ORG> having directed that no further payment of bonus should be made to the employees Class III and Class TV employees were not entitled to claim annual cash bonus from <ORG> It was not competent to <ORG> thereafter to issue another contrary direction which would have the effect of compelling <ORG> to commit a breach of its obligation under section sub section of the Industrial Disputes Act to pay annual cash bonus in terms of clause ii of the <ORG> <NAME> to clause i of the <ORG> it is true that under this clause non profit sharing bonus could be granted by <ORG> subject to such directions as <ORG> may issue from time to time but these words giving overriding power to <ORG> to issue directions from time to time are conspicuously absent in clause ii and it is difficult to see bow they could be projected or read into that clause Clauses i and ii are distinct and independent clauses and while clause i enacts a general provision that non profit sharing bonus may be paid by <ORG> to Class III and Class IV employees subject to such directions as <ORG> might issue from time to time clause ii picks out one kind of non profit sharing bonus and specifically provided that annual cash bonus shall be paid to all Class III and Class IV employees at the rate of per cent of the annual salary and this specific provision in regard to payment of annual cash bonus is made subject to only the approval of <ORG> which was admittedly obtained the annual cash bonus payable under clause ii of the <ORG> was a debt due and owing from <ORG> to each Class III or Class IV employee and so also at the date when the impugned Act came into force each Class III or Class IV employee was entitled to a debt due and owing to him from <ORG> in respect of the annual cash bonus from st April upto that date While discussing the scope and content of Entry in List III of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which confers power on <ORG> and the <ORG> to legislate with respect to acquisition and requisitioning of property It was speaking on behalf of the majority in India that property which can be compulsorily aquired by legislation under this Entry means the highest anything being that right which one has to with respect to acquisition and requisition of property it was pointed out by <NAME> Cooper Union of acquired by legislative a man can have to lands or tenements goods or chattels which does not depend on another courtesy it includes ownership estates and interests in corporeal things and also rights such as trade marks copyrights patents and even rights in persona capable of transfer or transmission such as debts and signifies a beneficial right to or a thing considered as having a money value especially with reference to transfer or succession and to their capacity of being injured It would therefore seem that according to the decision of the majority in <NAME> debts and other rights in personam capable of transfer or transmission are property which can form the subject matter of compulsory acquisition Since the effect of the Order of the President was to deprive the Ruler of his Privy Purse which was his property the learned Chief Justice held that there was infringement of the fundamental right of the Ruler under Article But a question was raised on behalf of the Respondents whether debts and choses in action though undoubtedly property could form the subject matter of compulsory acquisition so as to attract the applicability of Article clause There is divergence of opinion amongst jurists in the United <ORG>s of America on this question and though in the earlier decisions of the American courts it was said that the power of eminent domain cannot be exercised in respect of money and choses in action the modern trend as pointed by <NAME> on Eminent Domain Vol We shall confine our attention only to the question of compulsory acquisition of choses in action and not say anything in regard to compulsory acquisition of money for in these appeals the question arises only in regard to choses in action and it is not necessary to consider whether money can form the subject matter of compulsory acquisition for vesting in the <ORG> of arrears of rent due to the pro prietors or tenure holders for the period prior to the date of vesting of the estates or tenures held by them on payment of only per cent of the amount as compensation was challenged as constitutionally invalid on the ground that there was no public purpose for which such acquisition could be said to have been made The necessity for existence of public purpose was not sought to be spelt out from Article clause because even if there were violation of that The learned judge pointed out at pages of the Report It is a well accepted proposition of law that property of individuals cannot be appropriated by the State under the power of compulsory acquisition for the mere purposes of adding to the revenues of the State no instance is known in which it has been taken for the mere purpose of raising a revenue by sale or otherwise Taking money under the right of eminent domain when it must be compensated in money afterwards is nothing more or less than a forced loan Money or that which in ordinary use passes as such and which the Government may reach by taxation and also rights in action which can only be available when made to produce money cannot be taken under this power <NAME> rested his decision in <ORG> case on alternative grounds if the impugned section provided for the acquisition of money and if money could not be acquired then the section was void under Article as imposing an unreasonable restriction on the right to hold property This <ORG> held that the power of compulsory acquisition conferred under Article clause could not be utilised for enriching the coffers of the <ORG> that power could be exercised only for a public purpose and augmenting the resources of the <ORG> could not be regarded as public purpose <NAME> speaking on behalf of the <ORG> pointed out that if it were otherwise it would be permissible for the legislatures to enact laws acquiring all public debts due from the <ORG> annuity deposits returnable by it and provident fund payable by it by providing for the payment of some nominal compensation to the persons whose rights are acquired as the acquisitions in question would augment the resources of the <ORG> but nothing so bad could be said to be within the contemplation of clause of Article We have taken one example by way of illustration but in a modern welfare <ORG> dedicated to a socialist pattern of society myriad situations may arise where it may be necessary to acquire choses in action for achieving a public purpose There is a fundamental difference between chose in action and money in that the former has not the same mobility and liquidity as the latter and its values is not measured by the amount recoverable under it but it depends on a variety of factors such as the financial condition of the person liable the speed and effectiveness of the litigative process and the eventual uncertainty as to when and to what extent it may be possible to realise the chose in action Moreover there is also one other fallacy underlying the argument that there can be no public purpose in the acquisition of choses in action and that is based on the assumption that the public purpose contemplated by Article clause lies in the use to which the pro perty acquired is to be put as for example where land or building or other movable property is acquired for being used for a public purpose So long as the acquisition subserves a public purpose it would satisfy the requirement of clause of Article and therefore if it can be shown that the acquisition of choses in action is for subserving a public purpose it would be constitutionally valid If the legislature enacts a law acquiring any of these choses in action it could only be for the purpose of augmenting the revenues of the <ORG> or reducing <ORG> expenditure and that would clearly not be a public purpose and the legislation would plainly be violative of the constitutional guarantee embodied in Article clause We would therefore prefer the minority view of <NAME> in <NAME> case supra as against the majority view of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> So much on principle There are in fact subsequent decisions which clearly seem to suggest the contrary We have already referred to <NAME> case The debts due and owing from <ORG> to Class III and Class IV employees said the learned Attorney General were extinguished and not compulsorily acquired and hence there was no contravention of Article clause Now prior to the Constitution Fourth Amendment Act which introduced clauses A and in Article there was considerable controversy as to the inter relation between clauses and Clause A declared that a law shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property if it does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of the property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> It is only where a law provides for the transfer of ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> that it would have to meet the challenge of clause of Article as a law providing for compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property Whenever therefore the constitutional validity of a law is challenged on the ground of infraction of Article clause the question has to be asked whether the law provides for the transfer of ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> When clause A says that in order to attract the applicability of clause the law must provide for the transfer of ownership of property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it is not necessary that the law should in so many words provide for such transfer There is no doubt that in the present case the impugned Act extinguished or put an end to the debts due and owing from <ORG> to Class III and Class IV employees The same would be the position where A law provides for cancellation of the lease and in such a case if the lessor is the <ORG> or a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it would amount to compulsory acquisition of the leasehold interest of the lessees within meaning of clause A of Article It was pointed out in that case that there was no difference between taking by the <ORG> of money that is in the hands of others and the abrogation of the liability of the <ORG> to make payment to others for in the former case the <ORG> would be compulsorily taking others property while in the latter it would be seeking to appropriate to itself the property of others which is in its hands It is therefore clear that when a debt due and owing by the <ORG> or a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> is extinguished by law there is transfer of ownership of the money representing the debt from the creditor to the <ORG> or the <ORG> owned controlled corporation So long as the debt is due and owing to the creditor the <ORG> or the <ORG> owned controlled corporation is under a liability to pay the amount of the debt to the creditor and therefore if the amount of the debt is the total wealth of the creditor would be A plus while that of the <ORG> or <ORG> owned controlled corporation would be minus But if the debt is extinguished the total wealth of the creditor would be reduced by and that of the <ORG> or <ORG> owned controlled corporation augmented by the same amount It is necessary to remember that we are dealing here with a case where a constitutionally guaranteed right is sought to be enforced and the protection of such right should not be allowed to be defeated or rendered illusory by legis lative stratagems We accordingly allow the writ petitions and declare <ORG> Modification of Settlement Act void as offending Article clause of the Constitution and issue a writ of Mandamus directing the union of India and <ORG> to forebear from implementing or enforcing the provisions of that Act and to pay annual cash bonus for the years st April to st March and st April to st March to Class III and Class IV employees in accordance with the terms of clause ii of the Settlement dated th January The respondents will pay the costs of the writ petitions to the petitioners ORDER We agree with the conclusion of Brother <NAME> but prefer to rest our decision on the ground that the impugned Act violates the provisions of Article and is therefore void
