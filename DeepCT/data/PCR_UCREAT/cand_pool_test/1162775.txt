Under of the Finance Act income tax was to be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the First Schedule and super tax at the rates specified in Part of that Schedule The assessee contended that under of the Finance Act there was no mention of surcharge and hence only income tax which was to be worked out at the rates applicable under the Finance Act was payable Under of the Finance Act the provisions of and of the First Schedule to the Act shall apply in relation to income tax for the assessment year commencing on the first day of April If that meaning is applied to of the Finance Act it would lead to the result that income tax and super tax were to be charged in four different ways or at different rates which may be described as a the basic charge or rate surcharge special surcharge and additional surcharge calculated in the manner provided in the Schedule The legislative power of <ORG> to levy taxes and duties is contained in Arts Entry in List relates to taxes on income other than agricultural income Income tax super tax and sur charge would all fall under this entry Sections and of the Income tax Act only provide that where any Central Act enacts that income tax and super tax shall be charged for any assessment year at any rate or rates income tax and super tax at those rates shall be charged in accordance thereto and subject to the provisions of the Act In the previous year ending on th March his total income from salary amounted to Rs The assessee preferred an appeal to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner On a reference being sought the follow in question of law was referred to <ORG> Whether the words income tax in the Finance Act of in sub a and sub of would include surcharge and additional surcharge Section of the Finance Act which is headed as income tax and super tax provides in sub that income tax and super tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Parts I and II of the First Schedule respectively and that in cases to which certain paragraphs of those parts apply these taxes shall be increased by a surcharge for the purpose of the <ORG> According to sub where the total income of an assessee not being a company includes any income chargeable under the head salaries income tax and super tax payable by the assessee on the salary portion of the total income shall be the proportionate amount payable according to the rates provided in the Finance Act Under of the Finance Act income tax was to be charged at the rates specified in Part of the First Schedule and super tax at he rates specified in Part of that Schedule It was pointed out that surcharge was treated in the Finance Act sas a tax different from the income tax and super tax and that surcharge was levied by the Finance Act while the income and super taxes were levied by the Act Reference was made in this connection to the First Schedule to the Finance Act As regards the surcharge on super tax there was mention of a a surcharge for the purpose of the <ORG> and a special surcharge It came to the conclusion that The Government of India Act Part VII contained provisions relating to finance property contracts and suits Sections and in Chapter I headed finance provided for levy and collection of certain succession duties stamp duties terminal tax taxes on fares and freights and taxes on income respectively In the Finance Act of relating to income tax and super tax provided that these taxes would be levied at the rates specified in Parts I and II of the First Schedule increased in each case by a surcharge for the purpose of the Union The Finance Act of was a short document and thereof simply provided the provisions of of and the First Schedule to the Finance Act shall apply in relation to income tax and super tax for the financial year as they apply in relation to income tax and super tax for the financial year There was no specific mention whatsoever of surcharge in nor was there any modification of the First Schedule to the Finance Act of which contained the rates etc Section of the Finance Act is tothe effect that the provisions of and of the First Schedule to the Finance Act shall apply in relation to income tax for the assessment year or as the case may be the financial year commencing on the first day of April as they apply in relation to income tax for the assessment year commencing on first day of April with certain modifications set out in the section It is only in the modifications made in the Schedule to the Finance Act of that there is provision for a surcharge Clause says that tax on income other than agricultural income shall be levied and collected by the Government of India and distributed between the <ORG> and the States in the manner provided in clause The provisions of Article which is the first one under the heading distribution of revenue between the <ORG> and the States relate to duties levied by the <ORG> but collected and appropriated by the States The legislative power of <ORG> to levy taxes and duties is contained in Arts It is in exercise of the legislative power conferred by that entry that <ORG> enacts the provision in the Finance Act each year relating Lo them Section of the Act simply provides that where any Central Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any assessment year at any rate or rates income tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged in accordance thereto and subject to the provisions of the Act Section which was omitted by the Finance Act of contained similar provision with regard to super tax In our judgment it is unnecessary to express any opinion in the matter because the essential point for determination is whether surcharge is an additional mode or rate for charging income tax The meaning of the word surcharge as given in the Webster New International Dictionary includes among others to charge one too much or in addition If that meaning is applied to of the Finance Act it would lead to the result that income tax and super tax were to be charged in four different ways or at four different rates which may be described as i the basic charge or rate In part I of the First Schedule ii Sur charge iii special surcharge and iv additional surcharge calculated in the manner provided in the Schedule It would appear that since the Finance Act upto the Finance Act a provision was made for taxing the income under the head salaries according to the provisions of the Finance Act of the preceding year rather than of the current year if the assessee had any income in addition to his income by way of salary
