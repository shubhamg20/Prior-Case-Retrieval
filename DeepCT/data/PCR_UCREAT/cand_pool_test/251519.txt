JUDGMENT This appeal under section of the Motor Vehicles Act IV of is directed against the order of <ORG> dated dismissing the appellant application for claim in respect of an accident caused by bus No of the Punjab Roadways Ambala on in which he appellant received some injuries After dealing with the evidence led at the trial the <ORG> considered it important to look at the version given by the claimant himself immediately after the accident Fort Bahadurgarh and is dated and was made at A A a copy of the report sent by the claimant to <NAME> Ambala was then taken into account by the <ORG> From this material the <ORG> inferred that there was no negligence on the part of the driver of the bus as none was mentioned by the claimant who was holding the position of Deputy Superintendent of Police in the Police service and therefore <ORG> could not be held responsible He has stated that it was drizzling on that day and the accident took place one mile ahead of Shambu village towards Ambala side In cross examination by the <ORG> the witness could not say that the accident took place as <NAME> wanted to overtake another bus going ahead because the witness was sitting on the back seat It is further pointed out that in the complaint made by the appellant there was no mention of the driver negligence nor was there any such mention made in the report to <NAME> Ambala The respondent counsel has in this connection relied on section of the Motor Vehicles Act which excludes the jurisdiction of Civil Courts from entertaining questions relating to claims for compensation On the second point Shri <NAME> has contended that only a person who has been at fault can be held liable and burdened with the liability and that no innocent party should in fairness be called upon to compensate the injured person Dealing with the second point first it is true that section of the Motor Vehicles Act does not in terms lay down that it is only when negligence on the part of the driver of the vehicle concerned is established that compensation can be awarded but then it should be borne in mind that this bunch of Secs to merely deal with the subject of the substitution of <ORG> in place of civil Courts for the purpose of adjudicating on claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving the death or bodily injury to person arising out of the use of motor vehicles They do not deal with the question as to who is to be held liable and in what circumstances if any injury results from an accident In order therefore to discover the criterion or test for fixing liability we have in the absence of any statutory provision fixing liability irrespective of negligence to turn to the law of Torts according to which indisputably negligence in causing the accident in question is generally speaking essential to hold the negligent person liable The cardinal principle of liability in tort when death or bodily injury has been caused to a person is negligence or failure to take the requisite amount of care required by law I have therefore no hesitation in repelling this contention There is undoubtedly a divergence of judicial opinion as to the extent of the onus but in the case in hand that question does not arise and therefore it is unnecessary for me to advert to it The contention raised however is that it was not possible for the vehicle to skid if there had been no negligence on the part of the driver in other words the vehicles could only skid if there was some serious defect in it I would grant that a skid in itself does not excuse the accident and it may not suffice by itself to displace the prima facie inference of negligence arising from the vehicle being where it has no right to be for a skid may be caused by bad careless or fast driving I have therefore no option but to repel this contention as well
