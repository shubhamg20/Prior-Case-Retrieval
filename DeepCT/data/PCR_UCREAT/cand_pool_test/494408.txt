The usual course of that business was stated to be that appellants first entered into contracts with their customers abroad for the sale of tobacco and besides that having regard to their course of business any tax levied on their sales was in contravention of Art <ORG> dismissed the petition holding that the impugned Act did not infringe any constitutional provision but granted certificate under Art of the Constitution in deciding whether such a law is discrimi natory or not it is necessary to bear in mind that the State has a wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and that the statute is not open to attack on the mere ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others It is only when within the range of its selection the law operates unequally and this cannot be justified on the basis of a valid classification that there would be a violation of Arts The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Those are appeals against the judgment of <ORG> in petitions Nos of and of filed under Art The usual course of that business is stated to be that they first enter into contracts with their customers abroad for the sale of tobacco that thereafter they purchase the requisite quantities of goods locally and then export them to the foreign purchasers in performance of their contracts Prior to October the area wherein the appellants carried on business formed part of the State of Madras and on that date the State of Andhra was constituted and the area in question fell within that State Section of this Act provides for exemption of tax on sales of goods specified therein and a confers on the State Government power to exempt the tax payable on the sale of any specified class of goods or by any specified class of persons In exercise of the powers conferred by a the Government of Madras issued on March a notification No exempting the sales of unmanufactured tobacco from sales tax After the Andhra State came into existence the <ORG> of that State enacted Act XIV of hereinafter referred to as the Amendment Act whereby it amended of the Madras General Sales Tax Act by adding as item viii the following viii raw tobacco except country variety thereof whether cured or uncured shall be liable to tax under Section Sub Section only at the point of the first purchase effected in the State of Andhra by a dealer who is not exempt from taxation under Section Sub Section but at the rate of seven and half pies for every rupee on his turnover Acting under the provisions of the Amendment Act the Additional Commercial Tax Officer Guntur issued notices to the appellants to produce the account books relating to their business in tobacco for the purpose of assessing sales tax The learned Judges disagreed with these contentions and dismissed the petitions holding that the impugned Act did not infringe any constitutional provisions but granted certificates under Art On the arguments addressed to us two questions arise for our determination Is the impugned Act repugnant to Art All laws must satisfy the requirements of Art But in deciding whether a taxation law is discriminatory or not it is necessary to bear in mind that the <ORG> has a wide discretion in selecting the persons or objects it will tax and that a statute is not open to attack on the ground that it taxes some persons or objects and not others The point for consideration is whether there is in fact a real distinction between Virginia tobacco and other tobacco called country tobacco Nattu tobacco The finding of learned Judges on this point is as follows Broadly there are two types Virginia and Nattu differing in taste light colour and texture There are obvious differences between the two categories of to bacco in the nomenclature used in the process of growing curing and grading in the market facilities foreign and inland in the price and in the variety of uses to which they are put and also the class of customers that take to them It should in this connection be remembered that under the law it is for the person who assails a legislation a discriminatory to established that it is not based on a valid classification and it is well settled that this burden is all the heavier when It may be assumed for the purpose of the present discussion that the purchases made by the appellants on which the tax is sought to be imposed were made for the purpose of executing specific orders which they had received from their foreign customers The question is whether even so the sales in question took place in the course of export for the purpose of Art Now the observations quoted above were made in refutation of the contention that the expression sale in the course of export or import meant only a sale which takes place while the goods are actually in movement in the course of export or import as for example when shipping documents are endorsed and delivered when the goods are in transit We may refer to two other decisions of this Court where this question has been considered <NAME> sale does not fall within its purview though it is made for the purpose of or with a view to export In the result both the contentions urged by the appellants fail and the appeals must be dismissed with costs one hearing fee
