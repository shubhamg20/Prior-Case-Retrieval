For the assessment year corresponding to the accounting year ending August the assessee filed its return to income of Rs In the statement accompanying the said return the assessee has valued the stock in trade as on August as follows However the assessee filed a revised return on July showing the total income at Rs In that letter the assessee also pointed out that it has been following the mercantile system of accounting and that there is no change in the said method of accounting followed by it but that it has changed only the manner of valuation of certain items of closing stock that while the valuation of closing stock in respect of all items in the earlier years was being done at cost which term was understood to be total cost the valuation in respect of the accounting year ended August has been changed in respect of work in progress and finished goods from total cost to direct cost and that the difference between the total cost and the direct cost is that in the cost the overheads such as administrative department expenses are excluded while in the total cost such overheads are included The assessee by its letter dated January submitted that the total cost would include the following items Depreciation Rent Rates and taxes Repairs and maintenance supplies and services Insurance Shipping Packing Salaries and perquisites Supervisory and ancillary staff Postage telegrams and telephones Printing and stationery Travailing Audit fees Advertising Professional charges Technical fees while direct cost would include only the following components Raw materials Power Fuel Direct labour wages Direct labour and overtime Holiday pay Fringe benefits bonus I Production department Supervisory staff Salary Overtime and fringe benefits bonus and that it has bona fide valued the closing stock at direct cost and that this new method of valuation is not for any casual period but it would be adopted consistently in future from year to year and that the new basis adopted is based upon accepted principles of commercial practice which represented the difference in the value of the closing stock as per the new method of valuation and the old method valuation is to be added back and the reasons given by him may be given in his own words The assessee has been valuing the closing stock of finished goods and work in progress at full cost The assessee has made a departure from the method regularly adopted in the earlier years and for the first time has valued the stock as on August at part sic of the cost viz The <ORG> accepted the assessee contention and held that there are various methods of closing stock valuation that one of the recognised methods is cost or market value whichever is lower that the assessee has been following the cost method so far but in the relevant assessment year it has switched over from actual cost to direct cost and that in that process the value of the closing stock as on August went down by Rs He therefore held that since the opening stock has been valued as per the total cost method the same method should be adopted for closing stock also Therefore we have to proceed on the basis that the assessee is entitled to change the method of valuation of the stock from total cost to direct cost The difference between the view taken by the <ORG> and the <ORG> is that while the <ORG> felt that the new method of valuation of stock should be adopted both for closing and opening stock the <ORG> has held that being the first year when the change is contemplated on a permanent basis the closing stock alone can be valued on the new basis leaving the value of the opening stock arrived at as per the total cost method intact That when a new method of valuation of stock is adopted in any particular year the <ORG> can on that basis leave intact the valuation of the opening stock on the old method has been laid down in a series of cases In that case the assessee had valued his closing stock of the assessment year at the market rate and the same value was shown for the opening stock of In that case the assessee has valued the closing stock as on December on the basis of the invoice value plus appropriate customs duty and other charges on ad hoc basis but valued its closing stock on December without adding customs duty and other charges This decision which was relied on by the learned counsel for the <ORG> should be confined to the facts of that case as the court refused to direct a reference on the ground that no question of law arose out of the order of the <ORG> The assessee filed a return making addition to the value of the closing stock for that year When the reassessment was made the assessee filed an appeal seeking addition of the same amount to the opening stock of the assessment year That was refused on the ground that the assessee has filed a return revaluing only the closing stock of the previous year and not the opening stock of the previous year Therefore in view of the findings of the <ORG> that the change of the method is bona fide and is intended to be followed in future year after year the change has to be accepted by the <ORG> notwithstanding the fact that during assessment year which is the first year when change of method is brought about it has resulted in a prejudice or detriment to the <ORG> In view of the above discussion we answer the question referred to us in the affirmative and against the <ORG> The <ORG> will pay the costs of the assessee
