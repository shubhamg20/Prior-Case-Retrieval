It was stipulated that if <ORG> committed default or breach of the agreement or failed in the due performance thereof the <ORG> shall be entitled to recover from the <ORG> by way of compensation or liquidated damages and amount calculated at the rate of Rs There was no publication of the directories for Delhi for the years and and in respect of Bombay for the years and A Writ Petition was flied questioning the validity and legality of the supplemental agreement on different grounds including the ground of mala fide It was contended by the petitioners that under the grab of a supplemental agreement a fresh contract was awarded to Sterling for a fresh period from to on fresh terms and conditions to publish the directories every year for Delhi and Bombay without inviting tenders or affording an opportunity to others to submit tenders so that they may be also considered for award of the said contract The termination of the original contract was no remedy although repeated contraventions and breaches had been committed by the <ORG> inasmuch as there was no publication of directory for Bombay for the years and and for Delhi for the years and In the appeals to this <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the appellants that the supplemental agreement was entered into by the <ORG> taking into consideration the circumstances then existing which had been examined at the highest level and as such a <ORG> should not examine the discretion exercised by the public authority as a court of appeal because the decision to enter into the supplemental agreement also involved a question of policy and it was pointed out that the contract had been awarded in the year to <ORG> on an experimental basis on such terms and conditions on which in past directories had not ever been published and that the real experiment was as to how the directories could be published without incurring any cost by <ORG> crores for the period to the period covered by the supplemental agreement for which the <ORG> JDI Sterling have undertaken to pay only Rs In contracts having commercial elements some more discretion has to be conceded to the authorities so that they may enter into contracts with persons keeping an eye on the augmentation of the revenue But even in such matters they have to follow the norms recognised by courts while dealing with public property Under some special circumstances a discretion has to be conceded to the authorities who have to enter into contract giving them liberty to assess the overall situation for purposes of taking a decision its to whom the contract is to be awarded and at what terms If the decisions have been taken in bone fide manner although not strictly following the norms laid down by the <ORG>s such decisions are upheld If such decision is influenced by extraneous considerations which it ought not to have been taken into account the ultimate decision is bound to be vitiated even if it is established that such decision had been taken without bias There was no justification on the part of the <ORG> to become benevolent by entering into the supplemental agreement with no apparent benefit to the without inviting fresh tenders from intending persons to perform the some job for the next five years Because of the interim orders passed in such applications the very execution of the contracts are kept in abeyance The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> Leave granted Three appeals have been filed against the same judgment of <ORG> by which the Writ Petition filed on behalf of the petitioners respondents hereinafter referred to as the writ petitioners was allowed It was also stipulated that if <ORG> committed any default or breach of the terms and conditions of the agreement or failed in the due performance thereof within the time fixed which was the essence of the contract the <ORG> shall be entitled to recover from the <ORG> by way of compensation or liquidated damages an amount calculated at the rate of Rs But there was no publication of directories for Delhi for the years and Similarly there was no publication of directories in respect of Bombay for the years and It was also said that if there was any inconsistency or contradictions vis a vis the original agreement the memorandum of understanding read with supplemental agreement shall prevail and would have overriding effect The Writ Petition aforesaid was filed questioning the validity and legality of the supplemental agreement on different grounds including on ground of mala fide The termination of original contract was no remedy although repeated contraventions and breaches had been committed by the <ORG> inasmuch as there was no publication of directory for Bombay for the years and and for Delhi for the years and It was stated on behalf of the <ORG> before <ORG> that in order to salvage Rs crores for the period to the period covered by the supplemental agreement for which the UIP UDI Sterling have undertaken to pay only Rs In contracts having commercial element some more discretion has to be conceded to the authorities so that they may enter into contracts with persons keeping an eye on the augmentation of the revenue But even in such matters they have to follow the norms recognised by <ORG> while dealing with public property It is not possible for <ORG> to question and adjudicate every decision taken by an authority because many of the Government Undertakings which in due course have acquired the monopolist position in matters of sale and purchase of products and with so many ventures in hand they can come out with a plea that it is not always possible to act like a quasi judicial authority while awarding contracts Under some special circumstances a discretion has to be conceded to the authorities who have to enter into contract giving them liberty to assess the overall situation for purpose of taking a decision as to whom the contract be awarded and at what terms If the decisions have been taken in bona fide manner although not strictly following the norms laid down by the courts such decisions are upheld on the principle laid down by justice <NAME> that <ORG> while judging the constitutional validity of executive decisions must grant certain measure of freedom of play in the joints to the executive it has been said by this Court It must follow as a necessary corollary from this proposition that the <ORG> cannot act in a manner which would benefit a private party at the cost of the State such an action would be both unreasonable and contrary to public interest The <ORG> therefore cannot for example give a contract or sell or lease out its property for a consideration less than the highest that can be obtained for it unless of course there are other considerations which render it reasonable and in public interest to do so There is nothing paradoxical in imposing legal limits on such authorities by Courts even in contractual matters because the whole conception of unfettered discretion is inappropriate to a public authority who is expected to exercise such powers only for public good According to the appellants the supplemental agreement was entered into by the <ORG> taking into consideration the circumstances then existing which had been examined at the highest level and as such a Court should not examine the discretion exercised by the public authority as a court of appeal because the decision to enter into supplemental agreement also involved a question of policy With that object in view another opportunity was given to <ORG> UDI Sterling through the supplemental agreement to publish the directories for Delhi and Bombay <NAME> has said The doctrine that powers must be exercised reasonably has to be reconciled with the no less important doctrine that the court must not usurp the discretion of the public authority which parliament appointed to take the decision Within the bounds of legal reasonableness is the area in which the deciding authority has genuinely free discretion If it passes those bounds it acts ultra vires The court must therefore resist the temptation to draw the bounds too tightly merely according to its own opinion It must strive to apply an objective standard which leaves to the deciding authority the full range of choices which legislature is presumed to have intended But a public authority may do none of these things unless it acts reasonably and in good faith and upon lawful and relevant grounds of public interest There are many cases in which a public authority has been held to have acted from improper motives or upon irrelevant con siderations or to have failed to take account In this connection reference may be made to the case of Chief Constable of <ORG> <NAME> All ER where it was said that The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure that the authority after according fair treatment reaches on a matter which it is authorized or enjoined by law to decide for itself a conclusion which is correct in the eyes of the court If the contract has been entered into without ignoring the procedure which can be said to be basic in nature and after an objective consideration of different options available taking into account the interest of the <ORG> and the public then <ORG> cannot act as an appellate authority by substituting its opinion in respect of selection made for entering into such contract There were certain forests which were out of access on account of their distance from the roads and no contractor could be found for taking tapping contracts even on the basis of royalty It was pointed out that the blazes were situated in inaccessible areas and in spite of the offers given no bidders were attracted and as such the <ORG> had no option but to allot the said contract on basis of the offer made by the second respondent It was said by this Court But while considering the applicability of Article in such a case we must bear in mind that having regard to the nature of the trade or business the Court would be slow to interfere with the policy laid down by <ORG> for grant of licences for manufacture and sale of liquor But even in that case it was said No one can claim as against the state the right to carry on trade or business in liquor and the <ORG> cannot be compelled to part with its exclusive right or privilege or manufacturing and selling liquor It was said It is to be seen that in the present case no one has come forward alleging that he has been discriminated against and his fundamental right to carry on business had been affected We have it in the record that <ORG> already had <ORG> in Calcutta while <ORG> were making their own private negotiations and arrangements for establishing <ORG> But at the same time it was said On a consideration of the relevant cases cited at the bar the following propositions may be taken as well established Stateowned or public owned property is not to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the executive One of the methods of securing the public interest when it is considered necessary to dispose of a property is to sell the property by public action or by inviting tenders There may be situations where there are compelling reasons necessitating departure from the rule but then the reasons for the departure must be rational and should not be suggestive of discrimination Initially it had been put to the use <ORG> as a cotton and wholesale fruit and vegetable market This Court arrived at the following conclusion In regard to the allegation that the project scheme was tailored to suit respondent alone or that the project as put to tender did not admit of tenders on fixed comparable parameters we find no merit The tenders were such that the tenderer could identify the terms which form the basis of comparative evaluation Tests to be applied in a given case may be influenced by the extent to which a decision is supported by a democratic unanimity which evidences the decision granted of course the power The cases aforesaid on which reliance was placed on behalf of the appellants have also reiterated that once the <ORG> decides to grant any right or privilege to others then there is no escape from the rigour of Article the executive does not have an absolute discretion certain precepts and principles have to be followed the public interest being the paramount consideration compelling reasons which must stand the test on Article of the Constitution departure of the aforesaid rule can be made This <ORG> while upholding the contracts by negotiation in the cases referred to above has impressed as to how in the facts and circumstances of those cases the decisions taken by the <ORG> and the authorities concerned were reasonable rational and in the public interest The decisions taken in those cases by the authorities concerned on judicial scrutiny were held to be free from bias discrimination and under the exigencies of the situation then existing to be just and proper From the statements made in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> before that High Court and from the relevant minutes of <ORG> <ORG> which were produced before <ORG> during the course of the hearing and copies thereof have also been produced by one of the appellants before this Court it appears that the <ORG> in its th meeting held on considered the default made by <ORG> in not publishing the directories in terms of the agreement every year There is no dispute that the <ORG> in its nd meeting held on th August approved the new terms and conditions and took a decision that an extension of the contract be given to <ORG> and <ORG> for printing the issues of directories for Delhi and Bombay So far Bombay is concerned there was no publication for the years and Learned counsel appearing for the appellants did not dispute and contest that by the supplemental agreement the period of contract which had expired in was extended upto for printing the directories for Delhi and Bombay and that the terms and conditions were different There was no justification on the part of the <ORG> to become benevolent by entering into the supplemental agreement with no apparent benefit to the <ORG> without inviting fresh tenders from intending persons to perform the same job for the next five years If such decision is influenced by extraneous considerations which it ought not to have taken into account the ultimate decision is bound to be vitiated even if it is established that such decision had been taken without bias If the supplemental agreement has been executed without following the procedures which are essential in view of the repeated pronouncements of this <ORG> and taking into consideration irrelevant factors then can it be said that decision making process before the supplemental agreement was entered into was consistent with the requirement of Article of the Constitution In such a situation there is no scope for argument that any interference by <ORG> shall amount to an intervention like a court of appeal The appellants also took an objection to the maintainability of the writ application on the ground of delay and laches It was pointed out that supplemental agreement was entered into on th September whereas the Writ Petition was filed before <ORG> on th May although during this period the petitioners had full knowledge about the supplemental agreement It was urged on behalf of the writ petitioners that under the supplemental agreement it was the <ORG> who had been given the right to publish the directories and as such in normal course the advertisement should have been given in the paper on behalf of the <ORG> but only with an ulterior motive the advertisement was published on behalf of the <ORG> It was pointed out on behalf of the the writ petitioners that an affidavit was filed on behalf of the <ORG> before the Madras High <ORG> in connection with another Writ Petition on in which the details of the supplement agreement were disclosed Before we part with the judgment we shall like to strike a note of caution Because of the interim orders passed in such applications the very execution of the contracts are kept in abeyance
