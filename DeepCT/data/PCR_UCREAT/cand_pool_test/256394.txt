The petitioners have been convicted of an offence punishable under Section Penal Code for disobeying an order made by the Sub divisional Magistrate of Barrackpore under Section Criminal The facts which give rise to the prosecution are briefly as follows It is said that communal tension had been aroused in the locality in connexion with a strike After setting out the matters which gave him jurisdiction the Sub divisional Magistrate passed an order under Section That there is no evidence to show that the petitioners had any knowledge of it In my opinion it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the jurisdiction of the Magistrate to make an order and a possible practical difficulty in showing that it has been disobeyed It does not follow that because it is difficult for the <ORG> to secure a conviction that the order itself was made without jurisdiction If we apply the test laid down by the learned Judges in those two Bombay cases it would be very difficult to say where a place ends and an area begins Nor is the matter of much practical importance for example if an area may be said to contain places She Magistrate could pass orders in identical terms and the result would be exactly the same On the second point the learned Deputy Legal Remembrancer conceded that he had no evidence apart from the evidence relating to what took place at the actual meeting There is no distinct evidence as to the relative positions of the petitioners and the <ORG> officer in the crowd We must accordingly accept the contention raised in the second ground that there is no evidence upon which it can be held that the petitioners had any knowledge of the order The rule is accordingly made absolute the convictions and sentences are set aside and the petitioners are discharged from their bail
