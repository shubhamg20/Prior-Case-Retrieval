Similar orders as in annexures and A were passed by the Assistant Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Singhbhum Circle Jamshedpur respondent No in No of and by the Deputy Commissioner of Commercial Taxes Bokaro Circle Bokaro Steel City respondent No in No of as in annexure Before I deal with the question involved in these writ cases it is most pertinent to quote the three notifications referred to in the aforesaid paragraphs In exercise of the powers conferred by Clause a of Sub section of Section of the Bihar Sales Tax Fifth Ordinance Bihar Ordinance No of the Governor of Bihar in supersession of all previous notifications in this regard is pleased to exempt the sale of goods specified in the second column of the Schedule annexed hereto from the levy of sales tax subject to the conditions and restrictions if any set out in the corresponding entry in the third column thereof Notification dated th March on which the submission on behalf of the respondent <ORG> is based as follows Before I quote these notifications it is pertinent to mention that in the Bihar Gazette Extraordinary dated th March there were two notifications dated th March and they are as follows i No In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Sub section of Section of the Bihar Sales Tax Fifth Ordinance Bihar Ordinance No of the Governor of Bihar is pleased to make the following amendments in the Schedule appended to the Government of Bihar Finance Commercial Taxes Department Notification No Bikrikar San dated the th December as amended from time to time namely Amendments In the said Schedule the words excluding atta maida sujji and paddy appearing within bracket in column against serial No shall be substituted by the words excluding atta maida sujji bran and paddy This notification has been marked annexure in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents in No of In exercise of the powers conferred by Clause a of Sub section of Section of the Bihar Sales Tax Fifth Ordinance Bihar Ordinance No of the Governor of Bihar is pleased to make the following amendments in the Schedules appended to the Government of Bihar <ORG> Notification No Bikrikar San dated the th December as amended from time to time namely Amendments This notification has been marked annexure A in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents in No of In exercise of the powers conferred by Sub section of Section of Part I of the Bihar Finance Act Bihar Act No of the Governor of Bihar is pleased to make the following amendments in the Schedule appended to the Government of Bihar Finance Commercial Taxes Department Notification No Bikrikar San dated the th December as amended from time to time namely Amendments The stand taken on behalf of the respondents was that the extent and scope of the words cattle feed was fully explained by Notification No dated th March and no item other than the four items mentioned therein classified for the exemption under entry No of Notification No dated th December as amended by Notification No dated th March Further stand taken on behalf of the respondents was that <ORG> was included in the Notification No for fixing the rate of tax per cent and hence it was submitted that as the rate of tax was fixed by the Notification No issued on the same date i th March <ORG> chokar was exigible to tax under the specific entry made in this regard in that notification The learned counsel for the petitioners submitted that the explanation put by <ORG> by Notification No dated th March only explained the words cattle feed and poultry feed and it neither restricted nor extended the meaning of the words cattle feed and poultry feed What is apparent is that by the subsequent Notification No dated th March only an explanation in serial No of the original notification dated th December was inserted and there was no amendment in column of the original notification dated th December which had exempted cattle feed and poultry feed from the purview of sales tax Thus the significant question to be decided is whether chokar wheat bran was a cattle feed I will take up this question first as this is the main question Learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn my attention to the materials on the record including unambiguous admissions by the authorities of the <ORG> to the effect that chokar was essentially a cattle feed and has referred to various annexures appended to the supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioners of No of Learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn my attention to the averment made by the petitioners to the effect that chokar bran was essentially a cattle feed In order to strengthen the submission further the learned counsel for the petitioners has drawn my attention to a letter dated th October annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioners in No of Sir I am directed to refer to your letter No dated th October on the subject and to say that wheat bran is essentially a cattle feed My attention was also drawn to another letter of <ORG> dated th October annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners My attention was further drawn to another letter annexure of the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners from the Director <ORG> dated th February addressed to the Executive Director of <ORG> The learned counsel for the petitioners while drawing my attention to this letter submitted that the <ORG> New Delhi was an incorporate body of <ORG> and was highly technical body from whom a clarification about wheat bran and their use in India was called for and the reply from them annexure was as follows Wheat Associates Representing Wheat Grower Organizations of the United States Again my attention was drawn to a certificate dated st March annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners granted by the Director in charge <ORG> New Delhi This letter is dated rd February and has been marked as annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners The learned counsel for the petitioners also drew my attention to an affidavit sworn by the proprietor of the firm <ORG> at North Market Road Ranchi which deals mainly in cattle feed It is again pertinent to quote this affidavit annexure to the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners In <ORG> Ranchi That I on behalf of my firm use to purchase wheat bran chokar from various flour mills and sell the same to the customers who purchase it for the purpose of feeding their cattle The learned counsel for the petitioners also referred to two other affidavits i annexures and of the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners which are to the same effect as that of annexure That I on behalf of my firm use to purchase wheat bran chokar from various flour mills and sell the same to the customers who purchase it for the purpose of feeding their cattle That I on behalf of my firm use to purchase wheat bran chokar from various flour mills and sell the same to the customers who purchase it for the purpose of feeding their cattle Whichever way one looks at the matter therefore whether one looks at it from the angle of the etymological meaning of the word in the context in which it is used here along with fodder and concentrates or whether one looks at it from the angle of a person conversant with the industry or trade of live stock farming or poultry raising the words cattle feed and poultry feed cannot any longer be considered as meaning only that conventional food which is necessary for the bare maintenance of cattle or birds as the case may be Such feed must consist of both the elements namely ration for maintenance and ration for production purpose As to what a wheat bran is has been explained in a letter dated th February annexure of the supplementary affidavit filed by the petitioners from the Director <ORG> representing <ORG> at New Delhi which may be referred to in paragraph of the judgment It further held that commodities had to be classified in accordance with their normal use and the words in a notification have to be interpreted as understood in common parlance In my opinion there is no force in this submission This Notification No of th June came into force with effect from st July and as this was not brought on the record by either of the parties a copy of the notification was produced in the court at the time of argument and by this notification in item No of the exemption Notification No of th December the words cattle feed and poultry feed were withdrawn and only four specific items were mentioned There is no substance in this submission of the learned counsel for the respondents Under similar situation as in the present case it was held that even though ice cream and lassi have been made taxable under Section A on account of the notifications issued under Section the turnover of these items could not be included in the net taxable turnover Thus the view taken by the revising authority that the sale of ice cream was not taxable in view of the exemption granted under the notification issued under Section in respect of milk products appears to be correct It was further held that transactions or sales which enjoy exemptions have to be included in the gross turnover but they are exempted when the net turnover is calculated FD CT dated th May issued under Section of the Act Rajasthan Sales Tax Act prescribing the rate of tax on gowar will not have overriding effect on entry of the Schedule appended to the Act which deals with exemption It further held that Section postulates before the rate is made applicable i liable to sales tax It was further held that if however under Section there is also an exemption the question of applying any rate of tax obviously does not arise and where in the notification issued under this section any commodity is included which runs counter to express exemption under Section Section shall prevail over the incidental inclusion of such a commodity under Section which must be taken to be without the necessary sanction The very fact of their nonliability to tax is sufficient to exclude them from the calculation of the gross turnover as well as the net turnover on which sales tax can be levied or imposed I further hold that Notification No issued on th March making bran exigible to tax retrospectively with effect from th December on which much reliance has been placed on behalf of the respondents does not nullify entry No of the exemption notification No has already been referred to above and in that Bench decision of <ORG> it was also held that if once an exemption is granted under Section of the Act in respect of any class of goods or class of persons then unless such exemption is withdrawn it shall remain in force I fully agree with the aforesaid view taken by <ORG> and I hold that if once the exemption is granted in respect of any class of goods then unless such exemption is withdrawn it shall remain in force Having held as such I hold that there is no force in the submission advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents that because of the retroactive notification dated th March No dated th March inferentially and by implication taxed bran by superseding the exemption notification also fails I further hold that as exemption from tax on cattle feed and poultry feed item No of the exemption Notification No of th December was withdrawn only on th June by Notification No which came into force with effect from the st July the exemption notification with regard to cattle feed and poultry feed No Thus though it would bear repetition on th March simultaneously two notifications were published and both were made retrospective from th December one was No by which rate of tax on bran was fixed reference of which has already been made in earlier paragraph and the other being No published in both languages i Hindi and English The learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the explanation to Notification No dated th March published in Hindi was exhaustive and it explains as to what cattle feed and poultry feed were and hence it excluded bran as bran was not included in the four items of the explanation in short the submission was that the explanation limited the categories enumerated therein and as bran was not mentioned therein it cannot be taken to be still under exemption The learned counsel for the petitioners further submitted that there may be some cases in which an explanation can widen the meaning of the expression but in no case it can restrict in the eye of law In order to appreciate the aforesaid submissions advanced on behalf of the parties it would be most pertinent to mention just here that the Notification No published on th June the expressions cattle feed and poultry feed of item No in the exemption Notification No dated th December were dropped and only those four items as mentioned in the explanation to the expression pashuchara tatha kukutchara in the Notification No dated th March were retained It is true that in some cases an explanation can widen the scope of the expression sought to be explained but in such cases effect must be given to the legislative intent and the courts have to find out the true intention of the legislature It is also well settled that even if the explanation is not very happily worded but if the intention of the legislature is clear and unambiguous in that case effect must be given to the legislative intent Reference be made to the case of <NAME> Sales Tax Officer Section III Kanpur reported in AIR SC Reference of this notification has already been made in paragraph above The same case is also reported in AIR SC and by <ORG> it has further been held in that case as follows It is no doubt true that in construing fiscal statutes and in determining the liability of a subject to tax one must have regard to the strict letter of the law and not merely to the spirit of the statute or the substance of the law If the <ORG> satisfies the court that the case falls strictly within the provisions of the law the subject can be taxed If on the other hand the case is not covered within the four corners of the provisions of the taxing statute no tax can be imposed by inference or by analogy or by trying to probe into the intentions of the legislature and by considering what was the substance of the matter We must of necessity therefore have regard to the actual provisions of the Act and the rules made thereunder before we can come to the conclusion that the appellant was liable to assessment as contended by the sales tax authorities It is also well settled that if in construing taxing statutes if two interpretations are possible effect must be given to one that favours the citizen and not to one that imposes a burden on him Even if there was divergence between the two versions i Hindi version of the notification and the English version of the notification by virtue of Article of the Constitution of India referred to above it is the English version that will prevail There is no competition between the two It is also pertinent to quote Clause of Article of the Constitution of India which is as follows Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause of Clause where the Legislature of a State has prescribed any language other than the English language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by the <ORG> or in Ordinances promulgated by the Governor of the State or in any order rule regulation or bye law referred to in paragraph iii of that sub clause a translation of the same in the English language published under the authority of the Governor of the State in the Official Gazette of that State shall be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof in the English language under this article The satisfaction which was recited in the order of detention and on which the order of detention was manifestly and avowedly based was that it was necessary to detain the petitioner with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order There was no reference to the security of the <ORG> in the recital of the satisfaction contained in the order of detention either in Hindi version or in English version Article iii and Clause of Article of the Constitution were not under consideration in the case of <NAME> AIR SC and thus reliance placed by the learned counsel for the respondents on this case in support of his submission was under a misconception There was apparent inconsistency between the amending statute admittedly in Hindi and the English version of that amendment i Section A a of the Bihar State Universities Act as amended in and hence the ratio decided in this case was on the particular facts and circumstances of that case I further hold that even if there was some inconsistency conflict which there is none in the two notifications they did not affect the substance of the matter in the present case and in that view of the matter also it was the notification in English which must prevail under Article iii of the Constitution of India
