This appeal is brought by special leave from the judgment of <ORG> dated May in Letters Patent Appeal No of On May the respondent was reverted from his officiating position of Income tax Officer class II as his work was not considered satisfactory It was contended behalf of the respondent that the order of reversion was made by way of punishment and the provisions of Article of the Constitution were attracted and the procedure contemplated by that article should have been followed The appellants took the matter in appeal under the Letters Patent but the appeal was dismissed on May It was contended by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the respondent that the order of reversion was made by way of punishment and the provisions of Article of the Constitution were attracted It was pointed out that in his demi official letter dated February Mr <NAME> the then Commissioner of Income tax said that the respondent should be reverted because of the large number of complaints which the department had received against the integrity of the respondent and the bad reports received by him from his superiOrs It is well established that a <ORG> servant who is officiating in a post has no right to hold it for all time and the <ORG> servant who is given an officiating post holds it on the implied term that he will have to be reverted if his work was found unsuitable But this protection is only available where the dismissal removal or reduction in rank is sought to be inflicted by way of punishment and not otherwise As pointed out in <NAME> case the two tests applicable in a matter of this description are whether the <ORG> servant has a right to the post or the rank or whether he has been visited with evil consequences and if either of the tests is satisfied it must be held that the <ORG> servant had been punished Further even though misconduct negligence inefficiency or other disqualification may be the motive or the inducing actor which influences the <ORG> to take action under the express or implied terms of the contract of employment or under the statutory rule nevertheless if a right exists under the contract or the rules to terminate the service the motive operating on the mind of the <ORG> is whole irrelevant A I in which the respondent who held substantive post of Inspector of Police and had been officiating as Deputy Superintendent of Police was reverted to his original rank Inspector without being given any opportunity of being heard in respect the reversion Later a departmental enquiry was held behind his back in rest of certain allegations of misconduct made against him in a confidential communication from the District Superintendent of Police to the Deputy Inspector General of Police but these allegations were not proved at the enquiry The Inspector General of Police thereafter wrote to the <ORG> that respondent previous record was not satisfactory and that he had been promoted to officiate as Deputy Superintendent of Police in the expectation that he would turn a new leaf but the complaint made in the confidential memorandum was a clear proof that the respondent was habitually dishonest and did not deserve promotion As the order of reversion was maintained by the <ORG> the respondent filed a suit challenging the order The appeal of the <ORG> was allowed and the suit of the respondent dismissed For these reasons we hold that the judgment of <ORG> dated May should be set aside and the writ petition filed by the respondent should be ordered to be dismissed We accordingly allow the appeal
