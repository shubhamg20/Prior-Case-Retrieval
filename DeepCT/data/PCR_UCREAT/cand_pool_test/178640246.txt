different areas or for different factories or for different kinds of sugar Explanation For the purposes of this sub section producer means a person carrying on the business of manufacturing sugar The provisions containing these are If the Central Government is of opinion that it is necessary so to do for maintaining or increasing the production and supply of an essential commodity it may by order authorise any person hereinafter referred to as an authorized controller to exercise with respect to the whole or any part of any such undertaking engaged in the production and supply of the commodity as may be specified in the order such functions of control as may be provided therein and so long as such order is in force with respect to any undertaking or part thereof a the authorized controller shall exercise his functions in accordance with any instructions given to him by <ORG> so however that he shall not have any power to give any direction inconsistent with the provisions of any enactment or any instrument determining the functions of the persons in charge of the management of the undertaking except in so far as may be specifically provided by the order and the undertaking or part shall be carried on in accordance with any directions given by the authorized controller under the provisions of the order and any person having any functions of management in relation to the undertaking or part shall comply with any such directions An order made under this section shall a in the case of an order of a general nature or affecting a class of persons be notified in the Official Gazette and in the case of an order directed to a specified individual be served on such individual i by delivering or tendering it to that individual or ii if it cannot be so delivered or tendered by affixing it on the outer door or some other conspicuous part of the premises in which that individual lives and a written report thereof shall be prepared and witnessed by two persons living in the neighbourhood Every order made under this section by <ORG> or by any officer or authority of <ORG> shall be laid before both Houses of Parliament as soon as may be after it is made It has also to be remembered that it the mechanism of price control of some essential commodities fails there is under our Constitution with its socialistic orientation and objectives the provision in Article ii for the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise This Article is meant for protecting inter State as well as intra State freedom of trade commerce and intercourse But Article provides Parliament may by law impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest It was however vehemently urged on behalf of the petitioners that the Control Order is assailable for violating Articles and and despite the fact that the Act itself was placed in in the th Schedule of the Constitution Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in Article A none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule for any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of this part and notwithstanding any judgment decree or order of any court or tribunal to the contrary each of the said Acts and Regulations shall subject to the power of any competent <ORG> to repeal or amend it continue in force It is evident that Article protects only Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule from the vice of invalidity for inconsistency with provisions of Part III of the Constitution but not anything done or to be done in future under any of the provisions of any Act so specified such as an order passed under Section of the Act In practice it is the exercise of power which is generally assailed and not the mere conferment of it which raises the somewhat different question of legislative competence But there could be no independent and direct protection of this Schedule conferred upon orders passed under the Act before us just as none could be given to either the amendments of an Act or to regulations passed under the Act which were considered in <ORG> case supra It is alleged that the manufacturers of oil having invested a great deal of capital in mustard oil manufacturing industry and having purchased oil seeds at higher rates than those which have entered into the calculation of the Government in fixing the price of mustard oil for the consumer cannot be made to sell oil into which mustard seed is converted at prices below those at which they could themselves produce oil a Constitution Bench of this Court decided such a question quite rightly in our opinion as follows at of Supp SCR It seems to us that if a statutory rule is within the powers conferred by a section of a statute protected by Article it is difficult to say that the rule must further be scrutinised under Articles etc Rule seems to us to be a rule which does not go beyond the powers conferred under Section xvii read with Section of the Act In that case the rule made under the provisions of the Imposition of Ceiling on Land Holdings Act of was under attack The section under which the rule was made enjoyed the protection of both Articles A and of the Constitution Although we agree that the impugned order is not protected for this reason yet if the section under which it was passed is protected from any attack based on the provisions of Part III of the Constitution the only question which survives is whether the control order is covered by the protected empowering provision The control order therefore enjoys what may be called a derivative protection No further test based on fundamental rights in Chapter III of the Constitution can be applied to it in such a case It is evident that an assessment of either the expediency or necessity of a measure in the light of all the facts and circumstances which have a bearing on the subjects of price fixation is essentially a subjective matter But there is no obligation here to fix the price in such a way as to ensure reasonable profits to the producer or manufacturer It has also to be remembered that the object is to secure equitable distribution and availability at fair prices so that it is the interest of the consumer and not of the producer which is the determining factor in applying any objective tests at any particular time We think that it should not even have been attempted in a case of this kind because the price at which mustard oil was sold commonly in the market not very long ago and the price which prevailed at the time when the control order of th September was passed are matters of common knowledge It seems to us to have done that Students and observers of economic systems tell us that inflation is no problem in socialist countries because the whole economy is so completely controlled that there is no question of a rise in prices They could not claim a right to carry on business or manufacture on their own terms We can take judicial notice of these facts which illustrate the extreme inadvisability of any interference by any court with measures of economic control and planning directed at maximising general welfare We have also heard considerable argument on principles of fair fixation of price which it was submitted must take into account the cost of production as well as a reasonable amount of profit to the manufacturer and the middleman As indicated above such principles apply only in those cases where there is an obligation upon the price fixing authority to take certain matters into account which have a bearing on cost of production and are designed to secure fair share of profits to the producers About other matters there is practically no evidence so that we are left in the region of guesswork It was also observed there In <ORG> case supra this <ORG> said that the concept of fair price fixed under Section takes in all the elements to make it fair for the consumer leaving a reasonable margin of profit to the manufacturer without which no one will engage in any manufacturing activity These observations were made on the basis of the agreement of the parties there that irrespective of technical or legal points the <ORG> should base its judgment on examination of correct and rational principles and should direct deviation from the report of <ORG> appointed by it with the concurrence of the parties only when it is shown that there has been a departure from the established principles or the conclusions of the commission are shown to be demonstrably wrong or erroneous Price fixation is more in the nature of a legislative measure even though it may be based upon objective criteria found in a report or other material It could not therefore give rise to a complaint that a rule of natural justice has not been followed in fixing the price We think that unless by the terms of a particular statute or order price fixation is made a quasi judicial function for specified purposes or cases it is really legislative in character in the type of control order which is now before us because it satisfies the tests of legislation A legislative measure does not concern itself with the facts of an individual case It is meant to lay down a general rule applicable to all persons or objects or transactions of a particular kind or class In the case before us the Control Order applies to sales of mustard oil anywhere in India by any dealer Its validity does not depend on the observance of any procedure to be complied with or particular types of evidence to be taken on any specified matters as conditions precedent to its validity The test of validity is constituted by the nexus shewn between the order passed and the purposes for which it can be passed or in other words by reasonableness judged by possible or probable consequences I may however mention that in Permian Basin Area Rate Cases Ed where the majority of learned judges of <ORG> laid down inter alia with regard to price fixation by a body of experts of <ORG> required to proceed quasi judicially that in order to over turn the <ORG> judgment the petitioners must undertake the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences That was a case in which a <ORG> was charged with a duty to fix rates in accordance with certain principle after taking evidence and hearing parties affected It extends to the whole of India It shall come into force at once This provision lays down If <ORG> is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to do for maintaining or increasing supplies of any essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices or for securing any essential commodity for the defence of India or the efficient conduct of military operations it may by order provide for regulating or prohibiting the production

judges by possible or probably consequences where the majority of learned judges of <ORG> laid down inter alia with regard to price fixation by a body of experts of <ORG> required to proceed quasi judicially that in order to over turn the <ORG> judgment the petitioners must undertake the heavy burden of making a convincing showing that it is invalid because it is unjust and unreasonable in its consequences The Price Control Order was challenged in this Court by several dealers on the ground mainly that it violates Articles and of the Constitution The argument that the Price Control Order offends against the right to property and the right to carry on trade or business requires for its appreciation and decision the awareness that by the th Amendment passed in the Essential Commodities Act was placed in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution as item One of the main contentions of <ORG> in answer to the petitioners challenge to the constitutionality of the Price Control Order is that since the Act by reason of its being placed in the Ninth Schedule is immune from attack on the ground that its provisions violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution the Price Control Order which is but a creature of the Act must enjoy the same immunity Article A of the Constitution saves laws which provide for matters mentioned in Clauses a to thereof from a challenge under Articles or notwithstanding anything contained in Article of the Constitution Article A which was introduced by the Constitution First Amendment Act validates certain Acts and Regulations providing that without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in Article A none of the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule nor any of the provisions thereof shall be deemed to be void or ever to have become void on the ground that such Act Regulation or provision is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by any provisions of Part III On a plain reading of this article it seems to us impossible to accept that the protective umbrella of the Ninth Schedule takes in its everwidening wings not only the Acts and Regulations specified therein but also Orders and Notifications issued under those Acts and Regulations Considering the nature of the subject matter which Article deals with there is in our opinion no justification for extending by judicial interpretation the frontiers of the field which is declared by that article to be immune from challenge on the ground of violation or abridgement of fundamental rights The article affords protection to Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule Therefore whenever a challenge to the constitutionality of a provision of law on the ground that it violates any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III is sought to be repelled by the <ORG> on the plea that the law is placed in the Ninth Schedule the narrow question to which one must address oneself is whether the impugned law is specified in that Schedule On the other hand if the law is not specified in the Ninth Schedule the validity of the challenge has to be examined in order to determine whether the provisions thereof invade in any manner any of the fundamental rights conferred by Part III Extending the benefit of the protection afforded by Article to any action taken under an Act or Regulation which is specified in the Ninth Schedule appears to us to be an unwarranted extension of the provisions contained in Article neither justified by its language nor by the policy or principle underlying it Such an extension takes for granted the supposition that the authorities on whom power is conferred to take appropriate action under a statute will act both within the framework of the statute and within the permissible constitutional limitations a supposition which past experience does not justify and to some extent falsifies In fact the upholding of laws by the application of the theory of derivative immunity is foreign to the scheme of our Constitution and accordingly orders and Notifications issued under Acts and Regulations which are specified in the Ninth Schedule must meet the challenge that they offend against the provisions of Part III of the Constitution In exercise of the power conferred by Section the State Government had issued a Notification fixing the maximum rent payable by tenants of lands situated in the areas specified in the schedule appended to the Notification The validity of that Notification was challenged on the ground that it offended against Article of the Constitution On the second question it was held by the <ORG> that since the Bombay Tenancy Act was placed in the Ninth Schedule the Notification which was issued Under Section of that Act could not be challenged on the ground that it violated Article <NAME> who was in minority did not consider the latter point regarding the validity of the Notification issued Under Section because he took the view that Section suffered from the vice of excessive delegation and was therefore unconstitutional The decision in <NAME> supra contains no reasons beyond the bare statement that if a statutory rule is within the powers conferred by a section of a statute protected by Article it is difficult to say that the rule must further be scrutinised under Articles etc That view was rejected by this <ORG> on the ground that if the protection afforded under Article is extended to amendments made to an Act or Regulation subsequent to its inclusion in the Ninth Schedule the result would be that even those provisions would enjoy the protection which were never scrutinised and could not in the very nature of things have been scrutinised by the prescribed majority vested with the power of amending the Constitution <NAME> who spoke for the <ORG> observed that Article carves out a protected zone that any provision which has the effect of making an inroad into the guarantee of fundamental rights must be construed very strictly and that it is not permissible to the <ORG> to widen the scope of such a provision or to extend the frontiers of the protected zone beyond what is warranted by the language of the provision In the result it was held that the entitlement to protection cannot be extended to provisions which were not included in the Ninth Schedule and that this principle would hold good irrespective of the fact whether the provision in regard to which the protection was sought dealt with new substantive matters or with matters which were merely incidental or ancillary to those already protected But having won the battle on a point of law undoubtedly of public importance the petitioners have to lose the war of price fixation because there is no substance in their grievance that the Price Control Order offends against Articles and As observed earlier there is no reliable data to support this contention and we cannot accept the charge of over inclusiveness for the mere reason that dealers in a certain region have to import their raw material from another region That contention was rejected by this Court but the case is an instance of how a division of the country into separate zones for the purpose of fixing the price of an essential commodity does not offer a commonly acceptable solution In the ultimate analysis the mechanics of price fixation has necessarily to be left to the judgment of the executive and unless it is patent that there is hostile discrimination against a class of operators the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid That takes us to the petitioners contention that the Price Control Order is violative of the petitioners rights under Articles and of the Constitution By this method the petitioners are deprived of their right to acquire and hold their property and carry on their trade or business of extracting manufacturing and selling mustard oil It became necessary to issue the impugned Order in view of the fact that the price of mustard oil was increasing persistently in spite of the fact that the prices of other edible oils were showing a declining trend The fixation of price in these circumstances was necessarily empirical for which purpose the <ORG> took into account prices which were prevailing in the market when the goods were freely available the general level of prices of other edible oils the purchasing power of the consumer and the amount of loss which the industry was able to absorb after it had made huge profits in prosperous years The mustard crop is by and large grown by small farmers who have no staying ability and who in their anxiety to dispose of their produce as quickly as possible after the harvest sell their produce between April and June The fair price of the mustard oil according to the <ORG> could be fixed on the basis of weighted average price or the mean price of the mustard seed We see no reason to doubt the statement contained in the affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> that most of the growers of mustard seed are small agriculturists who have hardly any staying ability and are therefore compelled to sell their produce immediately after the harvesting season that is to say between March and June An argument was repeatedly advanced before us on behalf of the petitioners that it is futile to fix the price of oil without at the same time fixing the ceiling price of the raw material namely the mustard seed Their contention in which we find no substance is that the consequence of the Price Control Order cannot be looked at for the purpose of deciding whether the price of mustard oil was fixed in accordance with legally acceptable principles As observed by <NAME> in <ORG> supra it is enough compliance with the constitutional mandate if the basis adopted for price fixation is not shown to be so patently unreasonable as to be in excess of the power to fix the price The question which arose in that case was as regards the validity of a notification fixing fair prices of cotton yarn It was contended on behalf of the petitioners therein that the price fixed was arbitrary because the fluctuation in the price of cotton was not taken into consideration the price of raw materials the liability for wages and the necessity for ensuring reasonable profit to the trader were not taken into account and above everything else the industry was not ensured a reasonable return on its investment <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> observed In determining the reasonableness of a restriction imposed by law in the field of industry trade or commerce it has to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those who are engaged in these are alleging loss after the imposition of law will not render the law unreasonable Another passage from the judgment of the learned Chief Justice which has an important bearing on the instant case is to the following effect When available stocks go underground and the Government has to step in to control distribution and availability in public interest fixing of price can therefore be only empirical to the effect that <ORG>s of Law cannot be converted into tribunals for relief from the crudities and inequities of complicated experimental economic legislation Cases falling under Sub sections A and of Section of that Act belong to a different category altogether Secondly as regards the escalation clause the <ORG> recorded at page that it was not disputed on behalf of the <ORG> and the Attorney General accepted the position that a proper method should be devised for escalation or de escalation That is the reason why the judgment in <ORG> supra cannot be treated as a precedent and cannot afford any appreciable assistance in the decision of price fixation cases Learned counsel for the petitioners laid great stress on the circumstance that as is shown by the affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> the Price Control Order did not take into account the circumstance that the cost of production of mustard oil includes a fairly large margin of profit of the middleman But property rights are not absolute and important as the right of property may be the right of the public that such rights be regulated in common interest is of greater importance In the words of Justice <NAME> who delivered the opinion of the <ORG> in <NAME> supra The Constitution does not secure to any one liberty to conduct his business in such fashion as to inflict injury upon the public at large or upon any substantial group of the people We are unable to appreciate how if the Government has got the power to fix a fair price of an essential commodity it can be said that they have under a pretext trespassed upon a field which does not properly belong to them To sum up it seems to us impossible to accept the contention of the petitioners that the impugned Price Control Order is an act of hostile discrimination against them or that it violates their right to property or their right to do trade or business The petitioners have taken us into the minutest details of the mechanism of their trade operations and they have attempted to demonstrate in relation thereto that a factor here or a factor there which ought to have been taken into account while fixing the price of mustard oil has been ignored The interest of the producer and the investor is only one of the variables in the constitutional calculus of reasonableness and <ORG>s ought not to interfere so long as the exercise of <ORG>al power to fix fair prices is broadly within a zone of reasonableness If we were to embark upon an examination of the desperate contentions raised before us on behalf of the contending parties we have no doubt that we shall have exceeded our narrow and circumscribed authority Thereby they deprived themselves of an opportunity to show that in actual fact the Order cause them irreparable prejudice
