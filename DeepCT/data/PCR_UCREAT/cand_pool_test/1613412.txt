These contentions before <ORG> having failed it filed a writ petition in <ORG> A Single Judge allowed the writ petition but a Division Bench of <ORG> allowed the appeal of the respondent holding that the production of aluminium cans from aluminium slugs amounted to manufacture and that the aluminium cans could be described as goods for the purposes of the Act The excise duty is an indirect tax in which the burden of the imposition is passed on to the ultimate consumer In that context the expression goods manufactured or produced must refer to articles which are capable of being sold to a consumer The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by certificate granted by <ORG> raises the question whether the manufacture of aluminium cans or torch bodies is liable to excise duty under Entry of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act The appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> for a mandamus directing the excise authorities not to levy and collect excise duty on aluminium cans and to refund the excise duty levied and collected from the appellant on aluminium cans from March A learned Single Judge of <ORG> allowed the writ petition by his judgment and order dated April but on appeal by <ORG> <ORG> of <ORG> reversed the judgment and order of the learned Single Judge and dismissed the writ petition on February The learned Judges were not impressed by the distinction attempted by the appellant and held that the manufacture of the aluminium cans fell under Entry of the First Schedule to the Central Excises and Salt Act which refers to extruded shapes and sections including extruded pipes and tubes The learned Judges pointed out further that even otherwise the aluminium cans would fall under Entry which mentions pipes and tubes other than extruded pipes and tubes and inasmuch as the rate of duty was the same the point raised by the appellant was of no significance The only contention urged by the appellant before us is that the aluminium cans produced by the appellant cannot be described as goods for the purposes of excise duty inasmuch as they are not marketable and are prepared entirely by the appellant for the flashlights manufactured by it It does seem to us that in order to attract excise duty the article manufactured must be capable of sale to a consumer Entry of List I of Schedule VII to the Constitution specifically speaks of duties of excise on tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India and it is now well accepted that excise duty is an indirect tax in which the burden of the imposition is passed on to the ultimate consumer In that context the expression goods manufactured or produced must refer to articles which are capable of being sold to a consumer this Court considered the meaning of the expression goods for the purposes of the Central Excises and Salt Act and observed that to become goods an article must be something which can ordinarily come to the market to be brought and sold a definition which was reiterated by this Court in <ORG> It appears on the facts before us that there are only two manufaturers of flashlights in India the appellant being one of them In the result the appeal is allowed the judgment and order dated February of <ORG> of <ORG> are set aside and the judgment and order dated April of the learned Single Judge of that High Court are restored
