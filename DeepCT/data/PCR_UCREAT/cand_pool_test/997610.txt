The appellant filed a petition before the Returning Officer for recounting of votes but that prayer was not allowed and on the above grounds the appellant filed Election Petition for setting aside the election of the st respondent The st respondent filed counter affidavit denying the allegations in the Election Petition According to the st respondent there was no irregularity or illegality in the counting of votes Four witnesses were examined on the side of the appellant <ORG> held that no details were available as to how many votes were secured by the appellant Election Petitioner and the st respondent after the first round of counting and that the appellant had filed an application for recount before the Returning Officer The Counsel for the st respondent contended that <ORG> should not have ordered re count of votes and there was no foundation in the pleadings raised in the Election Petition It was urged by the Counsel for the st respondent that the Election Petition itself was liable to be dismissed for want of necessary pleadings It was also argued by the counsel for the st respondent that the Commissioner who conducted the recounting wrongly rejected ballot votes cast in favour of the st respondent and according to the Counsel in view of the Proviso to Rule of the Tamil Nadu Panchayat Election Rules the Commissioner should have treated those votes as valid votes even though they did not contain the distinguishing mark of the polling station SCC it was held that the secrecy of the ballot papers cannot be permitted to be tinkered lightly and an order of recount cannot be granted as a matter of course When there was no contemporaneous evidence to show any irregularity or illegality in the counting ordinarily it would not be proper to order re count on the basis of bare allegations in the Election Petition In Para of the said Judgment it was held that in order to obtain re count of votes a proper foundation is required to be laid by the Election Petitioner indicating the precise material on the basis of which it could be urged by him with some substance that there has been either improper reception of invalid votes in favour of the elected candidate or improper rejection of valid votes in favour of the defeated candidate or wrong counting of votes in favour of the elected candidate which had in reality been cast in favour of the defeated candidate In the election the st respondent was declared elected and the petitioner challenged the election on the ground that while counting the Returning Officer had wrongly treated some valid votes cast in favour of the petitioner as invalid votes and certain invalid votes were treated as valid votes which were cast in favour of the st respondent and that the Returning Officer had not permitted the petitioner agents to have scrutiny of the ballot papers at the time of counting On recounting of votes it was found that there was no difference in the number of votes secured by the petitioner but insofar as the st respondent was concerned he had secured only votes as against votes he was originally held to have secured The learned Single Judge allowed the Revision Petition and held that the <ORG> had erred in ordering a recount of the votes when the petitioner had not made out a prima facie case for an order of recount of votes cast This Court held in para of the said Judgment as under Thus the settled position of law is that the justification for an order for examination of ballot papers and recount of votes is not to be derived from hindsight and by the result of the recount of votes The reason for this salutary rule is that the preservation of the secrecy of the ballot is a sacrosanct principle which cannot be lightly or hastily broken unless there is prima facie genuine need for it <ORG> ordered a re count holding that although there was no clear evidence of any irregularity in counting in the first two rounds there was a possibility of the counting staff being completely exhausted in the third round which may have led to erroneous sorting and counting of votes This Court reversed the order passed by <ORG> and after referring to various decisions on this point it was held as under The court would be justified in ordering re count of the ballot papers only where The Election Petition contains an adequate statement of all the material facts on which the allegations of irregularity or illegality in counting are founded On the basis of evidence adduced such allegations are prima facie established affording a good ground for believing that there has been a mistake in counting and The court trying the petition is prima facie satisfied that the making of such an order is imperatively necessary to decide the dispute and to do complete and effectual justice between the parties The allegation was that counting was held in a small hall and there were several tables and chairs and counting agents of all the candidates along with other officials were present in the hall therefore it became very crowded and sorting out of the bundles of the ballot papers was done hastily and therefore it was not possible for the agents of the petitioner to carefully keep track of the process of sorting out and it was alleged that the Returning Officer rejected many votes as invalid in spite of the protest made by the petitioner The result of the analysis of the above cases would show that this <ORG> has consistently taken the view that re count of votes could be ordered very rarely and on specific allegation in the pleadings in the election petition that illegality or irregularity was committed while counting The Counting Officers were counting the votes very fast and they had not shown the ballots to the agents even when they raised objection To justify his contention that there was irregularity or illegality in the counting except making some general and bald allegations no other details are given The appellant Election Petitioner in this case has not stated as to when did he file the application for re count At the time of the evidence also the appellant has not stated as to when did he file the application He deposed that the result of the election was declared at and in all probability the appellant filed an application for re count after the result of the election was declared The absence of signatures under the circumstances could not invalidate the ballot paper which bore the distinguishing mark of the polling station He filed the application for re count before the Returning Officer only after the declaration of result and that was rightly rejected by the Returning Officer When there is error of jurisdiction or flagrant violation of the law laid down by this <ORG> by exercising the revisional powers the court can set aside the order passed by the <ORG> to do justice between the parties We find no merit in the present appeal and the same is dismissed
