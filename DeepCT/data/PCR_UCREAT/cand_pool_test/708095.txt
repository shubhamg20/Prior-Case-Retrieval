Both the appeals involve identical questions of law and facts In the order of termination it is alleged that the appellants were involved in an act of indiscipline at the Amritsar railway station on The order of termination was challenged before <ORG> in the above mentioned civil writ petitions They have no civil rights and therefore the termination of their services on account of the allegations leveled against them cannot be considered to be in violation of law <ORG> has also placed reliance on the observations made by this Court in the case of State of Gujarat Vs <NAME> SCC The learned counsel <NAME> appearing for the appellants apart from others submitted that the appellants being temporary employees working from last to years were entitled to Protection Guaranteed under Article of the Constitution of India before being terminated Reference is made to the decision of this Court in the case of <NAME> Vs Union of India SCR and Divisional Personnel Officer Southern Railway Mysore Vs <NAME> SCR since the appellants are governed by the provisions of Punjab Home Guards Act and Punjab Home Guards and Civil Defence Field Class III Rules their services could not have been terminated without issuing Show Cause Notice and without holding departmental enquiry Alternatively it is contended that the order of termination passed by the respondents is not only stigmatic but the same has been passed as a consequence of an alleged misconduct committed by the appellants at the Railway Station Amritsar on Therefore it is submitted that before any action could have been taken against the appellants they ought to have been afforded a reasonable opportunity of hearing in consonance with the principles of natural justice Alternatively it is contended that the appellants have no civil rights as they are engaged only as volunteers Since the appellants have no civil rights their services could be terminated for the reasons stated in the order of termination The learned senior counsel invites our attention to the extract of Para of Compendium of Instructions on Home Guards issued by <ORG> which authorizes the Commandant General or the Commandant to discharge any Home Guard at any time if in his opinion the services of such Home Guard are no longer required It is also submitted that the appellants are not temporary employees but only volunteers in the <ORG> and they are governed by Punjab Homes Guards Rules and not the Punjab Home Guards and Civil Defence Field Class III Rules In view of the rival contentions canvassed by the learned counsel the first issue which requires our consideration is which is the rule which may be made applicable to the parties to this lis The respondents submit that there is a distinction between the volunteers and members of the service of <ORG> It was argued before us that the Rules were still applicable to the volunteer members of <ORG> and that they are not to be considered as members of the service as mentioned under Rule of the Rules If we were to juxtapose the two corresponding provisions relating to repeal there is a marked difference in the wording of Rule of The Punjab Home Guard Rules and Rule of Punjab Home Guards and Civil Defense Field Class III Service Rules There is no reference to the members of the service There is further evidence for such a distinction in Rule of the Home Guard Act It is relevant to note that there is no such provision empowering the state to recruit volunteers from the public under the scheme of the Punjab Home Guards and Civil Defense Field Class III Service Rules On appointment there is a period of probation as prescribed under Rule during which the work and conduct of the appointee is evaluated The proviso to Rule states that Provided that the total period of probation including extension if any shall not exceed three years Under the Rules a member of the service can be dismissed only after following the procedure prescribed for that purpose under the Punjab Civil Services Punishment and Appeal Rules These observations must be read in the context in which they appear to have been stated To interpret words phrases and provisions of a statute it may become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and not to define Judges interpret statutes they do not interpret judgments They interpret words of statutes their words are not to be interpreted as statutes The court has proceeded to add Circumstantial flexibility one additional or different fact may make a world of difference between conclusions in two cases There is a substantial difference in the circumstances surrounding the lis in <NAME> case and the present case It is therefore necessary to consider whether Order No dated passed by the respondents is one without authority of law and whether the said order suffers from any other legal infirmities It is argued on behalf of the Respondents that the appellants were discharged under Rule of the rules read with para of compendium of instructions on Home Guards The order terminating the services of the appellants specifically cites indiscipline at the Amritsar Railway Station as the cause for the termination Provided that an order of dismissal shall not be passed unless reason of dismissal are recorded in writing and the member concerned has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him It is an admitted position that no such opportunity of hearing or notice was given to the appellants in the present case as is required under Rule In this view of the matter the respondents cannot be permitted to contend that the appellants being volunteers their services could be terminated without complying with the procedure prescribed in the Statutory Rules which speaks of providing an opportunity of hearing to the person who would be affected by the proposed action If it is instance of discharge simplicitor it would necessarily relate to instances where the post has been abolished or where there is a surplus of employees or other similar circumstances However in the instant case the appellants are being discharged from service for indiscipline Therefore as provided in proviso to rule of the rules the appellants should have been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against them Admittedly no such opportunity was given to them Therefore in the facts and circumstances of this case and in the interest of justice we deem it proper to set aside the order of termination passed by the respondents dated and direct the respondents to reinstate the appellants as Home Guards without back wages It is submitted that the appellants without exhausting the appeal remedy provided under rule of rules could not have approached <ORG> under Article of the Constitution inter alia requesting <ORG> to quash the order passed by respondents dated We do not find any merit in their submission for the reason that this issue was not raised nor argued before <ORG> and therefore we will not permit this issue to be raised for the first time before us For the reasons stated we allow these appeals and set aside the impugned judgment We direct the respondents to reinstate the appellants within four weeks time from today without back wages
