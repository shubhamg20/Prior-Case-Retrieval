Shortly before the date of this agreement a suit had been filed by the present second defendant against the present first defendant impleading the present plaintiff as second defendant therein to establish the joint right of that plaintiff with the first defendant to manage this institution The learned District Judge who tried the suit No of held against the joint right claimed by the plaintiff at such arrangements if they are conducive to the interests of smooth administration of the affairs of the trust are really in the nature of schemes framed for the management of the trust and will be binding upon the parties thereto and their representatives till modified either by common consent or in some manner known to law There are no doubt certain clauses which deal with documents to be taken in respect of the transactions of the trust providing that the document should be taken in the first defendant name as trustee It is noteworthy that the right to settle the budget the right to inspect the accounts and the right to decide upon loans or purchases out of the funds of the institution are given to the three jointly and the arrangement is intended to be perpetual so as to be binding upon the descendants of the parties as well It was next argued that if the Court should give effect to the terms of Ex the Court will be compelling the first defendant to run the risk of a breach of trust and reference was made in this connection to Section of the Trusts Act Section no doubt provides for the liability of a trustee who hands over trust funds into the hands of his co trustee without seeing that the terms of the trust are carried out If under the terms of Section the obligation rests upon the first defendant to see that the plaintiff carries out the terms of the trust we see no reason why the first defendant should not see to it Neither of them related to the rights and duties of trustees inter se and in Crosse Glennie Sir Knight Bruce only said that <ORG> need not grant relief in the case because it appeared to the learned Judge that the plaintiff had his remedies at law There is however some force in the appellant contention that the decree as framed by the learned Subordinate Judge may give rise to difficulties as throwing upon the <ORG> the duty of executing every direction contained in Ex We do not think this was really what was intended but to avoid any misapprehension we could modify the terms of the decree as follows to be applied by the plaintiff for the purposes of the trust and the first defendant be restrained by an injunction from interfering with the exercise of the plaintiff right as joint trustee and in accordance with the terms of Ex
