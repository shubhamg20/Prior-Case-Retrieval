This is an application for the issue of a writ of certiorari to quash the order of the Second Judge <ORG> Madras sitting as the appellate authority made by him on th August in A No of setting aside the order of the Rent Controller dated nd August and directing eviction of the petitioner from the premises described as Maharani Talkies Clause To yield up subject to the exceptions and provisos hereunder mentioned the demised premises together with the said fixtures fittings talkie equipment machinery furniture scenery articles and things and additions alterations thereto and to the said buildings whether severable or otherwise and whether they are lessors or lessees fixtures or additions and also all affects which shall be brought upon the said premises in addition thereto or substitution thereof at the expiration or sooner determination of the said term in good and substantial repair and condition and with a full and working stock for the requirements of the cinema and the theatre belonging to the lessors and otherwise in a fit proper and working condition to be used for cinema and theatrical representations proviso If the rent hereby reserved or any part thereof shall remain unpaid for two tenancy months after the same becomes payable whether legally or formally demanded or not or if the lessees shall fail or neglect to perform or observe any of the covenants herein contained and on their part to be performed or observed other than clauses I and supra or if the lessees or either of them shall be adjudged insolvent then and in any of the said eases it shall be lawful for the lessors at any time thereafter to re enter upon the demised premises or any part thereof in the name of the whole and thereupon the demise shall absolutely determine but without prejudice to the right of action of the lessors in respect of any breach of the lessees covenants herein contained and it shall be lawful for the lessors to make and effect such re entry even without the consent of the lessees and without subjecting themselves to any action for trespass or otherwise and without recourse to legal proceedings On the same day they filed an application before the Rent Controller Madras under Section i Madras Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act praying for vacant possession of the said talkies land and buildings The Additional Rent Controller dismissed the application on the ground that there was no default It is not clear how and why he came to that conclusion The main argument addressed on behalf of the lessees was that parties were aware of Madras Act XV of and by this lease they had contracted out of the statute and therefore the application was not maintainable There was an appeal by the lessors The appellate authority approached the case from the standpoint that as eviction was claimed under the said Act Madras Act XV of and not under the general law in accordance with the agreement between the parties the only question to be considered was whether there was a default within the meaning of Section i of the Act As there was clearly such a default he found that the lessees were liable to be evicted He therefore allowed the appeal and set aside the order of the Rent Controller and passed an order for eviction It was nest contended by Mr <NAME> that though clause Sub clause of the lease provided for the payment of the rent of each month before the th of the succeeding month we should take into account the subsequent provision which provides for re entry if the rent remains unpaid for two tenancy months after the same becomes payable The time fixed in the agreement of tenancy for payment of the rent of any month is certainly the th of the succeeding month There is nothing illegal in such a course After giving the question our careful consideration we have come to the conclusion that the provisions of Madras Act xv of would not apply to the lease in question In coming to this conclusion we have been impressed by the fact that the lease was entered into long after the Act had come into force and it must be presumed that the parties knew of its provisions Though most of the provisions of the Act are obviously thus intended to safeguard the rights of tenants there are provisions which so far as they go are in favour of the landlord also Now Section i is one of such provisions which gives a right to the landlord to pray for the eviction of the tenant on default of due pay It is a well established principle of law that every one has a right to waive and to agree to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity which may be dispensed with without infringing any public right or public policy There is no express prohibition against contracting out of it Though we realise that the Act wag passed in accordance with a general policy we cannot say that that policy would be violated if a contract is entered into between a landlord and tenant giving the tenant larger rights and greater privileges than those conferred on him by the Act In the present case though under Section i of the Act the landlord may be entitled to apply for eviction even when there was default in payment of a month rent the lease deed ex pressly provides that it is only if the rent remains unpaid for two tenancy months after the same became payable that the landlord is entitled to re enter upon the demised premises There is no provision in i the Act which has a material bearing on this aspect couched in imperative terms as for ex Mr <NAME> argued that there is no reference to the Act in the lease deed and therefore it cannot be said that they contracted out of it Merely because there was no reference to it we cannot presume that the parties or their legal advisers who evidently prepared the lease were not aware of the Act In this connection we have found the judgment of <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> ch ALL very instructive and applying the test laid down by the learned Judge in that case we cannot say that any ground of public policy compels us to hold that it was not open to the lessor to abridge his right to evict his lessee We have come to the conclusion that the lessors application in this case is not maintainable on other grounds as well In the case before us there is no lease of a mere building or a building with compound and furniture of the sort covered by the definition On behalf of the respondent Mr <NAME> relied strongly on the provision in the deed which splits up the monthly rent and hire of Rs We have no hesitation in holding that this splitting is purely notional and nominal and intended probably for purposes relating to the municipal assessment and other extraneous considerations When we asked Mr <NAME> what would happen in this case when there is an eviction of the lessees from the land and building to the machinery and equipments etc and whether there was any provision in the deed relating to them he confessed that there was no specific provision in the deed Though in that case the learned Judges were dealing with the lease of a factory called <ORG> which consisted of land and buildings including a bungalow used for residential purposes together with plant machinery and moveables contained therein we think the principle of that decision would apply equally to the case before us in which there is a lease not merely of a building but of a cinema theatre with all necessary equipment for the exhibition of films We therefore hold that the appellate authority had no jurisdiction to direct eviction of the petitioners under the provisions of Madras Act XV of
