The tariff so fixed was enhanced by another notification dated September by which came into force on December It was contended on behalf of <ORG> that in the absence of any regulations laying down the principles for fixing the tariff under the two Notifications issued under of the Act were void as they had been issued without any guidance and were therefore arbitrary It only provides that the Grid Tariffs shall be fixed in accordance with any regulations made in this behalf The additional charge of was levied in and <ORG> did not question it before the Court till March when it filed the Writ Petition No satisfactory material has been placed before the Court showing that the charges which were being collected by <ORG> from the consumers were uneconomical and did not satisfy the reasonable standards which should govern the directions issued by <ORG> or the <ORG> from A time to time regarding the tariffs policies of <ORG> The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These two appeals by special leave are filed against the judgment dated August of <ORG> in Special Appeal No of <ORG> <ORG> by <ORG> hereinafter referred to as <ORG> Constituted under the Electricity Supply Act hereinafter referred to as the Act and the <ORG> a local authority hereinafter referred to as <ORG> respectively <NAME> notification dated April issued under section of the Act the tariff payable by <ORG> and other licensees in <ORG> was fixed by <ORG> If the consumer takes supply at a standard voltage above KV a rebate of will be allowed to him by the <ORG> on the total amount of the bill calculated at the rates prescribed for supply at KV It questioned the enhancement made on September on the ground that it had not been permitted to enhance correspondingly the rates chargeable by it to the consumers even though in its vicinity <ORG> itself was supplying electric energy to consumers at a much higher rate The Writ Petition was heard by a Single Judge of <ORG> A tariff to be known as the Grid Tariff shall in accordance with any regulations made in this behalf be fixed from time to time by the <ORG> in respect of each area for which a scheme is in force and tariffs fixed under this section may if the <ORG> thinks fit differ for different areas Without prejudice to the provisions of section the Grid Tariff shall apply to sales of electricity by the <ORG> to licensees where so required under any of the First Second and Third Schedules and shall subject as herein after provided also be applicable to sales of electricity by the <ORG> to licensees in other cases Provided that if in any such other case it appears to the <ORG> that having regard to the extent of the supply required the transmission expenses involved in affording the supply are higher than those allowed in fixing the Grid Tariff the <ORG> may make such additional charges as it considers appropriate The first contention urged before us by <ORG> is that in the absence of any regulations framed by <ORG> under section of the Act regarding the principles governing the fixing of Grid Tariffs it was not open to <ORG> to issue the impugned notifications This contention is based on subsection of section of the Act which provides that a tariff to be known as the Grid Tariff shall in accordance with any regulations made in this behalf be fixed from time to time by <ORG> It only provides that the Grid Tariff shall be in accordance with any regulations made in this behalf That means that if there were any regulations the Grid Tariff should be fixed in accordance with such regulations and nothing more Admittedly no regulations had been framed under section of that Act But until such regulations are framed or directions are given the <ORG> may appoint such officers or servants as may be necessary for the efficient performance of its duties on such terms and conditions as it thinks fit We do not also find any merit in the submission that the Grid Tariff fixed in this case suffered from the vice of arbitrariness There is also no merit in the submission that there cannot be a common tariff for all licensees in an area served by a <ORG> and that there should be a separate rate <ORG> however held that the levy of an additional as an additional charge made by <ORG> under the first para of clause of the impugned notifications dated April and September was illegal and therefore liable to be quashed because according to it the additional charge of could be imposed under the proviso to section of the Act to cover extra expenses only and not for supplying electric ENERGY at a lower voltage of volts when the Grid Tariff had fixed rates for supplying electric energy at volts It also quashed the <ORG> order dated April by which <ORG> was permitted to increase the charges payable by the consumers in some respects and the subsequent action taken on the above basis The above additional charge of was levied in and <ORG> did not question it before the <ORG> till March when it filed the writ petition We are of the view that in cases of this nature where there is little or no possibility of refunding the excess amount collected from the ultimate consumer to him and the granting of the relief to the petitioner would result in his unjust enrichment the <ORG> should not ordinarily direct any refund in exercise of its discretion under Article of the Constitution Moreover in this case <ORG> woke up nearly years after the issue of the first notification and that too only after an enhancement by was made under the second notification In the case of <ORG> which is a local authority there is an additional reason <ORG> has been given directions from time to time by the <ORG> regarding the charges it may collect from the consumers in the light of the charges it has to pay to <ORG> and its own investment and expenditure on the undertaking No satisfactory material is placed before the <ORG> showing that the charges which were being collected by <ORG> from the consumers were uneconomical and did not satisfy the reasonable standards which should govern the directions issued by <ORG> or the <ORG> from time to time regarding the tariffs policies of <ORG> The question is left open by us
