The Board further directed vide the said Circular that the use of the goods in the manufacture of another commodity even within the place premises specified in this behalf by the <ORG> officers in terms of the powers conferred under rule of the Rules would attract duty It held i that section and the rules and as amended were valid ii the retrospective effect allowed by section would be subject to the provisions of sections A and of the <ORG>s and Salt Act the Act iii the yarn produced at an intermediate stage in the mill of the appellants and subjected to the integrated process of weaving into fabrics would be liable to payment of excise duty in view of the amended provisions of the rules and but the sized yarn actually put into the integrated process would not again attract excise duty The appellants then filed this appeal Civil Appeal No of before this <ORG> by certificate Section of the Finance Act giving retrospective effect to the said amendments is also legal and valid The apprehension of the appellants that the amendments to rules and having been made retrospective from the date the rules were framed that is February the appellants may be called upon to pay enormous amounts of duty in respect of the intermediate goods which have come into existence and again consumed in the integrated process of manufacture of another commodity is not right In view of section A of the Finance Act there is no cause for such an apprehension Under Section A the excise authorities cannot recover duties not levied or not paid or short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded beyond the period of six months the proviso to section A not being applicable in the present case Thus though section has given retrospective effect to the amendments of rules and it must be subject to the provision of section A of the Act Section does not contain any non obstante clause nor does it refer to the provision of section A and it is difficult to hold that section overrides the provision of section A <NAME> and Appellant in person in A No of for the Appellants <NAME> Attorney General <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> for the Respondents The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal is directed against the judgment of <ORG> allowing in part only the petition of the appellants under Article of the Constitution of India The appellant No <ORG> has a composite mill wherein it manufactures fabrics of different types In the said circular the Board has directed the subordinate excise authorities that use of goods in manufacture of another commodity even within the place premises that have been specified in this behalf by the <ORG> officers in terms of the powers conferred under rule of the Rules will attract duty It has however been held that the retrospective effect given by section I will be subject to the provisions of sections A and of the Central Excises and Salt Act hereinafter referred to as the Act Further it has been held that the yarn which is produced at an intermediate stage in the mill of the appellants and subjected to the integrated process of weaving the same into fabrics will be liable to payment of excise duty in view of the amended provisions of rules and of the Rules No excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the Collector in this behalf whether for consumption export or manufacture of any other commodity in or outside such place until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed in these Rules or as the Collector may require and except on presentation of an application in the proper form and on obtaining the permission of the proper officer on the form The remaining provisions of rule which are not relevant for our purpose are omitted For the purposes of this rule excisable goods produced cured or manufactured in any place and consumed or utilised i as such or after subjection to any process or processes or ii for the manufacture of any other commodity whether in a continuous process or otherwise in such place or any premises appurtenant thereto specified by the Collector under sub rule shall be deemed to have been removed from such place or premises immediately before such consumption or utilisation It has been already noticed that by section of the Finance Act amendments made to rules and have been given retrospective effect from the date on which the Rules came into force that is to say from February It is not disputed before us that under section of the Act the taxing event is the production or manufacture of the goods in question Indeed section provides that there shall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India and at the rates set forth in the First Schedule There is a distinction between levy and collection of duty A taxing authority will not ordinarily impose such a duty because it is much more convenient administratively to collect the duty as in the case of most of the Excise Act when the commodity leaves the factory for the first time and also because the duty is intended to be an indirect duty which the manufacturer or producer is to pass on to the ultimate consumer which he could not do if the commodity had for example been destroyed in the factory itself It is the fact of manufacture which attracts the duty even though it may be collected later Relying upon the aforesaid observation of <ORG> it has been urged by Mr <NAME> learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants that although it is true that as soon as the commodity is manufactured or produced it is liable to the payment of excise duty the duty will not however be collected unless the commodity leaves the factory Counsel submits that rules and as they stood before they were amended and even the main part of these two rules after amendment indicate in clear terms that so long as the goods which are manufactured in the factory are not removed there is no question of payment of excise duty on the goods Several decisions have been cited on behalf of the appellants to show that <ORG> also have taken the view that removal is the main criterion for the collection of excise duty on the commodity produced or manufactured inside the factory or the place of manufacture We shall presently refer to these decisions It may however be noticed that the decisions are not also uniform on the interpretation of rules and as they stood before amendment We are however really concerned with the interpretation of these two rules after amendment but as much submissions have been made by the parties in the light of the decisions of <ORG> on the interpretation of these two rules we would like to refer to the same The question that came up for consideration of <ORG> was whether there was removal of calcium carbide for the purpose of levy and collection of excise duty In that case the petitioner manufactured Bentol a mixture of Benzene and Toluene in the factory which was again used for the manufacture or rubber <ORG> took the view that it was not a case of removal under rules and and as such no excise duty was payable on Bentol Thus it appears that there is a conflict of opinion in the decisions of <ORG> as to what is meant by the word removal for the purpose of payment of excise duty <NAME> Apart from the above two views there is a third view which has A also been expressed by <ORG> namely that if an intermediate product is obtained in an integrated process of manufacture of a commodity there is no removal and therefore such intermediate product although known to the market and comes under a particular tariff item yet as there is no removal there will be no question of payment of excise duty on such intermediate product It has been observed that an intermediate product which by itself is goods known to the market and is used in captive consumption for bringing out altogether a new goods not by an integrated process but by a distinct and separate process is liable to excise duty before its removal It is manifestly clear from rule that it contemplates not only removal from the place where the excisable goods are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto but also removal within such place or premises for captive consumption or home consumption as it is called The decisions which have taken the view that if a commodity manufactured within the factory in one plant is transferred to another plant for the purpose of production of another commodity will be removal for the purpose of payment of excise duty are in our opinion correct It must be admitted that prima facie rule does not show that it also covers a case of integrated continuous and uninterrupted process of manufacture producing a commodity at an intermediate stage which again is utilised in such continuous process for the manufacture of the end product The learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of <ORG> submits that rule and rule also envisaged such a case of integrated process of manufacture of the end product using a product produced at an intermediate stage In support of his contention he has placed reliance on an unreported decision of <ORG> in Misc Reliance has been placed by the learned Judge on the Explanation to rule A as added by the said Notification dated May Reliance has also been placed on rule which provides for the procedure to be followed by an assessee who is a manufacturer of matches or cigarettes or cheroots From the above provisions of the Explanation to rule A and the proviso to rule the learned Judge has taken the view that a continuous or integrated process of manufacture has come to be contemplated by the scheme of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder for the first time only in May the scheme having been brought into force with effect from June and prior thereto such a continuous or integrated manufacturing process was never contemplated by the Act or the Rules It may be that the concept of continuous or integrated process of manufacture has been recognised in the Explanation to sub rule of rule A and in the proviso to rule but we do not think that rule or rule should be interpreted in the light of provisions of the Explanation to sub rule of rule A or the proviso to rule Moreover we are not concerned with the interpretation of rule and rule as they stood before the amendment Before we proceed to consider the contentions made on behalf of the parties it may be stated that in view of the divergence of judicial opinions as to the interpretation of rules and before they were amended the Explanations to rules and have been added so as to obviate any doubt The Explanations to rule and rule inter alia provide that commodity obtained at an intermediate stage of manufacture in a continuous process shall be deemed to have been removed from such place or premises as mentioned in sub rule of rule This deeming provision has been given retrospective effect by virtue of section of the Finance Act It is urged by Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the appellants that the amended rule and rule are arbitrary and unreasonable inasmuch as the goods which in fact are not removed from the factory and which are incapable of removal because of the nature and construction of the plant or the nature and character of the manufacturing process are fictionally treated as having been removed It is submitted that as a result of the amendment of these rules the appellants are exposed to excessive hardship for not complying with the statutory provisions In view of the length of the retrospective operation of the amendments namely years from the date of the commencement of the Act that is February the appellants would be called upon to pay enormous amount of duty in respect of the entire quantity of goods which have come into existence and have been captively consumed within the factory premises The appellants will not however be able to pass on this burden to consumers and will have to bear the same themselves It is submitted that in view of the arbitrariness and unreasonableness of the amendments and the hardships that will be caused to the appellants and other manufacturers of excisable goods the amendments should be struck down as violative of the provisions of Article and Article of the Constitution of India The apprehension of the appellants is that the amendments to rules and having been made retrospective from the date the Rules were framed that is from February the appellants and others similarly situated may be called upon to pay enormous amounts of duty in respect of intermediate goods which have come into existence and again consumed in the integrated process of manufacture of another commodity There can be no doubt that if one has to pay duty with retrospective effect from it would really cause great hardship but in our opinion in view of section I IA of the Act there is no cause for such apprehension When any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded a Central Excise officer may within six months from the relevant date serve notice on the person chargeable with the duty which has not been levied or paid or which has been short levied or short paid or to whom the refund has erroneously been made requiring him to show cause why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice Provided that where any duty of excise has not been levied or paid or has been short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded by reason of fraud collusion or any wilful misstatement or suppression of facts or contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or of the rules made thereunder with intent to evade payment of duty by such person or his agent the provisions of this sub section shall have effect as if for the words six months the words five years were substituted Where the service of the notice is stayed by an order of a court the period of such stay shall be excluded in computing the aforesaid period of six months or five years as the case may be Under section A I the excise authorities cannot recover duties not levied or not paid or short levied or short paid or erroneously refunded beyond the period of six months the proviso to section IA not being applicable in the present case Thus although section of the Finance Act has given retrospective effect to the amendments of rules and yet it must be subject to the provision of section A of the Act We are unable to accept the contention of the learned Attorney General that as section has made the amendments retrospective in operation since February it should be held that it overrides the provision of section A In the circumstances it is difficult to hold that section overrides the provision of section IA It is however contended by the learned Attorney General that as the law was amended for the first time on February the cause of action for the excise authorities to demand excise duty in terms of the amended provision arose on that day that is on February and accordingly the authorities are entitled to make such demand with retrospective effect beyond the period of six months There is no provision in the Act or in the Rules enabling the excise authorities to make any demand beyond the periods mentioned in section A of the Act on the ground of the accrual of cause of action In our view section I does not in any manner affect the provision of section A of the Act In the absence of any specific provision overriding section IA it will be consistent with rules of harmonious construction to hold that section of the Finance Act in so far as it gives retrospective effect to the amendments made to rules and of the rules is subject to the provision of section A In the circumstances there is no question of the amended provision of rule and rule being arbitrary unreasonable or violative of the provision of Article and Article of the Constitution of India We may now deal with the challenge made to the retrospective operation of amendments of rules and on another ground In order to appreciate the ground of such challenge we may once more refer to section of the Finance Act It is accordingly submitted on behalf of the appellants that the amendment of these two rules with retrospective effect is arbitrary and unreasonable and should be struck down as violative of Article of the Constitution Our attention has been drawn on behalf of the appellants to clause of sub section of section of the Act which defines place of removal as follows Sub section For the purpose of this section a place of removal means i a factory or any other place or premises of production or manufacture of the excisable goods or ii a warehouse or any other place or premises wherein the excisable goods have been permitted to be deposited without payment of duty from where such goods are removed It is submitted on behalf of the appellants that the Explanations to rule and rule are ultra vires the provision of clause of sub section of section of the Act inasmuch as place of removal as defined therein does not contemplate any deemed removal but a physical and actual removal of the goods from a factory or any other place or premises of production or manufacture or a warehouse etc Under the definition place of removal may be a factory or any other place or premises of production or manufacture of the excisable goods etc The Explanation to rules and do not contain any definition of place of removal but provide that excisable goods produced or manufactured in any place or premises at an intermediate stage and consumed or utilised for the manufacture of another commodity in a continuous process shall be deemed to have been removed from such place or premises immediately before such consumption or utilization Therefore in view of the deeming provisions under Explanations to rules and although the goods which are produced or manufactured at an intermediate stage and thereafter consumed or utilised in the integrated process for the manufacture of another commodity is not actually removed shall be construed and regarded as removed It has been already noticed that the taxing event under section of the Act is the production or manufacture of goods and not removal The Explanations to rules and contemplate the collection of duty levied on the production of a commodity at an intermediate stage of an integrated process of manufacture of another commodity by deeming such production or manufacture of the commodity at an intermediate stage to be removal from such place or premises of manufacture The deeming provisions are quite consistent with section of the Act As observed by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra there is in theory nothing to prevent the central legislature from imposing a duty of excise on a commodity as soon as it comes into existence no matter what happens to it after wards whether it be sold consumed or destroyed or given away There is therefore nothing unreasonable in the deeming provision and as discussed above it is quite in conformity with the provision of section of the Act The contention that the amendments to rules and are ultra vires clause of sub section of section of the Act is without substance and is overruled It is next contended on behalf of the appellants that even assuming that there can be fictional removal as provided in the Explanation to rules and there cannot be such fictional or deemed removal without the specification of the place where the excisable goods are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto Rule inter alia provides that no excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the Collector in this behalf until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid The Explanations to rules and refer to the specification that has been made by the Collector under sub rule of rule It is submitted on behalf of the appellants that as no specification has been made by the Collector of such place or premises appurtenant thereto the provision of deemed removal with regard to the commodity produced at the intermediate stage and consumed or utilised in the continuous process of manufacture of the end product is inapplicable It is contended that so long as such specification is not made by the Collector of the place of manufacture or of any premises appurenant thereto the provision of deemed removal as contained in the Explanations to rule and cannot be given effect to It is true that under rule there is a provision for specification by the Collector but the question is what has to be specified by the Collector The words which may be specified by the Collector in this behalf occurring in rule of the Rules do not qualify the words any place where they are produced cured or manufactured but relate to or qualify the words any premises appurtenant thereto In other words if the place of removal is not the place where the goods are produced cured or manufactured but any premises appurtenant to such place in that case the Collector has to specify such premises for the purpose of collection of excise duty Indeed it has been observed in that case that the rule of construction by reference to contemporanea exposito is a well established rule for interpreting a statute by reference to the exposition it has received from contemporary authority though it must give way where the language of the statute is plain and unambiguous Further it has been observed that in a modern progressive society it would be unreasonable to confine the intention of a <ORG> to the meaning attributable to the word used at the time the law was made and unless a contrary intention appears an interpretation should be given to the words used to take in new facts and situations if the words are capable of comprehending them Further section of this Finance Act giving retrospective effect to the said amendments is also legal and valid
