Hence a writ petition was filed by the petitioner seeking the issuance of a writ restraining the Assistant Collector <ORG> and the Superintendent <ORG> Indore from taking any further action on the show cause notices Annexures and being illegal and without jurisdiction The petitioner <ORG> manufactures an Ayurvedic product at their factory at Niran janpur Firstly it has been contended by the petitioners that the classification list was finally approved on after due enquiry under sub rule of Rule Secondly it has been stated that the classification list once approved finally cannot be received because the approval of the classification is a quasi judicial function and there is no power of review under the Act Thirdly it has been stated that Section A applies to recovery of duty not paid not levied or short paid short levied and not to change a classification list It has also been stated that in many medical syrups which are known and treated as medicines the glucose base is over per cent and still they are treated as medicines It has also been stated that the show cause notice is barred by limitation as Annexure to Annexure clearly show that there was full disclosure of all the facts by the petitioners The petition was resisted on the ground that the petitioners have used liquid glucose in the manufacture of their product SWAD from the very beginning but there is no mention of this in the ingredients either in their said drug licence or on the wrapper of the product No of has also been opposed on the aforesaid grounds and it has been stated by the respondents in that petition that they have filed detailed replies in No of and those facts may be treated as reply in this petition also along with the annexures A reply to the rejoinder was filed by the respondents wherein the order of the Drug Controller dated was challenged by <ORG> being faulty erroneous biased and void abinitio The petitioner gave further clarification on wherein it has been stated that Dr <NAME> is an Expert under the Rules framed under the Cosmetics Act and the respondents have no jurisdiction to criticise the order of the Drug Controller In view of the aforesaid contention of both the parties the first and crucial point which arises for determination is whether the tablet SWAD can be classified as an Ayurvedic medicine or a confectionery We may refer to the latest <ORG> authority wherein it has been held that although an alternative remedy may be available for challenging the impugned order by referring the question under the statutory provision to the appropriate authority but it is well established that an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to the maintainability of a writ petition When an authority has acted wholly without jurisdiction <ORG> should not refuse to exercise its jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution on the ground of existence of an alternative remedy In the same case it is also held that if an inferior <ORG> or <ORG> of first instance acts wholly without jurisdiction or patently in excess of jurisdiction or manifestly conducts proceedings before it in a manner contrary to rules of natural justice and accepted rules of procedure and which offends superior <ORG> sense of fair play the Superior <ORG> may exercise its powers to issue prerogative writ of certiorari to correct the error of the <ORG> or <ORG> of first instance even if an appeal to another inferior <ORG> or <ORG> was available The crucial point which falls for consideration is whether the product SWAD is an Ayurvedic preparation or a confectionery in view of the facts and circumstances of the case Therefore the respondent No gave a notice on to the petitioner stating that sugar syrup prepared during the course of manufacture is classifiable under sub heading A reply was given by the petitioner to this notice on that Sugar Syrup is not excisable The Drug Controller after holding the enquiry vide Annexure passed on order in favour of the petitioner discharging the notice wherein it held that the medicine is an Ayurvedic preparation despite the presence of liquid glucose and the variation in the weight and the ratio of the glucose and the active ingredient would not change the nature of the medicine In the light of the above arguments let us first see the relevant judgments relied on the points raised before us In the aforesaid judgment the certificate of the socalled Expert Dr <NAME> was considered and it was found that the information was based on the opinion of Dr <NAME> but it was not clear before the <ORG> as to who this Dr <NAME> is and what information is supplied to Dr <NAME> Therefore after considering all the facts and circumstances of the case and the contents of the product the <ORG> was of the view that the above said product could not be treated as an Ayurvedic medicine but can be classified as a sugar confectionery as it has a cooling and soothing effect on the throat as described in the literature Trade meaning or commercial nomenclature would be applicable if a particular product description occurs by itself in a tariff entry and there is no conflict between the tariff entry and any other entry requiring to reconcile and harmonise that tariff entry with any other entry In the same judgment <ORG> has held that although it is the settled position of law that the words used in Taxing Statute have to be understood in the common parlance or commercial parlance but such a trade understanding or commercial nomenclature can be given only in cases where the word in the Tariff Entry has not been used in a scientific or technical sense and where there is no conflict between the words used in the Tariff Entry and any other entry in the Tariff Schedule The Act makes it abundantly clear that only those drugs which are manufactured under a valid licence issued under the Act and in compliance with its provisions can be lawfully sold exhibited for sale or distributed Therefore the true and real meaning which a drug has in the trade or in commerce is the meaning given to it in the Drugs and Cosmetics Act In this case <ORG> has also taken the view that the order of the Assessment Officer has to stand or fall on its own grounds and cannot be supplemented by affidavits There is not an iota of evidence to show that this product is sold as a confectionery and is commonly used as a confectionery by the consumers The formula so prepared with the aid of the aforesaid text books was patented and an application to <ORG> for obtaining the license for manufacture of this drug was made which was granted to them There is absence of dosage in the wrapper Therefore a show cause notice was issued under Section a of the Cosmetics Act and the Rules by the Drug Controller to the petitioner and a copy of the test laboratory report was also sent with the show cause notice The liquid glucose is used as preservative and binding agent like other medicines just to preserve the properties of the drug and in general practise there is no need to mention about the preservatives and binding agents It cannot be brushed aside lightly only because there is an averment that it is a confectionery The deviations in the preparation as pointed out by <ORG> were dealt with and considered by <ORG> Government of and there is no contrary opinion of any Ayurvedic Expert to hold that the product is simply a confectionery and not a Ayurvedic product Even in <ORG> case supra decided by the <ORG> on which much reliance is placed by the learned counsel for <ORG> the <ORG> has considered the Expert opinion and thereafter gave a finding that the expert opinion is of no avail to the manufacture in that case because the opinion of Dr <NAME> was a second hand information and the qualifications of Dr <NAME> were also not known to ascertain whether he was an Expert or not coupled with the fact that there was no clinical test of the product It has already been held above that there is no evidence on record that in common parlance the product is known as a confectionery Food and Drugs in favour of the petitioner discharging the notice issued to them have filed a rejoinder wherein it has been stated that the opinion of the Director is erroneous and should not be acted upon
