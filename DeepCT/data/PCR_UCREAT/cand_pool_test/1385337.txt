The appellant contends that in view of the statutory provision contained in this behalf in clause of sub section of section of the Act as it stood on the date of accident no award in excess of the statutory liability of Rs could have been made against the appellant In view of sub section of section of the Act no Insurer to whom the notice referred to in sub section thereof has been given is entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in sub section thereof otherwise than in the manner provided for in sub section On this basis it is urged that the appellant was not entitled to assert that its liability was confined to Rs only inasmuch as this is not one of the defences specified in sub section of section of the Act A perusal of the policy indicates that the liability undertaken with regard to the death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle has been confined to such amount as is necessary to meet the requirements of the Motor Vehicle Act which was at the relevant time Rs only The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> This appeal by special leave has been filed by <ORG> New Delhi against a judgment of <ORG> in an appeal under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act hereinafter referred to as the Act <NAME> Respondent No was on th June driving a threewheeler scooter when he met with an accident with bus No DLP <NAME> driven by <NAME> Respondent No and owned by One lac which is the amount of compensation awarded to the claimants It has been urged by the learned counsel for the appellant that in view of the statutory provision contained in this behalf in clause of sub section of Section of the Act as it stood on the date of accident namely th June which happens to be prior to nd March the date of commencement of Amending Act of no award in excess of Rs could have been made against the appellant Clause of sub section of Section of the Act as it stood at the relevant time reads as under Subject to the proviso to sub section a policy of insurance shall cover any liability incurred in respect of any one accident up to the following limits namely a Where the vehicle is a vehicle in which passengers are carried for hire or reward or by reason of or in pursuance of a contract of employment in respect of persons other than passengers carried for hire or reward a limit of twenty thousand rupees and in respect of passengers a limit of twenty thousand rupees in all and four thousand rupees in respect of an individual passenger if the vehicle is registered to carry not more than six passengers excluding the driver or two thousand rupees in respect of an individual passenger if the vehicle is registered to carry more than six passengers excluding the driver On the plain language of the aforesaid clause which applies to the instant case it is apparent that the liability of the appellant could not be in excess of Rs Learned counsel for the respondents however urged that notwithstanding the provision contained in this behalf in clause aforesaid it was open to the insurer to take a policy covering a higher risk than contemplated by the aforesaid clause and consequently the said clause had to be read subject to the terms of the policy which was taken in the instant case Our attention was invited by learned counsel for the respondents to the circumstance that at the right hand corner on the top of page of the policy the words COMMERCIAL VEHICLE COMPREHENSIVE were printed On this basis and on the basis that the premium paid was higher than the premium of an act only policy it was urged by the learned counsel for the respondents that the liability of the appellant was unlimited and not confined to Rs only Such insurance entitles the owner to claim reimbursement of the entire amount of loss or damage suffered up to the estimated value of the vehicle calculated according to the rules and regulations framed in this behalf Subject to the Limits of Liability the Company will indemnify the insured against all sums including claimant cost and expenses which the insured shall become legally liable to pay in respect of i death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use including the loading and or unloading of the Motor Vehicle The limits of liability are indicated as hereinbelow Limits of Liability Limit of the amount of the Company Such amount as is necessary liability under Section II in to meet the requirements of respect of any one accidentthe Motor Vehicle Act Limit of the amount of the Company liability under Section II in respect of any one claim or series of claims arising out of one event Rs The premium paid on the other hand is shown as below Premium Rs Add on I Rs Add for Pass of Rs Rs Add for Driver Conductor Rs A perusal of the policy therefore indicates that the liability undertaken with regard to the death or bodily injury to any person caused by or arising out of the use including the loading and or un loading of the motor vehicle falling under Section II i has been confined to such amount as is necessary to meet the requirements of the Motor Vehicle Act The details of the premium also indicate that no additional premium with regard to a case falling under Section II i was paid by the owner of the vehicle to the insurance company It is only the vehicle which was comprehensively insured the insured estimate of value including accessories I thereof having been shown as Rs In this view of the matter the submission made by learned counsel for the respondents that the appellant had in the instant case undertaken an unlimited liability does not obviously have any substance On this basis it was urged that the appellant was not entitled to assert that its liability was confined to Rs only inasmuch as this is not one of the defences specified in sub section of Section of the Act
