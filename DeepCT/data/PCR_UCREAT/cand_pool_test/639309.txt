There was also on a glass door of the cupboard an impression of the palm of a hand but that has not been identified The peculiarity of the case is that there is absolutely no evidence to connect the accused with either of the offences except the evidence of the fingerprints The witness also stated with reference to the right thumb impression and the impression of the right index finger taken on the occasion of the first offence that there were fifteen points of similarity between the right thumb and seven in respect of the right index finger and the fingerprints of the accused and that it must have been the accused who made the marks found on the scene of the first offence From that evidence it appears that the accused was present in both of these rooms at about the time of the respective offences from which I think that it follows as a necessary inference that he is the person who committed the offences Now it is argued by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the accused that the <ORG> ought not to act on the uncorroborated evidence of fingerprint experts and in support of that contention he has referred us to a good many cases But we have examined the photographs in evidence which give very clear impressions The finger and thumb marks are not smudged and I am satisfied that there are a very large number of points of similarity between the thumb and finger impressions found in the rooms where the offences were committed and in the impressions of the corresponding thumbs and fingers of the accused I think he might have been asked to say how much experience he had had in the way of comparison of fingerprints and how much literature on the subject he had studied As it is I think the evidence here is sufficient to satisfy the <ORG> that the accused must have been present in the two rooms where these offences were committed and as I have said from that it must follow that he was the offender No particular number of witnesses shall be required for the proof of any fact according to the Evidence Act and I take it that the evidence of experts is subject to the same principle It is of course necessary in the case of fingerprint experts as in the case of every other witness whether expert or not that the <ORG> should exercise its own judgment upon the evidence and not merely accept the evidence without consideration and if the evidence of a fingerprint expert is given in such a way that the <ORG> is able to follow it and make up its own mind as to the accuracy of that evidence and as to the accuracy of the opinions given by the expert I can see no reason why it should not be open to the <ORG> to convict solely upon the evidence of that witness
