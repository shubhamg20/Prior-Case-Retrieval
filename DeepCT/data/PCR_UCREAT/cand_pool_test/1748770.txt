This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> in Second Appeal No of where under the concurrent findings of <ORG> and <ORG> have been reversed and the suit for eviction filed by the appellant landlord dismissed The appellant sought the eviction of the respondent on four grounds but the two grounds which found favour with <ORG> and <ORG> are that the respondent had sublet the premises to his brother without the consent of the appellant and secondly the appellant bona fide required the leased portion of the house for use and occupation of the members of his family <ORG> accepted the Commissioner report but held that even if three rooms were available accommodation was not adequate for the appellant because one room was being occupied by him and his wife another room by the married son and his wife and as such there was only one room left for all the three grown up sons of the appellant to occupy and therefore additional accommodation was bona fide required especially if the sons were to get married <ORG> further held that there was no reason to disbelieve the appellant statement that for want of accommodation in the house he was not able to arrange for the marriages of his unmarried sons In so far as the charge of subletting is concerned <ORG> found that on his own admission the respondent had ceased occupying the rooms given to him and he had given the rooms to his brother <NAME> and had shifted his residence elsewhere viz <ORG> therefore found no difficulty in holding that the evidence decisively proved that the appellant had permanently surrendered possession of the leased rooms to his brother and he had no intention of re occupying the portion leased out to him <ORG> after independently assessing the evidence concurred with the findings of <ORG> and dismissed the appeal filed by the respondent In the Second Appeal filed by the respondent <ORG> was fully alive to its limitations to interfere with concurrent findings of fact but nevertheless set aside the findings of the Courts below on the ground they were perverse in character <ORG> has also observed that the evidence on record did not show that there was any prospect of the three sons getting married in the foreseeable future When the members of the family are not having adequate living space for themselves it is futile for <ORG> to expect the appellant to adduce tangible evidence to show that there were imminent prospects of the celebration of the marriages of the three sons <ORG> has taken the view that because <NAME> is the brother of the respondent he will only be a licencee and not a sub tenant There is absolutely no warrant for this reasoning There is therefore no question of the respondent brother being only a licencee and not a sub tenant Apart from this it has also to be pointed out that this is a case where the appellant is occupying a portion of the house and wants possession of the leased portion only by way of additional accommodation The respondent counsel submitted that since no issue has been raised on the question of alternative accommodation being available the appeal may be remanded to <ORG> for evidence being taken and a finding rendered on the question whether the house in Ismail Madan Lane would meet the requirement of the appellant We do not find any merit in this submission Though formally no issue was framed the parties went to trial and adduced evidence with this issue in mind and have drawn the attention of the <ORG> to the existence of another house belonging to the appellant in Ismail Madan Lane and the said house being not vacant There is therefore no need for the appeal being remanded for a finding on the question whether alternate suitable accommodation is available for the appellant However taking into consideration the time factor that will be required by the respondent to find alternate accommodation for his brother he is given time till th June to vacate the premises and hand over vacant possession subject to the condition the respondent files the usual undertaking before this <ORG> on or before agreeing to pay the rent past as well as future and to vacate the premises and deliver vacant possession within the time given and also not to induct anyone else into possession in the leased portion
