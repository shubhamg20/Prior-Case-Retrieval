<ORG> will be advisory body and the <ORG> will take a final decision on the companies to be disinvested and mode of disinvestment on the basis of advice given by <ORG> iii In making its recommendations the <ORG> will also take into consideration the interests of workers employees and others stake holders in the public sector unit According to <ORG> it laid down the broad procedures to be followed for processing the recommendations of <ORG> Clause which contains the Representations Warranties and Covenants of <ORG> is as follows The SP represents and warrants to and covenants with each of the Government and the Company that a it has been duly incorporated or created and is validly subsisting and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction indicated in the preamble to this Agreement it has the corporate power and authority to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement this Agreement has been duly authorised executed and delivered by it and constitutes a valid and binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance with its terms it is not a party to bound or affected by or subject to any indenture mortgage lease agreement instrument charter or by law provision statute regulation judgment decree or law which would be violated contravened breached by or under which default would occur or under which any payment or repayment would be accelerated as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the consummation of any of the transactions provided for in this Agreement This is an adverse civil consequence and therefore they had a right to be heard before and during the process of disinvestment Procedural benefits and rights includes the right to approach <ORG> under Article of the Constitution and this <ORG> under Article of the Constitution in the event of violation of any of their rights He submitted that the workers should have been heard at different stages during the process of disinvestment the manner in which views may be invited and evaluated by the Government the method of evaluation the factors to be taken into consideration and the choice of the strategic partner the terms and conditions under which the strategic partner will take over the employment of the workers and the terms and conditions of the Share Holders Agreement are the stages in which the workers should have been heard and consulted He however contended that the implementation of the policy of disinvestment in the present case has failed to evolve a comprehensive package of socio economic and political reform and to structure the decision making process so as to achieve in a just fair and reasonable manner the ultimate goal of the policy and that the interest of the workers in the industrial sector cannot be undermined and therefore any decision which was likely to affect the interest of the workers and employees as a class as a whole cannot and ought not to be taken to the exclusion of such class lest it may be counter productive The first question therefore which would arise for consideration is whether such a decision is amenable to judicial review and if so within what parameters and to what extent This <ORG> has the power to strike down a law on the ground of want of authority but the <ORG> will not sit in appeal over the policy of the <ORG> in enacting a law Applying the analogy just as the <ORG> does not sit over the policy of the <ORG> in enacting the law similarly it is not for this <ORG> to examine whether the policy of this disinvestment is desirable or not With regard to the question of the locus standi of the workmen who feared large scale retrenchment to challenge the validity of action taken by the Company it was observed at page as follows If a citizen is no more than a wayfarer or officious intervener without any interest or concern beyond what belongs to any one of the million people of this country the door of the court will not be ajar for him I therefore take the view that the present petition would clearly have been permissible under Article Dealing with the power of the Court in considering the validity of policy decision relating to economic matters it was observed at page as follows But while considering the applicability of Article in such a case we must bear in mind that having regard to the nature of the trade or business the <ORG> would be slow to interfere with the policy laid down by <ORG> for grant of licences for manufacture and sale of liquor We pointed out in that case that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech religion etc We observed that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or strait jacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters where having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature In the utilities tax and economic regulation cases there are good reasons for judicial self restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgement The legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility The <ORG> have only the power to destroy not to reconstruct When these are added to the complexity of economic regulation the uncertainty the liability to error the bewildering conflict of the experts and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events self limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability What we said in that case in regard to legislation relating to economic matters must apply equally in regard to executive action in the field of economic activities though the executive decision may not be placed on as high a pedestal as legislative judgement insofar as judicial deference is concerned We must not forget that in complex economic matters every decision is necessarily empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method and therefore its validity cannot be tested on any rigid a priori considerations or on the application of any strait jacket formula It is against the background of these observations and keeping them in mind that we must now proceed to deal with the contention of the petitioners based on Article of the Constitution The question is not whether it is unconventional by the standard of the extant practices but whether there was something in the law rendering it impermissible There is no doubt a degree of public accountability in all governmental enterprises With the expansion of the <ORG> presence in the field of trade and commerce and of the range of economic and commercial enterprises of government and its instrumentalities there is an increasing dimension to governmental concern for stimulating efficiency keeping costs down improved management methods prevention of time and cost overruns in projects balancing of costs against time scales quality control cost benefit ratios etc It is well settled that a public body invested with statutory powers must take care not to exceed or abuse its power It must keep within the limits of the authority committed to it It must act in good faith and it must act reasonably It had been contended that Telecommunications was a sensitive service which should always be within the exclusive domain and control of the Central <ORG> and under no situation should be parted with by way of grant of licence to non government companies and private bodies While rejecting this contention it observed at page that The courts cannot express their opinion as to whether at a particular juncture or under a particular situation prevailing in the country any such national policy should have been adopted or not Privatisation is a fundamental concept underlying the questions about the power to make economic decisions No direction can be given or is expected from the courts unless while implementing such policies there is violation or infringement of any of the constitutional or statutory provision Of course whether there is any legal or constitutional bar in adopting such policy can certainly be examined by the <ORG> After giving our careful consideration to the facts and circumstances of the case and to the submissions made by the learned counsel for the parties it appears to us that the Industrial Policy of which was subsequently revised from time to time cannot be held to be arbitrary and based on no reason whatsoever but founded on mere ipse dixit of the <ORG> Government of The executive authority of the <ORG> must be held to be within its competence to frame a policy for the administration of the <ORG> Dealing with the validity of the new policy the Court observed at page as follows So far as questioning the validity of governmental policy is concerned in our view it is not normally within the domain of any court to weigh the pros and cons of the policy or to scrutinize it and test the degree of its beneficial or equitable disposition for the purpose of varying modifying or annulling it based on howsoever sound and good reasoning except where it is arbitrary or violative of any constitutional statutory or any other provision of law It was held by the majority at page as follows In matters relating to economic issues the <ORG> has while taking a decision right to trial and error as long as both trial and error are bona fide and within limits of authority There is no case made out by the petitioner that the decision to disinvest in <ORG> is in any way capricious arbitrary illegal or uninformed There is no principle of natural justice which requires prior notice and hearing to persons who are generally affected as a class by an economic policy decision of the <ORG> When it chooses to run an industry by forming a company and it becomes its shareholder then under the provisions of the Companies Act as a shareholder it would have a right to transfer its shares When persons seek and get employment with such a company registered under the Companies Act it must be presumed that they accept the right of the directors and the shareholders to conduct the affairs of the company in accordance with law and at the same time they can exercise the right to sell their shares A similar question came up for consideration before Madras <ORG> It was contended on their behalf that in the event of disinvestment being effected the employees of <ORG> would lose valuable rights including the protection of Articles and of the Constitution and a right to approach the <ORG> under Articles and The limitations placed by Article on the <ORG> with regard to employment under the <ORG> is not intended to compel the <ORG> to provide employment under it to all who seek such employment or retain all persons presently in its service in order to enable such persons to claim the benefit of Article The decisions rendered by the civil labour and industrial courts or tribunals are open to challenge before <ORG> and <ORG> in appropriate proceedings The employees have no vested right in the employer company continuing to be a government company or other authority for the purpose of article of the Constitution of India Even though the employees have no right to be heard before the decision to disinvest takes place nevertheless it is the case of the Respondent that the workers had been fully informed about the process of disinvestment through an ongoing dialogue In this connection it is pertinent to note that <ORG> had filed Writ Petition No of against <ORG> before <ORG> in relation to proposed disinvestment wherein the following order was passed on rd August It is stated by Dr <NAME> learned counsel on instructions from Mr <NAME> President of the Petitioner that challenge to the policy of disinvestment in Respondent No company is not pressed Mr <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General states that if any decision relating to the interests of the employees workers is taken by the Respondents two weeks prior notice of the same will be given to the Petitioners The minutes of the meeting with leaders of six trade unions who had taken part in the discussion disclose that in principle <ORG> were not against disinvestment but their interest should be sufficiently safeguarded So far as employees stock options and a lock in period for the investor are concerned there is a provision in the documents pertaining to the proposed strategic sale for giving upto per cent of the equity to employees and for a lock in period of three years It means that unless and until the appropriate Government grants permission the <ORG> management will not be competent to close down any undertaking of the company even after disinvestment Even though the employees of the company may have an interest in seeing as to how the company is managed it will not be possible to accept the contentions that in the process of disinvestment the principles of natural justice would be applicable and that the workers or for that matter any other party having an interest therein would have a right of being heard As a matter of good governance and administration whenever such policy decisions are taken it is desirable that there should be wide range of consultations including considering any representations which may have been filed but there is no provision in law which would require a hearing to be granted before taking a policy decision It was in relation to the winding up proceedings which were pending before a <ORG> that this <ORG> in <ORG> case held that they had a right to be heard No judicial or quasi judicial functions are exercised by the Government when it decides as a matter of policy to disinvest shares in a Public Sector Undertaking While it may be fair and sensible to consult the workers in a situation of change of management there is however in law no such obligation to consult in the process of sale of majority shares in a company The whole process of disinvestment of <ORG> took place over a period of about two years There was nothing to prevent the <ORG> of Chattisgarh at any stage prior to the selection of the strategic partner either to forward its views or a representation or even to make an offer of buying the of the shares which were being sold It has been contended on behalf of the State of Chattisgarh as well as by <NAME> that the process of disinvestment was a flagrant violation deviation of the recommendations of the expert body of <ORG> It was submitted that there was thus gross departure from the recommendations made by the <ORG> and the same was without any valid reason or consideration of overwhelming public interest which has resulted in vitiating the decision making process There is no suggestion that there was any other company or institution which had or could offer more than the said sum When proper procedure has been followed as in this case and an offer is made of a price more than the reserve price then there is no basis for this Court to conclude that the decision of the <ORG> to accept the offer of <ORG> is in any way vitiated It was contended on behalf of the State of Chattisgarh that the land on which industry has been set up was originally tribal land Transfer of immovable property by a member of a Scheduled Tribe a Notwithstanding anything in any enactment rule or law in force in the <ORG> tracts any transfer of immovable property situated in the <ORG> tracts by a person whether or not such person is a member of a Scheduled Tribe shall be absolutely null and void unless such transfer is made in favour of a person who is a member of a Scheduled Tribe or a society registered or deemed to be registered under the Andhra Pradesh Cooperative Societies Act Act of which is composed solely of members of the Scheduled Tribes While interpreting the said Regulation framed by the Governor in exercise of powers under Article read with para of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution this Court held that the words transfer of immovable property While we have strong reservations with regard to the correctness of the majority decision in <NAME> case which has not only interpreted the provisions of aforesaid Section of the A Scheduled Areas Land Transfer Regulation but has also interpreted the provisions of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution the said decision is not applicable in the present case because the law applicable in Madhya Pradesh is not similar or identical to the aforesaid Regulation of Andhra Pradesh Prior to its amendment on th November Sub section of Section reads as follows Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section the right of a Bhumiswami belonging to a tribe which has been declared to be an aboriginal tribe by <ORG> by a notification in that behalf for the whole or a part of the area to which this Code applies shall not be transferred to a person not belonging to such tribe without the permission of a Revenue Officer not below the rank of a Collector given for reasons to be recorded in writing By Section of the Act No of published in the <ORG> on th November the aforesaid sub section of Section was repealed and was substituted by the following provision Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section the right of Bhumiswami belonging to a tribe which has been declared to be an aboriginal tribe by <ORG> by a notification in that behalf for the whole or part of the area to which the Code applies shall i in such areas as are predominately inhabited by aboriginal tribes and from such date as the State Government may by notification specify not be transferred nor it shall be transferable either by way of sale or otherwise or as a consequence of transaction of loan to a person not belonging to such tribe in the area specified in the notification ii in areas other than those specified in the notification under clause i not be transferred or be transferable either by way of sale or otherwise or as a consequence of transaction of loan to a person not belonging to such tribe without the permission of a Revenue Officer not below the rank of Collector given for reasons to be recorded in writing Prior to its amendment a land could be transferred to a non tribal after getting permission of Revenue Officer not below the rank of Collector who is required to give his reasons for granting the permission This was clearly permissible under the provisions of Section as it then stood and it is too late in the day years after the last permission was granted to hold that because of this disinvestment it must be presumed that there is a transfer of land to the non tribal in the year even though the land continues to remain with <ORG> to whom it was originally transferred He contended that he had been closely connected with public sector undertakings and therefore had the locus standi to file the Writ Petition challenging the said disinvestment by filing what he terms as a Public Interest Litigation It will not be incorrect to say that it is primarily the judges who have innovated this type of litigation as there was a dire need for it While PIL initially was invoked mostly in cases connected with the relief to the people and the weaker sections of the society and in areas where there was violation of human rights under Article but with the passage of time petitions have been entertained in other spheres Where the affected persons belong to the disadvantaged sections of society women children bonded labour unorganised labour etc There is in recent years a feeling which is not without any foundation that Public Interest Litigation is now tending to become publicity interest litigation or private interest litigation and has a tendency to be counter productive It was essentially meant to protect basic human rights of the weak and the disadvantaged and was a procedure which was innovated where a public spirited person files a petition in effect on behalf of such persons who on account of poverty helplessness or economic and social disabilities could not approach the <ORG> for relief Therefore there is a need to re emphasize the parameters within which PIL can be resorted to by a Petitioner and entertained by the <ORG> This aspect has come up for consideration before this <ORG> and all we need to do is to recapitulate and re emphasize the same Public Interest Litigation in that case was filed relating to the appointment and transfer of judges and it is in this connection that the question arose with regard to the locus standi of the Petitioner to file the Writ Petition It is for this reason that in public interest litigation litigation undertaken for the purpose of redressing public injury enforcing public duty protecting social collective diffused rights and interests or vindicating public interest any citizen who is acting bona fide and who has sufficient interest has to be accorded standing But we must be careful to see that the member of the public who approaches the court in cases of this kind is acting bona fide and not for personal gain or private profit or political motivation or other oblique consideration It is also necessary for the court to bear in mind that there is a vital distinction between locus standi and justiciability and it is not every default on the part of the <ORG> or a public authority that is justiciable Before we part with this general discussion in regard to locus standi there is one point we would like to emphasise and it is that cases may arise where there is undoubtedly public injury by the act or omission of the <ORG> or a public authority but such act or omission also causes a specific legal injury to an individual or to a specific class or group of individuals It is thus clear that only a person acting bona fide and having sufficient interest in the proceeding of PIL will alone have a locus standi and can approach the court to wipe out the tears of the poor and needy suffering from violation of their fundamental rights but not a person for personal gain or private profit or political motive or any oblique consideration If there is a good reason why the project should not be undertaken then the time to object is at the time when the same is under consideration and before a final decision is taken to undertake the project The same considerations must weigh with the court when interim orders are passed in such petitions Hence the petitioner asking for interim orders in appropriate cases should be asked to provide security for any increase in cost as a result of such delay or any damages suffered by the opposite party in consequence of an interim order When there is a valid law requiring the Government to act in a particular manner the court ought not to without striking down the law give any direction which is not in accordance with law When two or more options or views are possible and after considering them the <ORG> takes a policy decision it is then not the function of the court to go into the matter afresh and in a way sit in appeal over such a policy decision No doubt a person personally aggrieved by any such decision which he regards as illegal can impugn the same in a <ORG> of law but a Public Interest Litigation at the behest of a stranger ought not to be entertained Writ Petition Civil No of This writ petition has been filed under Article of the Constitution by <ORG> challenging various show causes notices issued to them by authorities in the State of Chhattisgarh The petitioners have adequate remedy open to it under the Acts under which the notices had been issued and in appropriate case can approach <ORG> under Article of the Constitution The land was validly given to <ORG> a number of years ago and today it is not open to the State of Chattisgarh to take a summersault and challenge the correctness of it own action Judicial interference by way of PIL is available if there is injury to public because of dereliction of Constitutional or statutory obligations on the part of the government <ORG>s will interfere only if there is a clear violation of Constitutional or statutory provisions or non compliance by the <ORG> with it Constitutional or statutory duties In the case of a policy decision on economic matters the <ORG> should be very circumspect in conducting any enquiry or investigation and must be most reluctant to impugn the judgement of the experts who may have arrived at a conclusion unless the <ORG> is satisfied that there is illegality in the decision itself For the aforesaid reasons stated in this judgment we hold that the disinvestment by the <ORG> in <ORG> was not invalid The parties will however bear their own costs
