A Division Bench of <ORG> referred the question whether gur lauta and raskat and rab salawat are liable to the law of market fee under the Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam of to a Full Beach In the appeals to this <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the appellants that when gur khandsari and shakkar have been added in the definition of agricultural produce rab galawat On behalf of the respondents it was contended that the Full Bench was right in taking the view that molasses are a different product which looses its original character and being a residual article after solidification of the natural article i sugarcane juice it cannot be said to be an agricultural produce that molasses itself being not an agricultural produce gur lauta and raskat prepared from molasses cannot be held to be an agricultural produce It is a well settled rule of interpretation that where the legislature used the words means and includes such definition is to be given a wider meaning and is not exhaustive or restricted to the items contained or included in such definition The meaning of agricultural produce in the above definition is not restricted to any products of agriculture as specified in the Schedule but also includes such items which come into being in processed form and further includes such items which are called as gur rab shakkar khandsari and jaggery Gur lauta or raskat and rab salawat made from sugarcane or from molasses shall fall within the definition of agricultural produce as contained in Section a of the Uttar Pradesh Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam and are exigible to market fee A Division Bench of <ORG> referred the question for being considered by a <ORG> All the above appeals by grant of Special Leave are directed against the Judgment of <ORG> dated as well as the subsequent decisions following <ORG> case The said juice gets thickened by dehydration and when it reaches a particular pigment it takes the form of rab which is a semi solid form of the sugarcane juice After the process of boiling this rab is put in a crystaliser where it is allowed to get cooled and crystals are formed when the same is rotated in the crystaliser The crystalised rab is then put into centrifugal machines in which through the process of infusion of sulphur the sugarcane juice is cleaned and whitened The rab which is not put into the centrifugal machine but is dehydrated and is The rab which is not allowed to be hardened is also sold in semi solid form but those persons who desire to make further profits put the rab into centrifugal machines and by the process of infusion of sulphur they obtain khandsari in the dry powder crystalised form and the waste of rab which is obtained in the liquid form is known as molasses It has been contended on behalf of the appellants that rab galawat and rab salawat are thus nothing but different forms of rab although a little and or more inferior in quality On the other hand it has been contended on behalf of the respon dents that the Full Bench of <ORG> was right in taking the view that molasses are a different product which looses its original character and being a residual article after solidification of the natural article i sugarcane juice it cannot be said to be an agricultural produce We have considered the arguments advanced on behalf It is a well settled rule of interpretation that where the legislature uses the words means and includes such definition is to be given a wider meaning and is not exhaustive or restricted to the items contained or included in such definition Thus the meaning of agricultural produce in the above definition is not restricted to any products of agriculture as specified in the Schedule but also includes such items which come into being in processed form and further includes such items which are called as gur rab shakkar khandsari and jaggery If we look the matter from another angle Krishi Utpadan Adhiniyam is a beneficial legislation both for the agriculturists as well as the traders We find no ground or justification to take the view that the legislature though intended to levy market fee by mandi samities on gur and rab but may have had no intention of charging of market fee on inferior qualities of gur called as gur lauta or raskat and similarly of inferior qualities of rab called rab galawat and rab salawat We do not find any good reason to take the view as contended on behalf of the respondents that the gur lauta or raskat being prepared from the molasses as such these items should not be considered as agricultural produce It has been contended on behalf of the respondents that gur lauta or raskat is not fit for human consumption and the same is utilised for animal consumption as such cannot fall within the definition of gur Even if for arguments sake it may be admitted that the aforementioned inferior quality of gur is not fit for human consumption and is utilised for animal consumption we do not see any reason to hold that on account of such use or consumption the item cannot be held as an agricultural produce within the meaning of its definition in Section a of the Act Thus in our view an kinds of rab and gur made from sugarcane or from molasses shall fall within the definition of rab and gur as contained in Section a of the Act and to render them immune from exploitation as indicated by the prefatory note and by the provisions contained in Section i ii iii iv viii etc The Act has many more objects and a much wider perspective such as development of new market areas efficient collection of data and processing of arrivals in Mandis with a view to enable <ORG> to give substantial economic assistance to establish various markets in Uttar Pradesh as also protection of consumers and even traders from being exploited in the matter of quality weight and price The legislative power to add or include and define a word even artificially apart the definition which is not exhaustive but inclusive neither excludes any item produced in mill or factories nor it confines its width to produce from soil To say therefore that sugar being produced in mill or factories could not be deemed to be agricultural produce is both against the statutory language and judicial interpretation of similar provisions of the Act in statutes of other States Thus we hold that gur lauta or raskat and rab galawat and rab salawat fall within the definition of agricultural produce as contained in Section a of the Act and are exigible to market fee under the Act and the view taken by the Full Bench of <ORG> is not correct In the result we allow all these appeals
