Challenge in these appeals is to the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> accepting the appeal filed by the respondents who were found guilty of offences punishable under Section read with Section of the Indian Penal Code in short the IPC <ORG> held that if on taking overall view of the case right of self defence is made out or looks probable from the evidence on record that right should not be construed narrowly because the right of self defence is a very valuable right and it has a social purpose The dead body was then sent for postmortem examination with constable <NAME> and <NAME> Section IPC provides that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence It merely indicates that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of such right Whether in a particular set of circumstances a person legitimately acted in the exercise of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the facts and circumstances of each case It is for the accused to place necessary material on record either by himself adducing positive evidence or by eliciting necessary facts from the witnesses examined for the prosecution If a person has a right of private defence of body under Section that right extends under Section to causing death if there is reasonable apprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence of the assault The right given under Sections to and to is controlled by Section To claim a right of private defence extending to voluntary causing of death the accused must show that there were circumstances giving rise to reasonable grounds for apprehending that either death or grievous hurt would be caused to him The burden is on the accused to show that he had a right of private defence which extended to causing of death Sections and IPC define the limit and extent of right of private defence Sections and IPC deal with commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of body and property respectively In order to find whether right of private defence is available or not the injuries received by the accused the imminence of threat to his safety the injuries caused by the accused and the circumstances whether the accused had time to have recourse to public authorities are all relevant factors to be considered A right to defend does not include a right to launch an offensive particularly when the need to defend no longer survived If that be so there was no question of exercise of right of private defence From the evidence it is clear that after the accused persons assaulted the deceased and the injured witnesses they were beaten by the villagers In the FIR also there is mention about the beating given by villagers Conviction can be based on the testimony of single witness if he is wholly reliable Undisputedly there were injuries found on the body of the accused persons on medical evidence Merely because there was a quarrel and two accused persons sustained injuries that does not confer a right of private defence extending to the extent of causing death as in this case SCC it was held as follows Non explanation of injuries by the prosecution will not affect prosecution case where injuries sustained by the accused are minor and superficial or where the evidence is so clear and cogent so independent and disinterested so probable consistent and creditworthy that it outweighs the effect of the omission on the part of prosecution to explain the injuries It is for the defence to put questions to the prosecution witnesses regarding the injuries of the accused persons When that is not done there is no occasion for the prosecution witnesses to explain any injury on the person of an accused State of Bihar AIR SC it was observed that the obligation of the prosecution to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in the same occurrence may not arise in each and every case In other words it is not an invariable rule that the prosecution has to explain the injuries sustained by the accused in the same occurrence If the witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution are believed by the <ORG> in proof of guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt question of obligation of prosecution to explain injuries sustained by the accused will not arise When the prosecution comes with a definite case that the offence has been committed by the accused and proves its case beyond any reasonable doubt it becomes hardly necessary for the prosecution to again explain how and under what circumstances injuries have been inflicted on the person of the accused In the case at hand trifle and superficial injuries on accused are of little assistance to them to throw doubt on veracity of prosecution case The appeals are allowed to the aforesaid extent
