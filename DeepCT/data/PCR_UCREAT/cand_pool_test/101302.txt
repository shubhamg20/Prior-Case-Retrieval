HEADNOTE The appellants in execution of a decree passed in their favour for possession over a house obtained possession thereof on July The respondent made an application in <ORG> under ss and Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the ex parte order of delivery and for redelivery of possession of the house to him or in the alternative for an order to the appellants for giving facilities for removing the moveables from the house On appeal by the respondent <ORG> held that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to order the eviction of the respondent because of the provisions of the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order which was in operation on the date of eviction and under ss and of which certain restrictions were placed on the eviction of tenants Held that the Transfer of Property Act came into force only when it was extended by notification dated September under of that Act i from October and therefore the Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order was not repealed as from April when the Part States Laws Act came into force and was in force when the possession was delivered and the question of repugnancy to the Transfer of Property Act Act IV of did not arise in this case Section of the Code of Civil Procedure was applicable to the proceeding out of which this appeal has arisen because the question whether the decree was completely satisfied and therefore the court became functus officio was a matter relating to execution satisfaction and discharge of the decree Sections and of the House Rent Control Order placed restrictions on the power of the <ORG> to execute the decree and ignoring them was not merely an error in the exercise of jurisdiction The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal has little substance and must therefore be dismissed The respondent filed his written statement on March and an additional written statement on November whereby he raised an objection to the jurisdiction of the court by reason of the Mysore House Rent Control Order of On August the respondent made an application in <ORG> the District Judge under ss and of the Code of Civil Procedure for setting aside the ex parte order of delivery and for redelivery of possession of the house to him and in the alternative for an order to the appellants to give facilities to him respondent to remove the various moveables and articles mentioned in the petition <ORG> held that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to order the eviction of the respondent because of the provisions of Mysore House Rent and Accommodation Control Order which was in operation on the date of eviction <ORG> having refused to give a certificate under art the appellants obtained special leave to appeal from this Court on January and this is how the matter has come to this Court The Mysore House Rent Control Order of came into force on November and by of this Act a restriction was imposed on the eviction of tenants and the relevant part of this section was Section A tenant in possession of a house shall not be evicted therefrom whether in execution of a decree or otherwise before or after the termination of the tenancy except in accordance with the provisions of this clause A landlord wishing to evict a tenant in possession shall apply to the Controller for a direction in that behalf If the Controller after giving the tenant a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the application is satisfied This Order was replaced by the Mysore Rent and Accommodation Control Order of which came into force on July The relevant provisions of this Order i ss and which are applicable to the present appeal are as follows Section A tenant in possession of a house shall not be evicted therefrom whether in execution of a decree or otherwise except in accordance with the provisions of this clause A landlord who seeks to evict a tenant in possession shall apply to the Controller for a direction in that behalf If the Controller after giving tenant a suitable opportunity of showing cause against such application is satisfied this Order shall Prevent a landlord from filing a suit for eviction of a tenant before a competent civil court provided that no decree for eviction of a tenant passed by a civil court shall be executed unless a certificate to that effect is obtained from the Controller It was argued on behalf of the appellants before <ORG> and that argument was repeated before us that the Mysore House Rent Control Order of was repugnant to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act Act IV of which was brought into force in the State of Mysore by Part States Laws Act Act III of To test the force of this argument it is necessary to examine the provisions of Part States Laws Act and how and when as a consequence of it the Transfer of Property Act became effective and operative in the State of Mysore Although the question of repugnancy was raised in <ORG> at the time of the hearing of the appeal the true effect of of the Part States Laws Act was not brought to the notice of the learned Judges nor was the Notification placed before them but it was discussed by <ORG> in its order refusing certificate under art The inapplicability of to the proceedings out of which the appeal has arisen was also raised before us but that contention is equally unsubstantial because the question whether the decree was completely satisfied and therefore the court became functus officio is a matter relating to execution satisfaction and discharge of the decree The contention of res judicata was based on the plea taken by the respondent in his written statement dated March where he pleaded that the civil court had no jurisdiction to order eviction because of the House Rent Control Order to which the reply of the appellants was that considering the nature of the suit and the consequential remedy that they were seeking the plea of jurisdiction of the court was not open to the respondent Thereupon the trial court raised a new issue whether this court has jurisdiction to try the suit in view of the House Rent Control Order which was decided against the respondent and a decree in favour of the appellants was passed on August This judgment formed the basis of the argument before us that the plea of in executability of the decree could not be raised because it was barred on the principle of res judicata at the time of the execution of the decree which in the instant case could not be done because the order for delivery by <ORG> was passed without notice to the respondent We must therefore repel the contention based on the ground of res judicata The contention raised that ignoring ss and of the House Rent Control Order is no more than an error in the exercise of jurisdiction does not appear to be sound because those sections are a fetter on the executability of the decree and not merely an error in the exercise of the jurisdiction In the present case the two sections mentioned above were a restriction on the power of the court to execute the decree and therefore this argument must also be rejected
