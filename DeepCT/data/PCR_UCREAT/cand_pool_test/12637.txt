PETITIONER <ORG> <NAME> Vs RESPONDENT COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX <NAME> DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> SUBBARAO SHAH CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC SC SC SC SC SC ACT Indian Income tax Act xv Loan obtained by company Stamp duty and other expenditure incurred in obtaining the loan Whether capital or revenue expenditure Whether laid out for purpose of business The appellant by special leave came to this Court It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the expenditure in question was not incurred to acquire any asset or advantage of an enduring nature it was applied wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the business and was admissible as a deduction under xv i When there is no express prohibition an outgoing by means of which an assessee procures the use of a thing by which it makes a profit is deductible from the receipts of the business to ascertain taxable income In principle apart from any statutory provisions there is no distinction as drawn by the Income tax Officer between interest in respect of a loan and an expenditure incurred for obtaining the loan The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> at Madras answering the following question of law in favour of the respondent Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was right in law in holding that the sum of rupees expended by the assessee in obtaining the loan or any part thereof is an allowable expenditure The facts and circumstances of the case as stated by the <ORG> in the statement of the case are as follows The appellant <ORG> Madras hereinafter referred to as the assessee is a public limited company <ORG> after reviewing various cases observed If we ask for what purpose the expenditure in the present case was incurred the only answer must be that it was incurred for the purpose of bringing into existence an asset in the shape of borrowing these Rs He says that <ORG> was right in preferring the findings of the Income Tax Officer on the ground that there was no material for the finding made by <ORG> and the finding was based on surmises and material evidence was ignored In the alternative he says that the question referred is wide enough to include the question whether there was any material for the finding of <ORG> This was not a case arising under the Indian Income Tax Act but under the Madras Plantations Agricultural Income Tax Act in which a section exactly similar to xv existed In brief the facts in that case were that the assessee had borrowed money for the purpose of purchasing the plantations and he claimed that in computing his agricultural income from these plantations the entire interest paid by him on moneys borrowed for the purpose of purchasing the plantation should be deducted as expenditure under of the Act the Madras Act there was no provision similar to iii of the Act and thus interest was not expressly deductible as an allowance In our opinion there is no justification for drawing this distinction in India It will be remembered that there was no section like iii of the Act in the English Income Tax Act On the other hand there were certain rules prohibiting the deduction in respect of any capital withdrawn from or any sum employed or intended to be employed as capital in such trade These observations show that where there is no express prohibition an outgoing by means of which an assessee procures the use of a thing by which it makes a profit is deductible from the receipts of the business to ascertain taxable income It is true that <ORG> was dealing with the case of a company and the moneys that were borrowed were of a temporary character it appears to me simply amounts to this that the word capital must in this rule be held to bear a wholly artificial meaning differing altogether from the ordinary signification though there be no context in the clause requiring that there should be given to it a meaning different from that which it bears in ordinary commercial transactions He then referred to the decision in <NAME> <ORG> to show that the borrowing by a joint stock company of money by the issue of debentures does not amount to an increasing of the capital of the company The question must be viewed in the larger context of business necessity or expediency If the outgoing or expenditure is so related to the carrying on or conduct of the business that it may be regarded as an integral part of the profit earing process and not for acquisition of an asset or a right of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of the carrying on of the business the expenditure may be regarded as revenue expenditure and lakhs could not be treated as expenditure not in the nature of capital expenditure solely incurred for the purpose of earning the profits of the company business In our opinion if one keeps in mind the background of the English Income Tax Act the observations reproduced above have no relevance to cases arising under the Indian Income Tax Act In our opinion the derision as far as the brokerage was concerned was wrong but we do not say anything in this case with respect to the decision as far as the commission on sale of goods was concerned He placed reliance on a number of cases some of which we have already considered A loan is a liability and has to be repaid and in our opinion it is erroneous to consider a liability as an asset or an advantage within the test laid down by Viscount <NAME> and approved and applied by this <ORG> in many cases <NAME> after referring to a number of cases felt that the raising of capital by issue of debentures was a recognised mode of raising capital and he felt that the decided cases had laid down the proposition that borrowing money by the issue of debentures was an acquisition of capital asset and that any commission or expenditure incurred in respect thereof was of a capital nature and not to be considered as in the nature of revenue He was impressed by the fact that not a single case to the contrary was brought to his notice But we have to decide the case on principle and with respect it seems to us that he erred in treating the loan as equivalent to capital for the purpose of xv of the Act This case in our opinion directly covers the present case although Mr <NAME> suggests that the case of an investment company stands on a different footing from the case of a manufacturing company We may mention that in that case this Court was not considering whether the expenditure was in the nature of a capital expenditure or not because it was agreed all through that the expenditure was not in the nature of capital expenditure and the only question which this Court dealt with was whether the expenditure was incurred solely for the purpose of making or earning income profits or gains It was held in that case that the payment of interest and a sum equivalent to th of the profits of the business of the assessee in pursuance of an agreement for obtaining loan from the lender were in a commercial sense expenditure wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of the assessees business and they were therefore deductible revenue expenditure Before we conclude we must deal with the point raised by Mr <NAME> that <ORG> erred in law in preferring the findings of the Income Tax Officer to that of <ORG> It is not necessary to decide this question but it seems to us that in a reference <ORG> must accept the findings of fact made by <ORG> and it is for the person who has applied for a reference to challenge those findings first by an application under The appeal is allowed the judgment of <ORG> set aside and the question referred answered in the affirmative
