In appeal to this Court HELD i The Wealth Tax Officer was justified in taking the value of the assets of the assessee as shown in its balance sheet on the relevant valuation date Under in the case of an assessee carrying on business the Wealth Tax Officer may determine the net value of the assets of the business as a whole having regard to the balance sheet of the business as on the valuation date and when the assessee himself had shown the net value of the assets at a figure the Officer rightly accepted it ii As on the valuation date nothing further happened than a recommendation by the directors as to the amount that might be distributed as dividend it could not be held that there was any debt owed by the assessee to the share holders on the valuation date The liability to pay the tax is a debt within the meaning of and it arose on the valuation date during the accounting year and therefore was deductible in computing the net wealth of the assessee There is thus a prefected debt at any rate on the last day of the accounting year and not a contingent liability A Per Shah dissenting The liability to pay the tax is not a debt arising on the valuation date and therefore is not deductible in computing the net wealth of the assessee under Therefore the existence on the Statute Book of does not convert what is an inchoate liability on the valuation date into a completed or effective liability to pay tax Hence the liability to pay tax in the present case at the earliest arose on the first day of April but that under the Wealth Tax Act is not the valuation date The liability to pay wealth tax becomes crystallised on the valuation date though the tax is levied for the assessment year and on the valuation date there is normally no completed or effective charge for income tax payable for the assessment year because the liability to tax did not give rise to any obligation to pay a sum of money either determined or determinable in the light of factors existing on that date There is no warrant for the argument that substantially is a definition section which extends for the purposes of the Act their definition of the net wealth of assessees carrying on business The section merely provides machinery in certain special cases for the valuation of assets and it is from the aggregate valuation of assets that the net wealth chargeable to tax may be ascertained Section only contemplates cases where a company not resident in India is carrying on business and it is not possible to make a computation in accordance with cl a because of the absence of a separate balance sheet of the company Appeal from the judgment and order dated May of <ORG> in Wealth Tax Reference No of At the instance of the assessee the following three questions were referred to <ORG> under of the Wealth Tax Act Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the Wealth Tax Officer was justified in taking the value of the assets of the assessee as shown in its Balance Sheet on the relevant valuation date We shall take each of them seriatim for our consideration Notwithstanding anything contained in subsection a where the assessee is carrying on a business for which accounts are maintained by him regularly the Wealth tax Officer may instead of determining separately the value of each asset held by the assessee in such business determine the net value of the assets of the business as a whole having regard to the balance sheet of such business as on the valuation date and making such adjustments therein as the circumstances of the case may require Under this section in the case of an assessee carrying on business the Wealth tax Officer may determine the net value of the assets of the business as a hole having regard to the balance sheet of the business as on the valuation date It was argued that the revaluation was done for other purposes that it did not represent the real value of the assets and that fact was also reflected by the said amount representing the difference being shown as a capital surplus Apart from the a argument raised there is nothing on the record to disclose why the said figure did not represent the correct value of the assets Where he accented the figure shown by the assessee himself he did the right thing and there is nothing to complain about as the amount of dividend proposed to be distributed for the year ending March but the said dividend was declared by the company at its <ORG> only on November Under of the Indian Companies Act there shall be attached to every balance sheet laid before a company in general meeting a report by its board of directors with respect to inter alia the amount if any which it recommends to be paid by way of dividend As on the valuation date nothing further hap pened than a mere recommendation by the directors as to the amount that might be distributed as dividend it is not possible to hold that there was any debt owed by the assessee to the shareholders on the valuation date In that view it answered the third question in the negative The Finance Act came into force on April The question is whether the liability to pay income tax and super tax became a debt owed by the assessee on March or on April if it was a debt on the latter date it could not be deducted from the gross assets of the assesses to arrive at the net wealth if it was on the former date it could be Mr <NAME> argued that the liability to pay tax arose by virtue of the charging section i of the Income tax Act and that it arose not later than the close of the previous year though the quantification of the amount payable was postponed till the Finance Act was passed and that therefore it being a liability in praesenti existing on the valuation date it was a debt owed by the assesses on the said date II previous year means i in respect of any separate source of income profits and gains a the twelve months ending on the st day of March next preceding the year for which the assessment is to be made or if the accounts of the assessee have been made up to a date within the said twelve months in respect of a year ending on any date other than the said st day of March then at the option of the assessee the year ending on the date to which his accounts have been so made up Where any Central Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Act in respect of the total income of the previous year of every individual Hindu undivided family company and local authority and of every firm and other association of persons or the partners of the firm or the members of the association individually If on the st day of April in any year provision has not yet been made by a Central Act for the charging of income tax for that year this Act shall never theless have effect until such provision is so made as if the provision in force in the preceding year or the pro vision proposed in the Bill then before <ORG> whichever is more favourable to the assessee were actually in force Subject to the provisions of sub sections and for the year beginning on the st day of April a income tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the First Schedule and in the cases to which Paragraphs A and of that Part apply shall be increased by a surcharge for purposes of the <ORG> and a special surcharge on unearned income calculated in either case in the manner provided therein and super tax shall for the purposes of section of the Indian Income tax Act XI of hereinafter referred to as the Income tax Act be charged at the rates specified in Part of the First Schedule A gist of the said provisions excluding the controversial points relevant to the assessment under scrutiny may be given thus Under of the Wealth tax Act the net wealth of the assessee was assessable as on the valuation date i March at the rate or rates specified in the Schedule to the said Act On those facts the question is whether the liability of the assessee to pay income tax and super tax arose on the valuation date i March the last day of the accounting year or subsequently during the assessment year i during the period April to March Is there any provision in the Wealth tax Act which compels us to come to a conclusion which is unjust on the face of it The problem presented can satisfactorily be solved by answering two questions namely what does the expression debt owed mean and when does the liability to pay income tax and super tax under the Income tax Act become a debt owed within the meaning of that expression If we ascertain the meaning of the word debt the expression owed does not cause any difficulty The Court held that where a panel doctor had done work under his agreement with the insurance committee and the committee had received funds in respect of medical benefit from <ORG> there was a debt owing or accruing from the insurance committee to the panel doctor which might be attached though the exact share payable to him was not yet ascertained tinguishing those cases on the ground that there was no debt until the verdict of the jury was pronounced assessing the damages and judgment was given <ORG> observed Here there is a debt uncertain in amount which will become certain when the accounts are finally dealt with by <ORG> Therefore there was a debt at the material date though it was not presently payable and the amount was not ascertained This judgment in substance ruled that a present liability to pay an amount in future though it was not ascertained but was ascertainable was a debt liable to attachment It was argued that even if there was a liability on January that liability did not become a debt within the meaning of the Finance No think that in this Act it is used in the proper sense of an ascertained sum and that the contention of the Attorney General is well founded This decision while holding that in the context of the Finance Act of there was no debt until the liability was quantified conceded that the expression debt was wide enough to take in a liability it also did not define the scope of the expression ascertained that is to say whether the said expression would take in amounts ascertainable <ORG> in <ORG> Ford held that money in the hands of a Receiver for debentureholders was not a debt owing or accruing and therefore was not liable to attachment The Court held that there was an existing debt although the payment of the debt was deferred pending the ascertainment of the amount of the charge in favour of the <ORG> This decision also recognized that if there was a liability in praesenti the fact that the amount was to be ascertained did not make it any the less a debt architect certificate was just as much a necessity for investing a cause of action in sub contractors as it was in the main contracts and the judgment debtors had no right to be paid and therefore there was no debt until the architect had certified the amount to be paid for the work ordered by the <NAME> Strong reliance was placed on this decision in support of the con tention of the <ORG> that there could not be a debt if the ascertainment of the debt depended upon a certificate to be issued by a third party The principle of the matter is well put in the Annual Practice at thus But the distinction must be borne in mind between the case where there is an existing debt payment whereof is deferred and a case where both the debt and its payment rest in the future If for instance a sum of money is payable on the happening of a contingency there is no debt owing or accruing But the mere fact that the amount is not ascertained does not show that there is no debt We shall now notice some of the decisions of the Indian Courts on this aspect <NAME> Officiating said It is quite clear that this is not a debt for there was at the time of the death no present obligation to pay a liquidated sum of money there is no certainty it may turn out that there is nothing due to the plaintiff If we wish to distinguish between the two we say of the former that it is a debt owing and of the latter that it is a debt due amount which may be found due by an arbitrator on taking accounts between the parties is not a promise to pay a debt within the meaning of of the Indian Contract Act the amount not being a liquidated sum This was because the liability to pay the amount arose only after the arbitrator decided that a particular amount was due to one or other of the parties We have briefly noticed the judgments cited at the <ORG> All the decisions agree that the meaning of the expression debt may take colour from the provisions of the concerned Act it may have different shades of meaning But if there is a debt the fact that the amount is to be ascertained does not make it any the less a debt if the liability is certain and what remains is only the quantification of the amount In short a debt owed within the meaning of of the Wealth Tax Act can be defined as a liability to pay in praesenti or in futuro an ascertainable sum of money With this background let us look at the provisions of the Income tax Act and the decisions bearing on them to ascertain whether a liability to pay income tax and super tax on the income of the accounting year is a debt within the meaning of of the Wealth Tax Act Uninfluenced by judicial decisions let us at the outset look at the relevant provisions of the two Acts Under of the Incometax Act where any Central Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with and subject to the provisions of the said Act The expression charged is used both in the case of the Central Act i the Finance Act and the Income tax Act When you look at of the Finance Act it shows that income tax shall be charged at the rates specified in Part I of the First Schedule and super tax for the purpose of of the Income tax Act shall be charged at the rates specified in Part of the First Schedule Lord <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> laid down two principles namely i under the express terms of of the Indian Income tax Act the subject of charge is not the income of the year of assessment but the income of the previous year and ii the Indian Income tax Act as amended from time to time forms a code which has no operative effect except so far as it is rendered applicable for the recovery of tax imposed for a particular fiscal year by a Finance Act <ORG> in <NAME> Commissioner of <ORG> Bihar after considering the relevant English decisions held that the liability to pay tax was founded on ss and of the Income tax Act which were the charging sections It held that The facts in that case were the assessee company carrying on business in Chota Nagpur was assessed to tax for the year but the assessment was set aside by <ORG> on I Thereupon the Income tax Officer made an order holding that the income of the assessee for the year had escaped assessment and issued to the assessee a notice under of the Income tax Act This Court speaking through Jagannadhadas held that though the Finance Act was not in force in that area in the income of the assessee was liable to tax in that year and therefore it had escaped assessment within the meaning of of the Income tax Act This Court therefore accepted the principle that the liability to pay tax arose under the Income tax Act though its quantification depended upon the passing of the Finance Act If there was no liability under the Income tax Act during the relevant accounting year no question of escaped assessment during that year would have arisen in that case There is perfected debt at any rate on the last day of the accounting year and not a contingent liability For the reasons we have stated earlier we agree with the conclusion arrived at by <ORG> We therefore hold that the liability to pay income tax is a debt within the meaning of of the Wealth tax Act and it arises on the valuation date during the accounting year Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the assessee raised an alternative contention in regard to the manner of ascertaining the net wealth of an assessee carrying on a business based on a of the Wealth Tax Act The argument of Mr <NAME> was that sub of of the Wealth Tax Act provided an alternative method of valuation of the net wealth of an assessee who was carrying on a business that the expression net wealth of the assets of the business as a whole had a distinct meaning in accountancy that the expression net value meant only net wealth and that it was arrived at only after deducting the liabilities of the business disclosed in the balance sheet from the value of the assets Mr <NAME> on the other hand argued that of the Wealth Tax Act only dealt with the ascertainment of the value of the assets of a business as a whole and that it had nothing to do with the liabilities Learned arguments were advanced in support of the rival contentions But in the view we have taken on the expression debt owed found in in of the Wealth Tax Act it is not necessary to express our opinion on the alternative contention raised on behalf of the assessee In the result we answer the first question in the affirmative the second question in the negative and the third question in the affirmative Section of the Income tax Act provides Where any Central Act enacts that income tax shall be charged for any year at any rate or rates tax at that rate or those rates shall be charged for that year in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Act in respect of the total income of the previous year of every individual Hindu undivided family company and local authority and of every firm and other association of persons or the partners of the firm or the members of the association individually It may be recalled that the liability to pay wealth tax becomes crystallized on the valuation date though the tax is levied for the assessment year and on the valuation date there is normally no completed or effective charge for income tax pay able for the assessment year If on the first day of the financial year the Finance Act for charging income tax for that year has not been enacted the basic provisions of of the Act read with the provisions in force in the preceding year or with the provision then introduced in the Bill before <ORG> whichever is more favourable to the assessee applies But <ORG> held that the income of the company which came into existence in the year of assessment had to be taxed and liability did not attach to the income of the company till the Finance Act was enacted For the assessment year the Income tax authorities held that the income of the previous year derived from the assets comprised in the deeds would be deemed to be the income of the assessee under of the Income tax Act it should be remembered that the Indian Income tax Act as amended from time to time forms a code which has no operative effect except so far as it is rendered applicable for the recovery of tax imposed for a particular fiscal ye ar by a Finance Act This may be illustrated by pointing out that there was no charge on the income either of the appellant or his daughters nor assessment of such income until the passing of the Indian Finance Act of which imposed the tax for on the income and authorised the present assessment Counsel for the <ORG> however sought to contend not withstanding the view expressed in the cases cited that under the Income tax Act liability to pay income tax arises at the latest on the last day of the previous year and that being the valuation date under the Wealth Tax Act in computing wealthtax income tax payable for the year ending March could be regarded as a debt owed by the <ORG> on the valuation date <ORG> held that <ORG> had power to tax foreign income under the legislative head taxes on income if there was between the person sought to be charged and the country seeking to tax him a sufficient territorial connection The Court was not concerned to express any opinion on the question whether liability of the undivided family to pay tax arose before the years of assessment commenced But the liability to pay tax arises only when the Finance Act becomes operative on the first day of April of the assessment year either by enactment of an Act or by virtue of of the Income tax Act The Company sought to deduct in its balance sheet an estimated amount as the probable amount of tax which it would have to pay in the year of assessment that liability to pay advance tax arises when a demand notice is issued under A of the Act For the balance taken into account in the balance sheet there was no liability arising in the previous year which could be regarded as a debt owed by the Company It is not in my judgment open to the <ORG> to put a strained construction upon the Act merely because a businessman may regard a liability to be taxed on the income of the previous year as liability to pay tax on that income Liability to pay tax arose not from the estimate but from the Finance Act it arose when the Finance Act became operative and not earlier than that The alternative argument raised by counsel for the <ORG> from has in my judgment no force Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section a where the assessee is carrying on a business for which accounts are maintained by him regularly the Wealth tax Officer may instead of determining separately the value of each asset held by the assessee in such business determine the net value of the assets of the business as a whole having regard to the balancesheet of such business as on the valuation date and making such adjustments therein as the circumstances of the case may require where the assessee carrying on the business is a company not resident in India and a computation in accordance with clause a cannot be made by reason of the absence of any separate balance sheet drawn up for the affairs of such business in India the Wealth tax Officer may take the net value of the assets of the business in India to be that proportion of the net value of the assets of the business as a whole wherever carried on determined as aforesaid as the income arising from the business in India during the year ending with the valuation date bears to the aggregate income from the business wherever arising during that year By the first sub section the Wealth tax Officer is authorised to estimate for the purpose of determining the value of any asset the price which it would fetch if sold in the open market on the valuation date The <ORG> has therefore provided in sub a that where the assessee is carrying on a business for which accounts are maintained by him regularly the Wealth tax Officer may determine the net value of the assets of the business as a whole having regard to the balancesheet of such business as on the valuation date and make such adjustments therein as the circumstances of the case may require Section merely provides machinery in certain special cases for valuation of assets and it is from the aggregate valuation of assets that the net wealth chargeable to tax may be ascertained Power conferred upon the Tax Officer to make adjustments as the circumstances of the case may require is also for the purpose of arriving at the true value of the assets of the business Clause of sub contemplates cases where a company not resident in India is carrying on business and it is not possible to make computation in accordance with cl a because of the absence of a separate balance sheet of the Company The Wealth tax Officer is then entitled to take the net value of the assets of the business as a whole and to find the net value of the assets in India by multiplying the total value of the business with that fraction which the income arising from the business in India during the year ci ding on the valuation date bears to the aggregate income from the business wherever arising during the year The argument raised by counsel for the assessee is that substantially is a definition section which extends for the purposes of the Act the definition of the net wealth of assessees carrying on business There is no warrant for this argument in the language used in The appeal must therefore stand dismissed with costs ORDER In accordance with the opinion of the majority Civil Appeal No of is partly allowed and parties will bear their own costs here and in <ORG>
