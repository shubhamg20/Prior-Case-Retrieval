These decrees were made in seven suits instituted by the respondent on the th and th September against the appellant and others claiming to recover possession and settlement of certain chowkidari chakeran lands in villages of which the appellant is the zemindar It is unnecessary to deal with the history and vicissitudes of the litigation as the only question that now arises for determination is whether the suits were barred by the Indian Limitation Act is stated to apply to a suit for specific performance of a contract the period of limitation is fixed at three years and the time from which the period begins to run is stated to be the date fixed for the performance or if no such date is fixed the date when the plaintiff has notice that performance is refused That right depended upon the interpretation given by the <ORG> to Section of Act VI of subject to all contracts theretofore made in respect of under or by virtue of which any person other than the zemindar may have any right to any land or portion of his estate or tenure in the place in which such land may be situate They contemplate a case in which the village in which the resumed lands are situate has been made the subject of a contract by the zemindar or those through whom he claims and that under this contract some third party may have an interest in the lands resumed There is therefore no longer any question as to the right of the respondent to the lands but the appellant contention is that as the rights of the putnidar are reserved under the words referred to they must be assumed to be contractual rights that consequently a suit to enforce those rights must be a suit for specific performance and that the date from which the statute begins to run must be the date of the grants to the zemindar This date as has already been pointed out is either the date fixed for performance or the date when the plaintiff has notice that performance has been refused but no date whatever has been fixed for performance in such a case as the present either by the original grant or by the terms of the statute nor has there been any refusal to perform a contract for there was no unexecuted contract which had to be performed The word contract itself primarily means a transaction which creates personal obligations but it may though less exactly refer to transactions which create real rights It is in this latter sense that the word was used in Section and the rights thereby reserved to the putnidars comprehensively included in the word contracts are real rights the enforcement of which is secured not by a suit for specific performance but by a suit for possession and it is this which in their Lordships opinion is the character of the suits in the present case From this it follows the period of limitation is that fixed by Article consequently the judgment appealed from is in their Lordships opinion correct and they will humbly advise His Majesty that this appeal should be dismissed with costs
