is extended to sixty days Again by the proviso to the Government is entitled to withhold in serving grounds upon the detenu that it would be against public interest to communicate to him the grounds on which the detention order has been made Relying upon the terms of as amended by A it was urged that the Government was bound to refer the case of the petitioner within sixty days from the date of detention and since no reference was made the detention of the petitioner under the order dated March was unauthorised Section A opens with words Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act and provides that a person may be detained for a period not longer than six months without obtaining the opinion of <ORG> We will be justified in accepting the contention of the <ORG> that it was intended when the order was pass detaining the petitioner that he was not to be kept in detention for a period longer than six months and his case fell within the terms of A and on that account it was not necessary to obtain the opinion of <ORG> The only plea raised by the petitioner in support of that plea is in paragraph of the etition that the cancellation of the earlier order of detention and the service of the fresh order of detention on the petitioner was a part and parcel of the scheme of the <ORG> to suppress the peaceful trade union movement and that the fresh order of detention was passed mala fide No particulars are furnished which justify an inference that in resorting to the provisions of the Act the Government action was actuated by ill will or taken for some collateral purpose Reliance was also placed upon the recitals in the grounds supplied to the petitioner on March and under the fresh detention order dated September and it was contended that the grounds being identical an inference followed that the previous detention order was continued on the same grounds on which the original order was passed
