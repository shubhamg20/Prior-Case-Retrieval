Legality or otherwise of the contentions raised by the parties in <ORG> was left open the revision petition was allowed and the trial court order dated was set aside Feeling aggrieved the landlord preferred a revision petition in <ORG> which has been disposed of by the judgment impugned herein According to <ORG> There is no relationship of landlord and tenant between the landlord and Smt He was served with a prior notice of demand <NAME> the wife had challenged the order for partial eviction passed by the trial court and it became final In spite of a ground for eviction having been made out within the meaning of the said provision entitling the landlord to initiate proceedings for eviction of the tenant no order for the recovery of possession of any premises on that ground shall be made if the tenant deposits or pays to the landlord rent during the pendency of proceedings in the manner prescribed by Section of the Act and satisfies the <ORG> that there was a sufficient cause for the default to pay or tender the rent within the period referred to in Section a and further pays to the landlord or deposits in the <ORG> such further amount as may be determined and fixed by the <ORG> within the meaning of clause iii of sub section of Section of the Act Under Section of the Act once the interest of the tenant in any premises has been determined and order for recovery of possession has been made by the Court the same is binding on all persons who may be in occupation of the premises and vacant possession of the premises has to be given to the landlord by evicting the tenant and all persons in occupation of the premises excepting those who have any independent title to such premises The term family has been defined in clause ff of Section of the Act as family in relation to a person means the wife or husband of such person and his or her dependent children Yet the tenant in whose name the tenancy has been created is not the only one who is entitled to live in the residential premises he has a right to live therein with his family wherein is included the spouse She is also entitled to separate residence if by reason of the husband conduct or by his refusal to maintain her in his own place of residence or for other just cause she is compelled to live apart from him The position of law which emerges on a conjoint reading of the Rent Control Legislation and Personal Laws providing for right to maintenance which will include the right to residence of a wife including a deserted or divorced wife may be examined Any precedent much less of a binding authority from any Court in India and dealing with a situation as we are called upon to deal with is not available Lord <NAME> states in The Due Process of Law London Butterworths at page A wife is no longer her husband chattel She is beginning to be regarded by the laws as a partner in all affairs which are their common concern Thus the husband can no longer turn her out of the matrimonial home She has as much right as he to stay there even though the house does stand in his name Thus where a husband who was statutory tenant of the matrimonial home deserted his wife and left the house it was held that the landlord could not turn her out so long as she paid the rent and performed the conditions of the tenancy He said If a statutory tenant goes out of occupation leaving lodgers or sub tenants or no one in the house he ceases to be entitled to the protection of the Rent Restrictions Acts but he does not in my opinion lose the protection if he goes out leaving his wife and furniture there As in this case he left the house in a dispute with his wife and his wife and child remained in occupation of the house with the use of his furniture and he continued to pay rent supra <ORG> held in <NAME> <NAME> All England Law Reports that where a husband had deserted his wife and the wife remained in the matrimonial home she was lawfully there and the husband remained in occupation through her possession of a dwelling house to which the Rent Restrictions Acts applied could only be ordered on one of the grounds specified in the Acts and a tenant could not by agreement waive the statutory protection afforded by the Acts and therefore the orders for possession were wrongly made Lord <NAME> stated The duration of the right if it were held to affect the land would be uncertain It would not survive divorce nor would it necessarily survive a judicial separation by order of the court which puts an end to the duty of cohabitation on both sides The preamble of the Act says an Act to consolidate certain enactments relating to the rights of a husband or wife to occupy a dwelling house that has been a matrimonial home So long as one spouse has right to occupation either of the spouses may apply to the court for an order requiring either spouse to permit the exercise by the other of that right When there is no contract between the parties to a marriage as among Hindus a suit for maintenance is not a suit based upon contract but it is a suit arising out of a civil relation resembling that of a contract which is specially provided for in Article of the Limitation Act For forming this opinion the Court took into consideration the facts that the quarter was meant to be used by the employee and the husband was under an obligation to provide shelter to the wife and children Section of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act confers a right on a wife to be maintained by her husband during her life time Section enables the court to pass an order for providing alimony and maintenance in favour of the divorced wife How far that order would be binding on a landlord who is not a party is another question but it would certainly give her a right to defend the proceedings for eviction This Court upheld the right of sub tenant to file an appeal in his own right against the decree so as to protect himself even though thereby the tenant would also be freed from the decree In our opinion a deserted wife who has been or is entitled to be in occupation of the matrimonial home is entitled to contest the suit for eviction filed against her husband in his capacity as tenant subject to satisfying two conditions first that the tenant has given up the contest or is not interested in contesting the suit and such giving up by the tenant husband shall prejudice the deserted wife who is residing in the premises and secondly the scope and ambit of the contest or defence by the wife would not be on a footing higher or larger than that of the tenant himself In other words such a wife would be entitled to raise all such pleas and claim trial thereon as would have been available to the tenant himself and no more So long as by availing the benefit of the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and <ORG> the tenant would have been entitled to stay in the tenancy premises the wife too can continue to stay exercising her right to residence as a part of right to maintenance subject to compliance with all such obligations including the payment of rent to which the tenant is subject This right comes to an end with the wife losing her status as wife consequent upon decree of divorce and the right to occupy the house as part of right to maintenance coming to an end We are also of the opinion that a deserted wife in occupation of the tenanted premises cannot be placed in a position worse than that of a sub tenant contesting a claim for eviction on the ground of subletting Having been deserted by the tenant husband she cannot be deprived of the roof over her head where the tenant has conveniently left her to face the peril of eviction attributable to default or neglect of himself We are inclined to hold and we do so that a deserted wife continuing in occupation of the premises obtained on lease by her husband and which was their matrimonial home occupies a position akin to that of an heir of the tenant husband if the right to residence of such wife has not come to an end The tenant having lost interest in protecting his tenancy rights as available to him under the law the same right would devolve upon and inhere in the wife so long as she continues in occupation of the premises A suitable amendment in the legislation is called for to that effect And so long as that is not done we responding to the demands of social and gender justice need to mould the relief and do complete justice by exercising our jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution We hasten to add that the purpose of our holding as above is to give the wife right to residence a meaningful efficacy as dictated by the needs of the times we do not intend nor do we propose the landlord right to eviction against his tenant to be subordinated to wife right to residence enforceable against her husband We have dealt with all the abovesaid aspects of the law as it was urged on behalf of the landlord respondent No that Smt <NAME> the appellant has no right to contest or defend herself in these proceedings nor a right to file and prosecute this appeal as there is no privity of contract between the appellant and landlord and the appellant is neither a tenant nor so recognized ever by the respondent No landlord However the case of a divorced wife stands on a little different footing In the present case it is admitted by the appellant that on that is during the pendency of these proceedings and while the matter was pending in <ORG> a decree for dissolution of marriage by divorce based on mutual consent has been passed <NAME> the appellant that she is entitled to continue her residence in the tenanted premises by virtue of an obligation incurred by her husband to provide residence for her as a part of maintenance She cannot therefore be allowed to prosecute the appeal and defend her right against the claim for eviction made by the landlord However in the facts and circumstances of the case the appellant is allowed time till for vacating the suit premises subject to the following conditions i that the appellant shall clear all the arrears of rent calculated upto the date of deposit at the rate of Rs per month on or before st March by depositing the same in the executing court ii with effect from st April the appellant shall continue to deposit rent calculated at the rate of Rs per month on or before th day of each month for payment to landlord iii on or before st December the appellant shall hand over vacant and peaceful possession over the suit premises to the landlord and shall not in between part with possession to anyone else or create third party interest iv that an undertaking on affidavit incorporating the above said terms shall be filed in the executing court on or before
