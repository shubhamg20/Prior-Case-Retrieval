The law of bails dovetails two conflicting interests namely on the one hand the requirements of shielding the society from the hazards of those committing crimes and potentiality of repeating the same crime while on bail and on the other hand absolute adherence of the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence regarding presumption of innocence of an accused until he is found guilty and the sanctity of individual liberty It may be relevant to mention that the alleged incident took place after eight days of the alleged incident of instigation Section deals with situation in what kind of cases bail should be granted Section deals with the situation when bail may be granted in case of a bailable offence Section deals with the special powers of <ORG> or <ORG> regarding grant of bail Where any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on accusation of having committed a non bailable offence he may apply to <ORG> or <ORG> for a direction under this section that in the event of such arrest he shall be released on bail and that Court may after taking into consideration inter alia the following factors namely i the nature and gravity of the accusation ii the antecedents of the applicant including the fact as to whether he has previously undergone imprisonment on conviction by a Court in respect of any cognizable offence iii the possibility of the applicant to flee from justice and iv where the accusation has been made with the object of injuring or humiliating the applicant by having him so arrested either reject the application forthwith or issue an interim order for the grant of anticipatory bail Provided that where <ORG> or as the case may be <ORG> has not passed any interim order under this sub section or has rejected the application for grant of anticipatory bail it shall be open to an officer in charge of a police station to arrest without warrant the applicant on the basis of the accusation apprehended in such application A Where the <ORG> grants an interim order under sub section it shall forthwith cause a notice being not less than seven days notice together with a copy of such order to be served on the Public Prosecutor and the Superintendent of Police with a view to give the Public Prosecutor a reasonable opportunity of being heard when the application shall be finally heard by the <ORG> The presence of the applicant seeking anticipatory bail shall be obligatory at the time of final hearing of the application and passing of final order by the <ORG> if on an application made to it by the Public Prosecutor the <ORG> considers such presence necessary in the interest of justice If such person is thereafter arrested without warrant by an officer in charge of a police station on such accusation and is prepared either at the time of arrest or at any time while in the custody of such officer to give bail he shall be released on bail and if a Magistrate taking cognizance of such offence decides that a warrant should issue in the first instance against that person he shall issue a bailable warrant in conformity with the direction of the <ORG> under sub section Under the old Code there was a sharp difference of opinion amongst the various <ORG> on the question as to whether the courts had an inherent power to pass an order of bail in anticipation of arrest the preponderance of view being that it did not have such power <ORG> in its st Report dated September pointed out the necessity of introducing a provision in the Code of Criminal Procedure enabling <ORG> and <ORG> to grant anticipatory bail It observed in para of its report Volume I and the same is set out as under The suggestion for directing the release of a person on bail prior to his arrest commonly known as anticipatory bail was carefully considered by us Though there is a conflict of judicial opinion about the power of a court to grant anticipatory bail the majority view is that there is no such power under the existing provisions of the Code Apart from false cases where there are reasonable grounds for holding that a person accused of an offence is not likely to abscond or otherwise misuse his liberty while on bail there seems no justification to require him first to submit to custody remain in prison for some days and then apply for bail It will also be convenient to provide that notice of the interim order as well as of the final orders will be given to the Superintendent of Police forthwith It is apparent from the Statement of Objects and Reasons for introducing section in the Code of Criminal Procedure that it was felt imperative to evolve a device by which an alleged accused is not compelled to face ignominy and disgrace at the instance of influential people who try to implicate their rivals in false cases The Code of Criminal Procedure did not contain any specific provision corresponding to the present section When we carefully analyze this section the wisdom of the legislature becomes quite evident and clear that the legislature was keen to ensure respect for the personal liberty and also pressed in service the age old principle that an individual is presumed to be innocent till he is found guilty by the court <ORG> in the impugned judgment has declined to grant anticipatory bail to the appellant and aggrieved by the said order the appellant has approached this Court by filing this appeal Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant submitted that <ORG> has gravely erred in declining the anticipatory bail to the appellant Mr <NAME> submitted that the appellant has been implicated in a false case and apart from that he has already joined the investigation and he is not likely to abscond or otherwise misuse the liberty while on bail therefore there was no justification to decline anticipatory bail to the appellant Mr <NAME> also submitted that the FIR in this case refers to an incident which had taken place on the instigation of the appellant about eight days ago He also submitted that it is the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that every individual is presumed to be innocent till he or she is found guilty He further submitted that on proper analysis of section the legislative wisdom becomes quite evident that the legislature wanted to preserve and protect personal liberty and give impetus to the age old principle that every person is presumed to be innocent till he is found guilty by the court Mr <NAME> also submitted that according to the General Clauses Act the court which grants the bail also has the power to cancel it It is difficult to visualize or anticipate all kinds of problems and situations which may arise in future He placed heavy reliance on para of <ORG> case supra which reads as under But apart from the fact that the question is inherently of a kind which calls for the use of discretion from case to case the legislature has in terms express relegated the decision of that question to the discretion of the court by providing that it may grant bail if it thinks fit Mr <NAME> submitted that the Constitution Bench in <NAME> case supra also mentioned that we see no valid reason for rewriting Section with a view not to expanding the scope and ambit of the discretion conferred on <ORG> and <ORG> but for the purpose of limiting it Circumstances may broadly justify the grant of bail in such cases too though of course the court is free to refuse anticipatory bail in any case if there is material before it justifying such refusal is neither envisaged by the provisions of the Act nor is in consonance with the law declared by <ORG> in Sibbia case supra nor it is in conformity with the fundamental principles of criminal jurisprudence that accused is considered to be innocent till he is found guilty nor in consonance with the provisions of the Constitution where individual liberty in a democratic society is considered sacrosanct Mr <NAME> fairly submitted that the practice of passing orders of anticipatory bail operative for a few days and directing the accused to surrender before the Magistrate and apply for regular bail are contrary to the law laid down in <NAME> case supra Mr <NAME> submitted that not only the decision in Sibbia case supra must be followed on account of the larger strength of the Bench that delivered it but the subsequent decisions must be held to be per incuriam and hence not binding since they have not taken into account the ratio of the judgment of the Constitution Bench The observations made by the courts in the subsequent judgments have been made in ignorance of and without considering the law laid down in para which was binding on them In these circumstances the observations made in the subsequent judgments to the effect that anticipatory bail should be for a limited period of time must be construed to be per incuriam and the decision of <ORG> preferred He further submitted that the said issue came up for consideration before <ORG> reported in <NAME> and Another State CTC wherein after discussing all the judgments of this court on the issue the court held that the subsequent judgments were in conflict with the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and in accordance with the law of precedents the judgment of <ORG> is biding on all courts and the ratio of that judgment has to be applicable for all judgments decided by the <NAME> of same or smaller combinations We have heard the learned counsel for the parties at great length and perused the written submissions filed by the learned counsel for the parties It has many facets and meanings At the same time liberty without restraints would mean liberty won by one and lost by another The individuals composing the state must in their own interests and in order that they may be assured the existence of conditions in which they can with a reasonable amount of freedom carry on their other activities endow those in authority over them to make laws and regulations and adopt measures which impose certain restrictions on the activities of the individuals I aptly observed that Personal liberty consists in the power of locomotion of changing situation or moving one person to whatsoever place one own inclination may direct without imprisonment or restraint unless by due process of law According to <NAME> a distinguished English author of the Constitutional Law in his treatise on Constitutional Law observed that Personal liberty as understood in England means in substance a person right not to be subjected to imprisonment arrest or other physical coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification According to him it is the negative right of not being subjected to any form of physical restraint or coercion that constitutes the essence of personal liberty and not mere freedom to move to any part of the Indian territory In ordinary language personal liberty means liberty relating to or concerning the person or body of the individual and personal liberty in this sense is the antithesis of physical restraint or coercion observed that liberty postulates the creation of a climate wherein there is no suppression of the human spirits wherein there is no denial of the opportunity for the full growth of human personality wherein head is held high and there is no servility of the human mind or enslavement of the human body American Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of his life liberty or property without due process of law The said Article reads as under no person shall be deprived for his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law the right secured by Article is available to every citizen or non citizen according to this article two rights are secured The expression personal liberty has wider as well narrow meaning The juristic conception of personal liberty when used the latter sense is that it consists freedom of movement and locomotion <NAME> in the said judgment observed that Personal Liberty means liberty relating to or concerning the person or body of the individual and it is in this sense antithesis of physical restraint or coercion Personal Liberty means a personal right not to be subjected to imprisonment arrest or other physical coercion in any manner that does not admit of legal justification <NAME> however said that whatever may be the generally accepted connotation of the expression personal liberty it was used in Article in a sense which excludes the freedom dealt with in Article It was observed The expression personal liberty in Article is of the widest amplitude and it covers a variety of rights which go to constitute the personal liberty of a man and some of them have been raised to the status of distinct fundamental rights and given additional protection under Article So the phrase personal liberty is very wide and includes all possible rights which go to constitute personal liberty including those which are mentioned in Article While examining the ambit scope and content of the expression personal liberty in the said case it was held that the term is used in this Article as a compendious term to include within itself all varieties of rights which goes to make up the personal liberties or man other than those dealt within several clauses of Article The early approach to Article which guarantees right to life and personal liberty was circumscribed by literal interpretation in <NAME> supra Thus protection against arbitrary privation of life no longer means mere protection of death or physical injury but also an invasion of the right to live with human dignity and would include all these aspects of life which would go to make a man life meaningful and worth living such as his tradition culture and heritage It was held The right to live with human dignity and same does not connote continued drudging It takes within its fold some process of civilization which makes life worth living and expanded concept of life would mean the tradition culture and heritage of the person concerned <NAME> It is implicit in Articles and that when there is no compulsive need to fetter a person limbs it is sadistic capricious despotic and demoralizing to humble a man by manacling him But there is room for imposing supervisory regime over the exercise of that power One sector of supervisory jurisdiction could appropriately lie with the court trying the accused and it would be desirable for the custodial authority to inform that court of the circumstances in which and the justification for imposing a restraint on the body of the accused It was in that the people of England revolted against King John and enforced their rights first time the King had acknowledged that there were certain rights of the subject could be called Magna Carta Right to life is the most fundamental of all human rights and any decision affecting human right or which may put an individual life at risk must call for the most anxious scrutiny Though the freedom of life and liberty guaranteed by the above Article may be restricted such restriction will be valid only if it is in conformity with the legal order or pursuant to a law according to official translation Being a basic right the freedom guaranteed by Article is binding on the legislative administrative and judicial organs of the <ORG> Article This gives the individual the rights to challenge the validity of a law or an executive act violative the freedom of the person by a constitutional complaint to <ORG> under Article Procedural guarantee is given by Articles and Article XXXI of the Japanese Constitution of says No person shall be deprived of life or liberty nor shall any other criminal penalty be imposed except according to procedure established by law The result was that in Canada the due process clause lost its utility as an instrument of judicial review of legislation and it came to mean practically the same thing as whatever the <ORG> prescribes much the same as procedure established by law in Article of the Constitution of India as interpreted in <NAME> supra Article of the Constitution of Bangladesh SCW reads as under No person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty save in accordance with law Security of Person No person shall be deprived of life and liberty save in accordance with law In the Constitution of Nepal there is Article which deals with right to life and liberty which is identical with Article of the Indian Constitution No one shall be deprived of his liberty except on such grounds and in accordance with such procedure as are established by law Above all Article of the Constitution of India proclaims that no one shall be deprived of his right to personal liberty except in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law It provides the necessary conditions for growth whether it is in the economic sphere or in the scientific and technological spheres Those orders are contrary to the law laid down by the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> case supra The courts considering the bail application should try to maintain fine balance between the societal interest vis vis personal liberty while adhering to the fundamental principle of criminal jurisprudence that the accused that the accused is presumed to be innocent till he is found guilty by the competent court If the connivance between the complainant and the investigating officer is established then action be taken against the investigating officer in accordance with law Before arrest the arresting officer must record the valid reasons which have led to the arrest of the accused in the case diary The question which arises for consideration is whether the powers under section <ORG> in <NAME> case supra has clearly observed that there is no justification for reading into section This virtually reduces the salutary power conferred by section The proper course of action ought to be that after evaluating the averments and accusation available on the record if the court is inclined to grant anticipatory bail then an interim bail be granted and notice be issued to the public prosecutor It is a settled legal position that the court which grants the bail also has the power to cancel it <ORG> in <NAME> case supra has clearly stated that grant and refusal is discretionary and it should depend on the facts and circumstances of each case The court which grants the bail has the right to cancel the bail according to the provisions of the General Clauses Act but ordinarily after hearing the public prosecutor when the bail order is confirmed then the benefit of the grant of the bail should continue till the end of the trial of that case It would not stand the test of fairness and reasonableness which is implicit in Article of the Constitution after the decision in <NAME> case supra in which the court observed that in order to meet the challenge of Article of the Constitution the procedure established by law for depriving a person of his liberty must be fair just and reasonable Once such a direction of anticipatory bail is executed by the accused and he is released on bail the concerned court would be fully justified in imposing conditions including direction of joining investigation The court must bear in mind that at times the applicant would approach the court for grant of anticipatory bail on mere apprehension of being arrested on accusation of having committed a non bailable offence In fact the investigating or concerned agency may not otherwise arrest that applicant who has applied for anticipatory bail but just because he makes an application before the court and gets the relief from the court for a limited period and thereafter he has to surrender before the trial court and only thereafter his bail application can be considered and life of anticipatory bail comes to an end This is especially true when the statutory provision which falls for consideration is designed to secure a valuable right like the right to personal freedom and involves the application of a presumption as salutary and deep grained in our criminal jurisprudence as the presumption of innocence Now it seems to me that when the Act is so expressed to provide a wide discretion it is not advisable to lay down any rigid rules for guiding that discretion The view expressed by this <ORG> in all the above referred judgments have to be reviewed and once the anticipatory bail is granted then the protection should ordinarily be available till the end of the trial unless the interim protection by way of the grant of anticipatory bail is curtailed when the anticipatory bail granted by the court is cancelled by the court on finding fresh material or circumstances or on the ground of abuse of the indulgence by the accused Conditions mentioned in section cannot be read into section The <ORG> expressed concern that there is no internal mechanism within the police department to prevent misuse of law in this manner and the stark reality that complaint lodged in this regard does not bring any result Reference is made in this Article to the st Report of the Law <ORG> wherein the <ORG> saw no justification to require a person to submit to custody remain in prison for some days and then apply for bail even when there are reasonable grounds for holding that the person accused of an offence is not likely to abscond or otherwise misuse his liberty The following factors and parameters can be taken into consideration while dealing with the anticipatory bail i The nature and gravity of the accusation and the exact role of the accused must be properly comprehended before arrest is made ii These are some of the factors which should be taken into consideration while deciding the anticipatory bail applications In case the arrest is imperative according to the facts of the case in that event the arresting officer must clearly record the reasons for the arrest of the accused before the arrest in the case diary but in exceptional cases where it becomes imperative to arrest the accused immediately the reasons be recorded in the case diary immediately after the arrest is made without loss of any time so that the court has an opportunity to properly consider the case for grant or refusal of bail in the light of reasons recorded by the arresting officer Both individual and society have vital interest in orders passed by the courts in anticipatory bail applications This view is clearly contrary to the view taken by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra <ORG> has aptly observed that we see no valid reason for rewriting section with a view not to expanding the scope and ambit of the discretion conferred on <ORG> or <ORG> but for the purpose of limiting it We deem it appropriate to reiterate and assert that discretion vested in the court in all matters should be exercised with care and circumspection depending upon the facts and circumstances justifying its exercise Similarly the discretion vested with the court under section It is unnecessary to travel beyond it and subject to the wide power and discretion conferred by the legislature to a rigorous code of self imposed limitations The judgments and orders mentioned in paras and are clearly contrary to the law declared by <ORG> of this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra para per incuriam has been elucidated as under A decision is given per incuriam when the court has acted in ignorance of a previous decision of its own or of a court of coordinate jurisdiction which covered the case before it in which case it must decide which case to follow Young <ORG> KB at All ER at Lord Godard in <ORG> Watson All ER observed that where a case or statute had not been brought to the court attention and the court gave the decision in ignorance or forgetfulness of the existence of the case or statute it would be a decision rendered in per incuriam For the reasons we are bound to follow the <ORG> decision in Kalyani which is the binding authority on the point In para the court observed as under We are distressed to note that despite several pronouncements on the subject there is substantial increase in the number of cases involving violation of the basics of judicial discipline The decisions referred to hereinbefore clearly suggest that we are bound by a <ORG> decision <NAME> supra therefore could not have ignored either <NAME> supra or other decisions following the same only on the basis of an administrative circular issued or otherwise and more so when the constitutional scheme as contained in clause of Articles and of the Constitution of India putting the State and Union Territory in the same bracket In case there is no judgment of a Constitution Bench or larger Bench of binding nature and if the court doubts the correctness of the judgments by two or three judges then the proper course would be to request Hon ble the Chief Justice to refer the matter to a larger Bench of appropriate strength In the instant case there is a direct judgment of <ORG> of this court in <NAME> case supra dealing with exactly the same issue regarding ambit scope and object of the concept of anticipatory bail enumerated under section We direct the appellant to join the investigation and fully cooperate with the investigating agency
