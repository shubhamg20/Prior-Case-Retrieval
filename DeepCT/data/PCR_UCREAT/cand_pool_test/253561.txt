The Central Excise authorities determined the assessable value of the goods of the petitioner for the purposes of levying excise duty on the basis of the retail prices There was a further revision preferred to the Government which resulted in the allowance of trade discount of and cartage of from the retail sale price After discussing the relevant case law the learned judge came to the conclusion that the only means for ascertaining the wholesale price in a case like this was to deduct from the retail price the necessary items of expenditure which belonged to the post manufacturing stage In para of this order the learned judge pointed out that insofar as the percentage claimed on the aforesaid items as concerned there could be no serious controversy as a fact because the petitioner company had been utilising the services of a Chartered Accountant of standing and the above figures had been worked out for the assessment period namely in accordance with the figures mentioned by the Chartered Accountant and there was no evidence contra of <ORG> who dismissed the petitioner appeal on the ground that the demanded tax was not paid shall decide afresh in the light of the legal principles mentioned in this judgment When the matter thus went back to the Assistant Collector of <ORG> he passed an order on by which he allowed the petitioner a refund of Rs The petitioner filed reply to the show cause notice on th November The petitioner preferred an appeal to the Appellate Collector which was successful He also held that if the earlier order of refund was found to be erroneous it should have been revised by <ORG> under Section A and it was not open to review by invoking rule Before proceeding to deal with the contentions raised on behalf of the petitioner it is necessary to clarify that the decision of <ORG> cannot be considered to have decided the issue presently in dispute Learned counsel for the petitioner raised three contentions i The refund having been granted by the order of an Assistant Collector dated after a careful consideration of the various points involved it was not open to another Assistant Collector to review that order merely because he thought it was wrong and to hold to the contrary ii the order dated passed under Rule was barred by limitation as the proceedings for the review commenced after the expiry of three months from the date of grant of refund and iii The refund had been correctly granted to the petition and its withdrawal was not in accordance with law The first two contentions turn on the language of Rule and hence it is necessary to set out the provisions of rule as it stood at the relevant time Recovery of duties or charges short levied or erroneously refunded i When duties or charges have been short levied through inadvertence error collusion or mis construction on the part of an officer or through mis statement as to the quantity description or value of such goods on the part of the owner or when any such duty or charge after having been levied has been owing to any such cause erroneously refunded the proper officer may within the three months from the date on which the duty or charge was paid or adjusted in the owner account current if any or from the date of making the refund serve a notice on the person from whom such deficiency in duty or charges is or are recoverable requiring him to show cause to the Assistant Collector of <ORG> why he should not pay the amount specified in the notice ii The Assistant Collector of Central Excise after considering the representation if any made by the person on whom notice is served under sub rule shall determine the amount of duty or charges due from such person not being in excess of the amount specified in the notice and thereupon such person shall pay the amount so determined within ten days from the date on which he is required to pay such amount or within such extended period as the Assistant Collector of Central Excise may in any particular case allow It will be seen at once that the first contention urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner is untenable It is no doubt true that there is provision enabling a provisional assessment initially to be followed on by careful consideration later on and that in the case of a refund order there may not have been the same amount of haste as in a case of levy The language of the rule clearly postulates the existence of a prior quasi judicial determination by way of levy of duty or grant of refund or a decision not to levy duty and confers on the same authority a power of review of the earlier decision subject to the fulfillment of the conditions mentioned in the rule and subject to action for review being taken within the prescribed period of limitation It may include both imposition of a tax as well as assessment The term imposition is generally used for the levy of a tax or duty by legislative provision indicating the subject matter of the tax and the rates at which it has to be taxed The term assessment on the other hand is generally used in this country for the actual procedure adopted in fixing the liability to pay a tax on account of particular goods or property or whatever may be the object of the tax in a particular case and determining its amount It said there with reference to Rule We are not inclined to accept the contention of Dr <NAME> that the expression levy in Rule means actual collection of some amount It is to be noted that sub section used both the expressions levied and collected and that clearly shows that the expression levy has not been used in the Act or the Rules as meaning actual collection In the context of these observations it is quite clear that there could have been no non levy or short levy except by a process of assessment likewise a refund could have been directed only after making a like determination of a quasi judicial nature The rule permits a review when the appropriate authority comes to a conclusion that the earlier decision was erroneous and that more duty should have been levied or that no refund ought to have been granted such error having crept in inter alia due to inadvertence error collusion or misconstruction on the part of an officer Though there is some difficulty in the construction of this rule we are of opinion that the contention of the learned counsel for the respondents should be accepted Rule relates to the recovery by the department in case of short levy or excess refund whereas Rule gives the assessed a right to ask for refund where he finds that the department has collected more duty than it ought to have But we agree with Mr <NAME> that these are minor lapses in drafting and that the rule fully applies to the present case There is no logical reason why the rule should attract the applicability of Rule only in respect of one of the two eventualities the reference in the title to Rule is really a broad reference to the contents of rule and should not be read as limited only to one type of action taken under Rule The third difficulty posed by Mr <NAME> was that in the present case we are concerned with the excise duty levied and collected for the assessment period whereas Rule came into force only in This order was passed much after and its review ability will therefore be governed by Rule read with Rule The objection that the notice preceding the order dated mentioned only Rule does not also affect the validity of the order passed because Rule is not an independent rule by itself it only directs the application of provisions of Rule in certain cases with a modification regarding the period of limitation This takes us to the third and last contention of Mr <NAME> on the merits of the order under Rule which has been revived by the order in revision of the <ORG> The case of the assessed all along had been that since substantial loss due to breakage in transit of the fragile goods manufactured by the petitioner was an inevitable incident of the business the assessed had to take this into account in fixing its sale price Since the loss incurred at the post manufacturing stage this element of inflation included in the sale price represented a post manufacturing element which had to be excluded for excise duty purposes in view of the law settled by <ORG> and <ORG> Counsel for the respondents does not deny that the loss due to breakage claimed by the assessed occurs after the goods leave the factory Indeed the Rules make an allowance in respect of loss due to breakage in the process of manufacture and usually no question arises in regard thereto We do not think that the fact of the assessed claim being based on an estimate can vitiate it but we find substance in Mr <NAME> contention that the allowance of this loss will really result in the exclusion from the excisable value the manufacturing cost of a part of the excisable goods We have therefore come to the conclusion that plausible as the assessed claim may sound the claim of the assessed will really result in the reduction from the sale price a portion of the element of the assessed manufacturing cost included in it which is the subject matter of levy We therefore reject the contentions of the petitioner discharge the rule and dismiss the writ petition We however make no orders as to costs
