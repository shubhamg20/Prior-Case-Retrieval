HEADNOTE The respondents were tried for having committed offences under and of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act read with of the Indian Penal Code and of the Act This appeal by special leave is against that order dismissing the revision It was contended for the respondents that provides for two different procedures for dealing with contravention of the provisions of the Act That is to say persons who have contravened the provisions specified in a and are found guilty by the Director of Enforcement need not face prosecution in a criminal court if the Director is of opinion that the penalty he is empowered to impose would be adequate punishment whereas the persons alleged to contravene the other provisions of the Act have necessarily to face prosecution in criminal court without being given the benefit of an inquiry by the Director of Enforcement and the opportunity to the delinquents to convince him that imposition of penalty by him would be adequate punishment even if they are found guilty Allowing the appeal HELD i When the purpose of a challenged classification is in doubt the courts attribute to the classification the purpose thought to be most probable The decisions dealing with economic regulation indicate that courts have used the concept of purpose and similar situations in a manner which give considerable leeway to the legislature This approach of judicial restraint and presumption of constitutionality requires that the legislature is given the benefit of doubt about its purpose In strict theory this involves an abandonment of the principle that classification must include all who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose There are two main considerations to justify an under inclusive classification The basis of classification was that in cases where there was likelihood of getting sufficiently unimpeachable evidence as for instance The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The respondents were tried before the Presidency Magistrate th Court for having committed offences under sections and of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act hereinafter called the Act read with of the Indian Penal Code and of the Act Section as it originally stood in the Act provided that whoever contravenes any of the provisions of the Act or of any rule direction or order made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both and any Court trying any such contravention may if it thinks fit and in addition to any sentence which it may impose for such contravention direct that any currency security gold or silver or goods or other property in respect of which the contravention has taken place shall be confiscated The section as amended read as under If any person contravenes the provisions of or sub section of or of any rule direction or order made thereunder he shall a be liable to such penalty not exceeding three times the value of the foreign exchange in respect of which the contravention has taken place or five thousand rupees whichever is more as may be adjudged by the Director of Enforcement in the manner hereinafter provided or up on conviction by a Court be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both IA Whoever contravenes a any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule direction or order made thereunder other than those referred to in sub section of this section and shall upon conviction by a court be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both any direction or order made under shall upon conviction by a <ORG> be punishable with fine which may extend to two thousand rupees By it was provided that the Director of Enforcement shall for the purpose of adjudicating under clause a of sub section of hold an inquiry after notice to the person proceeded against and impose a penalty but if at any stage of the inquiry he is of opinion that having regard to the circumstances of the case the penalty he is empowered to impose would not be adequate he shall instead of imposing a penalty file a complaint in writing to the <ORG> The argument of the respondents was that provides for two different procedures for dealing with contravention of the provisions of the Act that while persons contravening the provisions of the Act specified in a have to be dealt with by the Director of Enforcement in the first instance and need face trial in criminal court only if he is of opinion that having regard to circumstances of the case the penalty he is empowered to impose would not be adequate the persons contravening the other provisions of the Act are liable to be prosecuted in the first instance in criminal court without an injury by the Director of Enforcement which would give them the possibility to escape prosecution in a criminal court In other words the argument was that persons who have contravened the provisions specified in I a anti are found guilty by the Director of Enforcement need not face prosecution in a criminal court if the Director is of opinion that the penalty he is empowered to impose would be adequate punishment whereas the persons alleged to contravene the other provisions of the Act have necessarily to face prosecution in criminal court without being given the benefit of an inquiry by the Director of Enforcement and the opportunity to the delinquents to convince him that imposition of penalty by him would be adequate punishment even if they are found guilty The question therefore is whether persons contravening the provisions specified in I a are similarly situated with persons contravening the other provisions of the Act with respect to the purpose or object of the Act or whether by reason of the nature of the offences resulting from the contravention of the provisions specified in I a the persons contravening them form a class by themselves distinct from the persons contravening the other provisions of the Act and therefore the legislative judgment to deal with them under a different procedure was justified with reference to the ultimate purpose of the Act The preamble provides the key to the general purpose of the Act The general purpose or object of the Act given in the preamble may not show the specific purpose of the classification made in a and A For achieving this the <ORG> may not only consider the language of but also other public knowledge about the evil sought to be remedied the prior law the statement of the purpose of the change in the prior law and the internal legislative history When the purpose of a challenged classification is in doubt the courts attribute to the classification the purpose thought to be Most probable The decisions dealing with economic regulation indicate that courts have used the concept of purpose and similar situations in a manner which give considerable leeway to the legislature This approach of judicial restraint and presumption of constitutionality requires that the legislature is given the benefit of doubt about its purpose How far a court will go in attributing a purpose which though perhaps not the most probable is at least conceivable and which would allow the classification to stand depends to a certain extent upon its imaginative power and its devotion to the theory of judicial restraint As already indicated their submission is that since they are similarly situated with persons contravening the provisions of the Act specified in a they should have been included in that class and dealt with by <ORG> in the first instance so that they might also have the benefit of inquiry by him with the possible advantage of escaping with penalty even if they are found guilty of the offences In strict theory this involves an abandonment of the principle that classification must include all who are similarly situated with respect to the purpose Mr Justice <NAME> in urging tolerance of under inclusive classifications stated that such legislation should not be disturbed by the <ORG> unless it can clearly see that there is no fair reason for the law which would not require with equal force its extension to those whom it leaves untouched What then are the fair reasons for non exten sion What should a court do when it is faced with a law making an under inclusive classification in areas relating to economic and tax matters There are two main considerations to justify an Linder inclusive classification It would seem that in fiscal and regulatory matters the court not only entertains a greater presumption of constitutionality but also places the burden on the party challenging its validity to show that it has no reasonable basis for making the classification This Was due to the fact that legal evidence necessary for establishing the cases beyond A I Generally speaking therefore the basis of the classification was that in cases where there was likelihood of getting sufficiently unimpeachable evidence as for instance in cases involving contravention of sections etc There is greater need fur taking deterrent measures in respect of these offences not think that there is any merit in the contention that the classification made in lA is discriminatory We set aside the order of <ORG> and allow the appeal
