grounds inter alia that <ORG> Officers were police officers within the meaning of that expression in of the Indian Evidence Act that confessional statements made to them were consequently inadmissible in evidence and that if they be excluded from consideration there was no other evidence to sustain the coviction A customs officer is a police officer qua his police functions and a confession made to him cannot be provided against a person accused of an offence RAGHUBAR DAYAL This appeal by special <ORG> leave raises the question whether a <ORG> Officer either under the Land <ORG> Act Act XIX of or under the Sea <ORG> Act Act VIII of is a In consequence of information received with respect to the smuggling of gold by the engine crew the <ORG> staff boarded the engine at Atari and other staff of the <ORG> surrounded the engine on its arrival at Amritsar to the effect the letter is the same which <NAME> had given to me yesterday On June <NAME> the respondent made certain other statements Ex On this occasion too he made a similar statement adding that he was to get Rs The conviction was confirmed by the appellate Court but was set aside on revision by <ORG> which held that <ORG> Officers were police officers within the meaning of that expression in of the Evidence Act that confessional statements made to them were consequently inadmissible in evidence and that if they be excluded from consideration there was no other evidence to sustain the conviction The only contention raised for the appellant in the appeal is that the <ORG> Officers to whom the confessional statements were made were not police officers within the meaning of that expression in of the Evidence Act It was contended that the mere fact that powers to arrest certain persons to make searches and to record evidence having a bearing on the alleged contravention of the legal provisions are conferred on certain officers of the <ORG> Department is not sufficient to make them police officers contemplated by of the Evidence Act even if it be assumed correct We may mention at this stage that the Officers to whom the respondent made confessional statements were Land Customs Officers appointed under the Land Customs Act purpose of the levy of duties of land customs under this Act in like manner as they apply for the purpose of the levy of duties of customs on goods imported or exported by sea Police whatever meaning be given to that word the preamble of the Act further says whereas it is expedient to reorganise the police and to make it a more efficient instrument for the prevention and detection of crime it is enacted as follows The authority given to police officers must naturally be to enable them to discharge their duties efficiently It is clear therefore in view of the nature of the duties imposed on the police officers the nature of the authority conferred and the purpose of the police Act that the powers which the police officers enjoy are powers for the effective prevention and detection of crime in order to maintain law and order prescribed thereunder apply for the purpose of levy of duties of and customs under the Land <ORG> Act in like manner as the apply for the purpose of levy of duties of customs on goods imported or exported by sea This makes it clear that the provisions conferring various powers on the Sea <ORG> Officers are for the purpose of levying and realization of duties of customs on goods and that those powers are conferred on the <ORG> customs officers also for the same purpose Apart from such an expression in of the Land <ORG> Act there are good reasons in support of the view that the powers conferred on the <ORG> Officers are different in character from those of the police officers for the detection and prevention of crime and that the powers conferred on them are merely for the purpose of ensuring that dutiable goods do not enter the country without payment of duty and that articles whose entry is prohibited are not brought in They have nothing to investigate about it Similarly the offence at item relates to a person making a false declaration It was said at It is clear on a perusal of the above pro visions that the powers of search arrest and detention are given to the Customs Authorities for the levy of sea customs duties an provision is made at the same time for a reference to the Magistrate in all cases where Further it was observed at It is true that the petitioners were dealt with by the Collector of <ORG> for the offence of smuggling were found guilty and a deterrent punish ment was imposed upon them but as he had not been vested with the powers of a Magistrate or a criminal court his proceedings against the petitioners were in the nature of <ORG> proceedings with a view to detecting the infringement of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act and imposing penalties when it was found that they had been guilty of those infringements Sections and of the Police Act provide for the appointment of special police officers who are not enrolled under the Act but are appointed for special occasions and have the same Powers privileges and protection and are liable to perform the same duties as the ordinary officer of the police There has however arisen a divergence of opinion about officers on whom some powers analogous to those of police officers have been conferred being police officers for the purpose of of the Evidence Act We now refer to certain aspects which lead us to consider that the expression police officer has not such a wide meaning as to include persons on whom certain police powers are conferred It is too much to suppose that the <ORG> did intend that all persons who may have to investigate or arrest persons or seize articles in pursuance of any particular law of which at the time it had no conception should be considered to be so unreliable that any confession made to them must be excluded just as a confession made to a regular police officer If it could not contemplate the later creation of offences or of agencies to take action in respect to them under future legislation it could not have intended the expression police officer to include officers entrusted in future with the duty of detecting and preventing smuggling and similar offences with the object of safeguarding the levying and recovery of <ORG> duties If the <ORG> had intended to use the expression police officer for such a wide purpose it would have used a more comprehensive expression is that in section of the Act in respect of an officer of the police there is a personal disability implied irrespective of the question whether be is holding an investigation or not while no such disability can be said to have been intended in the case of an excise officer Section provides that the officer adjudging confiscation shall take and hold posses sion of the thing confiscated and every officer of police on request of such officer shall assist him in taking and holding such possession Section A of the Act empowers the <ORG> Officer to summon any person to give evidence or to produce a document or any other thing in any enquiry which he be making in connection with the smuggling of any goods penalize the offender to any amount of fine and yet the and statements be held to be not admissible in evidence if they have to be used at a trial for a criminal offence in a regular Court of law We therefore allow the appeal set aside the order of acquittal of the respondent for the aforesaid offences and restore the order of conviction passed by the Magistrate and confirmed by the Sessions Judge Apart from the confessions alleged to have been made by the accused there was no other evidence to prove that they were guilty of the offence with which they were charged <ORG> accepting the contention held that if the statements were excluded there was no other evidence to sustain the conviction The State has preferred the present appeal against the acquittal of <NAME> Learned counsel for the <ORG> contended that <ORG> officials are not police officers within the meaning of of the Evidence Act and therefore the statements made by the respondents confessing their guilt were admissible in evidence and the convictions based thereon were sustainable The Indian Evidence Act Section No confession made to a police officer shall be proved as against a person accused of any offence All offences under any other law shall be investigated inquired into tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions but subject to any enactment for the time being in force regulating the manner of place of investigating inquiring into trying or otherwise dealing with such offences of the Code of Criminal Procedure also contemplates investigation of or inquiry into offences under other enactments regulating the manner or place of investigation that is if an act creates an offence and regulates the manner and place of investigation or inquiry in regard to the said offence the procedure proscribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure will give place to that provided in that Act It may mean any one of the following categories of officers i a police officer who is a member of the police force constituted under the Police Act ii though not a member of the police force constituted under the Police Act an officer who by statutory fiction is deemed to be a police officer in charge of a police station under the Code of Criminal Procedure and iii an officer oh whom a statute confers powers and imposes duties of a police officer under the Code of Criminal Procedure without describing him as a police officer or equating him by fiction to such an officer What was the meaning which the legislature intended to give to the term police officer at the time the said section was enacted That section was taken out of the Criminal Procedure Code Act of and inserted in the Evidence Act of as The salutary principle underlying the section would apply equally to other officers by whatever designation they may be known who have the power and duty to detect As the State power and duties increased manifold acts which were at one time considered to be innocuous and even praiseworthy have become offences and the police power of the State gradually began to operate on different subjects The question therefore in each case is does the officer under a particular Act exercise the powers and discharge the duties of prevention and detection of crime If lie does he will be a police officer There is a conflict of judicial opinion on the question raised <NAME> after considering the relevant provisions and the case law on the subject came to the following conclusion at After giving then my best attention to the arguments which have been addressed to us in my judgment we should hold that as <ORG> has deliberately conferred upon these Abkari officers substantially all the powers of a Police officer they have thereby in effect made them Police officers within the meaning of <NAME> stated much to the same effect at It seems to me a perfectly fair interpretation of section to say that the <ORG> officer within the meaning of that section is an officer who exercises the powers of police conferred upon him by law whether he is called a <ORG> officer or he is called by any other name and exercises other functions also under other provisions of law He is a <ORG> officer within the meaning of section if in the investigation of offences under particular Act he exercises the powers of an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence conferred upon him by that Act It is true that of the Bombay Abkari Act stated Every such officer shall in the conduct of such investigation exercise the powers conferred by the Code of Criminal Procedure upon an officer in charge of a police station for the investigation of a cognizable offence <NAME> who delivered the leading judgment after scrutinizing the relevant provisions and the cases concluded his discussion thus at It is the nature of the duties performance of which was likely to give occasion for improper influences being exercised or felt and not any particular aversion for a particular department of public service that must have moved the legislature in enacting the provision <NAME> in a separate judgment came to the same conclusion and he stated at thus Since not only have new off noes been created by later Acts but new bodies of officers have been created who are vested with powers of police with regard to these offenses Then the learned Judge posed the question Would that make any difference to the application of the section to these officers and answered it thus at The words police officer may be plain but they are not defined in the Evidence Act On the other band it is quite consistent with the scheme of the Act that person who exercises the powers of a police officer should be hit by the prohibitive provision of section <NAME> made the following observations at There is no exhaustive definition of the expression Police Officer in any of our statutes In the absence of a statutory definition and apart from all authority one would be tempted to say that a police officer is a person whom any statute or other provision of law calls such or on whom it confers all or substantially all the powers and imposes the duties of a police officer If he is expressly called a police officer there is no difficulty whatsoever A police officer does not cease to be such merely because he is put into a white khadder uniform instead of one in khaki drill a medicine will be just the same whether it is packaged in a glass jar or a plastic container This passage in my view lays down with clarity the real test for determining whether a particular officer is a police officer or not within the meaning of a statute With at respect to the learned Judges who decided that case I think that they looked too narrowly at the appearance of things and declined to look at the substance behind the appearance The fact that that Ordinance by reference to the Code of Criminal Procedure conferred powers on the Commercial Tax Officers but the Sea <ORG> Act conferred similar powers not by reference to any Code but by express enactment could not make any difference in the application of the principle though powers of prevention and detection were conferred on a <ORG> Officer no powers of investigation was given to him If a literal meaning is given to the term police officer indicating thereby an officer designated as police officer it will lead to anomalous results An officer designated as a police officer even though he does not discharge the well understood police functions will be hit by of the Evidence Act whereas an officer not so designated but who has all the powers of a police officer would not be hit by that section with the result the object of the section would be defeated The intermediate position namely that an officer can be a police officer only if powers and duties pertaining to an officer in charge of a police station within the meaning of the Code of Criminal Procedure are entrusted to him would also lead to an equally anomalous position for it would exclude from its operation a case of an officer on whom specific powers and functions are conferred under specific statutes without reference to the Code of Criminal Procedure A police officer within the meaning of of the Evidence Act may be defined thus An officer by whatever designation he is called on whom a statute substantially confers the powers and imposes the duties of the police is a police officer within the meaning of of the Evidence Act Section of the Sea <ORG> Act opens out with the following words The offences mentioned in the first column of the following schedule shall be punishable to the extent mentioned in the third column of the same with reference to such offences respectively Chapter XVI of the Act deals with offences and penalties Chapter XVII prescribes the procedure relating to Offences appeals etc Section confers on an officer of <ORG> duly employed in the prevention of smuggling the power to search on reasonable suspicion any person on board of any vessel in any port in India or within the Indian customs waters or any person who has landed from any vessel Section empowers such officer to board a vessel for searching it an order to ascertain whether any breach of the Act or any other law relating to customs has been or is being or is likely to be committed Section A which was inserted by Act of gives power to the said officer to summon persons to give evidence and produce documents presumably to facilitate investigation of the offence The said sections therefore create offences and for the purpose of prevention and detection of such offences confer specific powers on the <ORG> officers to search persons or places to arrest persons suspected of such offences and to make necessary investigation in respect thereof The <ORG> officers under the Act have the powers and they also discharge the functions of police officers and therefore they are police officers for the purpose of the Evidence Act in so far as they exercise or discharge such powers and functions If so it follows that a confession made to him cannot be proved against a person accused of an offence
