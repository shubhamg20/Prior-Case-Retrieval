The warrant of goods recites anticipatively that the <ORG> has granted to the trader an advance and contains undertakings to hold produce with the consent of the trader who had to sign the document on behalf of the <ORG> as security for the advance not to deliver up possession of the produce except under the written directions of the <ORG> and to affix labels on or near the produce so as to identify it as the <ORG> security If satisfied the <ORG> would then make an advance to the trader the trader signing in favour of the <ORG> a letter of hypothecation which after acknowledging the warrant of goods as constituting a security for the advance authorised the <ORG> in default of payment to sell and a promissory note for the amount of the advance The facts which gave rise to the present litigation may now be stated The District Judge who tried the case dealt with a multitude of issues some sixteen in number He found that there was no agreement by <NAME> to deliver the rice on payment of the contract price of the bags The learned Judge in the first place held that whatever might have been the real authority of <NAME> as between himself and the <ORG> in regard to parting with rice which was still subject to the <ORG> security persons dealing with the mill assumed that <NAME> had the full power of an ordinary mill manager which would include the power to deliver rice and to deal with delivery orders It is unnecessary for their Lordships to say whether this ruling fits in with the actual facts of this case but they understand it to mean that as between the <ORG> and the plaintiffs the <ORG> were bound by and estopped from denying the truth of representations made to the plaintiffs by <NAME> was the operation of the lien the effect of which is waived by the letters In other words I take the view that the second part of the estoppel consists of an estoppel of a principal by the waiver of his agent in this case the estoppel of <ORG> by the waiver of <NAME> It is a rule of evidence which comes into operation if a a statement of the existence of a fact has been made by the defendant or an authorised agent of his to the plaintiff or some one on his behalf with the intention that the plaintiff should act upon the faith of the statement and the plaintiff does act upon the faith of the statement On the other hand waiver is contractual and may constitute a cause of action it is an agreement to release or not to assert a right If an agent with authority to make such an agreement on behalf of his principal agrees to waive his principal rights then subject to any other question such as consideration the principal will be bound but he will be bound by contract not by estoppel There is no such thing as estoppel by waiver The learned Judge accepting the view that the arrangement was that the plaintiffs should do business with <NAME> on the same lines as <ORG> did business with <NAME> held that because <NAME> did not tell the plaintiffs that the letters on their delivery orders bore a different meaning from the meaning which they bore on <ORG> delivery orders the <ORG> were estopped from denying that they had the same meaning that the details contained in those documents were correctly given in other words they constituted a statement by <NAME> that there was at the mill the specified number of bags of the specified rice with the specified mark and of the specified weight the property of <NAME> This was a statement which <NAME> was entitled to make and it therefore binds the <ORG> but it is in no wise a statement that the rice is unencumbered There is complete absence of any evidence that <NAME> when he paid the money to <NAME> relied upon the presence of the letters on the delivery orders or bills and this is an essential element in establishing the plaintiffs plea of estoppel The only defendants then were first defendant <NAME> second defendant Mr <NAME> and third defendant Mr <NAME> and so constituted the suit was tried the suit being dismissed against the second and third defendants with costs by a decree dated October If these considerations had been kept in mind the present tangle could never have arisen Their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty that this appeal should be allowed the decree of <ORG> set aside and the decree of the District Judge restored without variation The respondents must pay the appellants costs of the appeal to <ORG> and of this appeal
