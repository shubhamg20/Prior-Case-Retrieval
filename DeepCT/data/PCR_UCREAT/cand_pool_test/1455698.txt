Section of the Act provides that the trade markmay be registered in respect of any or all of the goods comprised in a prescribed Class of goods In appeal by the respondent the learned single judge however took a different view and held that the word SAFI cannot be held to bedescriptive of the quality or the character of the goods of the respondent andon that finding he granted to the respondent trade mark to be registered inpart of the register Section lays down the requisites for registration in Parts A and of the register and by Clause provides that a trade mark shall notbe registered in Part A of the register unless it contains or consists of at leastone or more words having no direct reference to the character or quality ofthe goods There is also equally no doubt that it is notthe only meaning of the word SAFI and as it was even noticed by the Registrar the word SAFI also means cloth which is used for straining beveragesand medicines Now even Mr <NAME> did not disputethat if the word used was SAFAI or SAF which also means pure clear he could not dispute that these words would have direct reference to thecharacter and quality of the goods of the respondent There was no evidence led before theRegistrar to show that any other manufacturer of medicinal preparation wasalso using the trade mark SAFI for similar goods There was also no evidence led before the Registrar that the word SAFI has been used by someother trader and the respondents user was with a view to make a dishonestuser of the same so as to take unfair advantage Thereare words which have a direct relation to the character and quality ofgoods which nevertheless may lose their primary meaning and acquire in aparticular trade a Secondary meaning as indicating to people interested whether as traders or as the public in trade the goods of a particular manufacturer It is therefore possible that there may be some words whichthough they may have reference to the character and quality of goods yethave over a course of period become associated with the goods of aparticular trader and in that sense they would certainly be capable of distinguishing the goods of a particular trader and which would satisfy the test of of the Act and would be entitled to be registered in Part of the register We thus have come to the same conclusion as thelearned single judge though for different reasons with the result that theappeal will have to be dismissed which we do but with no order as to costs
