As the hoteliers in the State raised a hue and cry <ORG> effected an upward revision of the prices fixed by an Amending Order dated December If power to control prices of raw foodstuffs such as rice or wheat in conferred by there is no justification for that power not comprehending within its fold the power to regulate prices of articles made out of such raw foodstuffs a The mechanics of price fixation has necessarily to be left to the judgment of the executive and unless it is patent that there is hostile discrimination against a class of operators the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid The petitioners have not shown that in their overall turnover they have since the promulgation of impugned orders suffered losses Order for short dated September whereby it was made obligatory for the catering establishments to display the prices of all foodstuffs served by the establishment and simultaneously fixed the maximum price of seven items of food comprising the poorman menu in the State of Andhra Pradesh There were consequential provisions such as power to issue directions power to call for information power of entry search seizure and power to grant exemption as also power to amend the Schedule It seems some further negotiations took place between the Minister of Civil Supplies and Labour on the one hand and hoteliers on the other which led to a notification dated January Order for short giving further upward revision in maximum price of scheduled items and the scheduled items were reduced from to deleting rice place Ignoring this latest order which replaced the earlier orders the petitioners approached this <ORG> and obtained an ex parte stay of the implementation of Orders dated September and December Dr <NAME> who led on behalf of the petitioners made two submissions which have nothing to do with the validity or legality of the impugned Orders He next submitted that there are certain directions in the and orders which are impossible of compliance and therefore the petitioners should be heard before they are compelled to implement the conditions What transpired at this meeting may be extracted from the counter affidavit The Minister for Civil Supplies therefore convened a meeting at Hyderabad on with the representatives of hoteliers all over the State and the Joint Collectors A copy of the undertaking is produced at Annexure to the counter affidavit which inter alia also provided that the rates of the scheduled items determined with the consent of the hoteliers will be reviewed after three months There is not a whisper about it in the agreement Annexure and we do not find anything very unusual or impracticable in the conditions prescribed in the impugned orders Mr <NAME> who appeared for some of the petitioners urged that <ORG> is not competent to issue any price control measure in respect of cooked food because the Essential Commodities Act which confers power to issue orders in respect of essential commodities does not confer any power to issue any order in respect of cooked food of Essential Commodities Act confers power on <ORG> by an order to provide for regulating or prohibiting the production distribution and supply and trade in essential commodity or for securing their equitable distribution and availability at fair prices The power to fix price of essential commodity is implicit in the power conferred by Sec We see no justification for giving a restricted meaning to the expression foodstuffs we see no justification for that power not comprehending within its fold the power to regulate prices of articles made out of such raw foodstuffs After examining the definition of expression foodstuffs in <ORG> and Webster International Dictionary and some decisions bearing on the subject this Court held that the expressions food and foodstuffs can be used in both a wide and a narrow sense and that the circumstances and background can alone determine which is proper in any given case Accordingly it was held that the expression foodstuffs has been used in a wider sense in Act For this malaise petitioners have to thank themselves because it was an integral part of their agreement with <NAME> on December that the maximum prices fixed by the impugned orders would be re examined on the expiration of the three months from the date of the agreement We would however reject the contention about the mechanics of price fixation on the short ground that petitioners ordinarily do not serve only the scheduled items but they have large establishments catering to various tastes and delicacies Petitioners have not shown that in their over all turnover they have since the promulgation of impugned orders suffered losses And we reject this contention for the additional reason as laid down by a Constitution Bench of seven learned Judges of this <ORG> in <ORG> etc <ORG> where <NAME> observed as under In the ultimate analysis the mechanics of price fixation has necessarily to be left to the judgment of the executive and unless it is patent that there is hostile discrimination against a class of operators the processual basis of price fixation has to be accepted in the generality of cases as valid However the entire notification fixing the price of the menu of the poormen was put under suspended animation leaving the hoteliers to extort any price to suit their greed Now that we are dismissing these petitions and vacate the stay orders the notification fixing the maximum prices will revive and can be enforced of the Constitution and there is no way of depriving this unjust enrichment The <ORG> set up for justice including socio economic justice unfortunately lent its assistance to such unjust enrichment and yet we are helpless For the reasons herein discussed we find no merits in any of the contentions canvassed on behalf of the petitioners and therefore these petitions fail and they are dismissed with costs in each
