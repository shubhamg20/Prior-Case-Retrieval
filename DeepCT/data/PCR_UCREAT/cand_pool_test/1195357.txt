Validity of legislation is not to be judged merely by affidavits filed on behalf of the <ORG> but by all the relevant circumstances which the court may ultimately find out and more especially by what may be gathered from what the legislature has itself said <ORG>s are not really concerned with the hollowness or the self condemnatory nature of the statements made in the affidavits filed by the respondents to justify and sustain the legislation The deponents of the affidavits filed into court may speak for the parties on whose behalf they swear to the statements The Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act is a legislation for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principle specified in Article of the Constitution and is therefore immune under Article from attack on the ground that it offends the fundamental right guaranteed by Article At that stage of the rationalisation and nationalisation of the coal mining industry it was apparently thought necessary and sufficient to nationalise such coke oven plants as were in or belonged to the nationalised coking coal mines or as were identified as located near the nationalised coking coal mines leaving out all other coke oven plants The object of the coking coal Mines Nationalisation Act is to recognise and reconstruct coking coal mines and coke oven plants for the purpose of protecting conserving and promoting scientific development of the resources of coking coal needed to meet the growing requirements of <ORG> and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto The requirements of the Iron and Steel industry are recognised as Growing requirements and it is found necessary to protect conserve and promote the scientific development of resources of coking coal so as to meet those growing requirements The Act is contemplating the future If the object of the Act is to provide for the future it does not make any difference if in the past or in the present the hard coke produced by the nationalised coking coal mines is diverted elsewhere than <ORG> There has been no such infringement as could be seen from the facts of the right guaranteed under Article Nor can any inference be drawn of discrimination from the circumstance that subsequently eighty seven new coke oven plants have been allowed to come up Obviously there is demand for hard coke from industries other than the iron and steel industry and normally the <ORG> does not want to stifle those industries by making it difficult for them to obtain their requirements especially since the production of the Nationalised Coke Oven Plants has first to meet the requirements of the iron and steel industry The expression material resources of the community means all things which are capable of producing wealth for the community There is no warrant for interpreting the expression in so narrow a fashion as to confine it to public owned material resources and exclude private owned material resources in which it was expressly ruled that Article as it stood at that time i as inserted by the Constitution Twenty fifth Amendment Act was constitutionally valid No doubt the protection of Article was at that time confined to law giving effect to the policy of the clauses and of Article By the Constitution Forty Second Amendment Act the protection was extended to all laws giving effect to all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV The dialectics the logic and the rationale involved in upholding the validity of Article when it confined its protection to laws enacted to further Article or Article should uncompromisingly lead to the same resolute conclusion that Article with its extended protection is also constitutionally valid It cannot also be said that the nature of the Directive Principles enunciated in other Articles of Part IV of the Constitution is so drastic or different from the Directive Principle in clauses and of Article that the extension of constitutional immunity to laws made to further those principles would afford the basic structure of the constitution Any observations made to the contrary in <ORG> case may be held to be obiter If Article is not offended no one need give any immunity from an attack based on Article If the law was aimed at the broader egalitarianism of the Directive Principles Article protected the law from needless unending and rancourous debate on the question whether the law contravened Article concept of equality before the law There is no scope for bringing in Article by a side wind as it were that is by equating the rule of equality before the law of Article with the broad egalitarianism of Article or by treating the principle of Article as included in the principle of Article There was no separate legislation providing for the take over of all coke oven plants but as a part of the legislation to take over coking coal mines such coke oven plants were also nationalised When a citizen is deprived of his property by a <ORG> action and feels aggrieved by the act of the <ORG> and approaches the <ORG> and if it cannot be said that his grievance is absolutely frivolous the citizen in such a case should not be saddled with the costs simply because the <ORG> finds that his grievance has no valid legal basis The following Judgment were delivered <ORG> In these cases <ORG> and <NAME> representing <ORG> question the nationalisation of the Coke Oven Plants belonging to them Act which provided for the taking over of the management of coking coal mines and coke oven plants pending nationalisation of such mines and plants This aspect of the matter will be considered in slightly greater detail when we refer to the provisions of the Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act It was apparently thought necessary and desirable that the management of such coke oven plants also should be taken over Next The Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act was enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the right title and interest of the owner of the coking coal mines specified in the First Schedule and the right title and interest of the owners of such coke oven plants as are in or about the said coking coal mines with a view to reorganising and reconstructing such mines and plants for the purpose of protecting conserving and promoting scientific development of the resources of coking coal needed to meet the growing requirements of the iron and steel industry and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto Mine is defined by to mean any excavation where any operation for the purpose of searching for or obtaining minerals has been or is being carried on and to include among other things Apparently it was not thought sufficient to acquire the coke oven plants in the acquired mines or belonging to the owners of the acquired mines but it was thought necessary also to acquire the coke oven plants which were near about the acquired mines The learned judges appear to have thought that there was a dichotomy between the word mine on the one hand and the words coke oven plant on the other and that was why separate provision was made in the same Act for the nationalisation of mines and coke oven plants In this view we think that there is no substance in the submission on behalf of the appellant <ORG> that mine by definition includes coke oven We are afraid we are unable to agree with the view expressed by <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> As already mentioned by us there were in existence coke oven plants in or about coking coal mines some of which belonged to the owners of the mines and some to persons other than the owners of the mines There was no separate legislation providing for the take over of all coke oven plants but as a part of the legislation to take over coking coal mines such coke oven plants as were in or about the mines were also nationalised After the Coal Mines Taking over of management Act came the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act which was enacted to provide for the acquisition and transfer of the right title and interest of the owners in respect of the coal mines specified in the schedule with a view to re organising and re constructing such coal mines so as to ensure the rational coordinated and scientific development and utilisation of coal resources consistent with the growing requirements of the country in order that the ownership and control of such resources are vested in the <ORG> and thereby so distributed as best to subserve the common good and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto But there are no provisions in the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act corresponding to Section of and the Second Schedule to the Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act to cover coke oven plants which are situated near the coal mines but which do not belong to the owners of the mines The principal question for consideration therefore is whether the Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act is entitled to the protection of Art of the Constitution Art of the Constitution which was introduced by the Twenty fifth Amendment Act as it stood before the Forty second Amendment provided Notwithstanding anything contained in Article no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in cl or cl of Art was extended not merely to laws giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in cl or of Art but to laws giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV of the Constitution The decision of the <ORG> in <ORG> was strongly relied upon by <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioners to support his submissions regarding what he claimed was the true content and interpretation of Art which provides immunity to the Acts and Regulations specified in the Ninth Schedule from attack based on inconsistency with the Fundamental Rights was challenged and that question therefore directly arose for consideration Article of the Constitution which had been introduced into the Constitution by the Constitution Twenty fifth Amendment Act expressly provided that Notwithstanding anything contained in article no law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in cl or cl of Art it was necessary for the petitioners to challenge the Constitutional validity of the Constitution Twenty fifth Amendment Act by which Art It was so conceded too by the Learned counsel who appeared for the petitioner in the <ORG> case No question regarding the constitutional validity of of the Constitutional Forty second Amendment Act arose for consideration in the case firstly because the immunity from attack given to a law giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principles specified in cl or cl of Art was given by the Constitution Twenty fifth Amendment Act itself and secondly because the Sick Textile Undertakings Nationalisation Act had been enacted before the Constitution Forty second Amendment Act We have serious reservations on the question whether it is open to a <ORG> to answer academic or hypothetical questions on such considerations particularly so when serious constitutional issues are involved as it stood at that time was constitutionally valid was at that time confined to laws giving effect to the policy of the cls By the Constitution Forty second amendment Act the protection was extended to all laws giving effect to all or any of the principles laid down in Part IV We wish to say no more about the <ORG> case as we are told that there is pending a petition to review the judgment Thirdly notwithstanding the strong reliance placed upon <ORG> by the learned counsel for the petitioners we are not really concerned with the decision in that case since that is not the point at issue before us On these questions it was submitted there was no difference between the views of the majority of the Judges who decided <ORG> and the dissenting Judge He particularly invited our attention to the following observations of <NAME> at pp It will therefore be seen that if a law is enacted for the purpose of giving effect to a Directive Principle and it imposes a restriction on a Fundamental Right it would be difficult to condemn such restriction as unreasonable or not in public interest So also where a law is enacted for giving effect to a Directive Principle in furtherance of the constitutional goal of social and economic justice it may conflict with a formalistic and doctrinaire view of equality before the law but it would almost always conform to the principle of equality before the law in its total magnitude and dimension because the equality clause in the Constitution does not speak of more formal equality before the law but embodies the concept of real and substantive equality which strikes at inequalities arising on account of vast social and economic differentials and is consequently an essential ingredient of social and economic justice The dynamic principle of egalitarianism fertilisers the concept of social and economic justice it is one of its essential elements and there can be no real social and economic justice where there is a breach of the egalitarian principle If therefore there is a law enacted by the legislature which is really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle with a view to promoting social and economic justice it would be difficult to say that such law violates the principle of egalitarianism and is not in accord with the principle of equality before the law as understood not in its strict and formalistic sense but in its dynamic and activist magnitude In the circumstances the <ORG> would not be unjustified in making the presumption that a law enacted really and genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle in furtherance of the cause of social and economic justice would not infringe any Fundamental Right under Article or If this be the correct interpretation of the constitutional provisions as I think it is the amended Article does no more than codify the existing position under the constitutional scheme by providing immunity to a law enacted really ann genuinely for giving effect to a Directive Principle so that needlessly futile and time consuming controversy whether such law contravenes Article or is eliminated To determine whether a law satisfies this test the court would have to examine the pith and substance the true nature and character of the law as also its design and the subject matter dealt with by it together with its object and scope But if the court finds that the law though passed seemingly for giving effect to a Directive Principle is in pith and substance The point I wish to emphasize is that the amended Article does not give protection to a law which has merely some remote or tenuous connection with a Directive Principle Where therefore protection is claimed in respect of a statute under the amended Article the court would have first to determine whether there is real and substantial connection between the law and a Directive Principle and the predominant object of the law is to give effect to such Directive Principle and if the answer to this question is in the affirmative the court would then have to consider which are the provisions of the law basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to the Directive Principle and give protection of the amended Article only to those provisions The question whether any particular provision of the law is basically and essentially necessary for giving effect to the Directive Principle would depend to a large extent on how closely and integrally such provision is connected with the implementation of the Directive Principle That is how we understand <NAME> observations There is no scope for bringing in Art To illustrate a law which prescribes that every landholder must surrender twenty percent of his holding as well as a law which prescribes that no one shall hold land in excess of acres may both satisfy the ritual requirements of Art We are therefore not prepared to accept the submission of <NAME> that any law seeking the protection of Art First there was legislation in regard to the coking coal mines and then there was legislation in regard to all coal mines coking as well as non coking At that stage of the rationalisation and nationalisation of the coal mining industry it was apparently thought necessary and sufficient to nationalise such coke oven plants as were in or belonged to the nationalised coking coal mines or as were identified as located near the nationalised coking coal mines leaving out all other coke oven plants The nationalisation of the coking coal mines and the coke oven plants was with a view to reorganising and reconstructing such mines and plants for the purpose of protecting conserving and promoting scientific development of the resources of coking coal needed to meet the growing requirements of the iron and steel industry and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto We do not entertain the slightest doubt that the nationalisation of the coking coal mines and the specified coke oven plants for the above purpose was towards securing that the ownership and control of the material resource of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good A law providing for acquisition was not a law for distribution The expression material resources of the community means all things which are capable of producing wealth for the community There is no warrant for interpreting the expression in so narrow a fashion as suggested by <NAME> and confine it to public owned material resources and exclude private owned material resources Nor do we understand the word distribute to be used in Art It is used in a wider sense so as to take in all manner and method of distribution such as distribution between regions distribution between industries distribution between classes and distribution between public private and joint sectors Its meaning given in Black Legal Dictionary is Money or any property that can be converted into supplied means of raising money or supplies capabilities of raising wealth or to supply necessary wants available means or capability of any kind The object of the Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act is to reorganize and reconstruct coking coal mines and coke oven plants for the purpose of protecting conserving and promoting scientific development of the resources of coking coal needed to meet the growing requirements of <ORG> and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto The requirements of <ORG> are recognized as growing requirements and it is found necessary to protect conserve and promote the scientific development of resources of coking coal so as to meet those growing requirements The design of nationalisation as it appears from the statute itself including the preamble is that the increasing future demands of the iron and steel industry are to be met by the nationalised coke oven plants and demands of other industry are to be met by the non nationalised and new coke oven plants That the iron and steel industry is not now utilising the hard coke produced by the nationalised coke oven plants is not material since the industry is expected to expand its requirements of hard coke are expected to grow and the nationalised coke oven plants are to be harnessed and be in readiness to meet those requirements In view of the foregoing discussion we hold that the Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act is a legislation for giving effect to the policy of the <ORG> towards securing the principle specified in Art But we do not also see that there is any merit in the attack based on Art The facts that we are able to gather from the several affidavits filed in the case are like this In the beginning that is when <ORG> Nationalisation Act was passed there were in existence seventy five coke oven plants From the additional affidavit filed by <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> it transpires that when the Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act was passed fourteen coke oven plants were left out as they were not situated in or about coking coal mines but they were expected to be nationalised when the coal mines in which they were located or to which they belonged were to be nationalised by the Coal Mines Nationalisation Act Nor can we draw any inference of discrimination from the circumstance that subsequently eighty seven new coke even plants have been allowed to come up Obviously there is demand for hard coke from industries other than the iron and steel industry and naturally the state does not want to stifle those industries by making it difficult for them to obtain their requirements especially since the production of the Nationalised Coke oven plants has first to meet the requirements of the iron and steel industry <NAME> <NAME> drew pointed attention to the earlier affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> and commented severally on the alleged contradictory reasons given therein for the exclusion of certain coke oven plants from the Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act But in the ultimate analysis we are not really to concern ourselves with the hollowness or the self condemnatory nature of the statements made in the affidavits filed by the respondents to justify and sustain the legislation The deponents of the affidavits filed into <ORG> may speak for the parties on whose behalf they swear to the statement The executive <ORG> may place before the court their understanding of what <ORG> has said or intended to say or what they think was <ORG> object and all the facts and circumstances which in their view led to the legislation No Act of <ORG> may be struck down because of the understanding or misunderstanding of <ORG>ary intention by the executive government or because their the <ORG> spokesmen do not bring out relevant circumstances but indulge in empty and self defeating affidavits They do not and they cannot bind <ORG> Validity of legislation is not to be judged merely by affidavits filed on behalf of the <ORG> but by all the relevant circumstances which the court may ultimately find and more especially by what may be gathered from what the legislature has itself said We have mentioned the facts as found by us and we do not think that there has been any infringement of the right guaranteed by Art The submission of the petitioners would suggest that there were two coke oven plants one belonging to the New Sudamdih mine and the other belonging to <ORG> and that as a result of the mixing up of the names of the plant and owner the coke oven plant belonging to the petitioners has been taken over It is submitted on behalf of the respondents that there was only one coke oven plant and that as it did not belong to the owners of the mine it had to be included separately in the Second Schedule If it was part of the mine or if it belonged to the owners of the mine there was no need to include it separately in the Second Schedule That there has never been any real doubt about the identity of the coke oven plant that was meant to be taken over and in fact taken over is clear from the very statements in the affidavit filed on behalf of the petitioners Your petitioner states that the name of your petitioner coke oven plant has been wrongly given in the second schedule to the said Act We do not think there is any possible doubt about the identity of the coke oven plant shown as Item No in the second schedule to the Coking Coal Mines Nationalisation Act <NAME> I have had the benefit of reading in advance the judgment of my learned Brother <NAME> All the material facts have been set out in the judgment of my learned brother who has also carefully considered all the arguments which were advanced from the <ORG> I entirely agree with these observations In these writ petitions the validity of the inclusion of the coke oven plants belonging to the petitioners in the second schedule has been challenged mainly on the ground that other coke oven plants standing in exactly the same position as the coke oven plants of the petitioners were left out and had not been nationalised My learned brother on a consideration of the facts and circumstances of the case and the submissions made on behalf of the respective parties has come to the conclusion that there is no merit in the attack based on Art I must frankly confess that I had doubts in my mind as to the legality of the nationalisation of the coke oven plants of the petitioners in view of the discrimination alleged But on an anxious and very careful consideration of the matter I have come to the conclusion that in the facts and circumstances of this case it cannot be said that there has been any such discrimination as infringe Art At that stage of the rationalisation and nationalisation of the coal mining industry it was apparently thought necessary and sufficient to nationalise such coke oven plants as were in or belonged to the nationalised coking coal mines or as were identified as located near the nationalised coking coal mines leaving out all other coke oven plants The nationalisation of the coking coal mines and the coke oven plants was with a view to reorganising and reconstructing such mines and plants for the purpose of protecting conserving and promoting scientific development of the resources of coking coal needed to meet the growing requirements of the iron and steel industry and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto We do not entertain the slightest doubt that the nationalisation of the coking coal mines and the specified coke oven plants for the above purpose was towards securing that the ownership and control of the material resources of the community are so distributed as best to subserve the common good I agree with these observations To my mind therefore there was a logical basis for the nationalisation of the coke oven plants of the petitioners leaving out a few and I am not satisfied that there has been any rank or arbitrary discrimination in violation of Art I agree with my learned brother that these writ petitions must fail and should be dismissed To my mind however when a citizen is deprived of his property by a State action and feels aggrieved by the act of the State and approaches the <ORG> and if it cannot be said that his grievance is absolutely frivolous the citizen in such a case should not be saddled with the costs simply because the <ORG> finds that his grievance has no valid legal basis
