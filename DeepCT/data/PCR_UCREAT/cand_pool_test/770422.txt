HEADNOTE Before of the Indian Penal Code can be applied the court must find with certainty that there were at least live persons sharing the common object This was about Just as he left the house his wife <NAME> heard cries of alarm and on rushing out with her daughter Mst Before section can be called in aid the court must find with certainty that there were at least five persons sharing the common object There are cases and cases In fairness to the learned Judges we have examined the evidence with care to see whether if that was in their minds such a conclusion could be reached in this particular case on the evidence here The murder took place in daylight and within a few feet of the two eye witnesses If the witnesses had said I know there were five assailants and I am certain of A and I am not certain of the other two but think they were and a conviction of A and provided the witnesses are believed would be proper But when the witnesses are in no doubt either about the number or the identity and there is no suggestion about mistaken identity and when further the circumstances shut out any reasonable possibility of that then hesitation on the part of the Judge can only be ascribed not to any doubt about identity but to doubt about the number taking part It is true when feelings run high and there is personal cause for enmity that there is a tendency to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has a grudge along with the guilty but foundation must be laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of relationship far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of truth There is no such general rule Now what is the ground for suspecting the testimony of these two witnesses The only other reason given by the learned <ORG> Judges is that they have introduced a false element into their story at the instigation of the police in order to save the face of the lambardars But if that is so it throws a cloak of unreliability over the whole of their testimony and therefore though it may be safe to accept their story where the corroborative element of the blood stained clothes is to be found it would be as unsafe to believe on the strength of their testimony that at least five persons were present as it would be to accept that the ones who have been acquitted were present and once we reach that conclusion section drops out of the case <NAME> husband and the accused <NAME> and <NAME> but that was not followed up by other evidence and neither <NAME> nor <NAME> suggests that there was any such dispute in their examinations under section Criminal Procedure Code The questions put in cross examination therefore remain just shots in the dark and leave the testimony of the two women unimpaired Next the bloodstained clothes found on the persons of the four appellants afford strong corroboration as against them and as two courts have believed the witnesses to that extent all we need do is to concentrate on the other three accused who have been acquitted in order to see whether there were seven persons as Mst It is certainly a circumstance to be taken into consideration that these weapons should be found in the field of a man who was named from the start But when their stories find corroboration on so many important particulars we see no reason why they should be disbelieved as regards <NAME> always remembering that these are not witnesses who require corroboration under the law In our opinion <ORG> was unnecessarily cautious in acquitting the other three accused when the learned Judges were convinced that at least five persons were concerned We have taken into consideration the fact that <ORG> considers that the portion of Mst On that finding the conviction under section read with section can be sustained We accordingly uphold these convictions But the discretion is his and if he gives reasons on which a judicial mind could properly found an appellate court should not interfere In cases where the facts are more fully known and it is possible to determine who inflicted blows which were fatal and who took a lesser part it is a sound exercise of judicial discretion to discriminate in the matter of punishment We make it plain that a Judge is not bound to do so for he has as much right to exercise his discretion one way as the other It is impossible to lay down a hard and fast rule for each case must depend on its own facts They give no reasons and dispose of the matter in one sentence as follows I would dismiss the appeals of the other four and accepting the revision petitions change their sentences from transportation to death
