Notices were issued to the parties concerned in the dispute as provided in Section of the Code and both parties appeared filed written statements affidavits of evidence and documents in support of their respective claims By his order dated the Sub divisional Magistrate attached the properties in dispute under Section of the Code of Criminal procedure and forwarded the record of the proceedings to <ORG> having jurisdiction to decide the question whether any and which of the parties was in possession of the subject of the dispute His order is in the following terms There is no sufficient or reliable evidence before me to decide as to which party was in actual physical possession of the lands at the time this proceeding was started I am therefore unable to decide the issue of possession over the disputed lands In these circumstances the learned <NAME> returned the records to the Sub divisional Magistrate on with the following observation Neither party takes any steps even today Several dates have been given to the parties but no one turns up on their behalf Having come to know of the reference being returned to the learned Sub divisional Magistrate the petitioner made an application to the learned Sub divisional Magistrate on praying for appointment of a receiver till the decision of the case and also for suitable action for decision in accordance with law Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner put forward the argument that after the receipt of the reference under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure the <NAME> is bound to give a decision on the question of possession and that it was incompetent for the <NAME> to return the records back to the Magistrate Learned counsel pointed out that under Section or for the matter of that under any other section of the Code of Criminal Procedure there is no provision for return of the reference by the <NAME> to the Magistrate concerned His further contention was that if the parties did not choose to adduce any evidence in spite cf the opportunity being afforded to them the proper course for the <NAME> was to decide the question of possession on the materials already on the record and deliberate refusal by the parties to contest before the <NAME> or default of their appearance before him will not involve either rejection of the reference or its return to the Magistrate concerned Mr <NAME> appearing for the opposite party however contended that in the circumstances the course adopted by the learned <NAME> was the only proper course that could have been adopted and the <ORG> should not be kept at the mercy of the parties Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure is as follows If the Magistrate is of opinion that none of the parties was then in such possession or is unable to decide as to which of them was then in such possession of the subject of dispute he may attach it and draw up a statement of the facts of the case and forward the record of the proceeding to a Civil Court of competent jurisdiction to decide the question whether any and which of the parties was in possession of the subject of dispute at the date of the order as explained in Sub section of Section and he shall direct the parties to appear before <ORG> on a date to be fixed by him Provided that the District Magistrate or the Magistrate who has attached the subject of dispute may withdraw the attachment at any time if he is satisfied that there is no longer any likelihood of a breach of the peace in regard to the subject of dispute A On receipt of any such reference <ORG> shall peruse the evidence on record and take such further evidence as may be produced by the parties respectively consider the effect of all such evidence and after hearing the parties decide the question of possession so referred to it No appeal shall lie from any finding of <ORG> given on a reference under this section nor shall any review or revision of any such finding be allowed An order under this section shall be subject to any subsequent decision of a Court cf competent jurisdiction Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for cases where the Magistrate is of opinion that none of the parties wag in possession or is unable to decide as to which of them was in possession on the date of the initiation of the proceeding under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure In case of such uncertainty or inability of the Magistrate to come to any precise conclusion about possession a reference to <ORG> for the limited purpose of deciding the question of possession becomes necessary <ORG> on receipt of such reference shall peruse the evidence on record and take such further evidence as may be produced by ihe parties respectively The question that falls for consideration is what <ORG> will do in case the parties do not appear before him The further question that arises in this connection is whether it is incumbent oh <ORG> to take fresh evidence before deciding the question of possession This position is made perfectly clear by the opening words of Section A On receipt of any such reference <ORG> shall peruse the evidence on record and take such further evidence as may be produced by the parties respectively It is obvious that after a reference is made to <ORG> when the Magistrate finds it difficult to decide the question of possession on the materials as required by Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure there is always some evidence of possession before <ORG> If the parties do not choose to produce any evidence there is no obligation upon <ORG> to take that evidence The provisions of Section make it rather obligatory upon <ORG> to give a decision on the evidence that is on record and as will appear from Sub section of Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure no appeal lies from any finding of <ORG> given on a reference under that section nor any review or revision of any such finding is allow able under the law Even after the attachment some decision about possession has to be given under the amended provisions of Section
