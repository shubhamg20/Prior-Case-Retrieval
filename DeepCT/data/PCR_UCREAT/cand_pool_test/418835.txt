Chairman of the appellant company filed a complaint before the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Gandhidham Gujarat alleging certain offences including the offence of cheating against another company located at Indore Madhya pradesh and its Directors We have noted from the judgment of the learned single judge of <ORG> that appellants counsel in <ORG> did not turn up to argue the matter Respondents counsel in <ORG> put forward mainly two contentions First was that the dispute is purely of a civil nature and hence no prosecution should have been permitted and the second was that the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Gandhidham has no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint Learned single judge has approved both the contentions and quashed the complaint and the order passed by the magistrate thereon On the first count learned single judge pointed out that there was a specific clause in the Memorandum of Understating arrived between the parties that disputes if any arising between them in respect of any transaction can be resolved through arbitration <ORG> made the following observations Besides supplies of processed soyabean were received by the complainant company without any objection and the same have been exported by the complainant company We quote the following observations It may be that the facts narrated in the present complaint would as well reveal a commercial transaction or money transaction But that is hardly a reason for holding that the offence of cheating would elude from such a transaction In fact many a cheatings were committed in the course of commercial and also money transactions We are unable to appreciate the reasoning that the provision incorporated in the agreement for referring the disputes to arbitration is an effective substitute for a criminal prosecution when the disputed act is an offence Arbitration is a remedy for affording reliefs to the party affected by breach of the agreement but the arbitrator cannot conduct a trial of any act which amounted to an offence albeit the same act may be connected with the discharge of any function under the agreement Hence those are not good reasons for <ORG> to axe down the complaint at the threshold itself The investigating agency should have had the freedom to go into the whole gamut of the allegations and to reach a conclusion of its own Learned single judge has accepted the alternative contention advanced by the respondent pertaining to want of jurisdiction for the Judicial Magistrate of First Class Gandhidham in respect of the offence alleged in the complaint This is what <ORG> has said on that aspect Further there is nothing in the complaint which shows that any part of the transaction took place within the territories of the State of Gujarat It is an erroneous view that the Magistrate taking cognizance of an offence must necessarily have territorial jurisdiction to try the case as well That chapter contains provisions regarding the place where the enquiry and trial are to take place It cannot be overlooked that the said provisions do not trammel the powers of any court to take cognizance of the offence Power of the court to take cognizance of the offence is laid in Section of the Code Sub sections read thus i Subject to the provisions of this Chapter any Magistrate of the first class and any Magistrate of the second class specially empowered in this behalf under sub section may take cognizance of any offence a Upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence Upon a police report of such facts Upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge that such offence has been committed Section imposes a restriction on the court of sessions to take cognizance of any offence as a court of original jurisdiction But any Magistrate of the First Class has the power to take cognizance of any offence no matter that the offence was committed within his jurisdiction or not The only restriction contained in Section is that the power to take cognizance is subject to the provisions of this Chapter There are Sections in Chapter XIV most of which contain one or other restriction imposed on the power of a first class magistrate in taking cognizance of an offence Therefore when there is nothing in Chapter XIV of the Code to impair the power of a judicial magistrate of first class taking cognizance of the offence on the strength of any territorial reason it is impermissible to deprive such a magistrate of the power to take cognizance of an offence of course in certain special enactments special provisions are incorporated for restricting the power of taking cognizance of offences falling under such acts It is therefore a fallacious thinking that only a magistrate having jurisdiction to try the case has the power to take cognizance of the offence If he is a Magistrate of the First Class his power to take cognizance of the offence is not impaired by territorial restrictions After taking cognizance he may have to decide as to the court which has jurisdiction to enquire into or try the offence and that situation would reach only during the post cognizance stage and not earlier Unfortunately <ORG> without considering any of the aforesaid legal aspects rushed to the erroneous conclusion that the judicial magistrate of first class <NAME> has no power to take cognizance of the offences alleged merely because such offences could have been committed outside the territorial limits of the State of Gujarat Learned counsel for the respondents invited our attention to the fact that all the accused persons arrayed in the complaint are residing at Indore in Madhya Pradesh and he apprehends that revival of investigation in the case would most probably embroil them in a miserable position if they are arrested We considered that aspect in the view we now take and we also foresee such a plight for the accused To alleviate any possible hardship for the respondents we direct that if any of the respondents is arrested in connection with the above complaint he shall be released on bail by the arresting officer on execution of a bond to his satisfaction The appeal is disposed of in the above terms
