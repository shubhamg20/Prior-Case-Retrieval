Section of the Act provided penalties for breach of the provisions of the Act viz In the writ petition to this <ORG> it was contended on behalf of the petitioners i that of the Act is violative of Art of the Constitution as it confers unguided uncontrolled and arbitrary powers on the <ORG> ii deals with the power to recover damages and the damages imposed must have co relation with the loss suffered as a result of delayed payment iii the period of arrears varies from less than one month to more than months and therefore the imposition of damages at the flat rate of for all the defaults irrespective of their duration is not only capricious but arbitrary iv the absence of provision of appeal leaves the defaulter employer with no remedy and of the Act has not authorised levy of any penal damages i the penalty or fine but deals with the power to recover the damages The Act a social security measure is a humane homage the <ORG> pays to Arts ii An imperative of is that the Commissioner shall give reasons for his order imposing damages on an employer There is great social injury to the scheme when employers default in number The word has to be given its true meaning in consonance with the objects and purposes of the Legislation It must take its colour and content from its context The words used in section are default in the payment of contribution and therefore the word default must be construed in the light of Para of the Employees Provident <ORG> Scheme which provides that the payment of contribution has got to be made by the th of the following month and therefore the word default in section must mean failure in performance or failure to act Section of the Act does not confer unguided or uncontrolled discretion upon the <ORG> to impose such damages as he may think fit and is therefore not violative of Article of the Constitution It cannot be said that there are no guidelines provided for fixing the quantum of damages There is always a presumption that public officials would discharge their duties honestly and in accordance with the rules of law The following Judgments were delivered <NAME> Having had the advantage of reading my learned brother judgment I should have stopped mine with a single sentence following the example of <NAME> who in <NAME> <NAME> merely said For the reasons given by my brother <NAME> I would dismiss the appeal Power to recover damages Where an employer makes defaults in the payments of any contribution to the Fund <ORG> or the Insurance Fund or in the transfer of accumulations required to be transferred by him under sub section of Section for sub section of Section or in the payment of any charges payable under any other provision of this Act or of any scheme or Insurance Scheme or under any of the conditions specified under Section the Central Provident Fund Commissioner or such other officer as may be authorised by <ORG> by notification in the Official Gazette in this behalf may recover from the employer such damages not exceeding the amount of arrear as it may think fit to impose Provided that before levying and recovering such damages the employer shall be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard In <ORG> case this Court observed It is now settled law that where an authority makes an order in exercise of a quasi judicial function it must record its reasons in support of the order it makes that the Commissioner shall give reasons for his order imposing damages on an employer It is attractive to hear the argument that an order passed by an authority which becomes infallibly final in the absence of an appeal or revision is apt to be arbitrary and bad It depends on the nature of the subject matter other available correctives possible harm flowing from wrong orders and a wealth of other factors In the present case a hearing is given to the affected party Reasons have to be recorded in the order awarding damages In <NAME> case this Court upheld an otherwise unbridled power to levy tax by importing a variety of factors gathered from the statute and relied on many precedents Likewise in <NAME> case this Court rejected the plea that a power in the Commissioner to choose one of the two remedies was invalid in the absence of guidelines and observed on a review of the case law When power is conferred on high and responsible officers they are expected to act with caution and impartiality while discharging their duties and the circumstances under which they will choose either of the remedies available should be left to them There is great social injury to the scheme when employers default in numbers The Court there took the view that the damages imposed under Section are transferred to the general revenues of the appropriate government and went on to observe In other words the infliction of the damages under section is not meant to provide compensation or redress to the employees whose interest may be injured We therefore express the view that if any <ORG> is diverting damages under the Act into its own coffers it is improper I wholly agree with my learned brother for the reasons I have given The Regional Provident Fund Commissioner Chandigarh accordingly issued a show cause notice dated June requiring the petitioners to show cause why damages should not be levied under of the Act the facts that there were disputes between the partners of the firm as a result of which there was a loss of Rs It was accordingly contended that the default if any was not willful as they had no intention to commit a default he observed Even if it is assumed that there was a loss as claimed it does not justify the delay in deposit of Provident Fund money which is in unqualified statutory obligation and cannot be allowed to be linked with the financial position of the establishment over different points of time He went on to observe that where an employer can pay wages it is not conceivable why it cannot pay the provident fund dues For the period between November and January again for the period between October February March and April August to October January and February then again for the period March May to August October and December and January they made delayed payments of the Employees Provident Fund and <ORG> Contribution and consequently the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner after notice to them under and after considering the objections raised and hearing the petitioners imposed damages amounting to Rs Before stating the contentions raised by learned counsel for the petitioners we think it convenient to set out the scheme of the Act and the relevant provisions thereof having a bearing on the question to be determined Section of the Act provides for penalties Failure to comply with the requirements of is punishable with various terms of imprisonment which may extend to a period of six months or with fine which may extend to one thousand to two thousand rupees under the provisions of depending upon the nature of the breach viz and in particular by cl every employer guilty of contravention or of non compliance with the requirements of the Scheme shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine of Rs In support of the petition learned counsel for the petitioners assails the impugned order on two grounds namely i of the Act is violative of Article of the Constitution as it confers unguided uncontrolled and arbitrary power on the <ORG> Commissioner to impose damages which may be to the extent of i equal to the amount of arrears It is not the power to impose penalties The word damages in must therefore be understood in the legal sense The authority imposing the penalty or damages must therefore apply its mind to this aspect of the matter There is no substance in any of the contentions Power to recover damages Where an employer makes defaults in the payment of any contribution to the Fund <ORG> or the Insurance Fund or in the transfer of accumulations required to be transferred by him under sub section of Section or sub section of Section or in the payment of any charges payable under any other provision of this Act or of any scheme or Insurance Scheme or under any of the conditions specified under Section the Central Provident Fund Commissioner or such other officer as may be authorised by <ORG> by notification in the Official Gazette in this behalf may recover from the employer such damages not exceeding the amount of arrear as it may think fit to impose Provided that before levying and recovering such damages the employer shall be given a reasonable opportunity of being heard The contention that section confers unguided and uncontrolled discretion upon the <ORG> Commissioner to impose such damages as he may think fit is therefore violative of Article of the Constitution cannot be accepted In support of his contention he drew our attention to of the Coal Mines Provident Fund and Bonus Schemes Act which uses the words damages not exceeding twenty five per cent like section of the Act and also to a tabular chart provided under that Act itself showing that the amount of damages was correlated to the period of arrears This Court observed firstly that the determination of damages is not an in flexible application of a rigid formula and secondly the words as it may think fit to impose show that the authority is required to apply its mind to the facts and circumstances of the case There is always a presumption that public officials would discharge their duties honestly and in accordance with the rules of law It is not the power to impose a penalty on the defaulting employer though the maximum amount of damages that can be recovered has been indicated in the section it is submitted that the damages must have some correlation with the loss suffered as a result of delayed payments and the authority imposing damages must apply its mind to this aspect of the matter It has only the ordinary legal meaning of the term damages viz There is a conflict of opinion between different <ORG> as to the meaning of the word damages in of the Act These <ORG> have overlooked that we are not concerned in interpreting what damages means in the realm of Contract or Tort but the word had to be given its true meaning in consonance with the objects and purpose of the Legislation The learned Additional Solicitor General brought to our notice the conflict of opinion between the different <ORG> on the construction of the word damages used in and submitted that this has given rise to confusion in the mind of those charged with the duty of administering the Act It must take its colour and content from its context and it cannot be read in isolation nor can be read out of context There is nothing in the section to show that the damages must bear relationship to the loss which is caused to the beneficiaries under the Schemes It was brought on the statute book by Act of the objects and reasons so far material read There are also certain administrative difficulties to be set right There is no provision for inspection of exempted factories nor is there any provision for the recovery of dues from such factories In the arrears which amounted to Rs
