HEADNOTE While the appellant who was a member of <ORG> and the First Member of <ORG> Kerala State was holding the post of Commissioner of <ORG> certain complaints were made against him relating to the grant of certain leases The appellant filed a petition for the grant of a writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings initiated against him and for a writ of mandamus calling upon <ORG> to permit him to function as the First Member of <ORG> a show cause notice was issued to him In appeal to this Court it was contended inter alia for the appellant i that in view of of Madras Act XIX of which provides that the Commissioner shall be a Corporation sole a person acting in the capacity of a Commissioner is not a <ORG> servant and there was therefore no jurisdiction to take disciplinary proceedings against him under Rule ii that the Commissioner was exercising aquasijudicial function in sanctioning leases under the Act which were the subject matter of the complaints against him his orders could therefore only be questioned in appeal as provided under of the Act or examined by the <ORG> in revision under and not by the executive <ORG>al through disciplinary proceedings iii that the main charge against the appellant was not sustainable there was nothing improper in his having sanctioned leases for over five years without auction or in his having initiated proposals for leases in favour of specified individuals iv that the proceedings under Rule were invalid as there was no formal order instituting these proceedings and that the appellant could not be suspended until after charges had been framed against him There was no force in the contention that the Commissioner has a separate legal personality as corporation sole and is therefore exempt from disciplinary proceedings Rule requiring public auction framed under covers all leases and there is no exception in respect of leases exceeding years failing within the scope of Furthermore the Commissioner has no power under to initiate specific proposals for lease of the trust properties There was therefore no formal order necessary to initiate disciplinary proceedings under Rule of the Rules and the order passed by <ORG> must be deemed to be an order under Rule of the Rules initiating disciplinary proceedings The word charges in Rule should be given a wider meaning as denoting the accusations or imputations against the member of the <ORG> Appeal from the judgment and order dated January of <ORG> in Original Petition No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal is brought by certificate against the judgment of <ORG> dated January dismissing Original Petition No of filed by the appellant On the basis of certain petitions containing allegations of misconduct against the appellant in the discharge of his duties as Commissioner <ORG> instituted certain preliminary enquiries and thereafter started disciplinary proceedings against the appellant and also placed him under suspension under rule of the All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules hereinafter called the Rules The appellant then filed the present writ petition before <ORG> Kerala praying for grant of a writ of certiorari to quash the proceedings initiated against him and for a writ of mandwmus calling upon The appellant thereafter filed an application before <ORG> for amendment of the writ petition The prayer in this amended petition was for the issue of a writ of prohibition restraining the first respondent <ORG> from proceeding further in pursuance of the Show Cause Notice and also for quashing the same After hearing the arguments advanced on both sides <ORG> rejected the objections raised by the appellant regarding want of jurisdiction and held that the respondents had power to proceed with the inquiry into the charges <NAME> on the other hand took the view that quasi judicial decisions became final and conclusive if they were not set aside or modified in the manner prescribed by the statute and if the decisions are not so challenged their correctness or legality must be taken to be conclusive and such quasi judicial decisions cannot form the subject matter of charges in disciplinary proceedings against the appellant <NAME> held that <ORG> had therefore no jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry on the first part of charge charge the first part of charge and charge but <ORG> had jurisdiction to proceed with the inquiry with regard to the second part of charge No the second part of charge No and charge No Section of the Act provides that the administration of all religious endowments shall be subject to the general superintendence and control of the Commissioner and that such superintendence and control shall include the power to pass any orders which may be deemed necessary for the proper administration of the endowments Sub section provides for an appeal against the order of the Commissioner to the <ORG> by the trustee or any person having interest The Government may call for and examine the record of the Commissioner or any Deputy or Assistant Commissioner of any Area Committee or of any trustee in respect of any proceeding not being a proceeding in respect of which a suit or an appeal to a Court is provided by this Act to satisfy themselves as to the regularity of such proceeding or the correctness legality or propriety of any decision or order passed therein and if in any case it appears to the Government that any such decision or order should be modified annulled reversed or remitted for reconsideration they may pass orders accordingly Provided that the Government shall not pass any order prejudicial to any party unless he has had a reasonable opportunity of making his representations It is well settled that the writ of prohibition lies not only for excess of jurisdiction or for absence of jurisdiction but the writ also lies in a case of departure from the rules of natural justice See Halsbury Laws of England rd Edn It was held for instance by <ORG> in <NAME> that as the order of the judge of the consistory court of July was made without giving the vicar an opportunity of being heard in his defence the order was made in violation of the principles of natural justice and was therefore an order made without jurisdiction and the writ of prohibition ought to issue But the writ does not lie to correct the course practice or procedure of an inferior tribunal or a wrong decision on the merits of the proceedings It is also well established that a writ of prohibition cannot be issued to a court or an inferior tribunal for an error of law unless the error makes it go outside its If there is want of jurisdiction then the matter is coram non Judice and a writ of prohibition will lie to the court or inferior tribunal forbidding it to continue proceedings therein in excess of its jurisdiction Authority to institute proceedings and to impose penalty Where a member of the Service has committed any act or omission which renders him liable to any penalty specified in rule a if such act or omission was committed before his appointment to the service the Government under whom be is for the time being serving shall alone be competent to institute disciplinary proceedings against him and subject to the provisions of sub rule to impose on him such penalty specified in rule as it thinks fit if such act or omission was committed after his appointment to the Service the Government under whom such member was serving at the time of the commission of such act or omission shall alone be competent to institute disciplinary proceedings against him and subject to the provisions of sub rule to impose on him such penalty specified in rule as it thinks fit and the Government under whom he is serving at the time of the institution of such proceedings shall be bound to render all reasonable facilities to the Government instituting and conducting such proceedings It is not disputed that the appropriate <ORG> has power to take disciplinary proceedings against the appellant and that he could be removed from service by an order of <ORG> but it was contended that I A Officers are governed by statutory rules that any act or omission referred to in rule relates only to an act or omission of an officer when serving under the <ORG> and that serving under the <ORG> means subject to the administrative control of the <ORG> and that disciplinary proceedings should be therefore on the basis of the relationship of master and servant In other words if the act or omission is such as to reflect on the reputation of the officer for his integrity or good faith or devotion to duty there is no reason why disciplinary proceedings should not be taken against him for that act or omission even though the act or omission relates to an activity in regard to which there is no actual master and servant relationship In this context reference may be made to the following observations of <NAME> in <NAME> Foster If a servant conducts himself in a way inconsistent with the faithful discharge of hip duty in the service it is misconduct which justifies immediate dismissal It was also contended by the appellant in this connection that as the Commissioner was made a <ORG> sole under of the Act as a separate and independent personality he was not subject to the control of the Government and no disciplinary proceedings Could be initiated against him We do not think there is any substance in this argument Section of the Act provides for the establishment of a Fund called <ORG> and further states that the Fund shall vest in the Commissioner It was argued for the appellant that the corporate entity created by of the Act has a separate legal personality But there is a juristic distinction between a <ORG> sole and a <ORG> aggregate and the <ORG> sole is not endowed with a separate legal personality as the <ORG> aggregate We accordingly reject the contention of the appellant that the Commissioner has a separate legal personality as corporation sole under of the Act and that he is exempt from disciplinary proceedings for any act or omission committed in his capacity as We next proceed to examine the contention of the appellant that the Commissioner was exercising a quasi judicial function in sanctioning the leases under the Act and his orders cannot therefore be questioned except in accordance with the provisions of the Act It was argued that an appeal is provided under of the Act against the order of the Commissioner granting It was said that so long as these methods were not adopted the Government could not institute disciplinary proceedings and re examine the legality of the order of the Commissioner granting sanction to the leases Under the proviso to the section the particulars of the proposed transactions shall be published at least in one daily newspaper inviting objections and suggestions with respect By the rules made under section clauses and of the Act notice of the proposals for a lease for a period exceeding five years of immovable property belonging to a religious institution shall contain particulars of the nature of the proposed transaction the correct description of the properties and information regarding the survey number extent and boundaries the probable price or the rental as the case may be The rules made under section of the Act provide that all leases of lands buildings sites or other immovable properties and rights belonging to a religious institution shall be made by public auction in exceptional cases lands may be leased out by the trustee without auction subject to the previous sanction of the Deputy Commissioner Even upon that assumption we are satisfied that the Government was entitled to institute disciplinary proceedings if there was prima facie material for showing recklessness or misconduct on the part of the appellant in the discharge of his official duty It is manifest therefore that though the propriety and legality of the sanction to the leases may be questioned in appeal or revision under the Act the Government is not precluded from taking disciplinary action if there is proof that the Commissioner had acted in gross recklessness in the discharge of his duties or that he failed to act honestly or in good faith or that he omitted to observe the prescribed conditions which are essential for the exercise of the statutory power We see no reason why the Government cannot do so for the purpose of showing that the Commissioner acted in utter disregard of the conditions prescribed for the exercise of his power or that he was guilty of misconduct or gross negligence Rule of the Rules framed under of the Act reads as follows All leases of lands buildings sites and other immovable properties and rights belonging to a religious institution shall be made by public auction held in the places in which the properties are situate or the rights exist It was argued on behalf of the respondents that all leases had to be made by public auction and the Commissioner had no authority to sanction any leases without auction and that the power to waive the public auction is given to the Deputy Commissioner and not to the Commissioner under rule It was said that some more time will necessarily have to be allowed for the trustees to send an application after they decide the period of the lease and for the Commissioner to issue the notice himself and to communicate his sanction to the trustees We do not think there is any substance in this argument because it is open to the trustee to hold the auction in the first place under Rule even in the case of a lease for a period over years and then send the proposal to the Commissioner for sanction In other words Rule requiring public auction framed under covers all leases and there is no exception in respect of leases exceeding years falling within the scope of of the Act We accordingly reject the argument of the appellant on this aspect of the case As regards the second part of charge No it was argued by the appellant that there was no prohibition in the Act for the Commissioner to himself initiate the proposal for leases and therefore the charge cannot be sustained It is not disputed by the appellant that the trustee is the proper person to initiate a proposal for lease of the trust properties but it is argued that under of the Act the Commissioner can make specific proposals for leases and that he an himself sanction them under the power to pass an order which may be necessary to ensure that such endowments are properly administered and their income is really appropriated for the purpose for which they were founded If the language of is understood as suggesting that the Commissioner has power to initiate proposals it would mean that the Commissioner himself may sit in judgment over the proposals initiated by him As regards charges and it is not shown on behalf of the appellant that there is any defect of jurisdiction and that the respondents cannot proceed with the inquiry appellant that there was no formal order of the Government for instituting these proceedings In that case the order of suspens on was challenged by the appel lant by a writ petition in No of which was dismissed by <NAME> Against that decision the appellant preferred an appeal which was dismissed by the Division Bench It was contended by the appellant that the only issue considered in that case was whether the appellant could be suspended before the charges were framed and the rule of res judicata was not applicable Even so we are of the opinion that to there is no substance in the contention of the appellant that there was no valid institution of the disciplinary proceedings under rule In our opinion there is no formal order necessary to initiate disciplinary proceedings under Rule of the Rules and the order of the State <ORG> under Ex The grounds oil which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges which shall be communicated to the member of the Service charged together with a statement of the allegations on which each charge is based and of any other circumstances which it is proposed to take into consideration in passing orders on the case It was argued by the appellant that the word charges which occurs in Rule and Rule should be given the same meaning and no order of suspension could be passed under Rule before the charges are framed under Rule against the appellant We do not think there is any substance in this argument Rule prescribes that the grounds on which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges In view of he difference of language in Rule and Rule we are of the pinion that the word charges in rule should be given a wider meaning as denoting the accusations or imputations against the member of the <ORG> We accordingly reject the argument of the appellant on this aspect of the case For the reasons already expressed we hold that the appellant has made out no case for the grant of a writ of prohibition under Art In the circumstances of the case we do not make any order as to costs
