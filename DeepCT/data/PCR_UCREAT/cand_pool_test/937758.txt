HEADNOTE Section of the Finance Act provided If immediately before the st day of April there is in force in any Part State any law relating to income tax or supertax or tax on profits of business that law shall cease to have effect except for the purposes of the levy assessment and collection of income tax and super tax in respect of any period not included in the previous year for the purposes of assessment under the Indian Income tax Act for the year ending on the st day of March or for any subsequent year or as the case may be the levy assessment and collection of the tax on profits of business for any chargeable accounting period ending on or before the st day of March The appellant a merchant carrying on his business in the erstwhile States of Travancore and Cochin was assessed to income tax for the two accounting years and under the income tax law in force there namely the Travancore Income tax Act of and the Cochin Income tax Act of Between and there were constitutional changes resulting in the integration of the two States formation of the United State of Travancore and Cochin accession of the latter to the Dominion of India and finally its acceptance of the Constitution of India whereby it became a Part State within the Constitution of India of the Constitution taxes leviable under the Travancore Income tax Act or the Cochin Income tax Act continued to be so levied until provision to the contrary was made by <ORG> by law On February the Income tax Officer Ernakulam issued four notices to the appellant two under Of the Cochin Income tax Act and two under of the Travancore Income tax Act stating therein that in consequence of definite information which had come into his possession he had discovered that the income of the appellant for the assessment years and II had been under assessed and that he proposed to re assess the said income and the appellant was asked to submit a return in respect of his total world income for the two years in question The respondents contended that the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to issue such notices on the grounds that under the Finance Act the Mysore Income tax Act stood repealed on and from April and of the former Act kept alive the Mysore Act for the purpose of levy assessment and collection of income tax etc Held that the Finance Act empowered the Income tax Officer to take proceedings under Of the Mysore Income tax Act for re assessment for the prior years of the under estimated or escaped income that the financial agreement dated February did not render the proceedings for re assessment unconstitu tional or void and that though there was a distinction between an original or normal assessment under and a re assessment under of the Mysore Income tax Act the expression levy assessment and collection of income tax in of the Finance Act had been used in a comprehensive sense so as to include the whole procedure for imposing liability upon the assessee The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> judgment relates to and governs eleven appeals which for convenience have been classified into two groups By reason of the circumstance that certain common questions of law and fact arise in all these eleven appeals they have been heard one after the other but it will be convenient and will avoid confusion if we state the facts relating to the <ORG> group first and then deal with the questions arising therefrom We shall then state the additional facts of the <NAME> group of appeals and answer the questions arising therefrom in so far only as they have not been answered already in relation to the <ORG> group In the other group of appeals namely the <NAME> appeals the appellants are the Income tax Officers of certain income tax circles in Bangalore and the respondents are assessees who carry on business within the jurisdictional area of the said Income tax Officers In the Travancore Cochin appeals the High Court of <ORG> came to a decision against the assessee while in the <NAME> appeals the High Court of <NAME> came to an opposite conclusion on identical questions of law that is why in the first group of appeals the assessee is the appellant and in the second group the appellants are the Income tax Officers The assessee <NAME> is a hardware merchant who carried on his trade and business for several years in the then States of Travancore and Cochin with his headquarters at Ernakulam in Cochin The covenant further provided that there shall be a <ORG> for the United State and the Ruler of Travancore shall be the first <ORG> the executive authority of the United State shall be exercised by the <ORG> and there shall be a council of ministers to aid and advise him Article IX of the covenant said that the <ORG> shall within a fortnight of the appointed day execute on behalf of the United State an Instrument of Accession in accordance with the provisions of of <ORG> Act and in place of the earlier Instruments of Accession of the covenanting States and he shall by such Instrument accept as matters with respect to which <ORG> may make laws for the United State all the matters mentioned in List I and List III of the Seventh Schedule to the said Act except the entries in List I relating to any tax or duty There was a proviso to the Article which said that nothing in the Article shall be deemed to prevent the <ORG> from accepting any or all of the entries in the said List I relating to any tax or duty as matters with respect to which <ORG> may make laws for the United State The Constitution of India came into force on January and on that date Travancore Cochin became one of the Part States within the Constitution of India Under that Constitution the subject of taxes on income other than agricultural income was included in the Union Legislative List and <ORG> alone had exclusive power to make laws in respect thereof All laws in force in the territory of Travancore Cochin became subject to the Constitution of lndia when it came into force but Art of the Constitution enaccted Any taxes duties cesses or fees which immediately before the commencement of this Constitution were being lawfully levied by the Government of any State or by any municipality or other local authority or body for the purposes of the State municipality district or other local area may notwithstanding that those taxes duties cesses or fees are mentioned in the Union List continue to be levied and to be applied to the same purposes until provision to the contrary is made by <ORG> by law The result of the aforesaid provision of the Constitution was that the taxes leviable under the Cochin Act or the Travancore Act continued to be so levied until provision to the contrary was made by <ORG> by law The interpretation of of this Finance Act is one of the questions argued in these appeals and the relevant provision of that sub section must be quoted in full If immediately before the st day of April there is in force in any Part State other than Jammu and Kashmir or in Manipur Tripura or Vindhya Pradesh or in the merged territor of CoochBehar any law relating to income tax or super tax or tax on profits of business that law shall cease to have effect except for the purposes of the levy assessment and collection of income tax and super tax in respect of any period not included in the previous year for the purposes of assessment under the Indian Income tax Act for the year ending on the st day of March or for any subsequent year or as the case may be the levy assessment and collection of the tax on profits of business for any chargeable accounting period ending on or before the st day of March The income of the assessee for the two accounting years and corresponding to the years ending on August and August respectively was assessed in the two assessment years and in accordance with the Cochin Act by the Income tax Officer at Ernakulam by his orders dated July and January respectively On February the Income tax Officer Ernakulam issued four notices to the assessee two under of the Cochin Act and two under of the Travancore Act stating therein that in consequence of definite information which had come into his possession he had discovered that the income of the assessee assessable to income tax for the assessment years and had been under assessed and the Income tax Officer therefore proposed to re assess the said income the assessee was asked to submit a return in respect of his total world income for the two years in question On March the Income tax Officer <NAME> issued two similar notices to the assessee under of the Travancore Act stating therein that he had discovered in consequence of definite information which had come into his possession that the income of the assessee for the two years and assessable to income tax had either escaped assessment or had been under assessed or had been assessed at too low a rate and therefore be proposed to re assess the said income Presumably the Incometax Officer <NAME> issued the two notices because it was doubtful if the Income tax Officer Ernakulam had authority to issue notices to the assessee under the Travancore Act On June the assessee filed a writ petition in <ORG> in which he challenged the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer Ernakulam to re assess his income for the two assessment years and On the very day on which the assessee filed his writ petition the Incometax Officer Ernakulam made an escaped income assessment under of the Cochin Act for the assessment year This order was communicated to the assessee on June and the assessee filed a second writ petition in <ORG> June in which he again challenged the jurisdictions of the Income tax Officer <NAME> to make the assessment Linder of the Cochin Act and further said that the assessment was made in spite of his application for adjournment and an order of stay passed by <ORG> on June On June the assessee filed a third writ petition in <ORG> in respect of the two notices issued to him by the Income tax Officer <NAME> of the Constitution and on that certificate the three appeals which we have called Travancore Cochin appeals have been brought to this Court from the judgment and order of <ORG> of Travancore Cochin dated September In <ORG> three main points were urged on behalf of the assessee the first point taken was that with the passing of the Finance Act which made Travancore Cochin a taxable territory within the meaning of the Indian Income tax Act incometax laws of Travancore and Cochin became void and inoperative and <ORG> could not under keep alive the Income tax Act of Travancore and Cochin or any provisions thereof inconsistent with the Constitution Section of the Finance Act was therefore invalid in so far as it tried to keep alive the Cochin Act or the Travancore Act for the purpose of levy assessment and collection of incometax for the period referred to therein The second contention was that even if of the Finance Act was valid and kept alive the provisions of the Cochin Act and the Travancore Act it did so only for the purpose of the levy assessment and collection of income tax and super tax in respect of the period mentioned in the section and did not have the effect of saving the provisions of the Travancore Act or Cochin Act for the purpose of re assessment of income tax and super tax It was contended on behalf of the assessee that the statements in the notices with regard to definite information etc The learned Judges of <ORG> negatived the aforesaid contentions and as we have already stated the writ petitions Before us the first point urged on behalf of the assessee in <ORG> has not been pressed The other two points namely the true construction of of the Finance Act and tile absence of any foundation for the action sought to be taken under of the Cochin Act or of the Travancore Act have been pressed with great vehemence We have allowed learned counsel for the assessee to raise the point as it involves a pure question of law We shall refer in somewhat greater detail to these agreements particularly the agreements entered into by the Rajpramukhs of Travancore Cochin and Mysore We proceed now to a consideration in detail of the arguments urged before us on behalf of the assessee in the Travancore Cochin appeals In logical sequence the point as to the absence of foundation for the action taken by the two Income tax Officers of Ernakulam and Kottayam in the matter of the issue of notices Section of the Cochin Act so far as it is relevant for our purpose is in these terms If in consequence of definite information which has come into his possession the Income tax Officer discovers that income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment in any year or have been under assessed or have been assessed at too low a rate or have been the subject of excessive relief under this Act the Income tax Officer way in any case in which he has reason to believed that the assessee has concealed the particulars of his income or deliberately furnished inaccurate particulars thereof at any time within eight years and in any other case at any time within four years of the end of that year serve on the person liable to pay tax on such income profits or gains or in the case of a company on the principal officer thereof a notice containing all or any of the requirement which may be included in a notice under sub section of section and may proceed to assess or re assess such income profits or gains and the provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section The two requisites conditions for the application of the section are contained in the first part and they are firstly there must be definite information which has come into possession of the Income tax Officer and secondly in consequence of that information the Income fax Officer discovers that income profits or gains chargeable to income tax have escaped assessment in any year etc It is only when these two conditions are fulfilled that the Income tax Officer can take necessary action under Learned counsel for the assessee has taken us through Ext VIII prima facie contains the kind of information which will satisfy the conditions of of the Cochin Act and of the Travancore Act we must take note of the fact that according to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner as shown by his order dated December the so called information contained in Ext VIII was really non existent and the information being non existent there was no foundation for the action taken by the Income tax Officers It is true that the Appellate Assistant Commissioner considered in detail the various criticisms of the Income tax Officer with regard to the account books along with the explanations offered on behalf of the assessee but he expressed his final conclusion in the following words I have given my careful consideration to the various adverse criticisms of the Income tax Officer and to the Advocate answers thereto Again whatever may be the appellant reasons for not recording full details for cash sales there is the admitted fact that the cash sales stand partly unvouched and details as to the names and addresses of purchasers are not available for the major part of the year and there is therefore no possibility of satisfying one self whether all the cash sales have been duly brought to account There is also the further fact that at least some of the purchases are not satisfactorily vouched and that the rates of gross profit disclosed by the accounts both at the head office and the branches are not quite adequate It is to be remembered that there is a distinction between receipt of definite information as a consequence of which a discovery is made and a notice is issued and the final determination as to the liability or extent of liability for escaped assessment etc There is no doubt however that the information must be definite that is more than mere guess gossip or rumour The argument on this point has meandered over a wide area but it is really dependent on the meaning to be given to the expression for the purposes Of the levy assessment and collection of income tax and super tax occurring in the section Section states inter alia that subject to the provisions of the Act the total income of any previous year of any person includes all income profits and gains from whatever source derived Chapter IV deals with deductions and assessment and the words assessment and Ire assessment occur in several sections of this Chapter Sub section authorises the Income tax Officer to serve on any person upon whom a notice has been served under sub a further notice requiring him to produce accounts and documents subject to the limitation that he shall not require the production of any accounts relating to a period more than three years prior to the year previous to the year of assessment Section provides for the making of the assessment Under sub if the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that the return is incorrect or incomplete he must serve on the person who made the return a notice requiring him either to attend at the Income tax Officer office or to produce any evidence relied on in support of the return Subsection makes provision for an assessment by the Incometax Officer to the best of his judgment if the assessee fails to make a return or to comply with the terms of the notices issued to him This whole procedure it may be recalled not only applies on first assessment but is also prescribed by if for any reason income profits or gains have escaped assessment or have been assessed at too low a rate Section deals with cancellation of assessment in certain circumstances and states the Income tax Officer shall cancel the assessment and proceed to make a fresh assessment in accordance with the provisions of Section talks of a notice of demand to the person liable to pay the tax etc Section gives a right of appeal from certain orders Section provides for appeals against the orders of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and ss A and give powers of revision to the Commissioner In substance it deals with income which has escaped assessment for one reason or another and says in the operative part that the Income tax Officer may proceed to assess or re assess such income profits or gains etc There has been some argument before us as to the meaning of the juxtaposition of the words assess or re assess occurring in the section and it has been contended that a distinction has obviously been drawn between income which has totally escaped assessment and income which has been under assessed or assessed at too low a rate etc and the word assess appropriately applies to the former case and the word re assess to the latter case Section says that notwithstanding that a reference has been made under this section to <ORG> income tax shall be payable in accordance with the assessment made in the case In some sections it has a comprehensive meaning and in some a somewhat restricted meaning to be distinguished from a re assessment or even a fresh assessment In our opinion both these circumstances point towards a comprehensive meaning for it could not have been intended as part of the proposal of <ORG> that those whose income had totally escaped assessment should be liable but those who had been under assessed should go soot free We can see nothing in the words of the section which would justify such a distinction we say this quite apart from the argument that should be interpreted in consonance with the financial agreement entered into between the <NAME> and the President an argument to which we shall presently advert In support of these contentions great reliance has been placed on the decision of <ORG> in Commissioner of Income tax <ORG> and Aden <NAME> Until all such questions are determined and all such proceedings have come to an end there can be no final assessment In the order made by him on that date he assessed the respondents to income tax at the maximum rate but as the respondents were at that time a registered firm he held as he was bound to hold that no super tax was to be levied On some date before the end of March he served on the respondents a notice of demand for the tax that he had determined was properly leviable It was indeed contended before their Lordships that the assessment could not be regarded as having been determined inasmuch as the Commissioner might at any time and apparently after any lapse of time however long cancel the registration of the respondents as a registered firm and so subject the respondents to liability to pay super tax These observations lend no support to the view that the word assessment must always bear a particular meaning in the Income tax Act Finally a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable has to be served upon the tax payer If the word assessment is taken in its comprehensive sense as we think it should be taken in the context of of the Finance Act it would include I re assessment made under the provisions of the Act This brings us to the third question Such State Courts except Courts of final appeal from orders of <ORG> as may in fact correspond to particular grades and classes of British Indian Courts Civil and Criminal may have to be statutorily recognised as corresponding judicial authorities for purpose of dealing with cases arising in the States under the federal laws of the Union of India and <ORG> in India will have to be made the Court of final appeal from decisions of <ORG> to the same extent as in the case of <ORG> It will be necessary to provide that all matters and proceedings pending under or arising out of the preexisting State Act shall be disposed of under those Acts by so far as may be the corresPonding authorities nominated by <ORG> under the corresponding Indian Act In view of the fact that the members of the <ORG> themselves felt that the legal issues involved in the actual taking over of federal subjects in the <ORG>s by the Centre constituted a difficult subject on which they were not qualified to offer competent advice and their further statement that they were merely endeavouring to indicate the main features of what they considered to be required in order to establish continuity of proceedings it has been argued before us on behalf of the Income tax authorities that it would be wrong to treat the recomendations as binding statutory rules even though the financial agreement between the high contracting Parties states generally that the recommendations are accepted it is contended that the <ORG> in express terms states that the recommendations merely endeavour to indicate the main features of what the <ORG> thought was required and they should not be placed on a pedestal higher than what the <ORG> itself did We think that there is much force in this contention but in the view which we have taken of these recommendations we do not think that it is necessary to decide finally what constitutional sanctity they have acquired by reason of their acceptance in the financial agreement and the provisions of Art Assuming but without deciding that they have binding force what is their true meaning and effect The argument on behalf of the assessee is that cl a of the recommendations is the operative clause and inasmuch as it talks of continuity of pending proceedings and finality and validity of completed proceedings tinder the pre existing <ORG> legislation the true effect is that all assessment proceedings which have become complete and finance I by the issue of a demand notice under of the Indian Income tax Act or corresponding section of the Cochin Act or Travancore Act are saved under the clause and cannot be reopened and only proceedings actually pending on the relevant date can be continued thereunder What is worthy of special notice is that cl a specifically says that the clauses which follow it are the limitations or qualifications subject to which the whole body of <ORG> legislation is to be repealed and they are designed to secure two objects continuity of pending proceedings and finality and validity of completed proceedings therefore cl a is not the operative clause and it merely indicates the reasons or objects for which certain limitations or qualifications are suggested on the proposal to repeal the <ORG> legislation and which have little bearing on the problem before us We see no good grounds why full effect should not be given to it it is one of the limitations as stated in cl a subject to which the <ORG> law is to be repealed The <ORG> did not restrict the limitations they were suggesting to a proceeding which was actually pending on the date of repeal of the <ORG> law it gave a wider meaning to pending proceedings that is proceedings pending under and arising out of the preexisting <ORG> Act It is also not disputed that the assessment made under in any year subsequent to the relevant assessment year must be made as if it were made in the relevant assessment year and the assessment must be based on the provisions of the Act as it stood in the year in which the income ought to have been assessed Section of the Finance Act gives effect to that recommendation There is therefore nothing in the recommendations which would restrict the meaning of the expression levy assessment and collection of income tax in of the Finance Act nor do they bring into conflict with Arts We accordingly hold that there is no substance in any of the three points urged on behalf of the assessee in the Travancore Cochin appeals ln the result all the writ petitions were allowed with costs But subsequent to the integration of Mysore notices under of the Mysore Act were issued against the petitioners and they challenged the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officers to issue such notices Section of the Mysore Act states If for any reason income profits or gains chargeable to income tax has escaped assessment in any year or has been assessed at too low a rate the Income tax Officer may at any time within four years of the end of that year serve on the person liable to pay tax on such income profits or gains or in the case of a company on the principal officer thereof a notice I containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub section of and may proceed to assess or re assess such income profits or gains and provisions of this Act shall so far as may be apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub section Provided that the tax shall be charged at the rate at which it would have been charged had the income profits or gains not escaped assessment or full assessment as the case may be <NAME> in a separate but concurring judgment expressed the view that having regard to the wording of of Finance Act and the financial agreement of February he had no doubt that did not provide for re assessment under of the Mysore Act In dealing with the Travancore Cochin appeals we have fully dealt with the two grounds on which the respondent assessees in the Mysore appeals challenged the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officers concerned to issue the notices under It has been urged that the proviso to of the Mysore Act brings out the distinction between I assessment and re assessment and secondly it is contended that the jurisdiction under is limited to ascertainment of extra income not assessed and the section does not confer jurisdiction to make a new assessment for taxing whole of that assessment under the Act There is indeed a dis tinction between an original or normal assessment under and a re assessment under but we have shown that the word assessment has been used in more than one sense in Income tax law and so far as of the Finance Act is concerned there is no doubt that the expression I levy assessment and collection of income tax has been used in a comprehensive sense so as to include the whole procedure for imposing liability upon the taxpayer Result The final result therefore is a the TravancoreCochin appeals Civil Appeals to of are dismissed with costs and the Mysore appeals Civil Appeals to of and Civil Appeals to of are allowed and the judgment and orders of <ORG> are set aside The appellants in these Mysore appeals will be entitled to their costs in this <ORG> and the High <ORG> of Mysore
