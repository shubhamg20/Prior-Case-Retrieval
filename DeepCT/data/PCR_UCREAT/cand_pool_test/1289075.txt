I have held that opinion ever since that Act came into operation and I lately gave effect to it in a judgment on a Division Bench not then anticipating the present reference As to Section of the General Glauses Act it is idle to contend that it has any bearing whatever in such a case as this Section Act III of declares that registered documents relating to land of which registration is optional shall take effect against unregistered documents and the word unregistered is defined in the explanation thereunder to mean in cases where the document is executed after the first day of July not registered under Act VIII of or the Act of In reply I would say that the provisions of Section Act III of do apply to this case I do not think that Section of the General Clauses Act would apply to a case of this nature By the terms of Section Act III of however every registered document whether its registration be compulsory or optional shall take effect against every unregistered document relating to the same property and hence the defendant document executed since the Act came into force will now take effect in preference to the plaintiff It contains in Section an express provision by which all unregistered documents executed at the time the former laws referred to in the section were in force are to be defeated by all registered documents of the nature of those mentioned in the section It appears to me that Section of the Registration Act of is conclusive and that the defendant registered deed takes precedence of the plaintiff unregistered bonds
