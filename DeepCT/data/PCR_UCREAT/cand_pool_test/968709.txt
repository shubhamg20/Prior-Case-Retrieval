Between the years to in all there were vacancies for direct recruitment in the Indian Economic <ORG> out of which only posts were filled up by direct recruitment Earlier certain persons holding posts in Grade IV of these two services had filed Writ Petition under Article seeking direction order to <ORG> to confirm and regularise the petitioners in the posts held by them as and from the dates when they had become due for confirmation or regularisation in accordance with the Indian Economic <ORG> Rules or the Indian Statistical <ORG> Rules and to consider them for all future promotions when due on the basis of such seniority Since the lists were to the disadvantage of the departmental prouotees the <ORG> while declining to endorse either of the two seniority lists directed the respondent Union to implement the order dated February on or before th November In the meanwhile the petitioners filed a petition for initiating contempt proceedings against the respondent Union of India which was resisted by the respondents Certain direct recruits also intervened and wanted to be heard before disposal of the contempt application Opportunity was given to all the parties to make their submissions The Union <ORG> is directed to treat all persons who have been promoted to several posts in Grade in Indian Economic <ORG> and Indian Statistical <ORG> contrary to the Rules till now as having been regularly appointed to those posts in Grade IV under Rule a ii and assign them seniority in the cadre with effect from the dates from which they are continuously officiating in those posts Even those promotees who have been selected in and shall be assigned seniority with effect from the date on which they commenced to officiate continuously in the posts prior to their selection The direct recruits shall be given seniority with effect from the date on which their names were recommended by the <ORG> for appointment to such grade or posts as provided in clause a of Rule All appointments shall be made hereafter in accordance with the Rules and the seniority of all the officers to be appointed hereafter shall be governed by Rule He shall be continued in the higher post which he is now holding by creating a supernumerary post to accommodate him Further promotion shall be given to him when it becomes due as per the new seniority list to be prepared In the circumstances of the instant case clause of rule of the Rules which deals with the question of seniority of promotees becomes irrelevant as regards promotees who have been holding the posts from a long time When the Rules of recruitment prescribe recruitment from different sources in accordance with the specified quota the <ORG> is bound to appoint persons to the <ORG> concerned in accordance with the Rules The petitioners were not promoted by following the actual procedure prescribed under rule a ii but the fact remains that they have been working in posts included in Grade IV from the date on which they were appointed to these posts Neither the <ORG> has issued orders of reversion to their former posts nor has anybody so far questioned the right of the petitioners to continue in the posts which they are now holding However it is not the case that whenever a person is appointed in a post without following the Rules prescribed for appointment to that post he should be treated as a person regularly appointed to that post There is no impediment even under the Rules to treat the petitioners and others who are similarly situated as persons duly appointed to the posts in Grade IV because of the enabling provision contained in Rule If there is enormous departure from the Rules of recruitment in making appointments over several years it should be presumed that the excess appointment by promotion had been made in relaxation of the Rules when power to relax the Rules is available Union of India The Judgment of the <ORG> was delivered by <NAME> The perennial dispute regarding seniority between direct recruits and promotees which exists in Almost all the departments of Government has not spared <ORG> and <ORG> with which we are concerned in this case Earlier certain persons who had been holding posts in Grade IV of these two Services had filed Writ Petition No of under Article of the Constitution of India praying for a writ direction or order in the nature of mandamus directing <ORG> to confirm or regularise the petitioners in the posts held by them as and from the dates when they became due for confirmation or regularisation in accordance with <ORG> Rules or <ORG> Rules and to consider them for all future promotions when due on the basis of such seniority After the above case was heard the <ORG> passed a short order on February which reads thus We are not able to understand why the vacancies available to the departmental candidates under Rule ii of the Indian Economic and Indian Statistical Services Rules have not been filled up on regular basis We wish to make it clear that there is no question of any rotation system being applied under the Rules as they exist now Rule ii of the IES Rules ISS Rules provides for the quota for the departmental promotees and also the manner in which the Select List for promotion by a duly constituted <ORG> presides over by a Member of <ORG> has to be drawn However If there any slip on the part of this Respondent in carrying out the directions of <ORG> of if <ORG> considers that the orders should have been executed in any other manner this Respondent would tender unconditional apology ant will be duty bound to obey ant implement such orders directions as <ORG> may teem fit or pleaset to issue in the circumstance of the case While the order passed by the <ORG> on February did not require any clarification at all since the parties tried to place different interpretation on <ORG> prayer was mate by <ORG> as stated above seeking further clarifications in the light of certain recent decisions rendered by this <ORG> we gave opportunity to all the parties to make their submissions once again On its behalf it was submitted very fairly by <NAME> that there was no intention on the part of the <ORG> or any of its officers to flout the order of the <ORG> passed earlier and that if the <ORG> found that there has been any mistake in the preparation of the lists of seniority those lists would be prepared afresh in the light of any direction that may be given by the <ORG> in the course of these proceedings We have however found it necessary to consider the matter again in the light of the submissions made by the parties and issue fresh directions in this case The Indian Economic <ORG> Rules and <ORG> Rules hereinafter referred to as the Rules which are more or less identical with regard to the questions involved in this case were notified on November and these <ORG>s were constituted with effect from that date by encadering numerous posts carrying economic and statistical functions in the various ministries of <ORG> We are informed that the notifications regarding the initial constitution of these two <ORG>s were issued by the middle of February with effect from February Provided that per cent of the said quota for direct recruitment may be set apart for a maximum period of years for absorption of officers considered suitable for appointment at the initial constitution of the Service but who could not be so appointed in the absence of vacancies The selection will be made from amongst those who have completed at least years of service in those posts on the basis of merit with due regard to seniority by <ORG> on the advice of the <ORG> Rule a now reads thus Provided that per cent of the said quota for direct recruitment may be set apart for a maximum period of years for absorption of officers considered suitable for appointment at the initial constitution of the service but who could not be so appointed in the absence of vacancies The selection will be made from amongst those who have completed at least years of service on a regular basis in these posts on the basis of merit with due regard to seniority by <ORG> on the advice of the <ORG> That rule was added by a notification dated December and it has been amended subsequently by a notification dated February From the statements annexed to the counter affidavit filed by <NAME> Director in <ORG> it is seen that in <ORG> there were vacancies for direct recruits in the year in the year in the year and in the year In the year there were vacancies for direct recruits but were recruited directly during that year In there were vacancies for direct recruits and were recruited in there were vacancies for direct recruits in there were vacancies for direct recruits in there were vacancies for direct recruits there were vacancies for direct recruits and in there were vacancies for direct recruits By the year in all there were vacancies for direct recruits out of which only posts were filled up by direct recruitment In all posts intended for direct recruits remained unfilled and most of them were held all along by persons who had been promoted from the feeder posts It is alleged in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of <ORG> of which the deponent is <NAME> Deputy Secretary in <ORG> that many of the departmental candidates had been allowed to hold posts including in Grade IV of the aforesaid Services purely on ad hoc and ex gratia basis When <ORG> met in the year it prepared a select list consisting of names to fill vacancies only in Grade IV from amongst those who had already been promoted to Grade IV temporarily and at that time only officers who had completed four years of regular service in the feeder posts as on December were considered although <ORG> was meeting in the year If it had taken into consideration the service put in by the departmental candidates till the date on which it took up their cases for consideration for promotion many others who had been promoted on a temporary basis to Grade IV would have become eligible for consideration By omitting to take the cases of those persons into consideration on the ground that they had not completed four years of regular service in the feeder posts as on December <ORG> violated Articles and of the Constitution of India It is however seen that the select list contained only names because <ORG> felt that they were the only vacancies for which it could make recommendations under rule a ii of the Rules We have carefully considered all the decisions cited before us It is also true that when the Rules of recruitment prescribe recruitment from different Services in accordance with the specified quota the <ORG> is bound to appoint persons to the Service concern ed in accordance with the said Rules But we are faced in this case with the problem of resolving conflicts which have arisen on account of a violent departure made by the <ORG> from the Rules of recruitment by allowing those who were appointed contrary to the Rules to hold the posts continuously over a long period of time A letter dated August written by <NAME> Minister of <ORG> for <ORG> <ORG> to Shri <NAME> Member of <ORG> substantiates the conclusion The relevant part of the letter reads Government resorted to making ad hoc appointments as it was separately considering proposals to re Organise Grade IV of the two Services<ORG> Pending such reorganisation <ORG><ORG> has taken a deliberate decision to restrict direct recruitment for the present<ORG> It is therefore not correct to say that ad hoc appointments have been made due to nonavailability of direct recruits<ORG> I may add that but for his deliberate decision most of the officers holding ad hoc posts in Grade IV would have continued to stagnate in the lower posts of Investigators<ORG> At one stage it was argued before us on behalf of some of the respondents that the petitioners who have not been appointed in accordance with rule a ii could not be treated as members of <ORG> or of <ORG> at all and hence there was no question of determining the question to seniority as between the petitioners and the direct recruits It is true that the petitioners were not promoted ay following the actual procedure prescribed under rule a ii but the fact remains that they have been working in posts included in Grade IV from the date of which they were appointed to these posts It is significant that neither the <ORG> has issued orders of reversion to their former posts nor has anybody so far questioned the right of the petitioners to continue in the posts which they are now holding But we however make it clear that it is not our view that whenever a person is appointed in a post without following the Rules prescribed for appointment to that post he should be treated as a person regularly appointed to that post only question agitated before us relates to the seniority as between the petitioners and the direct recruits and such a question can arise only where there is no dispute regarding regarding the entry of the officers concerned into the same Grade In the instant case there is no impediment even under the Rules to treat these petitioners and others who are similarly situated as persons duly appointed to the posts in Grade IV because of the enabling provision contained in the rule thereof Rule as it stood at the relevant time read as follows Powers to relex me Government may in consultation with the Commission and for reasons to be recorded in writing relex any of the provisions of these rules with respect to any class or category of persons or posts and no such relaxation shall be given so as to have retrospective effect The said rules provided for recruitment to the said Service from three different Services i direct recruitment by competitive examination ii substantive appointment of persons included in the select list promoted on the basis of a limited competitive examination and iii promotion on the basis of seniority One of the Rules provided that the recruitment should be made from the above sources on the following basis i th of the substantive vacancies to be filled in by direct recruitment ii of the remaining of the vacancies to be filled on the basis of results of limited competitive examinations and iii the remaining vacancies to be filled in by promotion on the basis of seniority It found that there was enormous departure from the rules of recruitment in making appointments over several years The Court felt that in the circumstances it should be presumed that the excess appointment by promotion had been made in relaxation of the Rules since there was power to relax the Rules similar to the power under rule in the Rules with which we are concerned here Justifying the above view the court observed at pages thus It was however contended that it is not permissible to infer that promotions in excess of quota were given by relaxing the quota rule because the posts in Integrated Grade II and III were within the purview of <ORG> and the proviso to Rule a mandates that power to relax is hedged in with a condition that it can be done after consultation with the <ORG> and there is nothing to show that the <ORG> was ever consulted Commencing from the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> <NAME> AIR it is well settled that when the provisions of a statute relate to the performance of a public duty and the case is such that to hold null and void acts done in neglect of this duty would work general inconvenience or injustice to persons who have not control over those entrusted with the duty and that at the same time would not promote the main object of the Legislature it has been the practice to hold such provisions to be directory only the neglect of them though punishable not affecting the validity the acts done There are number of subsequent decisions to which our attention was called reiterating the same principle Therefore assuming there was failure to consult <ORG> before exercising the power to relax the mandatory quota rule and further assuming that the posts in Integrated Grade IT and III were within the purview of <ORG> and accepting for the time being that the <ORG> was not consulted before the power to relax the rule was exercised yet the action taken would not be vitiated nor would it furnish any help to <ORG> which itself cannot take any advantage of its failure to consult the <ORG> Therefore it can be safely stated that the enormous departure from the quota rule year to year permits an inference that the departure was in exercise of the power of relaxing the quota rule conferred on the controlling authority The facts in this case being almost identical there is no reason why the view express in <NAME> case supra should not be adopted here also Petitioner No who was promoted to Grade IV post in July would become junior to direct recruits of batch The only just solution to this problem is to treat the petitioners as persons duly appointed to the Service with effect from the day on which they were promoted to the Grade IV posts Clause of rule of the Rules which deals with the question of seniority of promotees becomes irrelevant in the circumstances of this case as regards the promotees who have been holding the posts from a long time as stated above In that decision there was a specific finding that except for a period two years i in and direct recruitment had been made in accordance with the Scheme governing recruitment to <ORG> and that there was substantial compliance with the rules of recruitment governing that Service The Court observed that in the absence of serious failure in implementing the relevant rules there was no ground to interfere with the inter se seniority of the officers in the Grades concerned Having given our anxious consideration to the submissions made on behalf of the parties and the peculiar facts present in this case we feel that the appropriate order that should be passed in this case is to direct <ORG> to treat all persons who are stated to have been promoted in this case to several posts in Grade IV in each of the two <ORG>s contrary to the Rules till now as having been regularly appointed to the said posts in Grade IV under rule a ii and assign them seniority in the cadre with effect from the dates from which they are continuously officiating in the said posts Even those promotees who have been selected in and shall be assigned seniority with effect from the date on which they commenced to officiate continuously in the posts prior to their selection The direct recruits shall be given seniority with effect from the date on which their names were recommended by the <ORG> for appointment to such grade or post as provided in clause a of Rule of the Rules This is the meaning of the direction given by the <ORG> on February which stated we wish to make it clear that there is no question of any rotation system being applied under the Rules as they exist now All appointments shall be made hereafter in accordance with the Rules and the seniority of all officers to be appointed hereafter shall be governed by rule of the Rules He shall be continued in the higher post which he is now holding by creating a supernumerary post if necessary to accommodate him His further promotion shall however be given to him when it becomes due as per the new seniority list to be prepared pursuant to this decision There shall however be a review of all promotions made so far from Grade IV to higher posts in the light of the new seniority list
