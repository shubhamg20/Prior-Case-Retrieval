All these petitions raise more or less the same questions for decision at any rate the main questions which fall for determination in these cases are the same There is a specific prayer for a writ of mandamus as against the opposite parties directing them not to ply and operate <ORG> on any of the routes on which the petitioners ply their vehicles In the statement of objects and reasons of this Act it was stated that the Act of which had been made to suit the conditions of motor vehicle traffic at an early stage of its development was no longer adequate to deal with the conditions which had come into existence on account of the rapid growth of motor transport in the country There was therefore a controversy raised by the private operators whose interests were affected and these operators challenged the power of the <ORG> to effect a monopoly in its own favour by resorting to certain powers which had apparently been conferred on the executive authority of the <ORG> under the Motor Vehicles Act Under the Motor Vehicles Act there was power vested in an authority called <ORG> to grant and regulate permits in respect of public vehicles and the <ORG> through this agency regulated private transport in such a manner as to eliminate private operators from some of the routes and thus laying those routes free for operation by <ORG> buss only The view expressed in that case was that it was not possible under the provisions of the Motor Vehicles and of the Constitution of India to create a monopoly in favour of the <ORG> It appears that the <ORG> Government was anxious to secure a monopoly in respect of motor vehicle transport and with this object it sought legislative authority from <ORG> The petitioners in all these petitions have challenged the validity of the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Act That by the Act the <ORG> has in effect acquired in any event an interest of the petitioners in an undertaking without making my provision for Section contains definitions Section confers power on <ORG> to run transport services Section provides for a scheme of transport services and by Sub section power is conferred to cancel or modify the existing permits granted under Chapter IV of the Motor Vehicles Act Section of the Act gives opportunity to persons whose interests were affected by the scheme promulgated under Section to object within thirty days from the publication of the scheme Sub section of Section provided that the procedure laid down in Sections and were to be followed so far as can be made applicable in alterations and modifications of a scheme under this section Section a to provides as fellows a The State Government may in the case of transport vehicles to be used by <ORG> or by <ORG> in conjunction with <ORG> provide for dispensation from observance of the provisions of Chapter IV of the Motor Vehicles Act as respects i the necessity of taking but or granting or countersigning permits ii the duration and renewal of permits iii the conditions attached to permits iv the cancellation and suspension of permits the restrictions on the number of permits as it may notify in that behalf in the official Gazette No person other than the State Government either singly or in conjunction with <ORG> shall except as may be provided under Clause be entitled to a permit under Chapter IV of the Motor Vehicles Act The State Government may specify the number of transport vehicles if any for which the permits may be granted or countersigned in favour of persons other than <ORG> or <ORG> and the Railway conjointly The State Government or any officer or authority empowered by it in this behalf may in the manner prescribed cancel any permit or direct that any permit or class of permits shall not be renewed or shall not be effective beyond such date as may be specified or reduce and curtail the number of vehicles or route covered by any permit or alter the conditions attached to any permit or attach any new condition to any permit granted under Chapter IV of the Motor Vehicles Act The provisions of clause are not very material but the provisions of Clause which are in these words are material The State Government may for purposes of this Act issue directions as it considers necessary to <ORG> <ORG> or any other authority or officer and such officer or authority shall forthwith give effect to all such orders and directions It was argued on behalf of the petitioners that this section gives power to <ORG> to discriminate Subsection of that section says Where there is any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of this Act and the provisions of any other law then the provisions of this Act shall prevail Sub section is in these words Any order made or deemed to be made under this Act Shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other enactment or any instrument having effect by virtue of such enactment a Every <ORG> commenced before the appointed date and operating on any route at such date and ii order cancelling or curtailing any permit for transport vehicle or attaching any new condition or altering the conditions already attached to any permit for such vehicle and every order reducing or otherwise fixing the number of transport vehicles to be used on any route or changing the route relating to the permit and every order refusing to renew any permit previously granted made on or before the appointed date on account of <ORG> running and operating or commencing to run and operate on the route to which the permit related shall be and is hereby made and declared to be valid in law any provision in the Motor Vehicles Act or any other law notwithstanding and Every route on which <ORG> was operating on the appointed date and every such service shall for purposes of this Act be deemed as the case may be to be a route specified in a notification under Section and the service operating under a scheme duly prepared and published under and in accordance with sections and provided that the State Government publishes in the official Gazette within fifteen days of the commencement of this Act a scheme as to the aforesaid road transport service providing as far as may be for all or any of the matters specified in Sub section of Section and the scheme so published shall be and be deemed to be the scheme duly confirmed and published under Sub section of Section and the route to which it relates shall be called a notified route and the provisions of Sections and shall be applicable thereto Any application for granting a permit for a transport vehicle made whether before or after the commencement of this Act in respect of a route which is or is deemed to be a notified route Shall notwithstanding anything in the Motor Vehicles Act or any judgment decree or order of a <ORG> be decided in accordance with the provisions of this Act as if the Act had been in force at all material dates By this clause the existing routes that is to say the routes on which the <ORG> transport services were operating on the appointed date were to become routes in accordance with a scheme prepared under the impugned Act and in respect of these the <ORG> Government was obviated the necessity of making the necessary declaration under Section and following the procedure laid down in Sections and Section of the impugned Act states Without prejudice to the provisions of Section but notwithstanding anything contained in the Motor Vehicles Act it shall be lawful for the Transport Commissioner or an officer appointed in that behalf by the Transport Commissioner to authorize a public carrier or contract carriage owned by <ORG> to be used on any or all route in Uttar Pradesh and the public service vehicle aforesaid may then be so used as if the authorization had been a permit granted under and in accordance with the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act This Section in effect gives power to the Transport Commissioner or an officer appointed in that behalf by the Transport Commissioner to authorize the running of any State vehicle on any route notwithstanding anything contained in the Motor Vehicles Act By Section power was conferred on the State Government to make rules for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of the impugned Act The State Government consequent upon the power conferred upon it by Section had made certain rules which were duly published in <ORG> on February All the petitions were classified by counsel appearing for the petitioners into two groups one which consisted of those petitioners whose route or operational area was curtailed because of action taken under the impugned Act and the other which consisted of those who were totally stopped from carrying on any operation on any route There was also another distinction which was pointed out namely the distinction that obtained between those operators who plied stage carriages and those who plied contract carriages A contract carriage has been defined in the Motor Vehicles Act in Section as follows contract carriage means a motor vehicle which carries a passenger or passengers for hire or reward under a contract expressed or implied for the use of the vehicle as a whole at or for a fixed or agreed rate or sum and from one point to another without stopping to pick up or set down along the line of route passengers not included in the contract and includes a motor cab not with standing that the passengers may pay separate fares Explanation Contract carriage does not include a motor vehicle possession of which has been temporarily transferred in accordance with an express agreement of hire for use as a private vehicle and which is used in accordance with the terms of such agreement Stage carriage has been defined by Section of the Act as follows Stage carriage means a motor vehicle carrying or adapted to carry more than six persons excluding the driver which carries passengers for hire or reward at separate fares paid by or for individual passengers either for the whole journey or for stages of the journey From the aforesaid definitions it would appear that a stage carriage is what is popularly known as a motor bus carrying passengers who wish to be carried along a public highway while a contract carriage is one which carries passengers under a specific contract and over a specific and agreed route and is not a carriage that runs on any particular route catering for passengers wishing to travel along that route Those counsel who followed <NAME> adopted the main arguments addressed to us by <NAME> and they only made submissions in regard to those points which required special attention in their respective cases our Constitution has also guaranteed certain freedoms to the individual citizens of India It has conferred what are called fundamental rights on the citizens and an invasion against these fundamental rights can be protected or guarded by having recourse to courts of law It was argued that the right to run a motor vehicle on the national highway was a trade or a business and a right to do that trade or business could only be affected by reasonable restrictions as were provided for by Sub Clause of that Article It was next argued that what has been done under the impugned Act is not to place a reasonable restriction on the exercise of the right guaranteed by Article but to completely destroy the right of trading by the running of motor vehicles on public highways In the Full Bench case in AIR All A an opinion was expressed by a majority of the Judges that the restrictions contemplated by Clause of Article of the Constitution could amount to a total annihilation of the right or a complete restriction thereof It was also pointed out in that case that nationalization of any industry did not appear to be possible without direct legislation and if there was a legislation to that effect then the legislation had probably to be justified under Article of the Constitution The right to use the public highway for purposes of trade or business was also recognized by <ORG> though it was pointed out that the right was exercisable subject to such reasonable restrictions and regulations which at times might even amount to prohibition as might be necessary to be imposed in the public interest The question which clearly arises for determination is what is the right which the petitioners possessed and which has according to them been destroyed by the impugned legislation Was it an unqualified right to run motor vehicles on the public highways unregulated and unrestricted or was it a right to run public vehicles on the national highways under a permit granted by the <ORG> a permit that contained restrictions under which the vehicles could be run To me it appears that the right which has been affected is not any unrestricted right to use the national highways because there was after the passing of the Motor Vehicles Act no such right The restrictions placed on the right of the individual to run motor vehicles on the public highways were not affected by the provisions of Article of the Constitution inasmuch as Clause of that Article provides that nothing in Sub Clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the Sub clause By Section of the Motor Vehicles Act it was made obligatory on all owners of transport vehicles to obtain a permit before they could use a vehicle on the public highway By Section of the Motor Vehicles Act power was conferred on <ORG> to grant or refuse to grant a contract carriage permit and by Section of the Act authority was vested to decide whether or not to grant a permit for a public carrier Be the position what it may even if there has been a restriction placed on an individual right of trade even then if the restriction is a reasonable restriction and in the public interest then the restriction has to be upheld It has to be borne in mind that in the operational field of a welfare <ORG> there are quite a large number of services which <ORG> is expected to render to the citizens of the <ORG> The guarantee as I see it is not that there is an un restricted right to do the things enumerated in that Article but the right is to do the things enumerated subject to reasonable restrictions or such restriction as are permissible it takes away that right of the individual if it does so then in my view it is not taking away any right of the individual to carry on any occupation trade or business On behalf of the <ORG> it was argued that Article of the Constitution indicated as in its amended state that the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business or industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of the citizens or otherwise was a permissible restriction on an individual right of trading Clause of Article was amended sometimes in and it came into force on June while the impugned Act came into force on February It was therefore argued on behalf of the petitioners that this amendment to Article could not affect the present case In order to be able to decide whether or not the amended clause could be made applicable in judging the validity of the impugned Act or not one has to decide first whether or not the references to matters contained in Sub clauses i and ii of Clause are in the nature of illustrations or did the amendment add substantially to the power which was originally contemplated to be conferred on legislatures in That there was a substantial amendment to Clause of Article admits in my view of no doubt for originally the words in Clause only provided in particular for such matters as related to prescribing professional and technical qualifications in respect of persons practising a profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business while in the amended form it provides in particular for permissible restrictions relating to not only professional or technical qualifications but also in regard to the individual rights being curtailed so that the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business in the <ORG> or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise may be possible In this view of the matter it appears to me that it was not possible for the <ORG> to rely on the power conferred on it by Clause of Article in its amended form for saying that the impugned legislation was beyond challenge because of what was contained in Clause ii of Article since this amendment came after the impugned Act had been placed on the statute book It is necessary therefore to see whether the impugned Act can be justified on the ground that if it affects the right of the individual to carry on an occupation trade or business then it affects those rights only in so far as it place reasonable restrictions on the exercise of those rights It was contended for the petitioners that the creation of a monopoly in favour of the <ORG> could never be called a reasonable restriction on the individual right of trade It was urged by the appellants that prohibitory As was pointed out by their Lordships of <ORG> in the case of the Commonwealth of Australia <ORG> each case has to be judged on its own facts and what may be reasonable restrictions in one case may not be so under the circumstances of another ease It may further have to be judged in certain cases having regard to geographical conditions A good deal of criticism was offered by learned counsel appearing for the petitioners against the transport services which were being run by the <ORG> for some time but most of these criticisms in my view were more imaginary than real It may further be stated here that there was no sufficient material before the <ORG> in these petitions for it to be able to say that the monopoly which was contemplated in favour of the <ORG> in regard to motor transport services under the impagned Act was not conducive to the common good It was next contended on behalf of the petitioners that the impugned legislation was discriminatory and it infringed the provisions of Article of the Constitution Article of the Constitution is in these words The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India It was argued that there was under the impugned Act no equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws to people who wished to carry on the business of transporting passengers by motor vehicles It was further contended that under Section <ORG> was armed with the power to discriminate between one service and another and between one group of persons and another because it was left to <ORG> to say whether or not it was going to take over the transport Services in general or to take over any particular class of such service or to take over any route or a portion thereof It may further be pointed out what else <NAME> observed Article of the Constitution lays down as important fundamental right which should be closely and vigilantly guarded but in construing it we should not adopt a doctrinaire approach which might choke all beneficial legislation <NAME> also approved the following passage from <NAME> book on Constitional Law There is no rule for determining when classification for the police power is reasonable In doing this the <ORG> may consider matters of common knowledge matters Of common report the history of the times and to sustain it they will assume every state of facts which can be conceived of as existing at the time of legislation For such proof it must be shown that there is no reasonable basis for the classification Willis Constitutional Law st Edition page It is an accepted doctrine of <ORG> and which seems to me to be well founded on principle that the presumption is in favour of the constitutionality of an enactment and the burden is upon him who attacks it to show that there has been a transgression of constitutional principles He then relied on the following passage from the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> US at page It must be presumed that a <ORG> understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people that its laws arc directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discriminations are based upon adequate grounds <NAME> further pointed out as follows It should be noted that there is no reference to intention in Article and the gravemen of that Article is equality of treatment In the same case <NAME> observed as follows By the process of classification the <ORG> has the power of determining who should be regarded as a class for purposes of legislation and in relation to a law enacted on a particular subject <NAME> further observed Classification thus means segregation in classes which have a systematic relation usually found in common properties and characteristics To get out of its reach it must appear that not only a classification has been made but also that it is one based upon a reasonable ground on some difference which bears a just and proper relation to the attempted classification and is not a mere arbitrary selection Discrimination involves an element of unfavourable bias and it is in that sense that the expression has to be understood in the context In this case it was pointed out that Equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Article of the Constitution does not mean that all laws must be general in character and universal in application and that the <ORG> is no longer to have the power of distinguishing and classifying persons or things for the purposes of legislation It was also pointed out in this case that it was for a court to find out whether having regard to the underlying purposes of the Act as disclosed by its title preamble and provisions the classification resorted to was or was not unreasonable I have quoted extensively from the decisions of <ORG> in order to glean out the important principles which have to be borne in mind in applying the provisions of Article of the Constitution to the facts and circumstances of any particular case a classification which bears a reasonable and just resemblance to the subject matter of the legislation then it cannot be contended that the legislation was in the teeth of the guarantee contained in Article It is permissible for a court to take into account the title the preamble as also the framework of the legislation to determine the true scope and nature of it In determining the purpose of the legislation and further in determining whether the provisions contained in the legislation are likely to achieve the objects with which the legislation was forged courts must lean in favour of the view that the objects are likely to be achieved since the legislature was of that view as was pointed out by <ORG> of America in <NAME> <ORG> It must be presumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people and its laws are directed to problems made manifest by experience and that its discrimination are based upon adequate grounds When I say this I have in mind the Road Transport Corporation Act Act LXIV of From all this it appears to me that the creation of monopolies in respect of those matters which appropriately fall under the head of public utility services cannot be assailed on the ground of either placing unreasonable restrictions on the individual right of trade or on the ground that such legislation is discriminatory legislation I believe I would be right when I say that no court can presume or lightly accept the contention that there are apparent or any real conflicts and inconsistencies between different parts of the same Constitution All reasonable classifications which have a proper and just resemblance to the subject matter of the legislation cannot be hit by the guarantee contained in Article has to be conceded on the statement of the law already indicated by me earlier Therefore the only question that arises for determination in this connection is whether the classification visualised or indicated in Clause ii of Article is a reasonable classification Having in mind the scope of the legislation which necessarily would fall within the scope of Sub Clause ii of Clause it appears to me that the classification indicated must be held at least after the amendment became effective to be a reasonable classification in relation to the field of legislation which is indicated in that sub clause Nothing in Clause shall prevent the <ORG> from imposing or authorising the imposition of any tax to such an extent if any as <ORG> may by law provide in respect of a trade or business of any kind carried on by or on behalf of the Government of a State or any operations connected therewith or any property used or occupied for the purposes of such trade or business or any income accruing or arising in connection therewith We must now see whether in the impugned Act there is or is not a reasonable classification having a proper relation to the Subject matter of the legislation Therefore the only question that arises for determination is whether this classification is reasonable or not In order to determine whether a particular classification is proper or improper one has also to bear in mind the prevailing national sentiments and the prevailing economic theories so that a classification which may not have been judged proper in the th century may be judged as eminently just proper and reasonable in the th century It was further contended on behalf of the petitioners that under Section of the impugned Act unrestricted power was conferred on <ORG> to discriminate between one set of operators and another It was Said that it was left to the objective discretion of <ORG> to determine which operators were to be joined with the State and which were to be left out it was also said that it was left to the objective determination of <ORG> to take over or not to take over any particular route or class of service Equal protection claims under Article always are examined with the presumption that the <ORG> action is reasonable and just this was so stated by Chief Justice <NAME> in the case of <NAME> a case to which I have already made reference Unless it can be shown that the discrimination that has been resorted to or the power to discriminate has been given without reason it cannot be said that there is unequal treatment It cannot be contended reasonably that <ORG> would without reason discriminate or that there is in Section of the impugned Act a power to discriminate without reason given to <ORG> I do not therefore consider that Section of the impugned Act confers on <ORG> a power which could be utilized by them arbitrarily for making discrimination The argument before the <ORG> was that Section a of the Motor Vehicles Act was ultra vires inasmuch as it conferred power on the State to discriminate between individuals and itself They expressed the view that the <ORG> could not engage in business or commerce denying equality before the <ORG> or equal protection of the laws to other persons as against itself The reason behind this view appears to me to have been that under Section a there was a clear discrimination between the <ORG> and the individuals in the same field of activity and there was no classification of the <ORG> in one group and the individuals in the other group The differentiation was made between persons falling in the same group and so did <NAME> But as I have pointed out above there was a clear distinction between the power conferred on the <ORG> under Section a of the Motor Vehicles Act and the power conferred by Section of the impugned Act <NAME> said this It is true that the vehicles of the <ORG> used for a purpose other than that of carrying passengers or goods on hire fell under a distinct category and can by law be treated separately and if Section a had been confined to such vehicles of the <ORG> there could have been no objection to its validity But since the impugned clause is not restricted in it operation to such vehicles of the <ORG> and is applicable to vehicles which are used by the <ORG> for the purposes of carrying on motor transport business for profit in competition with private individuals the clause must be held to be bad Any order made or deemed to be made under this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other enactment or any instrument having effect by virtue of such enactment Section of the aforementioned Act was in these words Any order made under Section shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than this Act or any instrument having effect by virtue of any enactment other than this Act We do not think that there is any essential difference between the two There is no difference in principle between an express repeal and an implied repeal I must therefore hold that the provisions of Section of the impugned Act are ultra vires <ORG> on the same reasons which impelled <ORG> in <NAME> case to come to the conclusion that Section of the Essential Supplies Temporary Powers Act was ultra vires the <ORG> The next contention raised on behalf of the petitioners was that by the impugned Act the petitioners had not only been deprived of their property but further that property in the shape of an interest in a commercial undertaking had been taken possession of or acquired ostensibly for public purposes by the <ORG> without making any provision for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and therefore such a legislation was bad in view of the provisions of Article of the Constitution The other question that arises is whether there was any acquisition of such an interest by the <ORG> under the impugned Act If it was property then there is no doubt that under the impugned Act the petitioners have been deprived of that property although such deprivation has been by the authority of the law The argument on behalf of the <ORG> made by the learned Advocate General was that the right which has been affected of the petitioners under the impugned Act was not strictly speaking either property or an interest in a business undertaking Reliance was placed on the well known case of the Minister of State for the Army <NAME> Comm LR particularly on the following observation of <NAME> at page In such circumstances he may well say You take my house when you do take the prop that doth sustain my house you take my life When you do take the means whereby I live I do not think that there is any substance in this contention In the case before us there is nothing which gets vested in the alleged acquirer although there is restriction of a similar thing in another It is necessary at this stage to refer to Article of the Constitution which guarantee certain rights in respect of property No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law No property movable or immovable including any interest in or in any company owning any commercial or industrial undertaking shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixed the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given The right to compensation only arises when there is an acquisition by the <ORG> of the thing of which an individual is deprived In order to judge whether there is a right to compensation or not the property acquired must be traceable to the earlier owner who has been deprived of it before any question of compensation can under our Constitution arise The right to get compensation under American Constitution is on a AIL slightly different looting for the words in the American Constitution are these Nor shall any person be deprived of property without due process of law In America there is no separate provision for acquisition after deprivation as there is in our Constitution The petitioners were running buses on certain routes under a permit granted to them by an appropriate authority the running of these buses has now been stopped by the State under the powers conferred by the impugned Act It is on this state of facts that it was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the State has first deprived the petitioners of their property and has thereafter acquired that property itself It must be borne in mind in this connection that under the Motor Vehicles Act everyone who could obtain the necessary permit was entitled to run buses or motor vehicles on such routes as were permitted To me it appears that it could not be said that there was by the <ORG> any acquisition of the right which was formerly of the petitioners whether such right was property or an interest in a commercial or industrial undertaking This right of the petitioners has in no way been vested in the <ORG> inasmuch as the <ORG> always had an equal right with the petitioners to run their buses on those routes I do not consider this to be so for if this were so then every individual who had a potential right to apply for a permit and get it could say that his right also has been acquired by the <ORG> and as such he was entitled to compensation The right to claim compensation is not founded on any such notional or far fetched conceptions Under the Motor Vehicles Act it was open to the appropriate authority to grant as many permits as the issuing authority considered proper in respect of any particular route so that when more people were put as competitors on a route then there was in a sense a taking of some of that man right who was earlier on that route I have already pointed out that mere deprivation is not enough justification for claiming compensation under our Constitution and in these case there was no acquisition of that of which the petitioners were deprived by the <ORG> I would further like to point out that I have already held that what was done by the impugned Act was to place reasonable restriction on the rights of the petitioners and there was no taking of any property of the petitioners When once it is found that the restriction imposed is reasonable and there is no actual taking then no question of compensation can arise I must therefore hold that the impugned Act is riot ultra vires inasmuch as it makes no provision for compensation for in my view there was no occasion to make any provision for any compensation payable to the petitioners It is appropriate to point out that by Article it is competent for the <ORG> of a State to impose such reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse as may be required in the public interest There however is a proviso which has to be borne in mind in connection with the exercise of the power conferred on the State <ORG> to which reference is just being made The guarantee contained in Article therefore is not an unqualified guarantee Article of the Constitution gives protection to an individual to the extent that he can practice any profession or carry on any occupation trade or business Article more or less is complementary to this general provision contained in Article inasmuch as Article gives a kind of territorial protection to trade commerce and intercourse a protection which incidentally enures to the benefit of those who engage in trade business and commerce or carry on intercourse of the type visualised under this Article I should like to quote here the following observations of the learned Chief Justice in <NAME> case A The correct interpretation seems to be that Article lays down the rights of the citizen while Article deals with how the trade commerce and intercourse is to be carried on between one place and another whether the two places are situated in two States or are inside the same State Considerable reliance was placed by <NAME> on the decision in All ER On the strength of this decision of <ORG> it was contended by <NAME> that if their Lordships were of the opinion that the business of banking which consisted of the creation and transfer of credit the making of loans the purchase and disposal of investments and other kindred transactions could be included in the activities described as trade commerce and intercourse and if by monopolizing such trade commerce and intercourse Article of the Australian Constitution was violated then obviously Article of our Constitution had been violated by the impugned legislation <ORG> itself pointed out that Every case must be judged on its own facts and in its own setting of time and circumstance The conception of freedom of trade commerce and intercourse in a community regulated by law presupposes some degree of restriction upon the individual i and their Lordships observed that two general propositions arose out of this conception that regulation of trade commerce and intercourse among the States was compatible with its absolute freedom and that Section of the Constitution the Australian Constitution which was more or less similar to Article of our Constitution was violated only when a legislative or executive act operated to restrict such trade commerce or intercourse directly and immediately as distinct from creating some indirect or consequential impediment which might fairly be regarded as remote From the observations of their Lordships of <ORG> it is clear to me that in order to determine whether there has been an infringement of Article of the Constitution or not the pith and substance of the enactment must be seen Attempt was made in this case to advance the argument on behalf of the petitioners by giving the matter a higher degree of definition than it admitted The words of <NAME> on which reliance was placed were these Nor can I share the view that the protection is against none but direct interference with inter State trade commerce and intercourse But whatever may have been the view of <NAME> the view that must prevail with us is the view expressed by their Lordships of <ORG> a view to which I have already made reference I may at this stage refer to an Australian case namely that of <NAME> <NAME> reported in Comm LR In this case one of the points that arose for decision was whether the New South Wales State Transport Co ordination Act was valid in view of the provisions of Section of the Australian Constitution It was held by the majority of Judges forming that Bench that The New South Wales State Transport Co ordination Act did not directly or even indirectly affect the freedom of inter State trade As I read Section of the impugned Act I do not see any such power being conferred on executive officers of the <ORG> The Section gives a right to the executive authority to make certain orders in respect of specified matters by this section the executive authority has not been vested with the power to either cancel or modify any previous legislation In order to appreciate the argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners it is necessary to reiterate some of the facts Another notification appears to have been published in <ORG> dated December Notification No TP XXX which refers to a Notification dated February in pursuance of the provisions of Sections and read with subsection of Section of the impugned Act It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the Notification having stated that it was the Governor who was to consider the objections the consideration of the objections by a Deputy Secretary of Government was illegal and without jurisdiction It is important to note that under Section of the impugned Act it was not possible for <ORG> to delegate the powers conferred on it by Section of that Act The notification which said that the Governor was to consider the objections also indicates that there was no prescribed authority which was to consider these objections It was contended that permitting consideration of these objections by the Deputy Secretary was in effect a delegation of the power to the Deputy Secretary and there being no power of delegation possible under the provisions of Section of the impugned Act the consideration of the objections by the Deputy Secretary was ultra vires and if that was so then there was no consideration of the objections and no finality therefore could attach to the schemes which have been given effect to The question that has to be considered therefore first is whether there was a consideration of the objections by the Deputy Secretary this question arises because it was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that the Deputy Secretary merely heard the objections and after hearing them advised the Governor who must be deemed to have really considered them It must be admitted that it is one of the principles of natural justice that if a man has a right to prefer objections to something then he ought to have also a right to be heard in support of his objections unless of course it is made clear by law that there is to be no right of hearing but the right to object is confined to a right to make written objections Under rule of the rules framed under the impugned Act any person wishing to file objections under Section was to do so in the form of a memorandum in duplicate setting forth concisely the grounds of objections to the scheme If therefore under the rules framed under the impugned Act there was power only in <ORG> to consider the objections then the consideration of the objections by the Deputy Secretary was unjustified We have also noticed that there could be no delegation of this power that is to say <ORG> could not nor could the prescribed authority if there was any under Section delegate power to anybody else to consider the objection this is so because of the provisions of Section of the impugned Act It was further contended that under the provisions of the impugned Act there was no question of giving anyone a hearing in regard to the objections but since the rules by implication provided for a hearing of the objections the hearing was before a Deputy Secretary of Government who must be deemed to have acted as a subordinate officer of the Governor acting which was possible constitutionally This indicates that a consideration was given by the Governor to the objections as provided for by Section the notification having been published in accordance with Section of the impugned Act There was no allegation on behalf of the petitioners that the matters which were submitted orally by them before the Deputy Secretary were not brought to the notice of the Governor before he made the final orders in respect of these matters I must assume that the Deputy Secretary in the normal course of his official business apprised the Governor of what was submitted on behalf of the petitioners before him and further I must assume that the Governor gave due consideration to those matters before he came to his decision Accordingly I do not think that there was any real substance in the contention raised on behalf of the petitioners in regard to this matter I therefore hold that the schemes finally published were not open to challenge on the ground that the petitioners had either no opportunity of raising objections or that the objections had been decided by an improper authority or that the procedure followed in I deciding those matters was an illegal procedure It was contended by <NAME> on behalf of some of the petitioners that some of them did not know the date on which their objections were to be heard It was however conceded that notice of the first hearing was given to these petitioners and all that happened was that the hearing could not take place on that date for want of time or some such reason and therefore it was adjourned to some other date and that the petitioners could not know the adjourned date of hearing On the material before me I am not satisfied that the petitioners could not have known the adjourned date of hearing if they had taken proper care and proper steps to know of it That being so I do not think that any legitimate grievance can be made by the petitioners on that score I do not consider that there is much substance in this contention first because the publication of the notice was not of the essence of the matter and secondly because everyone admittedly had knowledge of the schemes and the absence of the publication of such notice did not in any manner prejudice anybody As have already noticed there were certain contradictions or inconsistencies between the notification which issued in English and the notification that issued in Hindi but these contradictions or inconsistencies do not affect the substance of the matter I cannot however help saying that people concerned with making these notifications should have taken greater care in having them published in Hindi To me it appears that it is of importance that in the matter of issuing and publishing notifications which are now issued in Hindi and it may be noted that it is only that Hindi version of the <ORG> that is available to the general public great care should be taken The last point that was argued on behalf of the petitioners was that even if the impugned Act authorized the cancellation of permits which had been granted by the officers of this State in respect of motor vehicles which were being operated under those permits that Act could not have extra territorial application and no permits which had been granted to some of the petitioners by authorities outside this State could be cancelled under the said Act This argument was based on the fact that there were certain petitioners who operated their buses within the State on permits which had been granted to them by <ORG> Whether or not there could be power to cancel such permits the impugned Act could certainly give power to <ORG> not to let anyone operate his bus within the territory of the State irrespective of the fact whether he was operating his bus on a permit obtained from an authority within the State or because of a permit granted to him by an authority outside the State Under the impugned Act no power has been conferred on <ORG> to operate extra territorially and no such action has been taken as I see it by <ORG> under that Act These are writ petitions filed on behalf of certain persons who have been carrying on the business of transport of persons and goods for hire on various routes situate in the State of Uttar Pradesh Notices were issued under the Motor Vehicles Act mentioned above which had the effect of excluding from certain routes all private transport vehicles which were used for hire and the business of motor transport was to remain exclusively in the hands of <ORG> With that object in view a number of permits issued to the private operators were cancelled and certain other operators were refused the permits which they would otherwise have been entitled to This was about the time when the Constitution of India came into force and a number of writ petitions were filed in this Court in the year challenging this action of <ORG> The private operators of motor buses have filed the above petitions and the main prayers contained in the petitions are that writs in the nature of mandamus or other directions or orders be issued against the opposite parties directing them to refrain from enforcing the different schemes and from interfering with the petitioners business of transport and also to issue writs of certiorari quashing certain notification issued by <ORG> and the <ORG> authorities Stage carriages are those which are adapted to carry more than six persons excluding the driver and which carry passengers for hire or reward at separate fares paid by or for individual passengers either for the whole journey or for stages of the journey whereas contract carriages are those which carry passengers for hire under a contract for the use of the vehicle as a whole from one point to another without stopping to pick up or sit down along the line of route passengers not included in the contract Section authorises any person whose interests may be affected to file objections before the Transport Commissioner within days of the publication of the scheme and the State Government or the prescribed authority after considering the objections may either confirm modify or alter the scheme Section provides for the appointment of a Transport Commissioner and Section for the appointment of Advisory Committees Section provides that in case of any conflict or any inconsistency between the provisions of the impugned Act and the provisions of any other law the provisions of the impugned Act are to prevail and any order made or deemed to be made under the impugned Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other enactment Section authorises <ORG> to make rules for the purposes of carrying into effect the provisions of the Act and <ORG> in accordance with the provisions of the section has made certain rules which have been duly published in the <ORG> The main arguments in the case have been advanced on behalf of the petitioners by Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> who appear in the majority of these petitions The main arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the petitioners may be classified under the following heads that the impugned Act is bad as it contravenes the provisions of Article of the Constitution inasmuch as it discriminates between the State on the one hand and the citizen on the other and also inasmuch as it permits discrimination by <ORG> or its officers between one motor transport operator and another that the impugned Act is bad as it purports to interfere with the fundamental rights granted to the petitioners by Article of the Constitution to carry on their business of motor transport that the impugned Act contravenes the provisions of Article of the Constitution inasmuch as it provides for acquisition by the State of the business of transporting goods and passengers carried on by the petitioners without the payment of any compensation and without there being any public purpose behind this acquisition and that the impugned Act is bad as it contravenes the provisions of Article of the Constitution which directs that all inter State trade and also intra State trade shall be free The objections under this head are twofold that the <ORG> and the citizen stand on the same footing and if a monopoly cannot be created in favour of an individual it cannot be created in favour of the <ORG> either and that the Act makes it possible for the <ORG> Government and its officers to discriminate between one citizen and another inasmuch as the permits granted to the petitioners can be cancelled at the sweetwill of the officers concerned who may cancel the permit of one operator and maintain that of another The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners under head is that it has been laid down in the <ORG> case of <NAME> A already referred to that the <ORG> when it carries on business is as much a person as a private individual and Article of the Constitution prohibits preferential treatment being accorded to the <ORG> in the matter of trade Subsection of that Section prohibited every owner of a transport vehicle from using or permitting the use of the vehicle in any place except in accordance with the conditions of a permit granted or countersigned by a Regional or Provincial Transport authority It is this provision the validity of which was challenged on the ground of improper discrimination in favour of vehicles owned by the Government Section of the Motor Vehicles Act made it compulsory for private operators to obtain permits but an exception was made in favour of the <ORG> and the Full Bench held that as the <ORG> was competing with private individuals in the matter of trade an exception in favour of the <ORG> vehicles from the operation of Section was a discriminatory piece of legislation and it therefore became void after coming into force of the Constitution It further held that there was no provision in the Motor Vehicles Act which could authorise any <ORG> Government to nationalise the trade nor was there any legislation elsewhere to authorise such nationalisation It was therefore held that an attempt by <ORG> to nationalise transport trade by executive orders was illegal but at the same time they made it quite clear that they were not deciding the question that if a legislation was passed authorising the nationalisation of any trade such a legislation would be valid or not In the present case we have to decide the question left open by <ORG> namely whether such a legislation is a valid piece of legislation This brings me to the question whether the State Road Transport Act contains any classification and whether that classification can be said to be a reasonable one In either of these three cases it is left to the discretion of <ORG> to decide in the manner it considers to be in the interest of the general public and for subserving the common good Transport service is a public utility service and the considerations which are expected to guide a <ORG> in running such a service are widely different from the considerations which are expected to guide a private citizen in the matter of such a trade In the Union of India itself the <ORG> passed the Road Transport <ORG> Act Act of permitting nationalisation of motor road transports and it provided for the constitution of <ORG> I further find that Article was amended by the Constitution First Amendment Act of and the effect of the amendment is that an exclusive right to trade by a <ORG> or by a <ORG> owned or controlled by a <ORG> even to the total exclusion of others is considered as a reasonable restriction to the fundamental right of a citizen to carry on trade granted by Article These matters are all matters of detail which have to be left to the officers responsible for working the scheme under the supervision of the <ORG> Government and no hard and fast rule could possibly have been laid down by the <ORG> itself which could govern the cases of all the different routes and the individual operators Great reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the petitioners on the case in AIR SC It was left to the discretion of <ORG> to have one case of the same kind tried by <ORG> and another by the regular court It was held by their Lordships that a rule of procedure comes as much within the purview of Article of the Constitution as any rule of substantive law and that it was not necessary for the applicant to prove that the <ORG> had the intention to discriminate against him if the discrimination was a necessary consequence of the Act After considering <NAME> case and the case in AIR SC their Lordships came to the conclusion that the case of <NAME> was governed by the Saurashtra case where certain provisions of the State Public Safety Third Amendment Ordinance LXVI of were held to be valid It seems reasonable if misuse of the special machinery provided for the more effective punishment of certain classes of offenders is to be avoided that some competent authority should be invested with the power to make a selection of the cases which should be dealt with under the special Act I have no reason to doubt that officers of <ORG> would fairly and properly look into the matter and after taking everything into consideration make their selections with respect to the routes as well as the individual operators The objection under Article of the Constitution is that the impugned Act infringes the rights of the petitioners conferred upon them by Articles and and the main contention on behalf of the petitioners has been that it is the right to practise and carry on the transport trade which has been improperly taken away Sub clause really does not apply to the case as no restriction has been placed on the petitioners acquiring holding or disposing of any property No part of their undertaking or property has been acquired and the only right they have been deprived of is the right to carry on their trade of transporting goods and passengers Sub clause has therefore no application to the case and Sub clause is the only clause which requires consideration Sub Clause confers a right on all the citizens to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business Clause lays down that nothing contained in Sub clause shall prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the Sub clause This is the general restriction on the right and it has been mentioned that in particular nothing in the said sub clauses shall prevent the <ORG> from making any law prescribing or empowering any authority to prescribe the professional or technical qualifications for practising any profession or carrying on occupation trade or business Clause stood as above till the th of June when the latter portion of the clause was substituted by the following words nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation at any existing law in so far as it relates to or prevent the State from making any law relating to i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business or ii the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise If this amendment were applicable to the present case the point that the impugned Act contravenes the provisions of Article would not have been even arguable The impugned Act however came into force on the th of February before the Constitution First Amendment Act of came into force Existing law has been denned in Article of the Constitution as any law passed or made before the commencement of this Constitution I have therefore to see whether the impugned Act contravenes the provisions of Article read with as it originally stood It was argued that Article of the Constitution does not confer on the citizen any new rights but only guarantees the already existing right under the general law But this question is really of no importance because whether the Article preserves the old existing rights or confers new ones there can be no doubt that every citizen after the Constitution in any case has the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business subject to the right of the <ORG> of making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the citizens rights in the interests of the general public Attention has therefore to be confined to these provisions of the Constitution as it would serve no useful purpose to embark upon an enquiry as to what the rights of the citizens were before the Constitution and whether the same rights have been preserved or new ones have been conferred I have therefore to see whether <ORG> is authorised to pass a law nationalising a trade under Clause as it originally stood State could impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of the general public and it has been held that reasonable restrictions may even amount to the complete stoppage of any particular trade under certain circumstances It cannot be doubted that in the case of obnoxious trade the <ORG> can properly and validly put a complete prohibition against it in the interest of the general public for example nobody can doubt that the <ORG> has a right to stop the trade of selling publicly obscene literature or libellous matter After the <ORG> also entered into competition the services have been substantially improved on certain routes in the western and the hill districts and if taking an over all view of the entire position the <ORG> has come to the conclusion that all the motor transport trade should be nationalised there is no reason to hold that this action of the <ORG> is in any way unreasonable Nationalisation of any trade effected before the Constitution came into force and similar nationalisation effected after the amendment of Clause of Article will generally be upheld as a reasonable restriction in view of the amendment of the Constitution and I see no reason to hold that the same could not be the result if the legislation was passed after the th January and before the th January Still if nationalisation were prohibited by the Constitution as it stood before the amendment I would have been compelled to hold that the impugned Act is void But in view of what I have stated above I am of the opinion that nationalisation in the matter of public utility services was permissible even according to the constitution as it stood before the amendment On the th April <ORG> passed certain bye laws providing that wholesale business in vegetables shall be carried on only in the Municipal Market the person authorised by <ORG> shall be the only person who could carry on such business The result of the bye laws was that <NAME> could not carry on the business in his own shop and the contract for the business was given by <ORG> to a third person <NAME> applied for permission to carry on the trade but his application was rejected and subsequently a notice was issued to him to stop the business in his shop The argument of the learned counsel is that this observation of their Lordships means that all monopolies in the matter of trade are prohibited by the Constitution as they amount to more than reasonable restrictions on the right to carry on the trade There are two clear distinctions between this case and the present case In this case it was laid down by their Lordships that Section of and Berar Regulation of Manufacture of Biris Agricultural Purposes Act Act of was ultra vires inasmuch as it imposed total prohibition of carrying on the business of the manufacture of Biris during the agricultural season arbitrarily and it interfered with private business It consequently could not be said to impose reasonable restrictions on the fundamental rights conferred by Article of the Constitution It cannot be said in the case under consideration that the provision of the Act have no reasonable relation to the object in view or that they go in excess of that object The principles therefore laid down by their Lordships of <ORG> in that case have no application to this case The next case cited by the learned counsel is also a <ORG> case reported in Raghubir Singh Court of Wards AIR SC It was argued that the provisions of Section amounted to reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by Article of the Constitution and these restrictions were in the interest of the general public It was further observed that when a law deprived a person of possession of his property for an indefinite period based merely on the subjective determination of an executive officer such a law could on no construction be called reasonable That case has no bearing on the question under consideration Their Lordships further held that where a legislation which interfered with fundamental rights was sought to be sustained as falling within the scope of Article the question whether it was reasonable and made in the interest of the public was one open to judicial review I respectfully agree with this observation of the learned Judges but after a consideration of all the facts and circumstances of the case as well as the cases cited at the <ORG> I have come to the conclusion that the creation of a State monopoly in the matter of a motor transport trade or the nationalisation of such a trade in the interest of the general public is a reasonable restriction on the rights of the citizen guaranteed under Article of the Constitution The next point argued by the learned counsel was that the effect of this legislation was the acquisition or taking possession of the property of the petitioners and as no compensation was provided for that and as there was no public purpose behind it the legislation is rendered void as it contravened the provisions of Article of the Constitution To a case actually falling under Article of the Constitution the provisions of Article can have no application and similarly to a case falling within the ambit of Article the provisions of Article have no application Article permits the imposition of reasonable restrictions on the rights conferred by Article and I have already held that the present Act came within the scope of Clause of Article and the restrictions imposed by the Act were reasonable It is clear from the Act itself that there is no provision for payment of any compensation and if the case is really covered by Article then the impugned Act must be held to be void because it does not provide for the payment of any compensation It was argued by the learned counsel for the petitioners that they had a right to carry on the business or trade of transporting passengers and goods by means of motor vehicles on the routes in question and that right of theirs was property Section of this Act says that no person shall have a right to ply his motor vehicle for hire on a public thoroughfare except under and in accordance with the terms of the permit granted to him under the succeeding provisions of the Act But if those conditions are fulfilled and other considerations do not stand in the way a citizen would have a right to run his motor vehicle on the thoroughfare for earning profits There are some observations made by the learned Judges in <NAME> case A pointing to this conclusion and with great respect I agree with the law laid down there I am therefore prepared to hold that the right of the petitioners to carry on transport trade through their motor vehicles under the terms and conditions of the permit was there when the impugned Act was passed The learned counsel for the petitioners cited some cases in support of his contention that this right was property There is no question of any goodwill in the present case and the case cited above does not appear to be very helpful In this case it was held that the word undertaking used in Rule of the Defence of India Rules and Section Government of India Act was synonymous with the word business and that the business of carrying on the hotel came within the meaning of the word undertaking in the above provisions The case of Comm LR was a case where under Regulation of the National Security General Regulations the <ORG> took for an indefinite period exclusive possession of certain property and it was held that this taking possession of amounted to an acquisition of property It was held that this taking over amounted to an acquisition as the word was not restricted to any particular type of interest or to any particular type of property but it extended to the acquisition of any interest in any property But in the present case there is no right in any property that has been taken away but it is only the general right of every citizen to use a thoroughfare that has been affected There can be no doubt that the business of banking is trade but that question is not the question that I have to determine in this case The impugned Act only destroys the right to carry passengers and goods for hire on the notified routes and it cannot be said that the petitioners had any right or title in the land nor have they by the impugned Act been prohibited from carrying on their business elsewhere The right of the petitioners was the same right which every citizen has for using the highway but it cannot be said that every citizen has property in the highway because he has a right to carry on the business of transport on the highway These permits were liable to be cancelled for specified reasons but the discretion given to the transport authorities is so wide that it is difficult to say that the right acquired by the permit can be classified as property Whatever doubt there might be on the point there can however be no doubt in my opinion on the next question as to whether the <ORG> has acquired or taken possession of this very right of the petitioners It also has a right to run its own motor vehicles on the public thoroughfares and when it confines the right to itself it does not acquire the right of the citizen to use the highway for profits but exercises its own right exclusively with the result that the citizen is deprived of his right But it cannot be said that the <ORG> has acquired his right to run the buses because as stated above the <ORG> has an undoubted right in itself to run its own motor transports on public thoroughfares The right of the petitioners comes only to this that they could run a particular vehicle on a particular route for a limited period of time and the right to run that vehicle has not been acquired by the <ORG> though the petitioners have been deprived of it For the reasons given above I have come to the conclusion that the case is not covered by Article of the Constitution at all and the objection on this ground also fails I now come to the question whether the impugned Act purports to contravene the provisions of Article of the Constitution and It has been argued that this Article not only safegiards the right of the citizen to inter state trade but it safeguards the rights also to intra State trade but the impugned Act prohibits the petitioners from carrying on both inter State and intra State trade I am unable to accept this argument because in my opinion what the Article safeguards is the carrying on of the trade as distinguished from the right of any individual to carry it on Article and Article have been framed in order to secure two different objects Great reliance was placed by the learned counsel bn the case in All ER which is a decision by their Lordships of <ORG> in an appeal from Australia Their Lordships were interested in interpreting the provisions of Article of the Australian Constitution which provides On the imposition of uniform duties of cus toms trade commerce and intercourse among the States whether by means of an internal carriage or ocean navigation shall be absolutely free The Commonwealth of Australia had passed a law nationalising the banking trade and the validity of this Act was challenged on the ground that it contravened the provisions of Article of the Constitution But the distinction is that in our Constitution the rights of the individual have been separately provided for and this Article has been placed in a different part of the Constitution altogether If the individual citizen had no other right it could have been said that Article protects the individual right as well as the flow of the trade itself The same question was previously raised before <ORG> in <NAME> case A and while dealing with this part of the case the Hon ble Chief Justice observed The correct interpretation seems to be that Article lays down the rights of the citizen while Article deals with how the trade commerce and intercourse is to be carried on between one place and another whether the two places are situated in two States or are inside the same State Section is in the following words Any order made or deemed to be made under this Act shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other enactment or any instrument having effect by virtue of such enactment Numerous kind of orders can be passed by <ORG> and its officers under different provisions of the impugned Act and this Sub section provides that those orders shall have effect notwithstanding any provisions of any other enactment The question is really concluded by a decision of a <ORG> of this Court in AIR All All the cases therefore are governed by the provisions of Section of the impugned Act This sub section says Every route on which <ORG> was operating on the appointed date and every such service shall for purposes of this Act be deemed as the case may be to be a route specified in a notification under section and the service operating under a scheme duly prepared and published under and in accordance with sections and provided that the State Government publishes in the Official Gazette within fifteen days of the commencement of this Act a scheme as to the aforesaid road transport service providing as far as may be for all or any of the matters specified in sub section of section and the scheme so published shall be and be deemed to be the scheme duly confirmed and published under subsection of section and the route to which it relates shall be called a notified route and the provisions of sections and shall be applicable thereto This notification only mentioned the situation as it existed on that date and that Situation as it then prevailed was the scheme which was notified under Section All the present petitioners filed their objections excepting one Agarwala who is the petitioner in Writ Case No of There was another scheme with respect to a different route concerning which Writ Cases Nos and of have been filed and it was published on the th of April Section of the Act provides that a notification has to be issued where <ORG> is satisfied that it is necessary in the interest of general public and for subserving the common good and then it may declare that the Road Transport services shall be run exclusively by <ORG> or in conjunction with others But this objection cannot be upheld for two reasons that it was not only unnecessary to issue the notification under Section at all but the notification under Section having been issued this notification under section could not legally be issued Section covers cases of the routes newly proposed to be taken over and Section refers to those routes on which State carriages were already operating when the Act came into force A notification under Section having been issued the notification under Section should be deemed to have already been issued and any modification of the scheme could be undertaken under Section of the Act A notification actually issued under Section with respect to these routes was not only unnecessary but also illegal The subsequent scheme should be taken to be the modification of the previous scheme published under Section and this modification could be made under Section of the Act without in any way resorting to the provisions of Section As a matter of fact there is no provision in the Act for the cancellation of the scheme published under Section and the only provision is for modification of that scheme and it is contained in Section Under Article the executive power of the <ORG> vests in the Governor and is exercised by him either directly or through officers subordinate to him in accordance with the Constitution The reason why the Governor was mentioned in the notification as the person who would hear the objections appear to be that the officer concerned thought that as an executive action was to be expressed to be taken in the name of the Governor it should be mentioned that it is the Governor who would hear the objections Nobody could have been under any misapprehension that it would be the Governor himself who would hear the objections The Governor in such matters always acts through the officers subordinate to him and in the present case there was nothing wrong in a Deputy Secretary of the Department hearing the objections even though it was expressed in the notification that this executive action of the Government would be taken by the Governor It was next argued that the final scheme published under Sub section cf Section does not say that the objections have been considered by <ORG> and it is therefore not known whether any such consideration was actually given nor have any reasons been given for the decision arrived at on the objections As a matter of fact it appears that the proposed scheme as originally published has actually been modified and this fact unmistakably shows that the objections had been considered <ORG> is also authorised to act through its Secretaries and even if it be assumed that the Deputy Secretaries recommendations were accepted by <ORG> it cannot be said that there was any illegality in this procedure It was also argued in this connection that there is some inconsistency between the provisions of Section and Section of the Act Section says that <ORG> cannot delegate to an officer or authority subordinate to it the powers conferred upon the Government by the provisions of subsection of Section It was urged that under the provisions of Section <ORG> could not delegate its powers to any officer to consider the objections and then either confirm or modify the scheme whereas the provisions of Section confer those powers on the prescribed authority also If there were such an authority it would not be a delegation of powers by <ORG> under Section at all But the right of the prescribed authority to consider the objections is an independent right granted by Section Therefore it can make no difference whether the said notification was published in a local newspaper or not In respect to contract carriages the objection was that the notification itself purported to be concerning stage carriages and therefore we must take it that there was no notification under Section of the Act with respect to contract carriages at all I have already held that a notice under Section was not required nor could it legally be issued but the objection even as it stands has no force because the English notification said that it was with respect to the <ORG> carriages and it was only the Hindi notification which said that it was with respect to stage carriages A reference was made to some cases which laid down that the notifications issued by the State Governments should be read as they stand and that they must be strictly construed I respectfully accept the principle laid down in these cases but they do not apply to the present case and I do not consider it necessary to discuss those cases For the reasons given by us in our separate judgment we dismiss these petitions but direct that the parties do bear their own costs of these petitions We further certify that these cases involve Substantial questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution within the meaning of Article
