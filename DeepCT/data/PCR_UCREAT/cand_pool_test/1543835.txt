The State Government in exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the Motor Vehicles Act under a Notification No MVA dated th June and published in <ORG> on the same day constituted the District Judges of various districts mentioned therein as Motor Accidents Claims Tribunals for the areas within their Jurisdiction with effect from st July If the claim for compensation made in the suit was a claim which is covered by Section of the Act and can be made to <ORG> which had exclusive jurisdiction to decide the claim the jurisdiction of <ORG> is excluded by Section of the Act If is further contended that the word representative has a different meaning from the expression legal representative mentioned In Section A of the Act The first contention urged on behalf of the petitioners is that the suit filed by the petitioners is one for recovery of damages and not for compensation and therefore the suit claim is not barred under Section The argument of the petitioner learned counsel was that under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act the Jurisdiction of <ORG> for the area is restricted to claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving death or bodily injury arising out of the use of motor vehicles and that under Section the jurisdiction of <ORG> is barred in respect of any claim for compensation which may be adjudicated upon by <ORG> for the area The first question therefore is whether a claim for compensation includes a claim for damages Thus it is clear that the word compensation is a more comprehensive term and the claim for compensation includes a claim for damages and hence the petitioners could have put forward their suit claim before <ORG> Under Section A of the Act an application for compensation arising out of an accident involving the death of a person arising out of the use of motor vehicles may be made by the legal representatives of the deceased Under Clause of Rule of the Mysore Motor Vehicles Rules it is provided that the term legal representative shall have the meaning assigned to it under Clause of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure In Section Clause of the Code of Civil Procedure the term legal representative as a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person and includes any person who intermeddles with the estate of the deceased and where a party sues or is sued in a representative character the person on whom the estate devolves on the death of the party so suing or sued Hence it is urged on behalf of the petitioners that so far as the claim put forward by the father is concerned it could not be adjudicated upon by <ORG> constituted under the Act and that therefore the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain the claim is not barred It is further provided that the Court may give such damages as it may think proportioned to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought Section of the same Act provides that not more than one suit or action shall be brought for and in respect of the same subject matter of complaint and the proviso to that section provides that in every such action or suit the executor administrator or representative of the deceased may insert a claim for and recover any pecuniary loss to the estate of the deceased occasioned by such wrongful act neglect or default which sum when recovered shall be deemed part of the assets of the estate of the deceased The Legal Representatives Suits Act Act of provides that an action may be maintained by the executors administrators or representatives of any person deceased for any wrong committed in the lifetime of such person which has occasioned pecuniary loss to his estate for which wrong an action might have been maintained by such person It was held that as the preamble of the Act of itself indicated the relations of another were not prior to its enactment entitled to claim compensation on account of the death and that the right to claim compensation in respect of such a death was created by the said Act It was contended in that case that in the case of Europeans and Eurasians the only representative of a deceased man is his executor or administrator and that in the said Act the word representative has no application to Europeans and Eurasians but is used only with respect to Hindus and Mohammadans It was held that the word representative is not equivalent to heirs since by Act of passed on the same day the right is given to bring a suit against heirs or representatives of the deceased wrong doer It was held that the word representative means and includes all or any one of the persons for whose benefit a suit under the Act can be maintained and that these persons are the representatives of the deceased in the sense that they are the persons taking the place of the deceased in obtaining reparation for the wrong done It was further held that where there is no executor or administrator or where there is one and he fails or is unwilling to sue then the suit may be instituted by and in the name of the representative of the person deceased but one suit only is allowed to enforce the claims of all the persons beneficially entitled it being provided that the rights of each and every one of them shall be adjudged and adjusted by the <ORG> in such suit The right of each beneficiary is only to receive compensation in proportion to the loss occasioned to him by the death of his deceased relative The beneficiaries entitled to compensation under Act of are not persons entitled to claim compensation jointly but are parties entitled to relief severally in respect of the same cause of action which is enforceable at the suit of all or any of them suing for himself and the rest The English Act was amended by Fatal Accidents Act which provided that in case there is no executor or administrator of the deceased or where there is an executor or administrator no action is brought by him within the time prescribed then such an action may be brought by and in the name or names of any of the persons for whose benefit such action could have been brought by the executor or administrator and that every action so brought shall bo for the benefit of the said person or persons It has been observed in <NAME> <ORG> Acc CJ Mad a decision of <ORG> that Section of the Motor Vehicles Act provides a speedier remedy obviously conceived as a better one from the point of view of the injured person or his unfortunate dependants No new right or even a now remedy has been created by that provision the forum alone is changed The right to claim damages by the legal representatives of a deceased in respect of an accident where the latter met with his death was actionable under the pre existing law in <ORG> The aggrieved person has as before a remedy for damages in respect of the injury The period of limitation has also been curtailed but those two are matters of procedure It has not the same meaning as legal representative in the Civil Procedure Code It could not have been intended that in such a case where there is no executor or administrator the persons for whose benefit the right of action was given should be without a remedy Consequently a widow of a deceased European or Eurasian was held entitled to maintain a suit under the Fatal Accidents Act In our Judgment the term legal representative in Section A includes the persons referred to as representatives in Section A of the Fatal Accidents Act namely the wife husband parent or child of the deceased In that view <ORG> jurisdiction to entertain the suit is clearly barred Since we have held that the term legal representative used in Section A of the Act cannot have the same meaning as that attributed to it under Section of the Code of Civil Procedure the right that could be exercised under Section A of the Act cannot be confined to persons who come within the term legal representative as defined under Section of the Civil Procedure Code only The power to make rules under Section A is given to <ORG> only for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of Section A of the Act and while acting for that purpose <ORG> cannot restrict the right given under Section A of the Act to only some of the persons contemplated under that Section
