There was evidence to show that he and not his brother had struck the fatal blow The question was whether the omission to frame an alternative charge under simpliciter was an illegality that vitiated the trial and invalidated the conviction and whether there was a conflict of decisions of this <ORG> on the matter in controversy That of the Indian Penal Code by itself does not create any offence and where as in the present case it is possible to ascertain who struck the fatal blow the fact that another was also sought to be made liable does not invalidate a conviction for murder unless there was prejudice The question of prejudice is a question of fact to be decided by the court in each particular case This is made clear by ss and of the Code If therefore the necessary information is conveyed to him in other ways and there is no prejudice the trial is not invalidated by the mere fact that the charge was not formally reduced to writing It is not correct to say that of the Code has no application to a case in which there is no charge at all or that it cannot apply except where ss and apply or that it is governed by They cover every possible case that relates to the charge and they place all failures to observe the rules about the charge in the category of curable irregularities Sections and apply to every case in which there is a departure from the rules set out in Chapter XIX ranging from error omissions and irregularities in charges that are framed down to charges that might have been framed and were not and include a total omission to frame a charge at all at any stage of the trial In judging a question of prejudice as of guilt courts must act with a broad vision and look to the substance and not to technicalities and their main concern should be to see whether the accused had a fair trial whether he knew what he was being tried for whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself and a close consideration of the reasons given in <NAME> case show that there was in fact no difference of opinion as regards cases where there is a charge to start with Neither case however deals with the position where there is no charge at all Where it cannot be ascertained who struck the fatal blow no conviction can follow unless a common intention is proved But the converse does not hold good It is not therefore correct to say that where there is no charge the conviction must be illegal prejudice or no prejudice Nor is it correct to say that is sufficiently wide to apply to every case where there is no charge of any kind from the outset The provisions of mainly apply to cases of inadvertence to frame a charge induced by the belief that the matter on record is sufficient to warrant the conviction for a particular offence without express specification and where the facts proved constitute a separate and distinct offence but closely relevant to and springing out of the same set of facts connected with the one charged A deliberate breach of this basic requirement cannot be covered by the assertion that every thing was orally explained to the accused the assessors or jurors and there was no prejudice The absence of a charge under one or other of the various heads of criminal Liability for the offence in such cases is not fatal and a conviction for the substantive offence without a charge can be set aside only where there is prejudice Per <NAME> On the facts of the present case the question raised by the reference does not arise There is no substantial conflict of view between the two decisions of this court in <NAME> case and <NAME> case In cases however where a charge is framed but there is an omission or irregularity but the mode of trial is not affected the Code provides that the conviction may be set aside if in fact a failure of justice as resulted Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated the rd November of <ORG> at Nagpur in Criminal Appeal No of arising out of the judgment and order dated the st July of <ORG> at Jabalpur in Sessions Trial No of The charge framed against the appellant was different and he was never charged individually of having committed murder It is a fundamental principle of criminal law as administered in India that there should be a separate charge for every distinct offence as the accused person must have notice of the charge which he has to meet Where a person has been convicted of an offence with which he has not been charged unless allowed by exceptions the prejudice is inherent in the absence of the charge itself and it is unnecessary to look any further Where there is an illegality in the mode of trial as contemplated in ss to it is an illegality which is not cured by the provisions of ss and It is incorrect to say that the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case as to what is an illegality has been modified by the subse quent decisions of <ORG> and in fact in <NAME> case Lord <NAME> in delivering the judgment of the Board actually stated that it was taken as settled law by both sides that the breach of the provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be an illegality which would vitiate the trial as opposed to a mere irregularity which would not vitiate the trial Similarly the courts in India have also taken the view that a breach of any of the mandatory provisions relating to ss to of the Code would be an illegality in the mode of trial which would vitiate the trial as opposed to an irregularity in the course of trial which could be cured Section appears in Chapter XLV of the Code and is headed Of irregular proceedings and cannot possibly apply to breaches of the mandatory provisions of ss to of the Code it may relate to those cases where it is optional to frame a charge Assuming that actual prejudice is necessary then as the only charge against the appellant being one under read with and that having failed due to the acquittal of the co accused and the appellant having successfully shown that there was no common intention as contemplated by of the Indian Penal Code prejudice is bound to occur due to his conviction under simpliciter with which he was never charged The word has been used in three senses namely a In cases where the trial and conviction are ab initio void due to some inherent defect which goes to the root and is by itself enough to vitiate the trial as in cases of lack of jurisdiction where of the Code has not been complied with In cases where a mandatory prohibition of the Code has been disregarded and it is apparent from the provision itself that having regard to its objects and purposes such disregard is bound to lead to prejudice In a more popular sense that is in respect of a particular case or cases where having regard to the facts and circumstances whether it be due to prejudice or otherwise the conviction cannot be sustained A case of this nature may even be covered by the provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure In this case there was no actual prejudice as the accused knew that he was being charged with murder which is clear from the trend of cross examinations of witnesses and his examination under of the Code of Criminal Procedure The facts clearly show that the offence committed by the accused is one of murder as the deceased died as a result of injuries and the injury was sufficient to cause death according to the doctor evidence It would also mean that a person could be charged with a minor offence and convicted of a major offence whereas only allows conviction of a minor offence without a charge if the major offence with which the person is charged is not made out Such a wide meaning which would lead to absurdities should not be given to The judgment of <NAME> Acting and <NAME> was delivered by <NAME> The judgment of <NAME> and <NAME> was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> delivered a separate judgment The main ground is that the appellant was charged under section of the Indian Penal Code read with section As against this it is contended for the <ORG> that an omission to frame a separate charge in the alternative under section simpliciter is a curable irregularity provided there is no prejudice to the accused Therefore the only matter for determination is a question of fact whether there was prejudice in this case The charge was as follows That you on or about the th day of February at Civil Lines Jabalpur went with your brother <NAME> to the house of Mrs <NAME> at about and in furtherance of the common intention did commit murder by intentionally or knowingly causing the death of her brother <NAME> and thereby committed an offence punishable under section of the Indian Penal Code read with section of the Indian Penal Code It was contended on behalf of the <ORG> that this is really a charge under section of the Indian Penal Code and that the references to common intention and to section are mere surplusage There is much to be said for this but we will assume in this case without so deciding that the charge is ambiguous and that it means what the appellant says it means namely a charge under section read with section and not one under section simpliciter On that assumption the question for our decision is whether the omission to frame an alternative charge under section of the Indian Penal Code is an illegality that cuts at the root of the conviction and makes not invalid or whether it is a curable irregularity in which all that we are concerned to see is whether there was prejudice If he does if he is tried by a competent court if be is told and clearly understands the nature of the offence for which he is being tried if the case against him is fully and fairly explained to him and he is afforded a full and fair opportunity of defending himself then provided there is substantial compliance with the outward forms of the law mere mistakes in procedure mere in consequential errors and omissions in the trial are regarded as venal by the Code and the trial is not vitiated unless the accused can show substantial prejudice Others are not vital and whatever the irregularity they can be cured and in that event the conviction must stand unless the <ORG> is satisfied that there was prejudice Some of these matters are dealt with by the Code and wherever that is the case full effect must be given to its provisions In that event full effect must be given to the plain meaning of the words used Next comes a class of case for which there is no express provision in the Code or where there is ambiguity In any case the courts must be guided by the plain provisions of the Code without straining at its language wherever there is an express provision Later this was construed to mean that that only applies when there is an express prohibition and there is prejudice in most systems of jurisprudence but it would be an extraordinary extension of such a branch of administering the criminal law to say that when the Code positively enacts that such a trial as that which has taken place here shall not be permitted that this contravention of the Code comes within the description of error omission or irregularity Except where there is something so vital as to cut at the root of jurisdiction or so abhorrent to what one might term natural justice the matter resolves itself to a question of prejudice Other violations will not be so obvious and it may be possible to show that having regard to all that occurred no prejudice was occasioned or that there was no reasonable probability of prejudice Slightly to alter the language of <ORG> in <NAME> The KingEmperor we would say It must be hoped and indeed assumed that magistrates and judges will exercise their jurisdiction fairly and honestly If they do not or if they go wrong in fact or in law the accused has prima facie a right of recourse to the superior courts by way of appeal or revision and the cases show bow vigilant and resolute <ORG> are in seeing that the accused is not prejudiced or embarrassed by unsubstantial departures from the Code and bow closely and jealously <ORG> guards the position of the accused We now proceed to examine the relevant sections of the Code There are certain irregularities which do not vitiate the proceedings In every such case the <ORG> is bound to give effect to the express commands of the legislature there is no scope for further speculation Now there is no doubt that a charge forms the foundation of a sessions trial and is a most important step in it But there is in our opinion equally no doubt that the Code expressly deals with this and expressly provides that no error omission or irregularity in the charge or even total absence of a charge shall vitiate a trial unless prejudice to the accused is shown the nature of the case is such that the particulars mentioned in sections and do not give the accused sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will be sufficient for that purpose It is clear to us that the object of the charge is not to introduce a provision that goes to the root of jurisdiction as for example the requirement of previous sanction under section but to enable the accused to have a clear idea of what he is being tried for and of the essential facts that he has to meet But there are other ways of conveying this information Therefore when there is a charge and there is either error or omission in it or both and whatever its nature it is not to be regarded as material unless two conditions are fulfilled both of which are matters of fact the accused has in fact been misled by it and it has occasioned a failure of justice The proceedings up to the stage of the alteration which as we have seen can be at the very end of the trial are not vitiated unless there is prejudice they are good despite these imperfections Next we have a case in which the error is not observed and corrected during the trial and the accused is convicted It is to be observed that this is so whether there was a total absence of a charge or merely an error in it From there we proceed to section Next there is section Subject to etc no finding sentence or order passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered under Chapter XXVLI or on appeal or revision on account a of any error omission or irregularity in the charge or other proceedings before or during trial unless such error omission irregularity has in fact occasioned a failure of justice Reading these provisions as a whole there is in our opinion no room left for doubt about what was intended It was argued on behalf of the appellant that these sections must be read along with sections and Counsel conceded that there are occasions when an accused person can be convicted in the absence of a charge but he said that they are expressly set out in sections and and he contended that no further departure is permissible He said that sections and deal with cases in which there is a charge to start with but none to support a conviction for an offence which the <ORG> feels is made out by the evidence These sections define the limits within which the <ORG> may convict in spite of the fact that there is no charge for that particular offence When section is read along with these two sections it is seen that it cannot apply to a case in which there is no charge at all nor can it apply to any case that is not covered by these two sections In answer to this the following argument was put to counsel and be was asked to meet it This it was said follows from the words shall be deemed invalid It was suggested that these words show that a conviction without a charge is in truth and in fact invalid but that it can be cured in certain cases and when that is done that which in truth is invalid is deemed not to be invalid because of this section But as sections and expressly permit convictions in certain cases without a charge for those offences provided there is a charge in the case to start with the convictions so permitted cannot be invalid or even irregular because it would be wrong to say that that which the Code expressly allows is or can be irregular Therefore section cannot apply to cases covered by sections and Counsel replied that even if that is so section is still governed by section and so cannot apply to cases in which there is no charge at all Therefore so far as section is concerned there can be no doubt that it requires a separate charge for each offence and does not envisage a situation in which there is either no charge at all or where there being a charge for some other offence of which the accused is acquitted he can be convicted instead of something else for which be was not charged What then is the position if there is some departure from the normal procedure In our opinion sections and furnish the answer and they apply with equal force to every kind of departure from that part of section that requires a separate charge for each offence We think it would be monstrous to bold that a conviction cannot be set aside even when gross prejudice is proved in cases covered by section just because it does not speak of prejudice The sort of problem that we are now examining can only arise when an express provision of the Code is violated and then the root of the matter is not whether there is violation of an express provision for the problem postulates that there must be nor is it whether the provision is expressed in positive or in negative terms but what are the consequences of such disregard Does it result in an illegality that strikes at the root of the trial and cannot be cured or is it an irregularity that is curable We have used the terms illegality and irregularity because they have acquired a technical significance and are convenient to demarcate a distinction between two classes of case We do not attach any special significance to these terms They are convenient expressions to convey a thought and that is all It matters little whether this is called an illegality an irregularity that cannot be cured or an invalidity so long as the terms are used in a clearly defined sense Between them these sections cover every kind of case in which there is an error omission or irregularity in a charge and an omission to frame a charge so if sections and and save departures from section from being irregularities then there is nothing left for sections and to operate on In our opinion the truth is that the Code deals with the same subject matter under different heads so there is some overlapping Sections and are in the Chapter that deals with irregularities generally and these two sections deal specifically with the charge and make it clear that an omission to frame a charge as well as irregularities errors and omission in a charge are all irregularities that do not vitiate or invalidate a conviction unless there is prejudice Sections and deal with cases in which there is a charge to start with and then they go on to say that in certain cases the trial can proceed beyond the matter actually charged and a conviction for an offence disclosed in the evidence in that type of case will be good despite the absence of a charge in respect of it It is evident that if charges A and cannot be tried together because of the prohibition in section read with sections and then no conviction could be sustained on either A or and if that is the case when specific charges are drawn up it is all the more so when though there is a charge in respect of A there is none in respect of for clearly you cannot do indirectly that which you are prohibited from doing directly When they are read as a whole it becomes clear that sections and cover every type of case in which a conviction can be sustained when there is no charge for that offence provided there is a charge to start with They do not deal with a case in which there is no charge at all and anything travelling beyond that when there is a charge would be hit by sections and read as a whole for the reasons we have just given But if that is so and if section is excluded where sections and apply then what is there left for it to operate on except cases in which there is a total omission to frame a charge We do not think these sections should be regarded disjunctively In our opinion they between them including sections and cover every possible case that relates to the charge and they place all failures to observe the rules about the charge in the category of curable irregularities Chapter XIX deals comprehensively with charges and sections and cover every case in which there is a departure from the rules set out in that Chapter We say this because the Code repeatedly says so in express and emphatic terms and because that is the foundation on which rules of procedure are based We say it because that accords with logic and principle and reason and because it touches the deep verities on which the structure of justice is erected and maintained With the utmost respect we cannot read the words by the absence of a charge in section and no charge was framed in section to mean not what they would appear to mean on the face of them but where there is a charge but none for the offence of which the accused is convicted We see no reason for straining at the mean ing of these plain and emphatic provisions unless ritual and form are to be regarded as of the essence in criminal trials Was he told Was it explained to him Did he understand Was it done in a fair way We attach equal importance to other sections of the Code that are just as emphatic as section namely sections and and yet no one doubts that irregularities there are curable He calls witnesses in defence to meet the very point or points the prosecution seek to make out against him On the other hand there is nothing in the view we take to imperil or harass an accused however innocent he may be How does the technical formula of a charge afford greater protection than the explaining under section and the examination under section And yet on the argument before us an omission to observe these other rules that are of the substance is curable when there is no prejudice but not the sacred ritual of the framing of the charge once that is there the accused cannot be heard to say that be did not understand however much that may be the fact Now as we have said sections and a between them cover every conceivable typo of error and irregularity referable to a charge that can possibly arise ranging from cases in which there is a conviction with no charge at all from start to finish down to cases in which there is a charge but with errors irregularities and omissions in it The Code is emphatic that whatever the irregularity it is not to be regarded as fatal unless there is prejudice But when all is said and done what we are concerned to see is whether the accused bad a fair trial whether he knew what be was being tried for whether the main facts sought to be established against him were explained to him fairly and clearly and whether he was given a full and fair chance to defend himself In adjudging the question of prejudice the fact that the absence of a charge or a substantial mistake in it is a serious lacuna will naturally operate to the benefit of the accused and if there is any reasonable and substantial doubt about whether he was or was reasonably likely to have been misled in the circumstances of any particular case be is as much entitled to the benefit of it here as elsewhere but if on a careful consideration of all the facts prejudice or a reasonable and substantial likelihood of it is not disclosed the conviction must stand also it will always be material to consider whether objec <NAME> tion to the nature of the charge or a total want of one was taken at an early stage There is no such thing as a judicial precedent on facts though counsel and even judges are sometimes prone to argue and to act as if there were Endeavour was made in the argument to draw a distinction between cases falling under section of the Indian Penal Code and those under section of the Indian Penal Code This is not a case under section of the Indian Penal Code so the question does not really arise but it is necessary to advert to the argument because on the view we take of sections and it is immaterial what the offence is and whether there is a charge at all We now turn to an examination of the cases of this <ORG> that are said to give rise to a conflict of view In our opinion there is in reality no conflict and I A though the language used in one case might suggest that a close consideration of its reasons will disclose that there was in fact no difference of view in the type of case where there is a charge to start with None of the cases deals with the position where there is no charge at all But the evidence disclosed that the appellant had himself made an attempt on the life of one man and had himself shot another dead Accordingly <ORG> convicted him under sections and of the Indian Penal Code respectively though there was no separate charge under either of those sections I proceeded to determine the question of prejudice on the facts of that case It is enough to say that that was not the decision and though that was one of the matters taken into consideration the conclusion was based on a careful and lengthy investigation of all the facts in the case including the way in which it was conducted the evidence of several witnesses the medical evidence the first information report and certain documents including two filed by the accused <ORG> held that no common intention was proved either but as the evidence indicated that the appellant had done the actual killing he was convicted under section Now it is true that there are observations there which without close examination would appear to support the learned counsel for the appellant It was found that the appellant there was in fact misled in his defence and one of the factors taken into consideration as indeed must always be the case was that when he was told that he was to be tried under section read with section of the Indian Penal Code that indicated to him that he was not being tried for a murder committed by him personally but that he was only being I It all depends on the circumstances The entire evidence and facts on which the learned Judges founded are not set out in the judgment but there is enough to indicate that had the appellant attention been drawn to his own part in the actual killing he would probably have cross examined the doctor with more care and there was enough in the medical evidence to show that had that been done the appellant might well have been exonerated If the Court finds that a vital witness was not cross examined when be might have been and that if he had been the further facts elicited might well have been crucial then material from which prejudice can be inferred is at once apparent that is exactly Illustrations and Now having reached the conclusion that there was prejudice the learned Judges were of the opinion that the irregularity if it can be so called when prejudice is disclosed was incurable and from that they concluded that an incurable irregularity is nothing but an illegality a perfectly possible and logical conclusion when the words irregularity and illegality are not defined As there was prejudice in that case the decision was invalid and being invalid it was illegal If it be accepted that an absence of a charge would but for its provisions render a conviction invalid this section cures such an invalidity when there is in fact not in theory but in fact no failure of justice The section is just as mandatory as section and we can see no justification for giving it less weight than section If section validates a departure from section and saves it from the stigma of an irregularity then so does section for it says very expressly that no conviction shall be deemed invalid merely on the ground that no charge was framed unless that in fact occasioned a failure of justice and if section is held not to apply to cases covered by sections and then it must apply to cases that lie outside the scope of those sections and the only kind of case left is a case in which there is a total absence of a charge for any other type of case would be excluded because of misjoinder We agree that some of the expressions used in the judgment appear to travel wider than this but in order to dispel misconception we would now hold that the true view is the one we have propounded at length in the present judgment It also means that he is informed that it is immaterial who struck the fatal blow It is true that if it cannot be ascertained who struck the fatal blow then the accused cannot be convicted unless the common intention is proved and in that type of case an acquittal of the co accused may be fatal to the prosecution But the converse does not hold good and if the part that the accused played can be clearly brought home to him and if it is sufficient to convict him of murder simpliciter he cannot escape liability because of the charge unless he can show prejudice The fact that the appellant did not attempt to confront any of the witnesses with their statements before either the Committing Magistrate or the police on this point shows that the witnesses told a consistent story from the start He was told clearly and unambiguously that the evidence was that he hit the deceased over the head Instead of the accused speaking for himself he made a statement through his advocate There is no suggestion here that the other accused hit the deceased or that anyone other than the appellant did Next what was the cross examination of the only eye witness There was no suggestion that she was mistaken in her identity whereas she was crossexamined about this very matter of self defence and questions were put to show that the deceased and not his brother had threatened the appellant with his fist There was no hint of prejudice even in the grounds of appeal On the contrary there was a clear admission in <ORG> that he did hit the man but that he acted in self defence We would hold that there was no prejudice and that the conviction is not invalid because of the nature of the charge If there was no intention to kill then it can be murder only if the accused knew that the injury inflicted would be likely to cause death or that it would be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death or that the accused knew that the act must in all probability cause death He was in love with the deceased sister who reciprocated his affection but could not marry him be cause her husband had turned her out in England and she had no divorce The appellant went to the house and asked the sister to come down The brother came instead and there was a quarrel Where there is a charge against an accused under section read with section if section of the Indian Penal Code is inapplicable to the facts can the accused be convicted under section without a separate charge In the first case it was held that the omission to have a specific charge under section amounted to an illegality Section creates a specific offence and without applying its provisions a member of an unlawful assembly could not be made liable for the offence committed not by him but by another member of that assembly Therefore the case is not similar to the one where there is a charge under section read with section of the Indian Penal Code In a charge under section there is active participation in the commission of the criminal act under section the liability arises by reason of the membership of the unlawful assembly with a common object and there may be no active participation at all in the perpetration or commission of the crime The overlapping arises in those cases where two or more persons commit a murder in furtherance of the common intention but it is not possible to say which of them was responsible for the fatal injury or whether any one injury by itself was responsible for the death But whereas in this case the appellant has been individually charged with murder and there is proof that his band caused the injury the fact that his brother was also sought to be made liable owing to the existence of a common intention is neither here nor there so far as the legality of the conviction is concerned as there has been no prejudice by way of failure of justice lengthy arguments addressed to us to consider the main question arising on the reference Though the two cases which gave rise to this reference were cases relating to section of the Indian Penal Code and not to section of the Indian Penal Code as the Present case is the order of reference was occasioned by the fact that in <NAME> case it was stated specifically that the parallel case under section also stood on the same footing it would be an extraordinary extension of such a branch of administering the criminal law to say that when the Code positively enacts that such a trial as that which has taken place here shall not be permitted that this contravention of the Code comes within the description of error omission or irregu larity It was contended on appeal before <ORG> that the section was obligatory and that non compliance with such a mandatory provision was illegal on the principle laid down in <NAME> case Lord <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the Board assumed that an infringement of section of the Code would be an illegality and proceeded to state that the question did not however arise and it was hence unnecessary to discuss the precise scope of what was decided in <NAME> case The matter cropped up once again in <NAME> and others <NAME> where there was a breach of the statutory requirement found in section of the Code inasmuch as the accused were not supplied with copies of the statements first recorded by a police officer for cross examining the prosecution witnesses The present case falls under section and their Lordships hold the trial valid notwithstanding the breach of section The difficulty arises only when we have to consider the other provisions in the Code Which regulate procedure and which are found in a mendatory form positive or negative A power to alter or add to a charge at any time before judgment is pronounced is conferred on a court under section Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure refers more specifically to the effect of such error where an appellate Court or <ORG> in revision or in confirmation proceedings notices such an error and is in the following terms If <ORG> or <ORG> in the exercise of its powers of revision or of its powers under Chapter XXVII is of opinion that any person convicted of an offence was misled in defence by the absence of a charge or by an error in the charge it shall direct a new trial to be had upon a charge framed in whatever manner it thinks fit Then we have section dealing with a case where an accused charged with one offence for which he might have been charged under the provisions of section could be convicted of a different offence This applies only to cases where it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute A case of complete absence of a charge is covered by section whereas an error or omission in a charge is dealt with by section Where there is no charge it is for the court to determine whether there is any failure of justice But in the latter where there is mere error or omission in the charge the court is also bound to have regard to the fact whether the objection could and should have been raised at an earlier stage in the proceedings We are unable therefore to accept as sound the very broad proposition advanced for the appellants by Mr <NAME> that where there is no charge the conviction would be illegal prejudice or no prejudice It is said that it applies also to the case of a trial in which there has been no charge of any kind even from the very outset There is no reason to think that section of the Code of Criminal Procedure is not also to be understood with reference to the same context By way of illustration the following classes of cases may be mentioned a Where there is no charge at all as required by the Code from start to finish from the Committing Magistrate court to the end of the <NAME> trial the Code contemplates in section the possibility of a committal without any charge and it is not impossible to conceive of an extreme case where the <NAME> trial also proceeds without any formal charge which has to be in writing and read out and explained to the accused section and section A and section A deliberate breach of this basic requirement cannot be cured by the assertion that everything was orally explained to the accused and the assessors or jurors and there was no possible or probable prejudice Sections and of the Indian Penal Code provide for criminal liability viewed from different angles as regards actual participants accessories and men actuated by a common object or a common intention and the charge is a rolled up one involving the direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable and who are sought to be made constructively liable In such a situation the absence of a charge under one or other of the various heads of criminal liability for the offence cannot be said to be fatal by itself and before a conviction for the substantive offence without a charge can be set aside prejudice will have to be made out In most of the cases of this kind evidence is normally given from the outset as to who was primarily responsible for the act which brought about the offence and such evidence is of course relevant some provisions in respect of which the court would take an opposite view and would feel that they are matters which must be strictly obeyed otherwise the whole proceedings that subsequently follow must come to an end These words can be applied mutatis mutandis to cases where there is no charge at all In the main the provisions of section would apply to cases of inadvertence to frame a charge induced by the belief that the matter on record is sufficient to warrant the conviction for a particular offence without express specification and where the facts proved by the prosecution constitute a separate and distinct offence but closely relevant to and springing out of the same set of facts connected with the one charged On the evening of the day of the occurrence <NAME> and his mother went to <NAME> house There was a quarrel between them and the accused was asked to get away He left the place but returned a little later with his brother <NAME> and asked <NAME> who was on the first floor to come down to him There was a heated exchange of words The accused gave one blow on his head with a hockey stick with the result that his skull was fractured There is nothing to warrant us to attribute to the appellant knowledge that the injury was liable to cause death or that it was so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death We take the view considering all the circumstances that the offence is the lesser one <NAME> with the judgment just delivered by my learned brother <NAME> but would add some observations of my own as I was party to the judgment of this <ORG> in <NAME> case Strictly speaking on the facts of the present case the question raised by the reference does not arise In <NAME> the view taken was that when an accused is charged under section read with section of the Indian Penal Code it is illegal to convict him under section of the Indian Penal Code without a charge having been framed against him under that section In <NAME> case in similar circumstances it was held that failure to frame a charge under section was a serious lacuna and the conviction was set aside on the ground that the accused had been prejudiced It is therefore necessary to examine how far these provisions of the Code override its provisions relating to the framing of charges There is no ambiguity in the language of this section In cases where a charge has been framed and there is an omission or irregularity in it it is difficult to see how the mode of trial is affected Under the provisions of section of the Code an appellate <ORG> or <ORG> exercising its powers of revision or its powers under Chapter XXVII must direct a new trial of a case in which an accused person has been convicted of an offence with which he had not been charged if it is satisfied that he had been misled in his defence by the absence of a charge I regard with concern if not with dismay a too liberal application of its provisions to all cases in which there is an absence of a charge although a charge ought to have been framed In a criminal trial innocence of an accused is presumed unless there is a statutory presumption against him and the prosecution must prove that the accused is guilty of the offence for which he is being tried The prosecution is in possession of all the evidence upon which it relies to establish its case against the accused
