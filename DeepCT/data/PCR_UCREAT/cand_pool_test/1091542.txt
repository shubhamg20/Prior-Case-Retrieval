HEADNOTE Section of the Income tax Act enables the Commissioner to call for and examine the record of any proceeding under the Act and to pass such orders as he deems necessary as the circumstances of the case justify when he considers the order passed erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue without any inquiry or evidence whatsoever and that there were suspicious circumstances showing connection with the business of the assessee husband In the result he held that the order of the income tax officer was erroneous and prejudicial to the revenue and directed the income tax officer to make a fresh assessment after making inquiries with regard to the jurisdiction and the business carried on by the assessee the possession of initial capital acquisition and sale of ornaments purchase of plot of land and resources and the money invested in the name of the assessee On the question of the jurisdiction of the Commissioner to pass the order <ORG> held in favour of the assessee and <ORG> on reference in favour of the <ORG> In appeal to this Court it was contended that the Commissioner had no jurisdiction under to cancel the assessment made by the income tax officer inasmuch as it cannot be said that where an assessee has been assessed to tax it was prejudicial to the interests of revenue on the ground that no assessment could have been made in respect of the income of which she made a voluntary return If so the Commissioner under had ample jurisdiction to cancel the assessment and to initiate proceedings for assessment under the provisions of the Act against some other assessee who according to the income tax authorities is liable for the income thereof The assessee it appears had filed voluntary returns of income for the assessment years to giving her address as A Bysack Street Calcutta which was then within the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer ward District Calcutta It further appears from the records that the assessee had signed a declaration on th December stating inter alia that i at the time of her marriage with Sri <NAME> about years ago the assessee received presents and dowry and birth day presentations on different occasions in kind as well as in cash to the extent of Rs and the certificates showing the sale of such ornaments were enclosed with declaration vi the assessee was doing the aforesaid business in her individual capacity and this business had no connection with the business of her husband vii she kept no regular books of account and neither had she any bank account On July the Income tax Officer <NAME> again issued notice under of the Act fixing the hearing on July In response to the aforesaid notice the assessee showed cause on June and after considering the objections of the assessee the Commissioner passed an order cancelling the assessment for and directing <ORG> to make a fresh assessment according to law after making enquiries with regard to the jurisdiction and the business carried on by the assessee the possession of initial capital acquisition Ind sale of ornaments purchase of plot of land and resources and the money invested in the name of the assessee In the result having regard to the fact that the assessments for the years to were already beyond time for taking action he cancelled the assessment for and directed <ORG> to make a fresh assessment as stated above as such it could not be said that the assessment was prejudicial to the interests of revenue and that at the most it could be said that the assessee could not have carried on any business at the addresses Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case in taking action under of the Income tax Act for the assessment year the Commissioner of Income tax was entitled to take into consideration the records of the proceedings relating to the assessment of the assessee for the assessment years to Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was right in holding that there were no materials before the Commissioner to justify his finding that the assessment order for was erroneous insofar as it was prejudicial to the interests of the revenue Apart from these a further question which will be referred to as the third question was also referred at the instance of the assessee namely Whether the Commissioner of Income tax could lawfully initiate proceedings under section of the Indian Income tax Act on the th June notwithstanding the repeal of the aforesaid Act by the Income tax Act with effect from the st of April <ORG> declined to answer the first question as in its view it was merely academic The only other question therefore was the second one which was answered against the assessee on the ground that the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to make the order which itself would have been sufficient for the Commissioner to set aside the assessment In this view of the matter is held that there were materials before the Commissioner to justify his finding that the order of assessment for the year was erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interests of revenue It however did not pronounce any opinion on the question whether the Commissioner could have considered materials of the previous year in arriving at his conclusion in respect of the assessment for the year record of any proceeding under the Act and to pass such orders as he deems necessary as the circumstances of the case justify when he considers the order passed was erroneous insofar as it is prejudicial to the interest of the revenue In that case this Court in similar circumstances held that the Commissioner had jurisdiction under of the Act It appeared in that case as in this case the assessee had given a fictitious address in order to invest the jurisdiction on a particular Income tax Officer to make the assessment While agreeing with <ORG> that all this material was supporting material and did not constitute the basic grounds on which the order under were passed by the Com missioner this Court held that there was ample material to show that the Income tax Officer made the assessment in undue hurry that the assessee was a new assessee and filed voluntary returns in respect of a number of years i from assessment years to In the view we have taken the answer by <ORG> cannot be disturbed and the appeal is accordingly dismissed with costs
