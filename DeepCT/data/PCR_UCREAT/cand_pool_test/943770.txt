The questions of law arising for decision in these two appeals are identical Section of the Act provides Agricultural Income tax at the rate or rates specified in the Schedule to this Act shall be charged for each financial year in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this Act on the total agricultural income of the previous year Sub sections and of that section as it stood on March read as follows In the case of an undivided <ORG> family or branch of Maru makkathayam tarwad including a Nambudiri family or a family like that of the Moothathu or any other class governed by the law applicable to Nambudiries consisting of more than five members and whose agricultural income exceeds six thousand rupees the tax shall be assessed at the average rate applicable to the share of the agricultural income due to five members of the family or to six thousand rupees whichever is higher That amendment came into force with effect from April The amendment was given retrospective effect Section of the Act provides for bringing to tax the income that has escaped assessment or has been assessed at too low a rate If on the other hand we come to the conclusion that the case falls within Section then what we have to see is whether the power was exercised in respect of each of the assessment within the period prescribed therein <ORG> has come to the conclusion that on the facts of the case the Agricultural Income tax Officer could only have exercised his power under Section as he was dealing with a case where assessment had been made at too low a rate Section of the Act corresponds to Section of the Indian Income tax Act and Section corresponds to Section of that Act The Amendment Act provided that it shall be deemed to have come into force on April The assessee filed a petition in <ORG> of Bombay under Article of the Constitution praying for a writ prohibiting to be issued to the appellants from enforcing the rectified order and notice of demand This Court held that as a result of the legal fiction brought about as a result of the retrospective operation given to the Amending Act the subsequently inserted proviso must be read as forming part of Section A of the principal Act as from April and consequently the order of the Income tax Officer dated October was inconsistent with the provisions of the proviso and suffered from a mistake apparent from the record If that be the true position then the order which he made giving credit to the respondent for Rs If a mistake of fact apparent from the record of the assessment order can be rectified under Section we see no reason why a mistake of law which is glaring and obvious cannot be similarly rectified It was found that notice was given to the appellant of the intended determination of the written down value though it was not a written notice and that the matter was discussed with the assessee representative For the reasons mentioned above we come to the conclusion that the Agricultural Income tax Officer was empowered to make the rectification under Section of the Act But from the material before us it is not possible for us to decided which of all assessments would fall within the period prescribed in Section of the Act
