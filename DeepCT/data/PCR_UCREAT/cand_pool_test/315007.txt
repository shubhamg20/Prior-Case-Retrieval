The plaintiff respondent served on him a notice demanding payment of arrears and terminating his tenancy On failure to comply with the notice a suit for eviction was filed in <ORG> on This is an appeal filed by special leave At the time of hearing it was conceded by the learned counsel for the appellant that no fault can be found with the decree of <ORG> as confirmed by <ORG> and <ORG> On this Court directed a notice on SLP to be issued to the respondent and at the same time passed an interim order staying the operation of the decree appealed against On the date on which the time appointed by <ORG> for vacating the premises was coming to an end the tenant appellant moved an application before <ORG> seeking one month extension of time for compliance with the direction of <ORG> on two grounds firstly that though the SLP was filed in this Court it was yet to be taken up for hearing and secondly <ORG> had initiated proceedings for resumption of the suit premises against the plaintiff respondent In the meantime as already stated this Court granted interim relief to the appellant although the factum of extension of time granted by <ORG> and the grounds therefor were not brought to the notice of this Court An additional affidavit by way of rejoinder was filed by the appellant on th June wherein it has been stated that after the filing of SLP in this Court the appellant had received a notice dated from the Estate Officer <ORG> asking him to vacate the suit premises On the appellant has submitted an application to <ORG> requesting them to allot the suit premises to the appellant on the same terms and conditions or any other terms and conditions as may be thought fit by <ORG> It was submitted that in these circumstances as the plaintiff respondent has ceased to be owner of the suit premises he was not entitled to execute the decree for eviction and the same was liable to be set aside At the time of hearing the learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent brought to the notice of this court an order dated passed by Chief Administrator <ORG> an Appellate Authority over the Estate Officer <ORG> whereby an appeal filed by the respondent has been allowed and the respondent has been allowed an extension of time for payment of the arrears of instalments to <ORG> The relevant facts emerging from a perusal of the documents placed on record by the parties insofar as they relate to the proceedings before <ORG> may briefly be noticed On the Estate Officer <ORG> passed an order recalling the allotment of the suit premises for failure of the respondent to pay the amount of instalments in arrears and the interest accrued thereon forfeiting the amount already paid On the appellant proposed to <ORG> that he was ready and willing to pay the <ORG> the entire amount which was to be paid by the respondent to it along with interest and to have the suit premises allotted to himself It appears that there was a dispute as to the rate at which the interest was levied by <ORG> on the amount of instalments in arrears as to which <ORG> had issued some directions which the <ORG> was required to comply In a recent decision by us in <NAME> Vs <NAME> A Nos of decided on January we have held To constitute eviction by title paramount so as to discharge the obligation of the tenant to put his lessor into possession of the leased premises three conditions must be satisfied i the party evicting must have a good and present title to the property ii the tenant must have quitted or directly attorned to the paramount title holder against his will iii either the landlord must be willing or be a consenting party to such direct attornment by his tenant to the paramount title holder or there must be an event such as a change in law or passing of decree by a competent court which would dispense with the need of consent or willingness on the part of the landlord and so bind him as would enable the tenant handing over possession or attorning in favour of the paramount title holder directly or in other words the paramount title holder must be armed with such legal process for eviction as cannot be lawfully resisted This Court noticed the provisions of local rent control law whereunder entitlement of the tenant to hold the suit premises as tenant would not come to an end unless a decree for eviction against him was passed by a court of law in a suit for eviction instituted by the principal owner against the tenant and then held till then he would remain a tenant of the <ORG> It cannot be said that the respondent tenant does not have any defence nor can he lawfully resist the suit filed by the owner <ORG> The plain and simple legal position which flows is that the appellant must discharge his statutory obligation to put his landlord that is the respondent in possession of the premises in view of the latter entitlement to hold the tenancy premises until his own right comes to an end and the respondent must discharge his statutory obligation to put his own landlord that is the <ORG> in possession of the tenancy premises on his entitlement to hold the tenancy premises coming to an end The plea of eviction by paramount title is not available to the appellant for three reasons firstly it cannot be said that the <ORG> is armed with a legal process for eviction which cannot be lawfully resisted by the tenant respondent or to which he has no defence secondly the attornment by the appellant in favour of the <ORG> is voluntary and not under any compulsion and thirdly it cannot be said that the <ORG> has such good and present title against the tenant respondent so as to hold the appellant liable to be evicted against his will The triple test laid down by this court in <NAME> case is not satisfied Secondly the appellant is placing reliance on an event happening after the institution of suit i a subsequent event and a case for taking notice of such subsequent event by court so as to impair the judgment under appeal is not made out However the <ORG> has power to take note of subsequent events and mould the relief accordingly subject to the following conditions being satisfied i that the relief as claimed originally has by reason of subsequent events become inappropriate or cannot be granted ii that taking note of such subsequent event or changed circumstances would shorten litigation and enable complete justice being done to the parties iii that such subsequent event is brought to the notice of the <ORG> promptly and in accordance with the rules of procedural law so that the opposite party is not taken by surprise The <ORG> may in such cases bend the rules of procedure if no specific provision of law or rule of fairplay is violated for it would promote substantial justice provided that there is absence of other disentitling factors or just circumstances However the court cautioned i the event should be one as would stultify or render inept the decretal remedy ii rules of procedure may be bent if no specific provision or fairplay is violated and there is no other special circumstance repelling resort to that course in law or justice iii such cognizance of subsequent events and developments should be cautions and iv the rules of fairness to both sides should be scrupulously obeyed In the former case the <ORG> may take judicial notice of the event and before acting thereon put the parties on notice of how the change in law is going to affect the rights and obligations of the parties and modify or mould the course of litigation or the relief so as to bring it in conformity with the law Such subsequent event the <ORG> may permit being introduced into the pleadings by way of amendment as it would be necessary to do so for the purpose of determining real questions in controversy between the parties No doubt <ORG>s can and sometimes must take notice of subsequent events but that is done merely inter partes to shorten litigation but not to give to a defendant an advantage because a third party has acquired the right and title of the plaintiff It is all the more strictly applied in those cases where there is a judgment under appeal The subsequent event urged by the defendant appellant is basically a factual event and cannot be taken cognizance of unless brought to the notice of the <ORG> in accordance with established rules of procedure which if done would have afforded the plaintiff respondent an opportunity of meeting the case now sought to be set up by the appellant
