JUDGMENT <NAME> This is an appeal from an order granting temporary injunction in a suit pending before a learned Single Judge on the original side of this Court The facts have been fully stated in the order under appeal and may therefore be only briefly re stated The appellants are defendants in a suit filed on the original side of this <ORG> by the plaintiff respondent which is a foreign company having its registered office in Karachi West Pakistan It is not disputed that the appellants had applied for registration of a trade mark with the words Tibet Snow but their application was dismissed in the year on the ground that the said trade mark was already registered in the name of the respondent The appellants thereupon filed an application under Section of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act While the appellants application for rectification of the Registrar was still pending the respondent company instituted in this <ORG> on a suit wherein it prayed for a decree inter alia for perpetual injunction restraining the appellants by themselves or through any other persons on their behalf from using the trade mark Tibet Snow or any other mark in respect of face cream which may be an infringement of its trade mark On that application an ad interim order requiring the appellants to maintain accounts of the sale of face cream manufactured and traded by them under the mark Tibet Snow was passed Meanwhile a notice of the application for temporary injunction was also issued to the appellants The appellants entered appearance and by two separate applications asked for stay of proceedings in the suit till the final disposal of their application for rectification of the <ORG> and for security for their costs in defending the suit being furnished by the respondent The learned Judge trying the suit allowed the application for stay of proceedings in the suit He also held that the appellants were entitled to an order regarding security for costs being made in their favor but since their application for stay of the suit was being accepted by him it was not necessary to make such an order at present and that necessary directions in that behalf would be given if and when the proceedings in the suit were resumed In this appeal we are only concerned with the order made by the learned Judge on the respondent application for grant of temporary injunction whereby the appellants have been restrained from using any carton packing container or bottle bearing the words Tibet Snow or any word that might sound like Tibet while marketing and selling the face cream manufactured by them till the disposal of the suit It is contended that the carton used by the appellants is somewhat different from that of the respondent and as such it cannot be held that the user of the mark Tibet Snow by the appellants amounts to an infringement of the respondent trade mark Another fact on which a great deal of stress had been laid is that there has been considerable delay on the part of the Respondent instituting the suit in spite of the fact that the respondent had come to know in the year that the appellants had commenced proceedings for cancellation of their trade mark and for rectification of the <ORG> In support of his argument learned counsel for the appellants has not only cited the case of <ORG> versus <ORG> which was relied upon by the appellant before the learned Judge but he has also cited a decision of <NAME> as his lordship then was in Firm Gaylord Shangrila and another <ORG> The plaintiff issued a writ in December and moved for an interim injunction restraining the defendant from carrying on business except under his full name <ORG> It is apparent that there is no connection between the two cases It is well settled that there is an essential difference between an action for infringement of a trade mark and an action for passing off The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of the trade mark in relation to those goods while an action for passing off is a common law remedy being in substance an action for defunct that is But the very fact that the appellants have been defeated in at least two rounds does give rise to the belief that the respondent company has a prime fade case and that the sale of the same class of goods under the mark Tibet Snow does constitute infringement of the respondent trade mark The plaintiffs in that suit were carrying on business under the trading style <NAME> Restaurant in New Delhi The plaintiffs sued turn a decree for perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from using the words <NAME> <NAME> or <NAME> as their trading style and succeeded in obtaining a temporary injunction from the District Judge restraining the defendants till the decision of the suit from using the words <NAME> or <NAME> <NAME> The appeal was allowed and the order of temporary injunction was substituted by an order for maintaining true and proper accounts and for furnishing security for payment to the plaintiffs of profits made by them in case the plaintiffs ultimately succeeded in the suit There was also a further direction that the defendants shall display the word <NAME> on the signboard cash memo cartons and memo books as prominently as the word <NAME> and also publish general notices in the newspapers viz As regards delay the argument of the learned counsel for the appellants lies that this aspect of the case had not been considered by the learned Judge at all and that only a passing reference has been made to it in the order under appeal It is no doubt true that the delay in applying for an order of temporary injunction is one of the considerations which has to be kept in view but delay by itself is not sufficient to deprive the registered proprietor of a trade mark of his rights unless it is such as to give rise to a belief that the proprietor of the trade mark has either acquiesced in the user of the mark by the opposite party or has abandoned his rights therein The respondent no doubt came to know about the appellants efforts to have the respondent trade mark removed from the <ORG> but so long as there was no real danger to its rights the respondent could well ignore the threat We also cannot shut our eyes to the fact that the respondent is a foreign company in Pakistan and there are obvious difficulties in the way of its launching on a litigation in this country In such circumstances the respondent cannot restrain the appellants from manufacturing and marketing their produce under that mark when there is no possibility of the respondent own product being made available to the public in India In this connection reliance is placed by the learned counsel on a recent decision of <ORG> in England in <NAME> <ORG> Special stress has been laid by the learned counsel on the observations of <NAME> at page of the report where it was said IT is naturally with reluctance that I differ from the view of so experienced a judge but I cannot think that this is a proper case in which to grant the relief of an interlocutory injunction INthe circumstances of this case I do not see that in the absence of an interlocutory injunction there is the slightest chance of the plaintiff suffering any irreparable injury I see no reason why damages should not afford an adequate remedy assuming that the plaintiff ultimately succeeds in the action Although no opinion was expressed by <ORG> upon the general merits of the question canvassed before them it was said by <NAME> that in his view there was a good deal to be said in support of either side case There was also no material before the <ORG> as to the seals on which the defendants were operating It was further said that normally an interlocutory injunction would not be granted where damages would provide adequate remedy should the claim succeed nor would the <ORG> grant an interlocutory iniunction unless it was satisfied that there was a real probability of the plaii itiff succeeding on the trial of the suit In the present case there is no danger of the business of the appellants closing down According to Mr <NAME> either the audited statements filed by the appellants do not give a correct version of their sales or the business of the appellants is on such a small scale that any injury to them will be almost minimal the import of respondent goods from Pakistan into this country the very fact that during the period the said embargo lasts and there is equal possibility of the embargo being removed sometime or the other she respondent will have suffered an irreparable injury There is thus an apparent danger to the respondent goodwill and reputation which is a necessary attribute of a right to trade mark To accept the argument if the learned counsel for the appellants that since the respondent company was not having any sales of Its product in this country on account of trade restrictions one would have to go to the length of holding that it had also no right to its rights as the registered proprietor of the trade mark being protected by injunction or otherwise Mr <NAME> also referred us to a decision of <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> and others Dlt where it was held that for the grant or a temporary injunction the question of balance of convenience could arise only when at least pritna facie the two parties were on the same levels and their rights were about equal The plaintiff in that suit for the grant of a permanent injunction to restrain the defendant from infringing its trade mark had alleged that it was the user of the trade mark for years and had spent about four lakhs of rupees for advertising the trade mark and had sold goods under that trade mark to the tune of Rupees three crores while the defendant had used the trade mark for six months only It appears to us that in the present case there was material before the learned Judge that the respondent had large sales and had widely advertised its product for several vears On an over all view of the material on record we are satisfied that the learned Judge exercised his discretion on sound lines and that there is no error of principle involved in the order made by him
