<ORG> of <ORG> quashed the FIR on the premise that the complaint did not disclose the offence First is that the complaint did not disclose commission of any offence of cheating punishable under Section of the Indian penal Code Second is that there is nothing in the complaint to suggest that the petitioner had dishonest or fraudulent intention at the time the respondent exported goods worth by different invoices There is also nothing to indicate that the respondent by deceiving the complainant induced him to export goods worth The third is that on the face of the allegations contained in the complaint it is purely a commercial transaction which in a nut shell is that the seller did not pay the balance amount of the goods received by him as per his assurance After quoting Section of learned judges proceeded to consider the main elements of the offence in the following lines A bare reading of the definition of cheating would suggest that there are two elements thereof namely deception and dishonest intention to do or omit to do something In order to bring a case within the first part of Section it is essential in the first place that the person who delivers the property should have been deceived before he makes the delivery and in the second place that he should have been induced to do so fraudulently or dishonestly It was thereafter that <ORG> scanned the complaint and found out that there is nothing in the complaint to suggest that the accused had dishonest or fraudulent intention at the time of export of goods For quashing an FIR a step which is permitted only in extremely rare cases the information in the complaint must be so bereft of even the basic facts which are absolutely necessary for making out the offence The following observations made in the aforesaid decisions are a sound reminder We also give a note of caution to the effect that the power of quashing a criminal proceeding should be exercised very sparingly and with circumspection and that too in the rarest of rare cases that the court will not be justified in embarking upon an enquiry as to the reliability or genuineness or otherwise of the allegations made in the FIR or the complaint and that the extraordinary or inherent powers do not confer an arbitrary jurisdiction on the court to act according to its whim or caprice It may be that the facts narrated in the present complaint would as well reveal a commercial transaction or money transaction But that is hardly a reason for holding that the offence of cheating would elude from such a transaction In fact many a cheatings were committed in the course of commercial and also money transactions He also mentioned that respondent after receiving the goods have sold them to others and still he did not pay the money We therefore allow this appeal and set aside the impugned order
