The first group consists of CA Nos of of WP Nos and of wherein constitutional validity of the i Karnataka Excise Distillery and Warehouse Amendment Rules ii Karnataka Excise Manufacture of Wine from Grapes Amendment Rules iii Karnataka Excise Brewery Amendment Rules iv Karnataka Excise Sale of Indian and Foreign Liquors Amendment Rules and Karnataka Excise Bottling of Liquor Amendment Rules was unsuccessfully challenged by various parties before <ORG> inter alia on the ground that the Rules in question affected adversely the fundamental right of the parties to carry on trade or business in liquor and that the said Rules were violative of Articles A and of the Constitution of India A Bench of two learned Judges has referred the said matters also to <ORG> for decision on the question whether appellants have a fundamental right to carry on trade in liquor <ORG> has held that the Rules and the amendments thereto as well as the Act are not invalid on the ground that they violate the right to carry on trade in liquor which is not fundamental It appears that some of the parties affected by the decision of <ORG> upholding the validity of the enactments and rejecting the argument that the petitioners have a fundamental right to carry on trade in liquor filed writ petitions in <ORG> for a declaration that though the validity of the enactments had been upheld by <ORG> the A Act deals only with the taking over of trade but not business in liquor and therefore the <ORG> had no right to prevent the writ petitioners from carrying on with the business of liquor during the validity of their licences whether the appellants petitioners have a fundamental right to carry on trade in liquor We will first deal with the matters in groups and and therefore with the question whether the appellants petitioners have a fundamental right to carry on business in liquor Before we proceed to examine the question it is necessary at the outset to focus our attention on the precise controversy raised before us and which it is claimed arises out of the conflicting decisions of this <ORG> One that there is no fundamental right to trade or business in liquor and that the <ORG> has power to regulate the trade or business by placing restrictions on such trade or business in the interests of the general public even to the extent of prohibiting completely such business or trade The other contention is that a citizen has a fundamental right to trade or business in liquor and the <ORG> can only place reasonable restrictions on the said right in the interests of general public by law made for the purpose under Article of the Constitution It is in the light of these rival contentions that we have to examine the question raised before us If the law is that a citizen has no fundamental right then Article cannot be applied because the said article applies only to those rights which a citizen possesses Secondly it is submitted that assuming that the <ORG> has got the power to carry on trade in liquor dehors Article and under Article of the Constitution the power under Article cannot extend to trade in liquor This is so because <ORG> has no executive power to trade in a commodity which under Article it is enjoined to prohibit The implication of this entry is that till prohibition is introduced by applying Article there is no prohibition on consumption of liquor and hence there is no prohibition for manufacture and sale of liquor Secondly it is submitted that there are other substances like tobacco which are more harmful to health than alcohol and they are being sold freely For all these reasons it is submitted that there is no warrant for excluding liquor from the ambit of the words any occupation trade or business under Article of the Constitution We will first refer to the relevant provisions of the Constitution which have a bearing on the subject Article provides that all citizens shall have the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business This right conferred by the aforesaid provision is circumscribed by the provisions of clause of the very article which reads as follows Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the general public reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause and in particular nothing in the said sub clause shall affect the operation of any existing law insofar as it relates to or prevent the <ORG> from making any law relating to i the professional or technical qualifications necessary for practising any profession or carrying on any occupation trade or business or ii the carrying on by the <ORG> or by a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> of any trade business industry or service whether to the exclusion complete or partial of citizens or otherwise Thus Article read with Article spells out a fundamental right of the citizens to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business so long as it is not prohibited or is within the framework of the regulation if any if such prohibition or regulation has been imposed by the <ORG> by enacting a law in the interests of the general public The right conferred upon the citizens under Article is thus subject to the complete or partial prohibition or to regulation by the <ORG> Thus both the <ORG> and the State Governments have within their respective spheres power to carry on trade or business Article A provides that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law It is undisputed that if a citizen is carrying on the business according to the provisions of law his business cannot be taken away save by authority of law if such a law is enacted to further the purpose whether of Article or Article The right given by this article to freely carry on trade commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India is undisputedly subject to the same restrictions as is the right under Article Apart from the restrictions placed on the right under Article by the provisions of Articles and the provisions of Article also place such restrictions on the said right The provisions of the aforesaid articles so far as they are relevant for our purpose read together therefore make the position clear that the right conferred by Article is not absolute Those provisions are contained in Articles and We may now refer to the relevant entries of List of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which give power to the State Governments to make the laws in question Duties of excise on the following goods manufactured or produced in the <ORG> and countervailing duties at the same or lower rates on similar goods manufactured or produced elsewhere in India a alcoholic liquors for human consumption opium Indian hemp and other narcotic drugs and narcotics but not including medicinal and toilet preparations containing alcohol or any substance included in sub paragraph of this entry The relevant entry in List I which has a bearing on the subject is Entry which reads as follows Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Under this entry <ORG> has enacted the Industries Development and Regulation Act for short IDR Act and Item of Schedule I of that Act reads as Fermentation Industries Alcohol Other products of Fermentation and Distillery We are not in this reference concerned with the question as to whether there is any conflict between the relevant Acts of the respective <ORG> Legislatures and the Rules Regulations Notifications and Orders issued under the said Acts and the provisions of the IDR Act Hence the IDR Act confers on <ORG> power to make rules for the registration of existing undertakings and for regulating the production and development of the industries mentioned in the Schedule and also for consultation with the Provincial now <ORG> Governments in these matters The Act does not in any way denude the power of the <ORG> Governments to make laws regulating and prohibiting the production manufacture possession transport purchase and sale of intoxicating liquors meant for human consumption but not for medicinal or toilet preparations and levying excise on them under Entries and of List If there is any incidental encroachment by the relevant <ORG> Act on the area occupied by the IDR Act that will not invalidate the <ORG> Act The impugned judgments of <ORG> also mention that the <ORG> Act have received the assent of the President We may now refer to the relevant authorities cited at the <ORG> It does not appear that any contentions were raised there on the basis of Article and hence there is no discussion with reference to the said provision <NAME> <ORG> what fell for consideration was the validity of the amendment in to Rule of the Madras Motor Vehicles Rules to empower <ORG> to alter from time to time the starting place and termini for motor vehicles There is no fundamental right in a citizen to carry on business wherever he chooses and his right must be subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by the executive authority in the interests of the public convenience The SCR AIR SC Cri LJ SCR AIR SC restriction cannot be regarded as being unreasonable if the authority imposing such restriction has the power to do so The right of every citizen to pursue any lawful trade or business is obviously subject to such reasonable conditions as may be deemed by the governing authority of the country essential to the safety health peace order and morals of the community There is no inherent right in a citizen to thus sell intoxicating liquors by retail it is not a privilege of a citizen of the <ORG> or of a citizen of the United <ORG>s Properly speaking there can be a monopoly only when a trade which could be carried on by all persons is entrusted by law to one or more persons to the exclusion of the general public When the contract is thrown open to public auction it cannot be said that there is exclusion of competition and thereby monopoly is created The rival claimants had applied for grant of licences and setting up of country spirit shops and the parties who were dissatisfied with the orders of the Deputy Commissioner and those of the Excise Commissioner in appeals therefrom appealed to <ORG> whose orders were quashed by <ORG> on the ground that the notification concerned was void While dealing with the contentions raised therein the Court held that a perusal of the Act and the Rules made it clear that no person had any absolute right to sell liquor and the purpose of the Act and the Rules was to control and restrict the consumption of intoxicating liquors such control and restriction being obviously necessary for the preservation of public health and morals and to raise revenue After referring to the observations made in the American decision in <NAME> <NAME> the Court held as follows SCR AC All ER SCR AIR SC SCR AIR SC Ed US It will be abundantly clear from the foregoing observations that the activities which have been condemned in this country from ancient times appear to have been equally discouraged and looked upon with disfavour in England Scotland the United States of America and in Australia in the cases referred to above We find it difficult to accept the contention that those activities which encourage a spirit of reckless propensity for making easy gain by lot or chance which lead to the loss of the hard earned money of the undiscerning and improvident common man and thereby lower his standard of living and drive him into a chronic state of indebtedness and eventually disrupt the peace and happiness of his humble home could possibly have been intended by our Constitution makers to be raised to the status of trade commerce or intercourse and to be made the subject matter of a fundamental right guaranteed by Article The <ORG> further held relying on the observations in United States <NAME> <NAME> United States of America and <NAME> <NAME> that the fact of issuing a licence or imposing a tax means nothing except that the licensee shall be subject to no penalties under the law if he pays it The crime is not a business and the fact that regulatory provisions have been enacted to control gambling by issuing licences and by imposing taxes does not in any way alter the nature of gambling which is inherently vicious and pernicious Hence the validity of that Act had not to be decided by the yardstick of reasonableness and public interest laid down in Articles and After Article has conferred on the citizen the several rights set out in its seven sub clauses action is at once taken by the Constitution in clauses to to keep the way of social control free from unreasonable impediment It was to guard against this position SCR AIR SC SCR AIR SC AIR SC that the Constitution provided in its clauses to that even in the fields of these rights new laws might be made and old laws would operate where this was necessary for general welfare Laws imposing reasonable restriction on the exercise of the rights are saved by clause in respect of rights under sub clause a where the restrictions are in the interests of the security of the <ORG> and of other matters mentioned therein by clause in respect of the rights conferred by sub clause where the restrictions are in the interests of the public order by clauses and in respect of the rights conferred by sub clauses the restrictions are in the interest of the general public in clause which is in respect of rights conferred by sub clauses also where the restrictions are for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe But for these saving provisions such laws would have been void because of Article which is in these words All laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution insofar as they are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part shall to the extent of such inconsistency be void The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void As it was to remedy the harm that would otherwise be caused by the provisions of Article that these saving provisions were made it is proper to remember the words of Article in interpreting the words reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right as used in clause It is reasonable to think that the makers of the Constitution considered the word restriction to be sufficiently wide to save laws Inconsistent with Article or taking away the rights conferred by the article provided this inconsistency or taking away was reasonable in the interests of the different matters mentioned in the clause Since heavy reliance is placed on behalf of the appellants petitioners on this case to contend that the right to carry on business in liquor is fundamental it is necessary to examine this case a little more in detail Writ Petition filed by the appellant for quashing the order of the <ORG>er was dismissed by <ORG> A combined reading of clauses and of Article makes it clear that a citizen has a fundamental right to carry on any trade or business and the <ORG> can make a law imposing reasonable restrictions on the said right in the interests of the general public It is therefore obvious that unless dealing in liquor is not trade or business a citizen has a fundamental right to deal in that commodity If a law prohibits dealing in liquor the dealing does not cease to be business but the said law imposes a restriction on the said dealing According to the respondent State there it was held in that case that dealing in liquor was not a business or trade within the meaning of Article of the Constitution and there is no fundamental right in a citizen to carry on the business wherever he chooses and his right must be subject to any reasonable restriction imposed by the executive authority in the interests of public convenience The Court observed that in that case this Court did not say that there was no fundamental right to do business but only held that a citizen could not claim that his fundamental right could not be restricted in public interests Nor according to the <ORG> did the decision in <NAME> case lay down any such proposition According to the <ORG> there the learned Judge was considering the scope of the police power and the said observations were made in that context and those observations were applied by this <ORG> in <NAME> case in considering the reasonableness of the restrictions imposed upon the fundamental rights Similarly according to the <ORG> the following observations of this <ORG> in A Kidwai case had no relevance to the inquiry viz whether there was a fundamental right to carry on business in liquor The said observations are as follows SCR A perusal of the Act and rules will make it clear that no person has any absolute right to sell liquor and that the purpose of the Act and the rules is to control and restrict the consumption of intoxicating liquors such control and restriction being obviously necessary for the preservation of public health and morals and to raise revenue According to the <ORG> the said observations only mean that no absolute right to sell liquor was given to any person under the Act and that the said right was controlled by the provisions of the said Act The <ORG> further held that the respondent State could not draw any support from the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case because the question there was in regard to the scope of Articles and of the Constitution vis avis the orders passed by the appropriate authorities under the Eastern Bengal and Assam Excise Act although in that case two decisions of this <ORG> viz <NAME> case and A Kidwai case were noticed and it was observed that there was no inherent right to the settlement of liquor shops According to the <ORG> no question of fundamental right under Article arose in that case and hence the said observations were unhelpful to the State The <ORG> also found that the following observations made in the Chamarbaugwala case were also not helpful to the <ORG> because that decision only laid down that gambling was not business or trade SCR We find it difficult to accept the contention that those activities which encourage a spirit of reckless propensity for making easy gain by lot or chance which lead to the loss of the hard earned money of the undiscerning and improvident common man and thereby lower his standard of living and drive him into a chronic state of indebtedness and eventually disrupt the peace and happiness of his humble home could possibly have been intended by our Constitution makers to be raised to the status of trade commerce or intercourse and to be made the subjectmatter of a fundamental right guaranteed by Article According to the <ORG> in those decisions this <ORG> was only considering the provisions of the various Acts which conferred a restricted right to business The <ORG> therefore held that dealing in liquor was business and a citizen has a right to do business in that commodity but a <ORG> can make a law imposing reasonable restrictions on the said right in public interest We will have an occasion to deal with the <ORG> observations and conclusions in this case at the appropriate stage hereinafter To proceed further with the decisions of this <ORG> in chronological order we may now refer to the next decision viz The facts were that the first respondent was carrying on business of country liquor in SCR exercise of the powers conferred by Section of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act Thereafter the remaining seven shops were sold by private negotiations for substantially higher prices <ORG> had allowed the writ petition filed by the respondent and in appeal this <ORG> referred to the decisions which we have cited above including the decision in Narula case Referring to the decision in Narula case the <ORG> held there as follows <ORG> para It is no doubt true that this <ORG> in the case cited held that dealing in liquor is business and a citizen has a right to do business in that commodity but it was added that the <ORG> can make a law imposing reasonable restrictions on the said right in public interest lm It is no doubt true that in Section there is no express mention of the precise grounds on which the licence can be withdrawn The right to carry on lawful trade or business is subject to such reasonable conditions as may be considered essential by the appropriate authority for the safety health peace order and morals of the society In <NAME> <ORG> of which is a judgment of three learned Judges while dealing with the question whether the <ORG> has power to grant liquorlicence by public auction and whether the said power violated fundamental right under Article of the Constitution the <ORG> held as follows <ORG> pp paras There are three principal reasons to hold that there is no fundamental right of citizens to carry on trade or to do business in liquor Second there is power of the <ORG> to enforce an absolute prohibition of manufacture or sale of Intoxicating liquor Referring to Narula case the <ORG> held that it was not correct to read the said decision to mean that there was a fundamental right to do business in liquor According to the <ORG> the said decision was that dealing in liquor is business and a citizen had a right to do business in that commodity and the <ORG> could impose reasonable restrictions on that right in public interest The <ORG> has exclusive right to manufacture and sell liquor and to sell the said right in order to raise revenue While dealing with it after referring to all the earlier decisions including the decision in <NAME> case the Court held as follows <ORG> pp paras These unanimous decisions of five Constitution Benches uniformly emphasised after a careful consideration of the problem involved that the <ORG> has the power to prohibit trades which are injurious to the health and welfare of the public that elimination and exclusion from the business is inherent in the nature of liquor business that no person has an absolute right to deal in liquor and that all forms of dealings in liquor have from their inherent nature been treated as a class by themselves by all civilised communities The contention that the citizen had either a natural or a fundamental right to carry on trade or business in liquor thus stood rejected The decisions in <NAME> case <NAME> case and <NAME> case were cited before the Court but it took the view that they did not support the contention that dealing in liquor was not business or trade or that a right to do business in liquor was not a fundamental right paras This decision was also cited before the <ORG> in <NAME> case but it said This decision only lays down that gambling is not business or trade There is no fundamental right to do trade or business in intoxicants The <ORG> under its regulatory powers has the right to prohibit absolutely every form of activity in relation to intoxicants its manufacture storage export import sale and possession This may explain why the <ORG> restricted its final conclusion to holding that dealing in liquor is business and the citizen has a right to do business in that commodity If we may repeat <NAME> said We therefore hold that dealing in liquor is business and a citizen has a right to do business in that commodity but the <ORG> can make a law imposing reasonable restrictions on the said right in public interests The wider right to prohibit absolutely would include the narrower right to permit dealing in intoxicants on such terms of general application as the <ORG> deems expedient In <ORG> of <NAME> the Bench of two learned Judges reiterated that it is well settled by several decisions of this Court including the decision in Har Shankar case that there is no fundamental right in a citizen to carry on trade or business in liquor The <ORG> under its regulatory power has the power to prohibit absolutely every form of activity in relation to intoxicants and its manufacture storage export import sale and possession No one can claim as against the <ORG> the right to carry on trade or business in liquor and the <ORG> cannot be compelled to part with its exclusive right or privilege of manufacturing and selling liquor In <ORG> <ORG> of a Bench of two learned Judges while dealing with the question whether after the expiration of the licence given to the appellant fixation of the prices of the plant and machinery of the distillery and the attached warehouses and stock in trade and payment thereof to the appellant was a condition precedent to taking possession thereof and giving delivery to the new licensee which was a <ORG> owned Corporation found on facts that the appellant had no exclusive possession of the distillery which always remained with <ORG> and the appellant was only working out the contract of manufacturing rectified spirit in the distillery and wholesale supply of the same to the retail vendors within the area attached to it In that connection the Court observed as follows SCC para It is settled law by several decisions of this Court that there is no fundamental right to a citizen to carry on trade or business in liquor No one can claim as against the <ORG> the right to carry on trade or business in any intoxicants nor the <ORG> be compelled to part with its exclusive right or privilege of manufacture sale storage SCC SCC Tax SCC Supp SCC AIR SC of liquor The question whether the citizen had a fundamental right to carry on trade or business in industrial alcohol was neither raised nor answered Further Section of the Act provides that the <ORG> may declare what shall be deemed to be country liquor or foreign liquor and the <ORG> had under the rules issued the notification defining foreign liquor as meaning all rectified perfumed medicated and denatured spirit wherever made The Court further held that although it was true that the stand taken by the <ORG> Government in the earlier proceedings in <ORG> was that the levy was in the nature of excise duty or a fee and the present stand was that it was neither a duty nor a fee but only a levy for the conferment of the exclusive privilege that would not make any difference so long as the Government has the right to impose the levy Since the <ORG> had exclusive right of manufacturing and selling of intoxicating liquors the imposition of vend fee on denatured spirit and the grant of licences to wholesale vend of denatured spirit was within the legislative competence of the <ORG> under Entry of List II The Court further held that the Ethyl Alcohol Price Control Order issued by the Central Government in exercise of power conferred under Section of the IDR Act did not explicitly or impliedly take away the power of <ORG> to regulate the distribution of intoxicating liquor by collecting a levy for parting away with its exclusive rights <ORG> would have had exclusive power to legislate in respect of industry notified by <ORG> but the provisions of Entry of List and Entry of List III would also have to be taken into account for determining the scope of legislative power of <ORG> and the <ORG> The <ORG> held that it must accept the decision that the <ORG> have the power to regulate the use of alcohol and that power must include power to make provisions to prevent and or check industrial alcohol being used as intoxicating or drinkable alcohol The question according to the <ORG> was whether in the garb of regulations the legislation which is in pith and substance fee or levy which has no connection with the cost or expenses administering the regulations can be imposed purely as a regulatory measure The <ORG> then observed that only in two cases the question of industrial alcohol had come up for consideration before this <ORG> para there was no right to do business even in potable liquor But this must be held that the reasoning therein would apply with greater force to industrial alcohol Article of the Constitution imposes upon the <ORG> the duty to endeavour to bring about prohibition of the consumption except for medicinal purpose of intoxicating drinks and products which are injurious to health If the meaning of the expression intoxicating liquor is taken in the wide sense adopted in Balsara case it would lead to an anomalous result It was submitted that the activity in potable liquor which was regarded safe and exclusive right of the <ORG> in the earlier judgments dealing with the potable liquor were sought to be justifiable under the police power of the <ORG> that is the power to preserve public health morals etc We have examined the different provisions There is no taxing provision permitting these in the lists in the field of industrial alcohol for the <ORG> to legislate The aforesaid decisions pertaining to the trade or business in denatured spirit or industrial alcohol not only do not take the view that the citizen has a fundamental right to carry on trade or business in potable alcohol but on the contrary hold that he has no such right It will thus be obvious that all the decisions except the decision in Narula case have unanimously held as shown above that there is no fundamental right to carry on trade or business in potable liquor sold as a beverage The fundamental rights enumerated under Article are subject to the restrictions mentioned in clauses to of the said article The citizen has undoubtedly a fundamental right to carry on business in ghee But he has no fundamental right to do business in adulterated ghee To expound the theme further a citizen has no right to trafficking in women or in slaves or in counterfeit coins or to carry on business of exhibiting and publishing pornographic or obscene films and literature So also there are goods articles and services which are obnoxious and injurious to the health morals safety and welfare of the general public To contend that merely because some activities and trafficking in some goods can be organised as a trade or business right to carry on trade or business in the same should be considered a fundamental right is to beg the question The correct interpretation to be placed on the expression the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business is to interpret it to mean the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business which can be legitimately pursued in a civilised society being not abhorrent to the generally accepted standards of its morality This is apart from the fact that under our Constitution the implied restrictions on the right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business are made explicit in clauses to of Article of the Constitution and the State is permitted to make law for imposing the said restrictions It will have therefore to be held that even under the American Constitution there is no absolute fundamental right to do business or trade in any commodity or service They have the said rights as qualified by the respective clauses to of Article That is apart from the fact that Article of the Constitution enjoins upon the <ORG> to prohibit consumption of intoxicating drink like liquor which falls for consideration in the present case and therefore the right to trade or business in potable liquor is subject also to the provisions of the said article Whether one states as in <NAME> case that the citizen has a fundamental right to do business but subject to the <ORG> powers to impose valid restrictions under clause of Article or one takes the view that a citizen has no fundamental right to do business but he has only a qualified fundamental right to do business the practical consequence is the same so long as the former view does not deny the <ORG> the power to completely prohibit trade or business in articles and products like liquor as a beverage or such trafficking as in women and slaves The contention that if a citizen has no fundamental right to carry on trade or business in potable liquor the <ORG> is also injucted from carrying on such trade particularly in view of the provisions of Article though apparently attractive is fallacious The <ORG> power to regulate and to restrict the business in potable liquor impliedly includes the power to carry on such trade to the exclusion of others It carries on business in products which are not declared illegal by completely prohibiting heir production but in products the manufacture possession and supply of which is regulated in the interests of the health morals and welfare of the people The contention further that till prohibition is introduced a citizen has a fundamental right to carry on trade or business in potable liquor has also no merit All that the citizen can claim in such a situation is an equal right to carry on trade or business in potable liquor as against the other citizens He cannot claim equal right to carry on the business against the <ORG> when the <ORG> reserves to itself the exclusive right to carry on such trade or business We also do not see any merit in the argument that there are more harmful substances like tobacco the consumption of which is not prohibited and hence there is no justification for prohibiting the business in potable alcohol The licences granted to the distilleries breweries and wineries of potable liquor are valid only so long as their production possession transport sale consumption etc a The rights protected by Article are not absolute but qualified The fundamental rights guaranteed in Article a to are therefore to be read along with the said qualifications The right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business does not extend to practising a profession or carrying on an occupation trade or business which is inherently vicious and pernicious and is condemned by all civilised societies A citizen has therefore no fundamental right to do trade or business in liquor The <ORG> has therefore the power to completely prohibit the manufacture sale possession distribution and consumption of potable liquor as a beverage both because it is inherently a dangerous article of consumption and also because of the directive principle contained in Article except when it is used and consumed for medicinal purposes For the same reason again the <ORG> can impose limitations and restrictions on the trade or business in potable liquor as a beverage which restrictions are in nature different from those imposed on the trade or business in legitimate activities and goods and articles which are res commercium When the <ORG> permits trade or business in the potable liquor with or without limitation the citizen has the right to carry on trade or business subject to the limitations if any and the <ORG> cannot make discrimination between the citizens who are qualified to carry on the trade or business The power of the <ORG> to raise revenue by levying taxes and fees should not be confused with the power of the <ORG> to prohibit or regulate the trade or business in question Hence the mere fact that the <ORG> levies taxes and fees on trade or business in liquor or income derived from it does not make the right to carry on trade or business in liquor a fundamental right or even a legal right when such trade or business is completely prohibited The restrictions placed on the trade or business in industrial alcohol or in medicinal and toilet preparations containing liquor or alcohol may also be for the purposes of preventing their abuse or diversion for use as or in beverage The observations made in Narula case that a citizen has a fundamental right to trade or business in liquor are to be understood as explained above to mean only that when the <ORG> does not prohibit the trade or business in liquor a citizen has the right to do business in it subject to the restrictions and limitations placed upon it Those observations cannot be read to mean that a citizen has an unqualified and an absolute right to trade or business in potable liquor The decision in the second <ORG> case also cannot be read to mean that the <ORG> in that case has taken the view that a citizen has a right to trade or business in potable liquor That decision is confined to trade or business in industrial alcohol which is legitimately used for industrial purpose and not for consumption as an intoxicating drink We therefore hold that a citizen has no fundamental right to trade or business in liquor as beverage The view taken by this Court in <NAME> case as well as in the second <ORG> case is not contrary to the aforesaid view which has been consistently taken by this Court so far Clauses to of Article make no distinction between the law made by the legislature and the subordinate legislation for the purpose of placing the restrictions on the exercise of the respective fundamental rights mentioned in Article a to It will be apparent from the said clause that it only speaks of operation of any existing law insofar as it imposes from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the rights conferred by Article There is nothing in this provision which makes it imperative to impose the restrictions in question only by a law enacted by the legislature We therefore answer the question accordingly Section of the Act further makes it clear that any licence issued to sell Indian Liquor Foreign Liquor Wine and Beer in wholesale and remaining in force on the appointed day shall stand terminated with effect from that day As stated above the licence issued to the petitioners viz There is no doubt that the word business is more comprehensive than the word trade since it will include manufacture which the word trade may not ordinarily include However the word trade has also secondary meaning viz In the expression restraint of trade the word is used in its loosest sense to cover every kind of trade business profession or occupation Hence we reject the contention and hold that after the taking over of the trade viz
