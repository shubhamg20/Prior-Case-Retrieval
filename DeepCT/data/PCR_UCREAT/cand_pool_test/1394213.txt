That Act which received the assent of the Governor General on th of March was to remain operative under section of the Act for a period of one year only from the date of its commencement subject to a proviso engrafted upon the sub section itself which empowered <ORG> to extend it with or without modifications for a further period of one year by means of a notification on a resolution being passed to that effect by <ORG> and agreed to by <ORG> The appellants along with other detenus filed applications before <ORG> under section Criminal Procedure Code challenging the validity of the Ordinance itself and the propriety of the detention orders made under it on various grounds There are altogether ten judgments which have been challenged in the appeals before us the principals one being that of <NAME> and <NAME> JJ When the appeals were called on for hearing the appellants appeared in person and were not represented by any lawyer Provided that the Governor shall not without instructions from the Governor General promulgate any such Ordinance if any Act of the provincial Legislature containing the same provisions would under this Act have been invalid unless having been reserved for the consideration of the Governor General it had received assent of the Governor General It may be noted here that under the Government of India Act the Governor General has powers to make Ordinances in case of emergency vide section of the Government of India and section of Schedule IX which is now omitted and it was held by privy <ORG> in King Emperor <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> that the emergency which calls for immediate action has to be judged by the Governor General alone The next and the more serious contention raised by the appellants is that the Ordinance in question contains provisions which if they were contained in an Act of <ORG> would have been invalid without the assent of the Governor General In these circumstances it is argued that under section of the Government of India Act previous instructions of the governor General were necessary to validate this Ordinance and as admittedly there were no such instructions in the present case the ordinance must be deemed to be one which is beyond the competence of the Governor to promulgate As regards other parts of India which is outside the provinces as defined in the Act the dominion <ORG> has been given the authority under sub section of the section to legislate on any matter specified in the Provincial List When both the <ORG>s can operate on the same field conflict is likely to arise and section of the Government of India Act lays down rules as to how repugnancy is to be avoided when it arises between Provincial and Dominion Legislation Section of the constitution Act is in these terms If any provision of a Provincial Law is repugnant to any provision of <ORG> law which <ORG> is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent Legislative List then subject to the provisions of the sections the <ORG> law whether pass before or after the Provincial law or as the case may be the existing law shall prevail and the provincial law shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void Where a Provincial law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent Legislative List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier <ORG> law or an existing law with respect to that matter then if the Provincial law having been reserved for the consideration of the Governor General have received the assent of the Governor General the Provincial law shall in that Province prevail but nevertheless the <ORG> Legislature may at any time enact further legislation with respect to the same matter Provided that no Bill or amendment for making any provision repugnant to any Provincial law which having been so reserved has received the assent of the Governor General shall be introduced or moved in <ORG> without the previous sanction of the Governor General Had this been an Act of <ORG> there would have been a conflict between these provisions and those of the existing law contained in Criminal Procedure Code and other Acts and under sub section of section the assent of the Governor General would have been necessary to validate such provisions In order to succeed in their contention and attract the operation of section read with section of the Government of India Act two things have got to be established by the appellants This leads us to enquire first of all whether the impugned Ordinance is in respect to matters enumerated in the Provincial or in the Concurrent List It is settled by the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> that when the province acts solely within its power under the Provincial List without relying on any power conferred by the Concurrent List no question of repugnancy under section of the Government of India Act would arise The matter came up on appeal to this court and this court held that the Act was not void inasmuch as there was no repugnancy between its provisions and those of the Civil Procedure Code or the Indian Contract Act by reason of the exceptions expressly provided for in the latter enactments Against this judgment there was an appeal taken to <ORG> and their Lordships of <ORG> affirmed the decision of <ORG> but on different grounds As agricultural land was expressly excluded from Items and of List III the whole of the Act fell within the powers given to the province by the Provincial List without any necessity to invoke powers from the Concurrent List It will be seen that while this Court based its decision in <NAME> case on the ground that there was no real conflict between the provisions of the impugned Act and those of any existing Indian law and kept open the question as to whether the impugned Act extended to property other than agricultural lands <ORG> held definitely that the Act related exclusively to agricultural lands and that the question of repugnancy was not material at all Public Order but not including the use of his Majesty naval military or air forces in aid of the civil power the administration of justice constitution and organisation of all courts except <ORG> and fees taken therein preventive detention for reasons connected with the maintenance or public order persons subjected to such detention The expression Public Order with which the first item begins is in our opinion a most comprehensive term and it clearly indicates the scope or ambit of the subject in respect to which powers of legislation are given to the province Maintenance of public order within a province is primarily the concern of that province and subject to certain exceptions which involve the use of His Majesty forces in aid of civil power <ORG> is given plenary authority to legislate on all matters which relate to or are necessary for maintenance of public order Preventive detention for reasons connected with the maintenance of public order and persons subjected to such detention are expressly mentioned as being included in this item whereas preventive detention for reasons of <ORG> and connected with <ORG> <ORG> and relations with acceding <ORG>s have been placed separately under Item No of the Federal List Section gives power to <ORG> to make orders restricting the movements or action of or detaining a certain person with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety and he maintenance of public order Section specifies the duration of the order made under section Section lays down that the grounds of the order of detention are to be disclosed to the person affected by the order and the latter would have a right of representation by way of reply to the allegations made against him Under Section an officer authorised in that behalf may require the assistance of any male person in any area to assist him in the maintenance of law and order It is to be noted that violation of the orders passed under all the above sections are made criminal offences for which certain punishments have been provided Under section any police officer may arrest without without warrant any person who is reasonably suspected of having committed an offence punishable under the Ordinance Section lays down how cognizance has to be taken of any alleged contravention of the provisions of the Ordinance and sub section provides that any Magistrate or bench of Magistrates who are empowered to try cases summarily under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure could try any contravention of the provisions of the Ordinance or any order passed under it as <ORG> may be a notification direct Section saves all proceedings commenced or acts done under the earlier Ordinance It is argued on behalf of the appellants that the provision of section of the Ordinance which empowers any police officer to arrest without warrant any person suspected of having committed any offence punishable under the Ordinance really amounts to legislation on Criminal Procedure and conflicts with the provision of section of the Criminal Procedure Code It was laid down by this court in <ORG> <NAME> that none of the items in the lists is to be read in a narrow or restricted sense and each general word should be held to extend to all ancillary or subsidiary matters which can fairly and reasonably be said to be comprehended in it Once the true nature and character of a legislation determine its place in a particular list the fact that it deals incidentally with matters appertaining to other lists is immaterial Judged by the test it can scarcely be argued that the impugned Ordinance is a legislation not on public order or preventive detention for reasons connected with it but on criminal procedure That is the true nature and character of the legislation which unquestionably brings it within Item of List II We have therefore no hesitation in holding that the Ordinance is covered entirely by Items and of the Provincial List and as for no part of this provisions it is necessary to have recourse to the concurrent powers provided for in List III the question of repugnancy under section of the Government of India Act does not arise at all Even assuming for argument sake that the provisions relating to arrest without any warrant by a police officer of persons suspected of committing offences under the Ordinance as contained in section or that relating to trial of such persons by Magistrates empowered to try cases summarily are matters of Criminal Procedure and come within the purview of Item of the Concurrent List we do not think that it will help the appellants in any way There must be repugnancy between such legislation and an existing law prevail unless the procedure laid down in sub section of section was followed In our opinion there is no repugnancy between the provisions of the impugned Ordinance and those of the Criminal Procedure Code Similarly the investing of certain Magistrates with powers to try offences under the Ordinance does not affect or touch in the least any provision of the Criminal Procedure Code It is to be noted that Bihar Maintenance of Public Order Act itself contained a provision under which <ORG> with the assent of both Houses of legislature could by a notification prolong its life for one year more after the th of March In this circumstances the Governor of Bihar promulgated an Ordinance on the rd of June which incorporated in substance the provisions of the Maintenance of Public Order Act It might have been a mistake on the part of those who advised the Governor not to take into account the fact that the <ORG> has not been prorogued when the Ordinance of rd June was passed But it would be idle to suggest that there was anything mala fide or dishonest in the steps that were taken As a superfluity the section can certainly be ignored but it will not affect the validity of the Ordinance itself in any way There is no necessary and inseparable connection between this section and the rest of the Ordinance and none of the material provisions of the latter depend upon it any way The main attack of Mr <NAME> is however directed against the proviso to section of the Ordinance and it was strenuously argued by him that this clause was beyond the capacity of <ORG> to enact and it was not a matter included in any of the items in the Provincial List Now section of the Ordinance runs as follows When an order is made in respect of any person under clause a of sub section of section as soon as may be after the order is made the authority making the order shall communicate to the person affected thereby so far as such communication can be made without disclosing facts which the said authority considers it would be against the public interest to disclose the grounds on which the order has been made against him and such other particulars as are in the opinion of such authority sufficient to enable him to make if he wishes a representation against the order and such person may within fifteen days of the receipt of such communication make a representation in writing to such authority against the order and it shall be the duty of such authority to inform such person of his right of making such representation and to afford him the earliest practicable opportunity of doing so To this sub section a proviso is added which lays down that Where <ORG> is of opinion that it would be against the public interest to disclose all the grounds of the order neither the said order nor the detention of the said person thereunder shall be invalid or unlawful or improper on the ground of any defect vagueness on insufficiency of the communication made to such person under this section Mr <NAME> argues that word all occurring in the proviso is obviously used in the sense of any and under the proviso therefore <ORG> is not bound to disclose to the detenu any ground whatsoever in support of the order of detention The result is that the only safeguard which was provided for in section and which entitled a detenu to make an effective representation by way of reply to the allegations made against him is wholly taken away We may state here that we are not called upon to determine in the present case whether a proviso of this description which practically nullifies the main section upon which it is engrafted would prevail over the section itself This is a question of construction which can be raised on a proper occasion and we do not express any opinion upon it Mr <NAME> contention is that once the safeguard available to a detenu under section of the Ordinance is whittled down and rendered illusory by the proviso the detention is no longer a preventive detention which Item of the Provincial List contemplates it degenerates into arbitrary detention and in respect of such a matter no power of legislation has been given to the province by the Government of India Act It is obvious therefore that anything that weakens the fair and proper determination of the existence of such reasonable anticipation automatically tends to convert what would otherwise be preventive detention into a purely arbitrary detention and at some point in that weakening process the question will arise whether an Act which purports to deal with preventive detention does in pith and in substance in fact so deal or whether it has not over stepped the bounds and become ultra vires <ORG> in that it constitutes in effect an Act conferring upon the <ORG> a power of arbitrary detention The learned Judges appear to have proceeded on the footing that there is an antithesis between preventive and arbitrary detention and that arbitrary detention is itself a separate subject matter of legislation Preventive detention for reasons connected with the maintenance of public order is one of the subjects upon which the provinces have been given the authority to legislate under the Government of India Act Application have been filed by some of the appellants under section of the Government of India Act craving our permission to raise grounds other than those upon which certificates under section were granted This being the position we declined to enter into questions of fact which were discussed elaborately in the judgments of <ORG>
