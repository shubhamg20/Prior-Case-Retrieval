filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging the Award and dismissal of his appeal by the <ORG> on The argument of <NAME> learned counsel for the appellant is that it is section and not section of the Delhi Act which applies to the present case In reply Dr <NAME> on behalf of the contesting respondents contended that section relating to arbitration and not section pertaining to surcharge applies to the present case Surcharge If in the course of an audit inquiry inspection or the wind ing up of a cooperative society it is found that any person who is or was entrusted with the organisation or management of such society or who is or has at any time been an officer or an employee of the society has made any payment contrary to this Act the rules or the bye laWs or has caused any deficiency

the <ORG>r under this section is or is not a dispute touching the consitution management or the business of cooperative society the decision thereon of the <ORG> shall be final and shall not be called in question in an court In substance the contention of the learned counsel for the appeal lant is that the proper action to take in such a case is to resort to section dealing with surcharge and not to settlement of dispute by arbitration since it is not one of the disputes which may be referred to arbitration in terms of section of the Delhi Act It was urged that clause of sub section of section expressly provides that if any dispute touching the constitution management or the business of the cooperative society arises between the society or its committee and any past committee any officer agent or employee or any past officer of the society the dispute shall be refered to arbitration Delhi wherein the learned Single Judge took the view that sub section of section of the Delhi Act is exhaustive and not merely illustra tive The decision of this <ORG> in Srirakulu was ren dered with reference to the Madras Cooperative Societies Act hereinafter referred to as the Madras Act wherein section relating to settlement of disputes by arbitration was the provision corresponding to section of the Delhi Act Clause of sub section of section of the Madras Act was substantially the same as clause of sub section of section of the Delhi Act We do not find any significant difference between the provisions of the Madras Act which form the basis
