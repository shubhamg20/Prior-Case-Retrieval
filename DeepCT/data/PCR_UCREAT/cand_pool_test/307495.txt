This criminal appeal is directed against the judgment of <ORG> rendered in Criminal Appeal No of partly allowing the appeal by setting aside the convictions of respondents to accused Nos to under Section read with Section of I and Section A I and the sentence of imprisonment for life and the sentence of one year rigorous imprisonment respectively but retaining the conviction of the respondents to under Section read with Section of I and the sentence of three years rigorous imprisonment as against respondents and accused and but reducing the sentence of imprisonment inflicted on respondent No A to the period already undergone and in lieu of the unserved portion of the sentence imposing a fine of Rs The relevant facts of the case giving rise to this appeal are necessary to be re capitulated for the disposal of this appeal For the sake of convenience we shall refer respondents to in this judgment as accused Nos to as arrayed before <ORG> When the appellant made enquiries about her daughter complaints the accused abused and tried to beat him In during the second crop season the accused and along with the deceased forcibly harvested the crop standing in the land of the appellant Thus there were civil and criminal proceedings between the parties that the deceased had committed suicide As suspicion was entertained over the death of the deceased the dead body was sent for post mortem examination The State has not preferred any appeal against the order of acquittal of A A of the charges punishable under Sections read with and A of the Indian Penal Code but this present appeal is by PW the father of the deceased Mr <NAME> the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant took us very meticulously through the judgments of <ORG> as well of <ORG> and strenuously contended that the reasons given by the appellate Court for recording an order of acquittal of the offence of murder are perverse and difficult to comperhand and <ORG> has over looked the important and vital facts which tend to show that the circumstances established are consistent only with the hypothesis of guilt of the accused It is further submitted that the unrealistic and false plea put forth by the accused stating that none of them was present in the house on the ill fated night is itself an additional circumstance lending support to the other impelling circumstances unfailingly pointing out the guilt of the accused Mr <NAME> learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents to Accused to countered the above argument submitting that the judgment of <ORG> is based on sound reasoning and that the totality of the evidence adduced by the prosecution if at all proves anything it may create only a suspicion against the appellants and that no conviction as rightly pointed out by <ORG> can be safely recorded on such suspicion or conjecture this <ORG> in a series of decisions has consistently held that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence such evidence must satisfy the following tests the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else and the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence Bearing the above principle of law enunciated by this <ORG> we shall scrutinise scrupulously and examine carefully the circumstances appearing in this case with serious and onerous responsibility imposed on this <ORG> There are certain salient and material features in the present case which are not controverted they being that A to A and the deceased lived under a common roof that the deceased had instituted a civil suit against her father PW and brother PW claiming exclusive possession of the disputed land that the deceased was found dead on the morning of and that there were certain visible injuries such as abrasions nail marks and contusions on the part of the nose upper lip chin and neck etc The very fact that the deceased who was in her prime of youth did not accompany her husband and in laws to attend the marriage celebrated in the house of PW situated just opposite to the accused house shows that there was no cordial relationship between the deceased and the accused and the deceased was not leading a happy marital life by accused that the deceased had committed suicide should have been made only at the instance of A to A and this conduct of the accused clearly indicates that the accused had pre planned and calculated a false theory of defence presumably due to an earlier deliberation and consultation with the local A While considering the above circumstances the appellate Court has expressed its view that the explanation given by the accused that they were at the marriage house of PW throughout the night is nothing but a false explanation and that the culprits who ever they might have been should have administered the poison to the victim and thereby caused her death and that there is very strong suspicion against the accused persons but the prosecution cannot be said to have established the guilt of the accused decisively since the suspicion cannot take the place of legal proof The relevant portion of the final conclusion of the appellate Court reads thus There is no evidence whatsoever either from the neighbours or from others to show that the accused at any time ill treated the deceased or treated her cruelly Thus there is no conclusive evidence that the accused committed the offence of murder In our view this submission has no merit because there is no acceptable evidence showing that there was any quarrel in the family and that the deceased was ill treated either by her husband or in laws <ORG> while dealing with this aspect of the case has observed that there is no evidence that the accused ill treated the deceased which observation we have extracted above Hence we hold that there is no sufficient material to warrant a conclusion that the accused had any motive to snatch away the life threat of the deceased From this circumstance the <ORG> will not be justified in drawing any conclusion that the deceased was not leading a happy marital life We have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that it is a case of murder but not a suicide as we have pointed out supra But there is no evidence as to who had placed the tin container by the side of the dead body The explanation given by accused No in this written statement is that by about the time of the arrival of the police one <NAME> handed over these letters to him saying that he <NAME> found them near the place where the dead body was laid and that he A in turn handed over them to the police The circumstances indicated by the learned Counsel undoubtedly create a suspicion against the accused It also cannot be disputed that when we take into account the conduct of an accused his conduct must be looked at in its entirety We are of the firm view that the circumstances appearing in this case when examined in the light of the above principle enunciated by this Court do not lead to any decisive conclusion that either all these accused or any of them committed the murder of the deceased Vijaya punishable under Section read with Section of I or the offence of cruelty within the mischief of Section A I Hence viewed from any angle the judgment of the appellate Court does not call for interference
