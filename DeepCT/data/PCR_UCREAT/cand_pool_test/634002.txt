<NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the order proposed by my learned brother but I regret I am unable to agree with him The facts of the case have been clearly set out by my learned brother and it is unnecessary to repeat them The contention raised by learned counsel for the assessee relating to the apportionment of the tax on the income of the erstwhile family between the two separated groups does not appear to have any force and I agree with my learned brother when he says that having regard to the language of the statute the apportionment has to be made according to the portion of the joint family property allotted to each separated member I agree that there is nothing in the statute to support the argument that in deciding the value of the portion the income yielding capacity of that portion should be determined by the Income at Officer The word portion in section A is used in this sense and I agree with my learned brother that the Income tax Officer is not expected to embark upon and duty of determining a fresh the value of the assets that fell to the lot of the separating members in order to determine what portion of the joint family property fell to the share of each member Sub section shows that the claim that a partition has taken place amongst the members of the family till then assessed as undivided must be made at the time of making an assessment under section If a claim is made at the proper time the Income tax Officer is required by the statute to make such enquiry thereinto as he may think fit and if he is satisfied that the joint family property has been partitioned in definite portions he has to record an order to that effect From an order made under section A the assessee has a right of appeal under section of the Income tax Act if he objects to any order passed under section A of the Act Section of the Act which mentions the period during which an appeal may be presented states that the intimation of the refusal to pass an order under sub section of section A furnishes the starting point for the period of thirty days during which the appeal has to be presented Under section A the Income tax Officer is required to make an assessment of the total income received by or on behalf of the joint family as such as if no partition has taken place This phrase to my mind means that he has to ascertain the amount of income earned by the family while it existed during the relevant accounting period On the day specified in the notice issued under sub section or as soon afterwards as may be the Income tax Officer after hearing such evidence as such person may produce and such other evidence as the Income tax Officer may require on specified points shall by an order in writing assess the total income of the assessee and determine the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment The tax is to be levied according to the Income tax Act read with the Finance Act passed every year and it is levied on the total income earned by the units of assessment mentioned in section of the Act during the previous year Section says how the Income tax Officer may make an assessment if he feels that the return made under section is correct and complete After considering the language of the statute I am of opinion that when the statute requires an assessment to be made in accordance with section it confers on the assessee the right of availing of the opportunities mentioned in section and to take part in his assessment to tax I find on justification for taking the view that in spite of the express language of the statute requiring the assessments on the various divided members being made in accordance with the provisions of section all that the Income tax Officer may do is to calculate the tax liability and issue a notice of demand But only one assessment can be made under the Income tax Act unless an assessment on income that has escaped assessment is made under section of the Act Section says that when any tax penalty or interest is due in consequence of any order passed under or in pursuance of this Act the Income tax Officer shall serve upon the assesses or other person liable to pay such tax penalty or interest a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable Though this argument was not addressed it might be contended that section A makes the divided members liable for the share of the tax on the income of the erstwhile family and because of this liability a notice of demand may be issued section I fear this argument ignores the fact that a notice of demand under section may be issued for tax due in consequence of an order only and the order that the Income tax Officer has to pass to create a liability for the tax on a divided member must be an order of assessment passed in accordance with the provisions of section There was a partition in the family with effect from th January The Income tax Officer by his order dated July accepted the partition and the assessment for the year was made on the income of the family for the period up to the date of the partition and the total tax charge able on the family was determined and apportioned between the two separated groups of the family The submission that was made before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner after remand inter alia was firstly that the issue of the notice of demand was bad because proceedings in accordance with section A read with section and section of the Act were not taken and secondly that there was no proper and legal assessment as laid down in section A without which the issue of notice of demand was ultra vires The Appellate Assistant Commissioner accepted the contention of <NAME> and held that the notice of demand under section of the Act could not be issued without an assessment being made under section read with section A The question raised relates to the interpretation of section A of the Income tax Act Where at the time of making an assessment under section it is claimed by or on behalf of any member of a Hindu family hitherto assessed as undivided that a partition has taken place among the members of such family the Income tax Officer shall make such inquiry thereinto as he may think fit and it he is satisfied that the joint family property has been partitioned among the various members or groups of members in definite portions he shall record an order to that effect Provided that no such order shall be recorded until notices of the inquiry have been served on all the members of the family Where such an order has been passed or where any person has succeeded to a business profession or vocation formerly carried on by a Hindu undivided family whose joint family property has been partitioned on or after the last day on which it carried on such business profession or vocation the Income tax Officer shall make an assessment of the total income received by or on behalf of the joint family as such as if no partition had taken place and each member or group of members shall in addition to any income tax for which he or it may be separately liable and notwithstanding anything contained is sub section of section be liable for a share of the tax on the income so assessed according to the portion of the joint family property allotted to him or it and the Income tax Officer shall make assessments accordingly on the various members and groups of members is accordance with the provisions of section Provided that all the members and groups of members whose joint family property has been partitioned shall be liable jointly and severally for the tax assessed on the total income received by or on behalf of the joint family as such Mr <NAME> who has appeared for the petitioner had made two submissions before us The substance of section A is that if there has been a partition in the family any one of the separated members can during proceedings for assessment under section of the Act claim that partition has taken place in the family and when that if done the Income tax Officer would have to investigate into that question and decide whether in fact the partition has taken place The substance of sub section of section A is that if the Income tax Officer is satisfied that a partition has in fact taken place and consequently passed an order to that effect under sub section of section A of the Act he shall for the period during which the family was joint assess the family as if no partition has taken place Even though the tax due from the family is apportioned on the separated members or groups there still remains joint and several liability on all the members to pay the entire sum assessed on the family and not only the amount apportioned to them So far as the first submission made by the learned counsel for the petitioner is concerned it appears to me that reference to definite portions in section A of the Act was made as a check on the genuineness of the partition Those words are as follows But Mr <NAME> on behalf of the Commissioner contends that the word portionis used in exactly the same sense as in sub section and refers to a physical part of the property he suggests I think correctly that sub section is designed at any rate in part to meet the case in which there has been a partition of joint family property where one member gets a portion producing income and another member gets a portion producing less income or no income at all for instance where one member of the joint family takes income producing lands or shares and another member takes jewellery of considerable capital value but producing no income There is nothing on the record and the partition deed also does not show that in the division one group of the family got more income yielding properties and the other properties of higher capital value but yielding less income In my opinion the words according to the portion of the joint family property allotted to him or it have not been used in the sense of the portions of the properties being considered itemwise but in the sense of the extent of shares of the separated groups or members in the family property The scheme of the Act therefore shows that the entire proceedings contemplated by sub sections and of section A take place at the same time and there can be no question of starting completely fresh proceedings under section of the Act against the separated groups Hence under the proceedings under section A of the Act started in connection with the proceedings under section of the Act any order passed under sub section of section A is an order made in accordance with section of the Act It is in that sense that the words in accordance with the provisions of section have been used in sub section of section A of the Act The word assessments used in section A has been used in the sense of orders making the separated groups liable to pay the amount apportioned against them In this Act unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context assessee means a person by whom income tax or any other sum of money is payable under this Act and includes every person in respect of whom any proceeding under this Act has been taken for the assessment of his income or of the loss sustained by him or of the amount of refund due to him This definition is wide enough to include a person who has been made liable to pay the amount apportioned on him in respect of the tax due from the family If he is an assessee the order which makes him liable to pay the apportioned amount is an order of assessment within the meaning of section A of the Act To my mind the words and the Income tax Officer shall make assessments accordingly on the various members and groups of members only mean that he shall pass orders making the separated groups liable for the apportioned amount The context in which a words shall make assessments have been used in my judgment only justifies one conclusion i that these words have been used in the sense of an order to be made making the separated groups liable for the apportioned amount It is not necessary as has been suggested by the learned counsel for <NAME> that fresh returns should be made under section and fresh proceedings should be started under section of the Act In other words if proceedings under sections and have already taken place against the separated members or groups in respect of their separate incomes no fresh proceedings need be started for the purposes of section A of the Act and all that is required to be done is that the sum assessed in respect of separate incomes shall be added to the amount apportioned An interpretation which leads to such an absurd result cannot be accepted On a true construction of section A it appears that the Income tax Officer in the first place has to make an assessment of the total income as if no partition had taken place It is true that ordinarily the word assessment is used in the sense of an order made under section of the Act but that word has not been used in the same sense throughout the Act or in sub section of section A of the Act While dealing with that word in the English Act it was observed by <ORG> in the case of Income tax Commissioners for City of London <NAME> that that words has been used in more than one sense in the English Act For the reasons mentioned above I am of the opinion that there is no substance in this submission also BY THE COURT As there is a difference of opinion between us let the matter be placed before the honble the Chief Justice so that the case may be referred to a third judge The two questions of law which were referred to this court for opinion by <ORG> are Whether the Income tax Officer after passing an order under section A was bound in law to make an assessment on the separated group of members in accordance with the provisions of section of the Income tax Act Whether in the circumstances of the case when no assessment had been made on the separated group of members as mentioned in section A the notice of demand for Rs The facts of the case lie within a narrow compass and have been sufficiently stated by <NAME> in his judgment and it is not necessary for me to repeat them Even if I took a different view it would be of no avail as the view of the majority will necessarily prevail over mine The only question therefore on which I have to express my opinion is whether after an assessment of the total income of the family has been made and the liability apportioned between the separating groups according to their share of property at the partition is it necessary for the Income tax Officer to start fresh assessment proceedings under section against the separating groups before he can issue a notice of demand under section The answer depends upon the meaning to be attached to the word assessment in the last portion of section A which runs as follows and the Income tax Officer shall make assessments accordingly on the various members and groups of members in accordance with the provisions of section Section A provides that where a partition has taken place in any year and proceedings for the assessment of the Hindu undivided family hitherto assessed as joint are pending for that year a claim may be made therein by any member of the family setting up partition and he may ask the Income tax Officer for the recording of an order regarding partition This implies that assessment proceedings against the family must have been initiated in the manner provided by section and a notice must have been issued under that section Section A goes on to provide that in the assessment proceedings against the family the Income tax Officer shall make an assessment of the total income received by or on behalf of the joint family as such as if no partition had taken place The basis of this procedure is the legislative fiction that even though a partition has taken place and an order recognising partition has been recorded the family would still be assessed as if it had continued joint because the legislature wanted the liability for the entire tax to be joint and several The other class of separated members would consist of persons or groups who have a separate income also apart from share in the income of the Hindu undivided family In the case of this class of members also it will serve no useful purpose at all if a fresh assessment proceeding under section is once again initiated against them by the issue of a notice under section Accordingly there appears to be no reason at all in principle or policy that the last few words of section A should be interpreted in such a way as to give countenance to proceedings which will only involve waste of public time and harassment to the assessees and will yield no useful results either for the assessee or for the revenue He has observed as follows I am of the opinion that when the statute requires an assessment to be made in accordance with section confers on the assessee the right of availing of the opportunities mentioned in section and to take part in his assessment to tax It is in the interest of revenue of revenue to probe into the matter and to ascertain that the divided members or group of members have in fact no other income on which tax may be demanded from them So far as the members having separate property are concerned they again have ample opportunity of taking part in the proceedings under section which might already have been concluded or be pending or may be subsequently initiated for assessing their separate income So far as the members who have no separate income are concerned they will not be deprived of any right if futile proceedings under section are not taken against them So far as the revenue is concerned it has ample machinery through inspectors and other departmental officers to discover and initiate proceedings against persons who may have a taxable income Therefore the interest of the revenue will in no way suffer if fresh proceedings under section are not taken against members who have no separate income But the word assessment in this clause is not used in the sense of a proceeding for assessment for imposing liability upon the assessee <NAME> has referred to the difference of language used in section and the language used in section A The relevant portion of the language used in section is as follows It appears to me that too much significance should not be attached to this difference A similar determination will have to be made under section in the case of a member of the Hindu undivided family who has a separate income in separate proceedings against him It is only in the case of a member who has no separate income of his own that no separate assessment is made but the assessment is made in assessment proceedings against the Hindu undivided family and he is made liable for payment of a share of the tax liability of the family proportionate to his share in the properties of the family which have been allotted to him At pages and of the report <ORG> were concerned with the consideration of an argument precisely on the same point arising by reason of the difference in the language used in section and and the language used in section as it stood at that time The expression used in sub sections and of sections was assess the total income of the assessee and determine the sum payable by him on the basis of such assessment whereas the language used in sub section of that section was merely to the effect make the assessment to the best of his judgment There was thus no specific reference to the determination of a sum due by the assessee in sub section For even if such power be not given expressly by the direction to make the assessment it is in their opinion plainly implied reading the section as a whole Their Lordships go on to reinforce this conclusion as follows this view is strongly corroborated by section as it then stood which is in these terms When the Income tax Officer has determined a sum to be payable by an assessee under section the Income tax Officer shall serve on the assessee a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable There is nothing in the language of section to warrant the conclusion that a notice under that section can issue only in consequence of an order of assessment passed in accordance with the provisions of section against an assessee personally Section speaks only of a tax demand due in consequence of an order passed under or in pursuance of this Act The order is not necessarily an order passed in a proceeding under section against the assessee himself personally I may also point out that if the word assessment in the concluding portion of section A was intended to imply a fresh assessment under section there was nothing to prevent the legislature from using the expression fresh assessment in place of the word assessment there as it does in section where it says that after cancellation of assessment in certain circumstances the Income tax Officer shall proceed to make a fresh assessment in accordance with the provisions of section or as in section where it says that the appellate authority may set aside the assessment direct the Income tax Officer to make a fresh assessment By way of curiosity I looked up the provisions of the Income tax Amendment Bill For the above reasons I am of the opinion that both the questions referred to this court should be answered in the negative and against the assessee In accordance with the opinion of the majority of the judges who have heard the reference the two questions referred to this court are answered in the negative and against the assessee
