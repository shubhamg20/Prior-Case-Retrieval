On April respondent No filed an application in the Court of the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act for a direction to the petitioner under Section of the Act to pay a sum of Rs An objection was taken on behalf of the petitioner that the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act had no jurisdiction to decide the applications of respondent No in view of the contentions raised by the petitioner and the relationship of master and servant between them came to an end or in other words after February there was no subsisting contract of service between <ORG> The question which arises for our consideration is whether looking to the terms of the Payment of Wages Act iv of it is competent to the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act to direct payment of wages when it is disputed that there is a subsisting contract of service between the employer and his employee Is it open to the <ORG> to decide whether a contract of service has been properly and validly terminated Is it open to him to decide that the dismissal of a servant by his master is wrongful In order to decide this question it is necessary to look at the purpose of the Payment of Wages Act and also its general provisions Now such person is the person employed and any sum which is payable by reason of the employment of such person coming to an end is also wages for the purpose of this Act Then Section provides for responsibility for payment of wages and it deals with cases where the employer is directly responsible and cases where a person other than an employer may be made responsible for payment of wages Then we come to Section which is the section directly in question and that provides <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette appoint any Commissioner for Workmen Compensation or other officer with experience as a Judge of <ORG> or as a stipendiary Magistrate to be the authority to hear and decide for any specified area all claims arising out of deductions from the wages or delay in payment of the wages of persons employed or paid in that area It must be borne in mind that Section ousts the jurisdiction of civil Courts in respect of all claims which can be entertained by the <ORG> under Section Therefore if there is delay in reference to the paint of time indicated in Section then an employee is entitled to make a grievance of that fact and the <ORG> is entitled to order wages which have not been paid and which should be paid in accordance with Section Farther there is jurisdiction to adjudicate with regard to deductions from the wages and this must again be read with reference to Section which permits certain deductions and which makes it illegal for the employer to make deductions other than those provided in the Act There is also a provision for appeal under Section but that right is restricted to cases where the total sum directed to be paid by way of wages and compensation exceeds Rs In cases where the payment is less than Es there is no right of appeal at all and the decision of the <ORG> is final Now what is contended by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the <ORG> and supported by Mr <NAME> on behalf of respondent No is that it is competent to the <ORG> to decide whether a contract of service was terminated or not because if he comes to the conclusion that the contract of service was not validly terminated then the employee continues in service and what the <ORG> directs the employer to pay his wages within the meaning of the definition in the Act In this case there is no delay on the part of the petitioner to pay wages He has refused to pay wages rightly or wrongly contending that respondent is not his employee he has dismissed him and therefore nothing is due to him If the <ORG> wanted to confer such a jurisdiction upon the <ORG> it would certainly have done so by appropriate language Jurisdiction must be expressly given and we must find from the language of the statute itself that there is express ouster of the jurisdiction of the civil <ORG> and an express conferment of such jurisdiction upon the special tribunal set up under the Act It would also be open to him to determine whether a person has been employed or not because the question of contract of employment and the terms of the contract can only arise provided the person seeking relief was employed It has been suggested by Mr <NAME> that this construction of the statute really confines the jurisdiction of the <ORG> only to cases where wages are admitted and Mr <NAME> says that if the <ORG> intended that the <ORG> should only try cases of admitted wages there was nothing easier than for the <ORG> to have so stated Therefore the jurisdiction of the <ORG> really is to determine the terms of the contract in so far as they relate to the payment of wages and in so far as he has to decide the liability of the employer to pay wages under the terms of the contract Mr <NAME> has contended that this petition is not maintainable inasmuch as a specific legal remedy was open to the petitioner and he should have availed himself of that remedy rather than come to this Court on a petition for a writ of certiorari and reliance is placed on Article of the Constitution which confers upon the <ORG> powers of superintendence not only over all <ORG> but also over all tribunals throughout the territories in relation to which the <ORG> exercises jurisdiction We have already taken the view that the superintendence of the <ORG> is not confined to administrative superintendence it also includes judicial superintendence and undoubtedly the <ORG> has power to correct any decision of a tribunal within its jurisdiction through its powers of superintendence But in order that a petition for a writ of certiorari would not lie the petitioner must have a specific legal remedy and specific legal remedy in this context can only mean that he must have a right to approach a Court and he must have a right to a remedy if his case was just A litigant may approach the <ORG> but he has no right to do so nor has he a right to a remedy because the <ORG> may refuse a remedy under Article It cannot be said under the circumstances of the case that he had an alternative specific legal remedy open to him which he should have availed of before he asked for a prerogative writ We therefore order that respondent should pay the costs of the petition
