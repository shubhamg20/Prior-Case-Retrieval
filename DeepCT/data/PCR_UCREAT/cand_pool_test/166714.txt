This revisional application was filed by the petitioners <NAME> and five others for quashing the proceedings against them pending in the Court of <NAME> Magistrate First Class Suri On th December one Sheikh <NAME> lodged a first information report at Nanoor against persons including the six petitioners alleging that in the early morning of that day a bullock belonging to one <NAME> had damaged gram plants belonging to one <NAME> and <NAME> for impounding that <NAME> asked for the release of the bullock and there was a quarrel whereupon fifteen or sixteen persons including the six petitioners assaulted <NAME> On the st of May when the Magistrate was to peruse police papers for considering whether a charge or charges should be framed against the persons sent up the informant filed a petition stating that there was a prima facie case against the six petitioners and that the police wrongfully refused to send them up The learned Magistrate then perused the police papers and heard both sides and he decided that there was prima facie evidence against the six petitioners also and so by an order dated th July he summoned these six petitioners under Section of the Indian Penal Code Mr <NAME> appearing for the petitioners has urged that the learned Magistrate had no jurisdiction to summon the petitioners who had not been sent up by the police along with the charge sheet The learned Magistrate in the course of his order dated th July observed that when a Magistrate takes cognizance under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code on a police report he takes cognizance of the offence and not merely of the particular persons named in the charge sheet and therefore the Magistrate can issue process against other persons who appear to him on the basis of the report and other materials placed before him to be concerned in the commission of the offence In the particular case after perusing the statements under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code the learned Magistrate observed that more than one witness having named the six persons as concerned in the unlawful assembly which assaulted the men on the side of the informant and rescued the bullock prima facie there was a good case under Section of the Indian Penal Code against the six petitioners and so he summoned them The view taken by the learned Magistrate finds support in the observations made in the case <NAME> Emperor Cri LJ AIR Sind which is a Full Bench case of <ORG> Sind It was observed in that case as follows Under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence and not of the offender Once a Magistrate has taken cognizance of a case and proceeds to deal with the evidence brought before him it is his duty to see that justice is done with regard to any other person that may be suspected of being concerned in the offence Mr <NAME> has sought to distinguish the case by pointing out that in the case which the Full Bench of the Judicial Commissioners of Sind were considering the evidence had been recorded by the Magistrate and on the basis of that evidence the Magistrate considered that there was a good Prima facie case against certain other persons not sent up with the charge sheet and the learned Magistrate summoned those persons has urged that the Magistrate whether the original Magistrate who takes cognizance of the offence or a transferee Magistrate gets jurisdiction to summon other accused not originally summoned or not sent up by the police with the charge sheet only after the evidence had been recorded in Court and that by merely looking at the police papers the Magistrate cannot summon person not sent up with the charge sheet It is true that under the procedure for the trial of the warrant cases before the amendment of the Criminal Procedure Code in the Magistrate had to record the evidence before he could decide whether there was a prima facie case against anybody including also the persons sent up by the police along with the charge sheet The Magistrate could not act on the basis of the statements recorded by the police under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code For framing charge against the accused sent up as well as for deciding whether any other additional persons were concerned in the offence the Magistrate had to act on the evidence which he himself had recorded Under Section A of the Criminal Procedure Code the Magistrate after consideration of the documents referred to under Section and hearing the prosecution and the defence has to decide whether a charge has been prima facie established against any of the accused and if he is satisfied on that point he will frame a charge Thus before examination of any witness by perusing the statements recorded by the police under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code and the other documents referred to under Section like the first information report and the dying declaration if any and the medical report the Magistrate has to decide whether there is a prima facie case against the persons sent up by the police along with the charge sheet It is clear that at the same time the Magistrate can also decide on the basis of the same materials whether there is a prima facie case against other persons not sent up by the police and if the Magistrate is so statisfied certainly the Magistrate is entitled to summon them and place them on trial along with tne other persons sent up by the police The Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence on the police report or charge sheet for as has been repeatedly held in many decided cases the Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence and not of the offender and having taken cognizance of the offence on the police report if he summons additional persons not sent up by the police he is still ndt taking cognizance under Clause of Section but acting under the cognizance which he has already taken under Clause Mr <NAME> has referred to a decision of <ORG> of this Court in Kashemali Gomasta The <ORG> Crl In such a case there was no charge sheet on which the Magistrate could take cognizance under Clause of Section of the Criminal Procedure Code He must treat the naraji petition as a complaint and examine the complainant on oath and only then he would have jurisdiction to summon persons against whom he may consider that there is a prima facie case The case cited therefore does not support the proposition that even when the Magistrate has taken cognizance of a case on a charge sheet submitted by the police the Magistrate cannot after examination of the statements recorded under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code summon additional accused We must therefore hold that the learned Magistrate was right in the view he took that he was entitled to summon additional accused against whom he considered that there was good evidence after perusal of the statements recorded by the police under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code and the other documents referred to in Section of the Criminal Procedure Code
