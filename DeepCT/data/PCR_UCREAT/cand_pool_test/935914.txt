The plaintiff in this case seeks to set aside the decree passed in Original Suit No of in favour of the defendant his wife awarding to her a maintenance of ten rupees per mensem I have no hesitation in finding that the plaintiff has made out his case As to the relief prayed it has been contended on behalf of the defendant that she is entitled under any circumstances to at least bare maintenance To hold otherwise would be contrary to all morality and principle and I have little doubt that before a decree for maintenance is given to a wife who has once been guilty of infidelity she must show not only that at the time of the plaint and the trial she was leading a chaste life but also that she had done so for a sufficient period previously so as clearly to lead to the conclusion that she has completely renounced her immoral course and that in fact she is a reformed woman But whether even among Sudras the existence of an illegitimate issue born to the wife before she changed her life would not under certain circumstances be an obstacle in the way of her claiming even bare maintenance is rather a delicate question However this may be and although no doubt a mere false defence by itself would not deprive the party setting it up of her legal right the attempt which the defendant has made in this case to fasten upon the plaintiff as his legitimate issue the fruit of adultery is clear proof that she is far from a penitent wife who may be allowed to seek the benefit of the humane provision mentioned in the texts referred to in <NAME> Ganga I Bom
