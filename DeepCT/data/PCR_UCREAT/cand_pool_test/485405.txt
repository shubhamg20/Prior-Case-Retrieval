The appeal filed by the assessee was dismissed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner The <ORG> has however allowed the second appeal filed by the assessee and has referred the following questions to this court Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the sums of Rs The submission of Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the revenue is that these receipts are capital gains in the hands of the assessee for the liquidator has paid these sums out of the assets of the company but there is no merit in this contention The Income tax Act of which repealed the Indian Income tax Act came into operation on st April and thereafter the assessee filed his return of income for the assessment year And Section of this Act provides as follows Notwithstanding the repeal of the Indian Income tax Act where a return of income is filed after the commencement of this Act otherwise than in pursuance of a notice under Section of the repealed Act by any person for the assessment year ending on the st day of March or any earlier year the assessment of that person for that year shall be made in accordance with the procedure specified in this Act The submission of Mr <NAME> is that as the assessee has filed the return after the commencement of this Act the Income tax Officer must compute the total income in accordance with the procedure specified in this Act as enjoined by Section and while making the assessment under Section of this Act he must treat this receipt as capital gains under Section of the Act though it is not a capital gain under Section of the Indian Income tax Act But there is no merit in the second limb of his contention It has been rightly contended on behalf of the assessee that to accept the contention of Mr <NAME> is to amend Section of the Indian Income tax Act by Section of the Income tax Act with retrospective effect and therefore we must reject the contention of Mr <NAME> Moreover the revenue had no right to tax this receipt and it cannot be said that by the repeal of the Income tax Act a new right has been created in its favour by these two sections of the Income tax Act We do not find anything in this case which can lend any assistance to the contention of Mr <NAME> Therefore this case has no bearing on the question involved before us for we are concerned with the substantive law of the year of assessment
