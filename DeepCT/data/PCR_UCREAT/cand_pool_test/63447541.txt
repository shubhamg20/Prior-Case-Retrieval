The proceedings for acquisition of land of the appellants commenced with the State of Rajasthan issuing notification dated th October under Section of the said Act proposing to acquire the land described in the said notification which was situated in various villages in and around the city of Jaipur By this notification information was given to all the concerned owners and persons interested in the land which was sought to be acquired to file any objections which they had against the proposed acquisition It was stated therein that the land mentioned in the said notification was needed under the said Act for the improvement of urban areas and this notification was issued after considering those objections which had been filed by the interested persons Vide a common judgment dated st October a Single Judge of <ORG> dismissed writ petitions and upheld the acquisition of the land which had been made Appeals were filed against the said judgment and a Division Bench of <ORG> dismissed the same on th December The main contention which has been urged on behalf of the appellants is that no award had been made within two years of the notification issued under Section of the said Act Section of the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act contains provision for compulsory acquisition of the land and the same reads as under could no longer be sustained Where on representation from the Trust or otherwise it appears to <ORG> that any land is required for the purpose of improvement or for any other purpose under this Act <ORG> may acquire such land by publishing in the official Gazette a notice specifying the particular purpose for which such land is required and stating that <ORG> had decided to acquire the land in pursuance of this section Every such objection to the notice given under Sub section shall be made in writing to the Officer on Special Duty or any other officer appointed by <ORG> for the purpose Such officer shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader and after hearing all such objections and after making such enquiry as he deems necessary shall submit the case for the decision of <ORG> together with the record of the proceedings held by him and a report containing his recommendations on the objections Thereafter <ORG> may pass such orders as it deems fit If any person refuses or fails to comply with an order made under Sub section <ORG> may take possession of the land and may for that purpose use such force as may be necessary hereinafter referred to as the Amending Act with a view to amend the provisions of the Principal Act and to provide for certain transitory and special procedure for the disposal of pending and present proceeding as well as payment of compensation interest etc Thereupon the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Amendment and Validation Act thereinafter referred to as the Validating Act was passed which received the assent of the President on th March A new Section A was inserted in the Principal Act which contained a transitory provision and which reads as follows A Transitory provisions or pending matters relating to acquisition of land notwithstanding anything otherwise contained in Sub section of Section where in any matter relating to the acquisition of land pending on the date of commencement of the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Amendment Act hereinafter in this section referred to as the date of commencement an action thing or order has been taken done or made under and in accordance with the provisions of this Act as it stood before the date of commencement such action thing or order shall not be re opened or reviewed or be liable to be challenged on the ground that such action thing or order was at variance with that provided in the Land Acquisition Act Central Act I of hereinafter in this section referred to as the Land Acquisition Act subject however that any further proceedings action or order in such matter conducted taken or made on or after the date of commencement shall subject to the other provisions of this section be made under and in accordance with the Land Acquisition Act Where any land has prior to the date of commencement vested in <ORG> or its possession has been taken in accordance with the provisions of this Act as it stood before the date of commencement such vesting or possession of land shall not be liable to be challenged on the ground that no amount of compensation was tendered and paid in accordance with Sub section A of Section of the Land Acquisition Act subject however that such amount shall be tendered and paid within a period of six months from the date of commencement In determining the amount of compensation to be awarded in a matter pending on the date of commencement the market value of the land at the date on which the notice was published in the official gazette under Clause of Sub section of Section as it stood before the date of commencement shall be taken into consideration An appeal filed under Section or Section or a dispute referred under Section or Section and pending on the date of commencement shall be decided having regard to the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act According to this section before publishing a notice under Sub section a notice is issued to the owners of land and other persons who are interested to show cause why <ORG> should not acquire the These objections are to be in writing and an opportunity of being heard in person or through pleader has to be afforded by the Officer on Special Duty to the objectors It is after complying with the provisions of Sub sections and that <ORG> can issue a notification under Sub section of Section acquiring the land specified in the notification for the purpose of improvement or for any other purpose under the Act Neither the amendments nor the extension of the Central Act can have the effect in law or otherwise of divesting the State of ownership of the land which had already been vested in it Just as publication of a notification under Section vests the land in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances as provided by Section similarly when possession of land is taken under Section the land vests absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances A question arose before this Court that if there is a non compliance with the provisions of Section A and an award is not made in respect to the land so acquired would the acquisition proceedings lapse In <NAME> <ORG> of this Court held that once possession had been taken under Section and the land vested in the <ORG> then the <ORG> could not withdraw from acquisition under Section and the provisions of Section A were not attracted and therefore the acquisition proceedings would not lapse on failure to make an award within the period prescribed therein It was further held that non compliance of Section A regarding part payment of compensation before taking possession would also not render the possession illegal and entitle the <ORG> to withdraw from acquisition In view of the aforesaid ratio it follows that the provisions of Section A are not attracted in the present case and even if it be assumed that the award has not been passed within the stipulated period the acquisition of land does not come to an end It was contended by the learned counsel for the respondents that the <ORG> had complied with all the legal requirements in the present case In any case non compliance with the provisions of this sub section will not in any way affect the vesting of the land which has already taken place with the publication of the notification dated th April The provisions of Sub section of Section A of the Validating Act are analogous to Section A of the Land Acquisition Act and as held in the aforesaid decisions of this <ORG> non compliance with the said provisions will not in any way amount to the divesting of acquisition which has taken place or the acquisition proceedings having lapsed There is also no merit in the contention of the learned counsel for the appellants that the decision of the Division Bench of <ORG> rendered in in <NAME> case WLC supra can in any way affect the present proceedings With utmost respect it is difficult to agree with the observations made and view expressed by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra as regards the decision of the <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra It had been contended that land could not be acquired under Section of the Act unless and until there was a scheme for improvement of the urban area under the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act The power of the State <ORG> to acquire land under the Act has been designed to meet the scheme of the Act Where on a representation from the <ORG> or otherwise it appears to the State <ORG> that any land in required for the purpose of improvement or for any other purpose under the Act it can acquire such land by issuing a notification under Section of the Act It is thus clear that the State <ORG> has the power to acquire land either for the execution of the schemes framed by the <ORG> under Chapter of the Actor for any other public purpose under the Act The notification issued by the State <ORG> under Sub section of Section of the Act specifically states that the land was being acquired for the construction of residential commercial and administrative buildings The effect of this is that even if there is no scheme prepared or finalised under a <ORG> or Urban Improvement Act acquisition could be validly made under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act for a public purpose or under the Rajasthan Urban Improvement Act for the purpose of improvement or for any other purpose under the Act For the aforesaid reasons we do not find any merit in these appeals and the same are dismissed with costs The appeal is dismissed with costs
