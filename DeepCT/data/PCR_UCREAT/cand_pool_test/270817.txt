The plaintiffs have now filed the suit out of which this second appeal arises praying for two reliefs vis for declaring that the plaint schedule offices rights and perquisites lapse by survivorship to the plaintiffs and the defendants and on the death of the said Vedavyasa <NAME> on th November and as a consequential relief for directing a the first and second defendants to enjoy the plaint schedule offices rights and perquisites with the plaintiffs in equal moities by turns or in any other manner the Court may deem fit to order giving necessary directions therefor to the first second and third defendants at when speaking of a trustee of a temple their Lordships of the Privy Council observed It has also to be remembered that a trust in the sense in which the expression is used in English law is unknown to the Hindu system pure and simple in no case is the property conveyed to or vested in him nor is he a trustee in the English sense of the term No doubt these observations were made with reference to a religious office but it has also been extended to the case of a bare dharmakarthaship without any emoluments attached thereto In such a case where the office vests by descent in a number of persons in order to avoid confusion or an unseemly scramble it is not unusual and it is certainly not improper for the parties interested to arrange among themselves for the due execution of the functions belonging to the office in turn or in some settled order and sequence There is no breach of trust in such an arrangement nor any improper delegation of the duties of a trustee where a widow of a divided member of a family was allowed to succeed to the management of a charity in thatKattalai in a temple His Lordship Chief Justice Wallis made the following observation It was next argued by Mr <NAME> that as the plaintiff is now the only male member in the junior branch he is entitled to the right to the exclusion of the females that the vesting of the management in accordance with rules of inheritance applicable to private property must from the very nature of the right be subject to the condition that the devolution in the ordinary line of descent is not inconsistent with or opposed to the purpose the founder had in view in establishing the worship Once it is recognised that the office of trustee is property to which the rules of inheritance governing ordinary property are applicable and it has been applied where the office has vested in a single person on principle the same rule must govern the devolution of the turn of office which has become vested on division between the various members of the family Mr <NAME> relied on a number of decisions in support of his contention that this principle should not apply to the case of a bare trusteeship Further their Lordships did not decide the question and the actual decision was rested on the facts peculiar to the foundation in question Sir <NAME> observed It is unnecessary however to decide whether there is a general rule for the devolution of the management of charities of this class because in their Lordships view there is sufficient indication in the documents and surrounding circumstances of this case that a devolution of the management to the heirs of the original donee is inconsistent with the purposes of the founder when he created the endowments The decision while it lays down that a renunciation or a waiver of a trust should not be permitted enunciates the following principle If it was a mere arrangement for the more convenient management of the choultry reserving to the plaintiff brothers their right of control and if necesssary of resumption of actual management then it might be said that there would be no interference with the supposed will of the founder and that the arrangement would be lawful To that extent it seems clear that any co parcener jointly entitled to management may waive his rights It is always subject to the implied condition that the resumption of actual management can be availed of either by consent of parties or through <ORG> and there is no question of divesting themselves of all control over the offices In this case the members of the family have acted upon the arrangement for nearly half a century and there is no reason why the arrangement should not be held binding on the representatives of the various branches observed that the arrangement will be binding upon the parties thereto and their representatives till modified either by common consent or in some manner known to law
