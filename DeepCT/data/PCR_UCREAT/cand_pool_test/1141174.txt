CASE NO Appeal civil of PETITIONER State of RESPONDENT <NAME> Others DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH Sinha Naolekar JUDGMENT JUDGMENT I CIVIL APPEAL NOS of CIVIL APPEAL NO of and CIVIL APPEAL NO of <NAME> The jurisdiction of <ORG> to issue a direction for framing a scheme for regularisation of the employees of <ORG> for short the <ORG> is in question in this batch of appeals which arise out of judgments and orders passed by <ORG> of Judicature at Allahabad in the writ petitions filed by the private respondents either dismissing or allowing the same ACT The legislature of the State of Uttar Pradesh enacted The Uttar Pradesh Krishi Utpadan Mandi Adhiniyam for short the Act Section provides for the constitution of the <ORG> The following course should be adopted to terminate such appointments a There is no legal impediment in terminating the service of the employee concerned after cancelling the appointments which have been made without any created sanctioned post but the reason therefor shall have to be recorded in the order There is no legal impediment in terminating the service after cancelling the appointments of such persons as did not have educational qualifications prescribed for the post concerned but the reason therefor should be recorded in the order In case no procedure is mentioned in the appointments order their service should be terminated after giving either notice or pay in lieu thereof in regard to irregular appointments made on the post of various categories in <ORG> there has been no requirement of prescribed procedure rules In such circumstances the proposal sent to <ORG> A Division Bench of <ORG> <ORG> put its seal of approval to the order of the learned Single Judge by a judgment and order dated in similar writ petitions filed by other dismissed employees SUBMISSIONS On behalf of the Board Submission of Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Board are i In terms of the statutory mandate contained in Section of the Act the Board was bound by the directions issued by the <ORG> ii The appointments having been made in utter disregard of the mandatory provisions of the Services Regulations and the Establishment Regulations the employees did not derive any legal right to continue in the said posts On behalf of the <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the <ORG> of Uttar Pradesh submitted that from the records it would appear that the <ORG> adopted a known criterion for cancellation of appointment of such employees who were in the last slots namely to Such orders of termination ensured that the principles of last come first go basis are followed and the employees are paid one month salary in lieu of notice as also days wages for each completed year of service by way of compensation On behalf of the Writ Petitioners Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondents on the other hand urged i that the appointments of the employees cannot be said to be illegal as the provisions contained in the respective regulations apply to appointments in regular cadre ii There is no embargo in appointing employees on adhoc basis in exigency of service or on work charge basis recognised in the regulations in view of the fact that such employees do not derive the benefits which are granted to the regular employees iii Section of the Act had no application in the facts of the case in view of the fact that appointment of adhoc employees is not a matter which would come within the purview of the functions of the <ORG> as envisaged under Section and of the Act iv By reason of purported directions issued under Section the rights and privileges granted to the employees under other statutes cannot be taken away ix The Board having adopted a resolution to regularise the services of its employees there was no need to obtain any approval from the <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of another writ applicant submitted that institutions of the market committees and the <ORG> having their activities principally in rural areas the human problem should not be ignored as without such daily wagers or adhoc employees functions of the statutory body may have to be stopped Mrs <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of <NAME> supplemented the arguments of Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> contending that there was no material before the government for issuing the impugned instructions viii The principles of natural justice have been ignored in terminating the services of such employees and thus the orders terminating the services of the writ petitioners were bad in law <ORG> shall within six months resolve and formulate a policy to deal with the terms of their service by giving due consideration to its earlier resolution regarding regularization of their services However as noticed supra <ORG> of the same Court in its judgment dated opined that the appointments having been made in violation of the statutory regulations the appointees must be held to have entered into service through backdoor and in that view of the matter the <ORG> has the requisite jurisdiction to issue a direction in terms of Section of the Act Section of the said Act provides for establishment of a Market <ORG> Fund Section of the Act occurring in Chapter IV provides for appointments of officers and servants of <ORG> and their conditions of services Section A empowers the <ORG> to appoint such officers and servants as it considers necessary for efficient performance of its functions on such terms and conditions as may be provided for in the regulations made by the <ORG> Section provides for the powers and functions of the <ORG> Section of the Act empowers <ORG> to issue directions in the following terms In the discharge of its functions the Board shall be guided by such directions on question of policy as may be given to it by <ORG> Section thereof empowers the <ORG> to make regulations with the previous approval of <ORG> which shall be subject to the said Act and the rules made thereunder Section of the Act confers power upon the <ORG> to call for the proceedings of a <ORG> for the purpose of satisfying itself as regard legality or propriety of a decision or an order or orders and pass order thereon as it may deem fit if it is of the opinion that the decision or order of the <ORG> should be modified annulled or reversed Proviso appended to Section provides that no bye law other than a bye law made by adopting draft or model bye law suggested by the <ORG> shall be valid unless approved by it Section of the Act provides for rule making power Such appointment made by the <ORG> under sub section of Section of the Act for those posts wherefor the <ORG> is the appointing authority shall be intimated within days of the date of such appointments to the Directors or to such officer as may be authorised by the Director in this behalf Regulation empowers the appointing authority to determine the number of vacancies in all the classes to be filled during the course of the year as also the number of vacancies to be reserved for candidates belonging to Schedules Castes and Scheduled Tribes and other categories under Regulation Section of the Act however imposes further restriction on the power of <ORG> by limiting the annual expenditure made in this regard not exceeding of the total annual receipt of the <ORG> The said regulations provide for detailed procedure for appointment and the terms and conditions therefor Submission of the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the employees is that the procedures prescribed by reason of the Regulations are applicable to the regular employees The question which however falls for consideration is as to whether any appointment can be made de hors the provisions of the Act and the rules It would therefore not be correct to contend that <ORG> or the <ORG> have the jurisdiction to appoint anybody on daily wages work charged or on part time basis de hors the rules It implies that although <ORG> may have power to make appointments such appointments can be made in relation to the posts created therefor by the <ORG> wherefor requisite intimation has to be given to the Director or the officer authorised in this behalf Such directions were not shown to have been issued pursuant to any decision taken by a competent authority in terms of the Rules of Executive Business of the <ORG> framed under Article of the Constitution of India In that view of the matter if a policy decision is taken by the <ORG> in regard to the appointment or terms and conditions of the servants in the event regulations made in this behalf do not contain any provisions such policy decision must conform to the directions of the <ORG> issued in that behalf if any While granting such advice the <ORG> had taken into consideration the last segment of employment If such directions had been confined to the period to on following certain basic principles like last come first go basis we do not see any reason as to why the same would be termed to be arbitrary or discriminatory The principle of natural justice would be attracted only when the services of some persons are terminated by way of a punitive measure or thereby a stigma is attached It cannot be put in a straitjacket formula It cannot be applied in a vacuum without reference to the relevant facts and circumstances of the case It is the <ORG> again that lays down the conditions of service subject of course to a law made by the appropriate legislature This Court besides the proposals made therein issued certain other directions That power may have its source in Article Therefore the present case touches the power of the <ORG> to make rules under Article of the nature impeached here Counsel on behalf of the respondent contended that regularisation would mean conferring the quality of permanence on the appointment whereas counsel on behalf of the <ORG> contended that regularisation did dot mean permanence but that it was a case of regularisation of the rules under Article To accede to such a proposition would be to introduce a new head of appointment in defiance of rules or it may have the effect of setting at naught the rules OTHER CONTENTIONS Mr <NAME> has placed strong reliance upon the provisions of the Regularisation of Adhoc Appointments on Posts Outside the Purview of the Public Service Commission Rules purported to have been framed by the State in pursuance of the provisions of Clause of Article of the Constitution of India ii possessed requisite qualifications prescribed for regular appointment as the time of such ad hoc appointment and iii has completed or as the case may be after he has completed three years service shall be considered for regular appointments in permanent or temporary vacancy as may be available on the basis of his record and suitability before any regular appointment is made in such vacancy in accordance with the relevant rules or orders In making regular appointments under these rules reservations for the candidates belonging to the Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes Backward Classes and other categories shall be made in accordance with the orders of the <ORG> in force at the time of recruitment Submission of Mr <NAME> to take recourse to Regulation of the Establishment Regulations providing that in regard to the matters not specifically covered by the rules persons appointed to the services of the <ORG> shall be governed by the regulations applicable generally to the <ORG> employees is misconceived The said submission of Mr <NAME> is furthermore inconsistent with his submissions as noticed supra that even in terms of Section of the Act <ORG> had no power to issue any direction governing appointment in respect of terms and conditions of the services of the employees We have therefore no doubt in our mind that Regulation of the Establishment Regulations which is in Chapter VII of the Act refers to only such regulations and orders which would be applicable to the regular employees The <ORG> and the <ORG> were bound to take steps in accordance with law It is also true as has been contended by Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> that the power to create posts was with the <ORG> but the <ORG> did not exercise its power nor the competent authorities of <ORG> proceeded to appoint employees on the sweet will of the concerned authorities without in any way bothering for the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder A contention has been raised by Mrs <NAME> that there was no material before the <ORG> for issuing the impugned instructions insofar as the financial position vis vis the strength of the employees had been taken into consideration It is not necessary for us to go into the aforementioned question inasmuch as we are herein concerned with the legality and or validity of the impugned orders of termination of services and the same having not been done the appointment of the concerned employees were wholly illegal and without jurisdiction and thus void and of no effect We however direct the <ORG> and <ORG> to fill up all existing vacancies strictly in accordance with law as expeditiously as possible and preferably within six months from date In the offers of appointment which may be issued to such temporary or ad hoc employees it shall be made clear that their appointments would be ad hoc in nature and the same shall be co terminus with the appointment of regular employees In the result Civil Appeal arising out of SLP No of is dismissed and other civil appeals filed by the <ORG> and the State of Uttar Pradesh as also civil appeal arising out of SLP No of filed by the <ORG> are allowed
