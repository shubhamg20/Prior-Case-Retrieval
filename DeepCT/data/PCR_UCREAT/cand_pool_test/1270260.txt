Being informed of the opening of such credit <ORG> London sent intimation to <ORG> Madras and the latter in its turn used to pass on the intimation by letter addressed to the assesses company It was common ground between the Income tax department and assessee company that the income arose at the place where the sales took place It was contended on behalf of the department that the sales must be regarded as having taken place in British India because i the price and delivery of goods were on terms ii that in the European contracts the insurance if any was to be the concern of the buyers iii that the payment of the percent or percent as the case may be was made in Madras by <ORG> Madras and as on these facts the property passed at Madras he sales were completed in British India Held repelling the contention that upon the terms of the contracts in question and the course of dealings between the parties he property in the goods could not have passed to the buyer earlier than the date when the bill of exchange was accepted by the <ORG> in London and the documents were delivered by the assesses company agent <ORG> London to the duyers <ORG> and this admittedly always took place in London and in the promises the sales took place outside British India and ex hypothesi the profits derived from such sales arose Outside British India Held further that the contention submitted on behalf of the department that irrespective of the place where the sales may have taken place the profits derived from such sales were received in Madras as after shipment the assessee company through its managing agent in Madras prepared provisional invoices and drew bills of exchange for percent or percent as the case may be of the amount of such invoices and handed over the same to <ORG> Madras and received the amount of the bill of exchange from them in Madras and that the receipt of this payment by the assessee company was really the receipt of the price of the goods and amounted to receipt of profits in Madras was also devoid of force because the price was paid on behalf of the buyers by their respective London <ORG>s in London to <ORG> London which was the agent of the assessee company The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal from the judgment pronounced by <ORG> at Madras on the th March on a consolidated reference by <ORG> under section of the Income tax Act whereby <ORG> answered in the affirmative both the referred questions which were expressed in the following terms Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the profits derived by the assessee company from sales made to European and American buyers arose outside British India Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the profits derived by the assessee company from sales made to European and American buyers were received outside British India The above Questions of law arose out of proceedings for the assessment to income tax of the respondent <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the asseessee company for the years and Being informed of the opening of such credit <ORG> London sent intimation to <ORG> Madras and the latter in its turn used to pass on the intimation by letter addressed to the assessee company The <ORG> by its order dated the nd January came to the conclusion that the sales took place outside British India and that the money in respect of such sales was also received by the agent of the It appears from the statement of case as also from the order of <ORG> that it was agreed between the department and the assessee company that the income arose at the place wherever that be where the sales took place The point for determination therefore is as to where the sales took place Skipping over sections to which deal with contract of sale of specific goods we come to section which lays down that where there is a contract for the sale of unascertained or future goods by description and goods of that description and in a deliverable state are unconditionally appropriated to the contract either by the seller with the assent of the buyer or by the buyer with the assent of the seller the property in the goods thereupon passes to the buyer This argument however overlooks the important word unconditionally used in the section This is further elaborated by section which provides that where there is a contract for the sale of specific goods or where goods are subsequently appropriated to the contract the seller may by the The facts found in this case are that the assessee company shipped the goods under bill of lading issued in its own name It is not necessary for us to express any opinion on this extreme contention In the premises <ORG> as well as <ORG> were quite correct in holding that the sales took place outside British India and ex hypothesis the profits derived from such sales arose outside British India taken place the profits derived from such sales were received in Madras He draws our attention to the terms of payment in the European contract and to the letter of intimation of the opening of the credit sent by <ORG> Madras to the assessee company which have been quoted in part in the earlier part of this judgment This is made further clear by the latter part of the letter where <ORG> Madras expressed their willingness at their option to negotiate the drafts drawn in terms of the arrangement provided that the documents were in order The concluding sentence of that letter whereby <ORG> Madras disown any responsibility in respect of the advice clearly militates against the suggestion of the learned Solicitor General The true position is very clearly put by Lord <NAME> in The Prinz Adalbert When a shipper takes his draft not as yet accepted but accompanied by a bill of lading indorsed in this way and discounts it with a banker he makes himself liable on the instrument as drawer and he further makes the goods which the bill of lading A There is no dispute that the balance of the price ascertained after weighment and assay and deducting the amount paid on the bill of exchange was similarly received in London by <ORG> London on behalf of the assessee company For reasons stated above this appeal must stand dismissed with costs and we order accordingly
