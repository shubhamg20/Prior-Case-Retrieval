This appeal is directed against a judgment in an application under Section of the Arbitration Act Application No of in CS It is conceded before us and it appears that it was so conceded before the learned single Judge that the above clause stipulated an arbitration and the winding up accounts etc <ORG> has however accepted the contention of the plaintiff respondent that the application under Section of the Act has been filed beyond the time fixed under the Act and is therefore not maintainable It is said however that after appearance the defendants applied for time for filing the written statement and before filing the written statement they filed the application for stay under Section of the Act Section of the Act has made a specific provision that at any time before filing a written statement or taking any other steps in the proceeding any party to an arbitration agreement or any person claiming under him in respect of any matter agreed to be referred to arbitration may apply to the judicial authority before which the proceedings are pending to stay the proceedings <ORG> observed as under To enable a defendant to obtain an order staying the suit apart from other conditions mentioned in Section of the Arbitration Act he is required to present his application praying for stay before filing his written statement or taking any other step in the suit proceedings The question is whether any other step was taken in the proceeding as contemplated by Section and it is this point with which we are directly concerned in the present case However a Bench of three Judges of <ORG> has taken a view that Section of the Act prescribes a mode and method of enforcing the arbitration agreement when a party to the agreement has filed a suit for breach of the agreement and the other party to the agreement is dragged to the <ORG> by staying the suit at the instance of the other party so dragged to the <ORG> and the first party consequently would be forced to honour the arbitration agreement But before the other party to the arbitration agreement is entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement by stay of the suit it must disclose its unequivocal intention to abide by the agreement and therefore Section obliges such a party to ask for stay of the proceedings before such a party takes any steps which may unequivocally indicate the intention to waive the benefit of the arbitration agreement Once such unequivocal intention is declared or abandonment of the right to claim the benefit of the agreement becomes manifest from the conduct such party would then not be entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement because there is thus a breach of the agreement by both the parties disentitling both to claim any benefit of the arbitration agreement Once the <ORG> is invited to adjudicate upon the dispute there is no question of then enforcing an arbitration agreement by forcing the parties to resort to the forum of their choice as set out in the arbitration agreement After saying as above on the underlying intendment of Section of the Act <ORG> in this judgment has proceeded to examine what other steps did the legislature contemplate as being taken in the proceedings which would disentitle the party to the suit from obtaining stay of the proceedings which would have the effect of enforcing the arbitration agreement and has said General words taking any other steps in the proceedings just follow the specific expression filing a written statement and both are used for achieving the same purpose This specific word is followed by general words taking any other steps in the proceedings <ORG> has in this judgment then said Having thus critically examined both on principle and precedent the meaning to be given to the expression taking steps in the proceedings we are clearly of the view that unless the step alleged to have been taken by the party seeking to enforce arbitration agreement is such as would display an unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit and acquiesce in the method of resolution of dispute adopted by the other party namely filing of the suit and thereby indicate that it has abandoned its right under the arbitration agreement to get the dispute resolved by arbitration any other step would not disentitle the party from seeking relief under Section Thus it is clear from what has been stated as the law on the subject by <ORG> that there is no authority as such for making an application under Section of the Act only until the time prescribed for the filing of the written statement Taking any other steps in the proceedings has been interpreted by <ORG> also to mean that it should be such as would display an unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit and to give up the right to have the matter disposed of by arbitration and thereby to indicate that it has abandoned its right under the arbitration agreement to get the dispute resolved by the arbitration There is also no intention to keep or fix the time limited to the statutory declarations of the period of filing the written statement but actual filing of the written statement or taking any other step which may give the basis to hold that the defendant has intended to give up his right under the agreement Order Rule of the Original Side Rules of this Court says If the defendant intends to defend the suit he shall within the period limited by the summons served on him file in Court a written statement setting out the grounds of his defence in the form prescribed by the Code and also stating his address for service Provided that a defendant may file his written statement within a further period of five days if the plaintiff or his advocate consents and signifies such consent by endorsement on the written statement The costs of obtaining and granting consent shall be costs in the cause The defendant shall within the said period give notice to the plaintiff that he has filed a written statement and of his address for service In the counter that plaintiff respondent filed in the suit to show what steps taken by the defendants appellants according to him were indications of unequivocal intention to proceed with the suit he has stated as follows They the applicants have taken steps to file counter on a number of occasions in the Application No The steps taken by the petitioner indisputably show that there was intention in unequivocal terms to proceed with the suit and this would give us the right to have the matter disposed of by arbitration It is also submitted that the defendants entered appearance into petition was listed for orders and the vakalath was filed in this suit and therefore he should have filed the written statement within two weeks thereof and the applicant failure to file an application under Section seeking stay within the time allowed by law for filing the written statement precludes him from getting the stay We have thus seen that there is no rigid time limit and a discretion is given to <ORG> to suitably cause to extend the time for filing the written statement The parties have agreed that in the event of any difference of opinion between the Arbitrators on their giving separate awards the unresolved dispute shall be placed before the <ORG> nominated by the Arbitrators appointed by them and the <ORG> award shall be final In case the Arbitrators are not in agreement on any issue and they deliver separate awards they are directed to make a reference of the same to the <ORG> within the said period of three months and on receipt of the references the <ORG> is directed to give his award within two months
