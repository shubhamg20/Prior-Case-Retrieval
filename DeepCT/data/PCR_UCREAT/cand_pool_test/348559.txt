This is an appeal from a Judgment of Mr Justice <NAME> who on a petition filed by the respondents held that the <ORG> under the Pay ment of Wages Act had jurisdiction to entertain the application made by them and his order dismissing the application on the ground of want of jurisdiction was an erroneous order They then claimed their wages from to and <ORG> contention was that they were entitled to wages only from and not for any earlier period The applications were beyond time the delay was condoned by the <ORG> he heard the applications on the preliminary issue whether <ORG> had jurisdiction to entertain them and he came to the conclusion that the claim of the respondents was for compensation and not for wages and therefore he had no jurisdiction Now the first contention urged by Mr <NAME> is that the petition is not maintainable inasmuch as the respondents had the right of appeal under Section of the Act Section confers a right of appeal against a direction made under Sub section or Sub section of Section and the right is given to the employer if the total sum directed to be paid by way of wages and compensation exceeds three hundred rupees and it is given to an employee if the total amount of wages claimed to have been withheld from him exceeds fifty rupees In this case we are not concerned with Subsection of Section and the only question on this aspect of the case that arises for our determination is whether the order made by the <ORG> was a direction under Sub section of Section Turning to Section Sub section deals with the jurisdiction of the authority to be appointed and his authority is to deal with all claims arising out of deductions from the wages or delay in payment of the wages of persons employed or paid in the area mentioned in that sub section Then Sub section gives the right to an employed person to make an application where a deduction has been made from his wages or the payment of wages has been delayed Then the first proviso to Sub section provides for the period of limitation within which the application is to be made and the second proviso gives the power to the authority to admit an application after the period of limitation Then comes Sub section and the opening words of that subsection are When any application under Sub section is entertained and then the subsection goes on to provide how the application is to be heard by the authority and the concluding words are the authority may direct the refund to the employed person of the amount deducted or the payment of the delayed wages together with the payment of such compensation as the authority may think fit not exceeding ten times the amount deducted in the former case and exceeding ten rupees in the latter The contention of Mr <NAME> is that after the delay had been condoned by the authority the application was entertained and the order made by the <ORG> is a direction under Sub section of Section that the employee is not entitled to wages and that direction is subject to appeal under Section We think Mr <NAME> is right on the authorities that the right of appeal which is onferred is not limited to a case where the authority gives a direction to the employer to pay an amount to the employed person The right of appeal would also arise if the authority refuses to give a direction in the sense that he holds on the merits of the application that the employee is not entitled to any amount in other words he dismisses the application of the employee after considering the merits of his case But what is really urged by Mr <NAME> is that even when the <ORG> holds that the employee is not entitled to any relief not on the ground that he has no case on merits but on the ground that he has no jurisdiction to entertain the application it amounts to a refusal to give a direction which is subject to appeal under Section It has been urged by Mr <NAME> that the expression entertain used in Sub section is used in its technical sense and that once the authority has come to the conclusion that delay should be condoned and puts the application formally on file it is entertained by him In our opinion it is strictly unnecessary to consider that aspect of the case though it may be pointed out that a plea as to jurisdiction may be taken at any stage and if a <ORG> or authority has no jurisdiction even the fact that a party does not raise the plea of jurisdiction will not confer jurisdiction upon that <ORG> or authority But even assuming that Mr <NAME> is right and in this particular case the application was entertained after the delay had been condoned it is not mere entertaining an application that is sufficient for the purpose of deciding the question as to whether the right of appeal had ensued to the employee or not Therefore two conditions are necessary and not one in order to give rise to the right of appeal under Section Having entertained it the <ORG> did not proceed to dispose of it on merits but held that he had no Jurisdiction to dispose of the application Therefore it is clear that in this particular case as the <ORG> refused to assume jurisdiction and refused to deal with the respondents application on merits the only remedy they had was to come to this Court on a petition to compel the <ORG> to assume jurisdiction and dispose of the application of the respondents on merits They had no right to appeal under Section as there was no decision on merits which they could appeal against It then goes on to say Employees Who are unable to make up their minds finally within this period should fill in the form provisionally as a further opportunity will be afforded to them to make a final choice within six months from the date of transfer of power It is clear from the fact that <ORG> guaranteed to these employees their seniority and other conditions of serving that the respondents did not cease to be in the service of <ORG> during the period when a right was given to them to think over then own position and ultimately decide The attitude taken up by <ORG> is that although the respondents were ready and willing it was left to their own discretion when they should employ them and from what date they should pay for their services If this attitude is justified then the assurance given to the respondents was meaningless and was not worth the paper on which it was given Mr <NAME> further argues that at best this is merely a case of a breach of undertaking on the part of <ORG> and it may give a right to the respondents to sue for damages or compensation and not for wages But it is clear that there was no question of re employing the respondents
