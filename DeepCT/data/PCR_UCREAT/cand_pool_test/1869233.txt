hypothecating a two biswa odd share in patti No and a one biswa odd share in patti No both of village Bhaineroli for a term of ten years subject to the condition that if interest was not paid in any year the whole of the mortgage money would become immediately payable The second of the two aforesaid mortgages was first sued on and a preliminary decree obtained on foot thereof on th March which was made final on th November The appellants in A No in whom the prior mortgagees interest was then vested were not made parties and it is not disputed that they were not necessary parties and that the auction purchaser at a sale held in execution of the decree passed on the nd mortgage would take subject to the encumbrance created by the first mortgage Before however such a sale could take place the prior mortgage was put in suit and a preliminary decree obtained on foot thereof on th March Between the dates of the preliminary and final decrees passed on foot of the prior mortgage the property to which the subsequent mortgage related i half of that to which the prior mortgage related was sold in execution of the decree passed on foot of the second mortgage to which reference has already been made and was purchased by <NAME> At the sale held in execution of decree passed on foot of the prior mortgage the mortgagees themselves were declared purchasers It is not disputed that the first two defendants the prior mortgagees as purchasers were in actual possession up to the date of the suit which has given rise to this appeal Two main questions arise for consideration first which of the two auction purchasers is entitled to possession of the property in dispute and secondly if the first two defendants the mortgagee auction purchasers in execution of decree of the prior mortgage are rightfully in possession whether the plaintiff the auction purchaser in execution of the decree passed on foot of the second mortgage is still entitled to redeem the first mortgage so as to entitle him to possession on redeeming the prior mortgage The case law bearing on the first question is considerable and it is not easy to reconcile some cases in which identical questions were considered the mortgagor had sold his rights and the mortgagee there was only one mortgage brought his suit for sale subsequently impleaded the mortgagor who had lost all rights to the mortgaged pro party before the institution of the suit and failed to implead the vendee But that decision can be of no help in a case where there is competition between the auction purchaser in the prior mortgagee suit in which the puisne mortgagee was not a party and the auction purchaser in the puisne mortgagee suit The puisne mortgagee instituted his suit for sale first but before the mortgaged property could be sold in execution of his decree the prior mortgagee also instituted a similar suit without impleading the puisne mortgagee The sale in execution of the decree on foot of the second mortgage took place during the pendency of the prior mortgagee suit and the auction purchaser obtained actual possession Subsequently the purchaser in the prior mortgagee suit made an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession which was followed by a simple suit for possession described by the learned Judges as an ordinary suit for ejectment the plaintiff claiming to recover possession from the defendant absolutely and not subject to any condition The judgment contains no discussion of the question whether the auction purchaser in the prior mortgagee suit to which the puisne mortgagee is no party acquires at least the right of a mortgagor which in case both mortgages are simple includes the right to possession No question was raised or decided in reference to the sale in the puisne mortgagee suit having taken place during the pendency of the prior mortgagee suit and to the applicability or otherwise of the rule of lis pendens which again was a case of one mortgage the mortgaged property was sold in execution of a simple money decree during the pendency of the mortgagee suit He brought a suit for possession affording an opportunity to the auction purchaser in execution of the simple money decree to redeem The two cases first referred to were distinguished on the ground that they were simple suits for possession in which no opportunity to redeem had been given to the defendant It should be noticed that the substantial relief claimed in that suit was one for possession giving an option to the defendant to redeem the prior mortgage This feature is of importance as in a subsequent case in which a different view was taken it was pointed out that redemption was a right and not an obligation It was held that the purchaser in execution of a decree obtained by the prior mortgagee the plaintiff in that suit was entitled to possession unless the purchaser in the second mortgagee suit chose to redeem the prior mortgage At the same time he held that the puisne mortgages whose right should be deemed to have been transferred to the auction purchaser in his suit was a necessary party to the prior mortgagee suit and a failure on the part of the prior mortgagee to implead him did not affect his right and through him that of the auction purchaser in his suit to redeem the prior mortgage To what extent then is her title defective by reason of her omission to implead the puisne mortgagee Only to the extent that her title as owner is qualified by a right of redemption which was vested in the second mortgagee and which has now passed to the appellant as purchaser under the decree obtained on the second mortgage That is the only right which the second mortgagee could have enforced against her as prior encumbrancer for the right of the subsequent mortgagee to bring the equity of redemption to sale to satisfy his claim is a right which is exercised against the mortgagor only It is clear that this view which upholds the right of a purchaser in the prior mortgagee suit who purchased after the sale in the second mortgagee suit had already taken place is justified only on the assumption that the sale in the second mortgagee suit though anterior in date was subject to the result of the prior mortgagee suit then pending The sale in execution of decree obtained by the puisne mortgagee took place during the pendency of the suit on the prior mortgage The transfer took place in favour of the second mortgagee and at a date long prior to the institution of the suit by the first mortgagee <NAME> <NAME> arrived at the same conclusion holding that the effect of the nonjoinder of the puisne mortgagee was to leave him unaffected by the decree passed in the prior mortgagee suit and that in reference to him it should be assumed that nothing had taken place on foot of the prior mortgage which should be deemed to be subsisting On the doctrine of lis pendens he observed that the sale to the auction purchaser in the decree upon the puisne mortgage cannot be regarded as a new transfer the title of the auction purchaser must be taken at any rate where as in this case the decree holder was himself the purchaser as dating back to the mortgage and I find myself in agreement in this respect with <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> Cal <NAME> who took the same view held that I think the auction purchaser is in just the same position as the mortgagor son or transferee in the cases which I have put by way of example above In the Full Bench case to which reference has been made the sale in execution of a decree obtained by the prior mortgagee without impleading the subsequent mortgagee had taken place long before the puisne mortgagee obtained a decree in his suit On the applicability or otherwise of the rule of lis pendens as contained in Section Act we find ourselves in agreement with <NAME> We would however give our own reasons in support of that view of a contentious suit or proceeding in which any right to immovable property is directly and specifically in question the property cannot be transferred or otherwise dealt with by any party to the suit or proceeding so as to affect the rights of any other party thereto under any decree or order which may be made therein except under the authority of the <ORG> and on such terms as it may impose It is now settled law though some doubt existed at one time that the rule applies not only to transfer of or dealing with the property pendente lite by a party himself but also at auction sales in decrees obtained against him on the principle that what the owner could not do with the property the <ORG> could not do on his behalf see <NAME> <NAME> Cal A sale in execution of a decree obtained by a puisne mortgagee during the pendency of a prior mortgage must in our opinion be held to be within the rule It cannot be argued that the sale relates back to the mortgage or that it is the inevitable result of it and therefore not affected by the rule of lis pendens which has been purposely made so wide as to include not only transfers of properties pendente lite but also any manner of dealing with it during the pendency of a proceeding in which it is directly and specifically in question On the authorities to which we have referred we are lad to the following conclusions Where the puisne mortgagee has had the mortgaged property sold before the prior mortgagee institutes a suit or where the mortgagor parts with his right by a private alienation before such suit and the prior mortgagee fails to implead the auction purchaser or the transferee from the mortgagor the auction purchaser in his suit acquires no title to possession of the property purchased by him for the simple reason that the mortgagor had ceased to be the owner at the date of the suit and the equity of redemption had become vested in another person who was the only parson that could have been made a party and was not impleaded There are conflicting rulings of at least two Division Benches of his <ORG> on the question whether the auction purchaser in execution of a decree obtained on a prior mortgage without impleading the subsequent mortgagee acquires at least the rights of the mortgagor who was a party including his right to possession in cases where both the mortgages were simple Where sale in execution of a decree obtained on foot of a puisne mortgage takes place during the pendency of the suit on the prior mortgage there are conflicting rulings of two Division Benches of this Court on the questions a whether the sale in the subsequent mortgagee suit is affected by the rule of lis pendens so as to make the purchaser right subject to the result of the prior mortgagee suit and whether apart from the effect of the rule of lis pendens the purchaser in the prior mortgagee suit is entitled to possession in preference to the purchaser in the puisne mortgagee suit in case both mortgages were simple even though the sale in the second mortgagee suit took place before the sale in the prior mortgagee suit On the second question our own view is that the purchaser in the prior mortgagee suit acquires at least the mortgagor right to possession subject to the right of the purchaser in the puisne mortgagee suit to redeem the prior mortgage which for that purpose should be deemed to be subsisting Whether the auction purchaser in execution of a decree obtained on a prior mortgage without impleading the subsequent mortgagee acquires at least the rights of the mortgagor who was a party including his rights to possession in cases where both the mortgages were simple Where sale in execution of a decree obtained on foot of a puisne mortgage takes place during the pendency of the suit on the prior mortgage a whether the sale in the subsequent mortgagee suit is affected by the rule of lis pendens so as to make the pnrchaser right subject to the result of the prior mortgagee suit and whether apart from the effect of the rule of lis pendens the purchaser in the prior mortgagee suit is entitled to possession in preference to the purchaser in the puisne mortgagee suit in case both mortgages were simple even though the sale in the second mortgagee suit took place before the sale in the prior mortgagee suit It will thus appear that although the suit on the subsequent mortgage was instituted first there was a parallel suit on the first mortgage as well and decrees were obtained in both The suit was resisted by the prior mortgagee purchasers on the ground that it did not lie and in any case that the plaintiff must redeem them The appeals came up for hearing before <NAME> and <NAME> JJ who found that there was a conflict of opinion in this Court As there is undoubtedly a conflict of opinion not only in this <ORG> but also in the other High <ORG>s I propose to discuss the relevant cases of this <ORG> and only of course the cases decided by their Lordships of <ORG> and shall only give references to a few cases of the other High <ORG>s had a case in which a prior mortgagee brought a suit on his mortgage without impleading the subsequent mortgagee and obtained a decree and purchased the property in execution He then brought a suit against the subsequent mortgagee and the third party for recovery of the amount due under his mortgage and in default of payment by the defendants for recovery of possession It would appear from the judgment that the sale in execution of the subsequent mortgagee decree took place first where a prior mortgagee without impleading the puisne mortgage sued for and obtained a decree for sale on his mortgage but before the sale actually took place the puisne mortgagee sued for sale on his mortgage and contended that the prior mortgagee by omitting to implead him had forfeited his right to execute his decree a Pull Bench of this Court held that this was not better nor worse by his not having been impleaded in the prior mortgagee suit and that if the prior mortgage was valid the puisne mortgagee was not entitled to a decree for sale without giving the prior mortgagee an opportunity of redeeming him It is to be noticed that by the time the second mortgagee brought his suit limitation for the prior mortgage if a fresh suit were to be instituted on it had expired held that where two mortgagees each without impleading the other brought suits on their respective mortgages and obtained decrees for sale and purchased the property the second mortgagee being earlier in date a suit by the first mortgagee for possession or compelling the defendant to redeem him was not maintainable The first Court gave the plaintiff a decree for sale conditional on her paying to the defendants the sum of Rs In the course of the judgment the learned Judges held that the plaintiff <ORG> was seeking to enforce her mortgage against a prior mortgagee who had failed to make her a party and that it was the duty of the Court to give the plaintiff an opportunity of occupying the position which she would have occupied if she had bean made a party The question of allowing a prior mortgagee whose mortgage had long since become barred by time but who was in possession of the property under a decree obtained without impleading the subsequent mortgagee to set up his prior mortgage as a shield even though the limitation for the mortgage had run out was prominently before their Lordships and their Lordships allowed <NAME> to recover the amount due on his mortgage of This to my mind is a clear authority for the proposition that a prior mortgagee if he is in possession can set up in defence a prior mortgage as a shield although in his suit he had not impleaded the subsequent mortgagee and even though a fresh suit to enforce it would now be barred by time <NAME> and <ORG> held that as those mortgages were not usufructuary mortgages and the plaintiffs purchased the equity of redemption it was not open to the defendants to resist the claim of the plaintiffs to possession and the defendants had got possession by virtue of a sale which was unenforceable as against the claim arising out of the attachment Their Lordships further observed that whatever rights if any the defendants had under their mortgages they could no doubt enforce them in proper proceedings taken for the purpose but there was no opportunity afforded which enabled them to set up their mortgages as shields against the plaintiffs claim for possession The learned Judges held that the plaintiff was not entitled to possession and the suit was not maintainable It may give the former the right to redeem the latter It thus appears that there is considerable authority for the support of the proposition stated above There are three principles which are now well established and from which the right of the prior mortgagee as a defendant in possession to set up his prior mortgage as a shield follows logically A prior mortgagee therefore can bring a suit against his mortgagor without impleading a subsequent mortgagee and if there were no defect of lis pen dens and no suit by a subsequent mortgagee were pending the prior mortgagee can sell up the rights and interest of the mortgagor in the mortgaged property even behind the back of the subsequent mortgagee Section Act expressly conferred a right of subrogation on subsequent mortgagees but the equitable principle underlying that section was applied to all subsequent transferees on the strength of the rule of equity laid down by their Lordships of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> Cal The third principle is that the language of Section has been held to be applicable not only to private transfers but also to <ORG> sales held in execution of decrees Section does not make Section inapplicable to Ch which deals with mortgages It has been suggested that lis pendens cannot apply to the sale in a subsequent mortgage decree for the reason that the transfer in reality took place at the date of the mortgage and the subsequent auction sale is merely a necessary result of it arguments were sound it could be said that the transfer under the first mortgage took place at the date of that mortgage and the auction purchaser in the prior mortgage suit would always have priority even though his auction sale may be later in point of time It seems to me that the transfer by the mortgagee at the time of its execution was of the mortgagee rights and was made to the mortgages Indeed the defendant had no right whatsoever to transfer the mortgagee rights Can it be said that the transfer made to him really took place when the mortgage was executed in favour of the mortgagee Surely the transfer with which we are dealing and which is in favour of <NAME> could only have taken place on the date of the auction sale and not a day earlier Or suppose that the whole mortgage decree is not satisfied can it be said that the auction purchaser has acquired any part of the mortgagee right I therefore do not see how this argument can avoid the applicability of lis pendens to the transfer of the mortgagor interest even though that transfer takes place in the case of a mortgage suit As pointed out above the doctrine would apply equally to both the suits and the sale in each suit would be subject not only to the other mortgage but to the decree or final order passed in the other suit The doctrine of allowing a prior mortgagee who has entered into possession of the mortgaged property to set up his prior mortgage as a shield is a doctrine of equity If however the prior mortgagee does not succeed in obtaining possession he cannot enforce his rights under the prior mortgage in a suit as plaintiff if the remedy on that prior mortgage has become barred by time After the equities have been adjusted by the payment of the amounts due on the encumbrances which can be validly ordered to be paid up the equity of redemption of the mortgagor will ultimately remain vested in the person who purchased it at auction first in point of time Whether the auction purchaser in execution of a decree obtained on a prior mortgage without impleading the subsequent mortgagee acquires at least the rights of the mortgagor who was a party including his right to possession in cases where both the mortgages were simple a Whether the sale in the subsequent mortgagee suit is affected by the rule of lis pendens so as to make the purchaser right subject to the result of the prior mortgagee suit Whether apart from the effect of the rule of lis pendens the purchaser in the prior mortgagee suit is entitled to possession in preference to the purchaser in puisne mortgagee suit in case both the mortgages were sic simple even though the sale in the second mortgagee suit took place before the sale in the prior mortgagee suit I take it however that the reference relates to the admitted and established facts of the case and I therefore lay emphasis on the facts of this case It was agreed that the interest would be paid yearly and in default of payment of the yearly rent the mortgagees would be entitled to sue for their mortgage money The prior mortgagees brought a suit for sale being Suit No of on th August The suit was resisted on various grounds The lower appellate Court held that the plaintiff was not in possession when defendants and were put in possession that the mortgage of was time barred at the date of <NAME> suit which was instituted in December that defendants and had a right to hold up as a shield their prior mortgage of although it wag time barred because as a matter of fact defendants and were in possession and that the plaintiff was entitled to redeem half of the property mortgaged in It follows from what has been stated above that the auction purchaser will be entitled to take possession of the property as he has acquired the interest of the mortgagor which is If however we seek to apply the principle enunciated above to the facts of this case we shall find that the question involved in this case is more complicated and have not only a right to redeem A or in the case of a sale the auction purchaser it matters little whether the auction purchaser is the prior mortgagee himself or a third party but also they have an absolute right to bring the interests mortgaged to them to sale without payment of the prior mortgage of A can raise a suit of his own by making a party as a subsequent mortgagee a party as the mortgagor and the auction purchaser in A suit and decree as the person who has acquired the interests of the mortgagor in execution of the decree obtained by A can say that he would sell the property subject to the mortgage in favour of A and now held by I am not considering the question of limitation for the present the auction purchaser and nobody can possibly object to this attitude of his In this suit the prior auction purchaser will be entitled to nothing but the amount of the price which he has paid for the property not exceeding the mortgage money due to A If the auction purchaser be A himself and if he has purchased the property in full satisfaction of his mortgage decree he will be entitled to realize the whole of the mortgage money by a fresh sale It is effectual as against those persons interest in the equity who are made parties Further I would point out that where the author is talking of the right of the party omitted from the previous suit to redeem he is not considering the right of a subsequent transferee who was omitted to raise a suit of his own and to bring the property to sale subject to the prior mortgage relating to the suit to which he was not a party in considering what passes to the purchaser when a sale is held under an English mortgage states The effect of a conveyance by the mortgages under an express or statutory power to sell is to vest the property in the purchaser discharged from the mortgage and all claims arising thereunder and free from equity of redemption There can be no doubt that the rule of lis pendens generally speaking applies to cases of transfer pending suit on a mortgage Thus if where a mortgagee suit is pending the mortgagor transfers his property voluntarily or if his interest is attached in execution of a simple money decree and it is sold the purchaser by private treaty or the auction purchaser would take the property subject to the result of the mortgage suit Literally Section applies to a transfer by a party to the suit which would be a private act but there can be no doubt on principle and on authorities that where the interest of a party is transferred at the instance of a simple money creditor who attaches the same in execution the principles of the section would apply Where however a transfer takes place not in execution of a simple money decree or by private treaty but at the instance of a prior or subsequent mortgagee who is no party to the litigation Section or the principles on which Section is based has no application whatsoever There is no difference in principle between a private sale and a sale held in execution of a simple money decree after attachment There the only right that passes to the auction purchaser is the right title and interest of the judgment debtor alone and none of the decree holder who has no interest whatsoever in the property attached and sold In the case of a sale under a mortgage the transfer has already taken place at the date of the mortgage and what follows namely the subsequent sale in execution of the mortgage decree is nothing but the logical effect of a transfer which took place some time ago and not during the pendency of the suit by the prior mortgagee Now let us suppose that while the suit of <ORG> against <ORG> was pending <ORG> brings a suit against <ORG> for sale of the property under the simple mortgage executed in his favour and during the pendency of <ORG> suit brings the property to sale and himself purchases it The question is Will <ORG> be bound by the result of the suit in favour of <ORG> We have seen that <ORG> as a mortgagee would not be bound by the decree passed in favour of <ORG> not being a party to <ORG> suit and because there was no transfer in favour of <ORG> pending the suit of <ORG> Will <ORG> be bound because he has brought a suit of his own on the mortgage and purchased the property himself If it be said that <ORG> would be bound in the capacity of the auction purchaser how will you divide up <ORG> liability between his capacity as the mortgagee and his capacity as the auction purchaser How far will <ORG> be bound if he be bound at all If we should hold as we ought to that <ORG> is not at all liable how and on what principle shall we hold the auction purchaser in execution of the decree obtained by <ORG> liable if the purchaser should happen to be somebody other than <ORG> himself If a sale takes place at the instance of the second mortgagee the third mortgagee being a party to the suit the auction purchaser would acquire the rights of the two mortgagees and of the mortgagor The mortgagor alone is a party to the prior mortgagee suit while the second mortgagee is not How will you split up the liabilities of the auction purchaser in his various capacites as the representative of the mortgagor he will be bound by the decree obtained by the prior mortgagee and will not be permitted to question the decree while as the representative of the second mortgagee ha will be entitled to treat the decree as not binding on him and will be entitled to ask for redemption and also to sell the property again subject to the prior mortgage To apply the principle to this case when <NAME> purchased on th January he acquired the interest which is the sum total of the interest of <ORG> and <ORG> But what would happen in the case which I have considered by way of illustration The auction purchaser has paid the mortgage money due to the second mortgagee and thus we may say let us assume that the auction purchaser has acquired by subrogation an interest of the second mortgagee But how does he acquire the interest of the subsequent mortgagee also There is no question of payment of the money due to the third mortgagee Again let us take note of the facts of the present case By obtaining the decree to which <NAME> was not a party they could not prejudice the right of <NAME> which was twofold namely the right to redeem <NAME> and <NAME> and to sell the mortgage property subject to the prior mortgage in favour of <NAME> and <NAME> I do not regard this argument as serious because the mortgage of gave <NAME> a right to bring the interest of <NAME> to sale and it is that right of that has been exercised by <NAME> and as the result of the exercise of that right <NAME> had made the purchase As I have said this is an important distinction to remember and the simple question formed in the order of reference does not take note of the different answers that may be given in different cases My answers therefore to question a is as follows Answer to question a Where a transfer takes place as the result of an auction sale held during the pendency of a prior mortgagee suit in execution of a subsequent mortgagee decree the principle of lis pendens will not apply It runs as follows Whether apart from the effect of the rule of lis pendens the purchaser in the prior mortgagee suit is entitled to possession in preference to the purchaser in the puisne mortgagee suit in case both the mortgages are simple even though the sale in the second mortgagee suit took place before the sale in the prior mortgagee suit I take it that the question was framed with reference to the facts of this case and this case alone I do not find that there is anything in the reference which requires a discussion of the principles of the doctrine of shield and I therefore refrain from expressing any opinion But the plea was disregarded not only by <ORG> but also by their Lordships of <ORG> on the ground that the simple mortgages held by the defendant did not give him a right to hold possession as against the rightful owner I agree with the judgment of <NAME> Ag I am confirmed in the view expressed in the order of reference and have nothing to add The answer to of the second question is that if <ORG> does not apply and the second mortgagee is the earlier purchaser the prior mortgagee will have the right to take possession as plaintiff if a suit on his mortgage be not time barred
