The said I A of is an offshoot of I A filed by learned Amicus Curiae questioning the correctness of orders issued by the States of Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh respectively which according to him were in violation of the provisions contained in the Wildlife Protection Act in short the Act While contending that there was no violation of any law relating to forests and environment certain legal issues were raised by the Company which need to be dealt with first In any event hectares of land was outside the land covered by the Notification Since there was an existing legal right to get a renewal which had already accrued there was no question of any embargo on the renewal of the mining lease It was pointed out that the company had subsisting contracts with foreign buyers and if the lease is not renewed or the mining activities are required to be abandoned there shall be large financial implications on account of impossibility to perform the contracts It is pointed out that some subsisting contracts are there and in fact there is possibility of extracting million tons of primary ores in addition to million tons of secondary weathered ores SCC to contend that the Act has no application The Committee has granted to the company much more than what it deserves All these go to show that there is no proper application of mind and without realizing the serious consequences involved recommendations are being made There is no quiet place in the white man cities But in your perishing you will shine brightly fired by the strength of the God who brought you this land and for some special purpose gave you dominion over this land and over the red man The Stockholm Declaration of United Nations on Human Environment reads its Principle No inter alia thus Man has the fundamental right to freedom equality and adequate conditions of life In an environment of equality that permits a life of dignity and well being and bears a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations Article protects right to life as a fundamental right Therefore there is constitutional imperative on <ORG> <ORG> Governments and bodies like Municipalities not only to ensure and safeguard proper environment but also an imperative duty to take adequate measure to promote protect and improve the environment man made and natural environment Each victory it is true in the first place brings about the results we expected but in the second and third places it has quite different unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first There are a variety of colours of this problem In this whole gamut of the problems <ORG> came out with the date that we have in India nearly five hundred environmental laws and the Committee pointed out that no systematic study had been undertaken to evaluate those legislative developments Fines will be the normal penalty though in a number of cases sentences of imprisonment have been imposed there is normally a potential personal liability for directors and senior managers Clean up costs In most environmental legislation there is a power to clean up after a pollution incident and receive the cost from the polluter or in some cases the occupier Civil liability There is growing interest in the toxic torts although many of the actions have in fact been around for a long time AIR SC when science and technology are increasingly employed in producing goods and services calculated to improve the quality of life there is certain element of hazard or risk inherent in the very use of science and technology and it is not possible to totally eliminate such hazard or risk altogether There is increase in awareness of the compelling need to restore the serious ecological imbalances introduced by the depredations inflicted on nature by man The Constitution has laid the foundation of Articles A and A for a jurisprudence of environmental protection There is a total prohibition against the grant of mining lease in a forest area without concurrence of <ORG> Therefore while thinking of the developmental measures the needs of the present and the ability of the future to meet its own needs and requirements have to be kept in view It cannot be lost sight of that while today is yesterday tomorrow it is tomorrow yesterday It is therefore necessary for the <ORG> to keep in view the international obligations while exercising discretionary powers under the Conservation Act unless there are compelling reasons to depart therefrom The Section begins with a non obstante clause providing that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force in a State no State Government or other authority shall make except with the prior approval of <ORG> any order of the nature enumerated in the provision Section of the Conservation Act deals with constitution of <ORG> and Section deals with power to make rules On consideration of the materials on record we find no reason to vary the majority view of the <ORG> a statutory one when its findings and conclusions are based on assessments of the factual aspects and after duly considering the materials and Reports placed before it by the parties We have also taken note of the period indicated by the Forest Advisory <ORG> which is also a statutory <ORG> It was submitted by the learned counsel for the <ORG> of Karnataka that the recommendation made about transfer of buildings and other infrastructure to <ORG> of <ORG> at book value is not acceptable to it Certain proceedings have been initiated against the company for alleged violation of various statutes These proceedings shall be considered by the respective forums Courts in their proper perspective uninfluenced by any observation made hereinbefore in this judgment
