<ORG> Hyderabad who is the petitioner in these two cases claims concessional rates of excise duty for the years and by seeking to issue a certiorarised mandamus for quashing the order of <ORG> confirming the orders of the Assistant Collector of <ORG> and the Appellate Collector of <ORG> and a consequential direction for the refund of excess duty collected Under the said notification as averred by the petitioner issued under sub rule of Rule of the <ORG> Rules hereinafter referred to as the rules the concession was to operate with reference to the period during which the paper was manufactured There shall be levied and collected in such manner as may be prescribed duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India and a duty on salt manufactured in or imported by land into any part of India as and at the rates set forth in the First Schedule A The provisions of sub section shall apply in respect of all excisable goods other than salt which are produced or manufactured in India by or on behalf of <ORG> as they apply in respect of goods which are not produced or manufactured by <ORG> Where under this Act any article is chargeable with duty at a rate dependent on the value of the article such value be deemed to be a the wholesale cash price for which an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from the factory or any other premises of manufacture or production for delivery at the place of manufacture or production or if a wholesale market does not exist for such article at such place at the nearest place where such market exists or where such price is not ascertainable the price at which an article of the like kind and quality is sold or is capable of being sold by the manufacturer or producer or his agent at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from such factory or other premises for delivery at the place of manufacture or production or if such article is not sold or is not capable of being sold at such place at any other place nearest thereto In determining the price of any article under this section no abatement or deduction shall be allowed in respect of trade discount and the amount of duty payable at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty payable at the time of the removal of the article chargeable with duty from the factory or other premises aforesaid The Central Government may from time to time by notification in the Official Gazette exempt subject to such conditions as may be specified in the notification any excisable goods from the whole or any part of duty leviable on such goods <ORG> may by special order in each case exempt from the payment of duty under circumstances of an exceptional nature any excisable goods No excisable goods shall be removed from any place where they are produced cured or manufactured or any premises appurtenant thereto which may be specified by the Collector in this behalf whether for consumption export or manufacture of any other commodity in or outside such place until the excise duty leviable thereon has been paid at such place and in such manner as is prescribed in these rules or as the Collector may require and except on presentation of an application in the proper form and on obtaining the permission of the proper officer on the form Provided that such goods may be deposited without payment of duty in a store room or other place of storage approved by the Collector under rule or rule or in a warehouse appointed or licensed under rule or may be exported under bond as provided in rule Provided further that such goods may be removed on part payment of duty leviable thereon if the Central Government by notification in the official gazette allow the goods to be so removed under rule Therefore interpreting Section of the Central Excises and Salt Act we are of the opinion that the liability for tax namely the excise duty would arise no sooner the manufacture or the production is completed and it is immaterial as to what machinery may be devised by <ORG> under the rule making powers for recovery of a tax The point of recovery or any restriction on removal will not be the determining factor for grant of exemption in respect of goods manufactured during the duty free period Therefore if the notification withdrawing the exemption came into effect from and had no retrospective operation the excisable articles which were in stock till were exempt from excise duty and excise duty would be payable on excisable articles produced or manufactured on and onwards only a Division Bench of <ORG> while construing the provisions of Section Rules and A held One does not find any warrant in the Central Excise Act or the rules to spell out a construction that it is only the stage of manufacture or production of goods which attracts duty Therefore if at the date when the goods are removed from the place of manufacture they are specified in Schedule I they cannot be removed unless duty is paid on them even though such goods have been manufactured when there was no excise duty on them Therefore the goods manufactured prior to the withdrawal of exemption notification but removed thereafter would not be entitled to such exemption A Division Bench of <ORG> in No dated while differing from the earlier decisions of that <ORG> held based on the provisions enacted in Rule A that the excise authorities were right in applying the rates prevailing on the date of removal duties of excise on all excisable goods which are produced or manufactured in India and at the rates set forth in the st Schedule In sum levy of excise duty is on goods which are produced or manufactured In other words imposition of the duty is on the goods produced or manufactured Section provides for the determination of the value of the goods for the purpose of duty Rule enables the <ORG> to exempt certain goods in special circumstances partially or wholly from the imposition of excise duty Rule lays down the time and mode of payment of duty and Rule A schedules the date for determination of duty and tariff valuation The answer therefore to the proposition which falls for determination in these cases is found in Section and not in any other section or rule including Rule A But nevertheless it should not make any difference as there cannot be any quarrel that the provisions postulated by the said rule lays down more the mode and manner of assessment <ORG> appears to have made a departure from its earlier two decisions in No when it held that the excise authorities were right in applying the rates prevailing on the date of removal and thereby agreed with the conclusions reached by the Bombay and Gujarat <ORG> which have been referred to herein above True there was an additional factor in that case viz The contention of the learned Standing Counsel for <ORG> that the decision in <NAME> case should not be a guideline in adjudicating the case on hand for the reason that that case was concerned with the goods wholly exempted has no substance inasmuch as on principle it makes no difference whether the matter pertain to partial or total exemption Likewise the contention in regard to the dismissal of the <ORG> on merits by <ORG> passed on September against the aforesaid judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> case it should not be taken to be really a decision on merits also merits no consideration as it is fairly settled by now that when the court records its order as dismissal on merits it must be taken to have been a decision on merits When a notification is issued extending exemption partial or total with reference to say expansive production as in this case and the assessee on that court produces or manufactures goods in compliance of the said notification and if the authority rescinds the same after the goods are manufactured and before the goods are cleared or removed for one reason or the other then the very scheme and object behind such exemption clause is rendered abortive stultifying the very incentive accorded to the manufacturer or producer From the foregoing therefore it is manifest and we unhesitatingly hold that the excise duty would arise the moment the manufacture or production of the commodity is complete irrespective of the fact that the assessment and collection is postponed to a later point of time when the said commodity is cleared or removed the incidence for the impost being the manufacture or production of goods If that be so the petitioners are entitled to have the benefit of the exemption notification and so the refund of the excess duty paid
