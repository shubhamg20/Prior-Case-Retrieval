CASE NO Appeal civil of PETITIONER Jagdish Mitter RESPONDENT <ORG> DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH GAJENDRAGADKAR SUBBARAO WANCHOO SHAH DAYAL JUDGMENT JUDGMENT AIR SC The Judgment was delivered by <NAME> Per Gajendragadkar JThe short question which arises in this appeal is whether the order passed by the Director of Postal Services on October terminating the services of the appellant amounts to his dismissal under so as to attract the provisions of of the Government of India Act That led to the present suit filed by the appellant on November in which he claimed a declaration that the termination of his services was illegal on the ground that rule of the Posts and Telegraphs Manual Vol It was alleged that the appellant was a temporary servant and as no declaration had been made in his favour that he had acquired the status of quasi permanent servant it was urged that his services could be terminated on a month notice in terms of his contract <NAME> had alleged that he had posted four reply paid postcards to the Postmaster General Ambala in connexion with a claim application for National and Defence Certificates originally registered in Pakistan he however received no reply to the said letters except a bare acknowledgement The Sub Judge at Ambala who tried the suit held that since the appellant was a temporary <ORG> servant his service could be terminated without holding any enquiry and that the provisions of of the <ORG> of India Act were therefore inapplicable and so he dismissed the appellant suit The learned District Judge held that the order passed against the appellant was one of dismissal and so it attracted the provisions of of the <ORG> of India Act He found that the said provisions had not been complied with and so he held that the order of dismissal passed against the appellant was invalid <NAME> who heard this appeal upheld the pleas raised by the respondent and came to the conclusion that the order passed against the appellant was no more than a mere order of discharge and so it fell outside the purview of In the result the appeal preferred by the respondent was allowed and the appellant suit was ordered to be dismissed The appellant then applied to the said <ORG> for a certificate of fitness but since the said certificate was refused he moved this Court for special leave and it is with the special leave granted to him by this Court that he has brought the present appeal before us On his behalf <NAME> has contended that the <ORG> was in error in holding that the impugned order passed against the appellant did not amount to dismissal within the meaning of Art in respect of persons employed in civil capacities under the <ORG> or a <ORG> on a temporary or probationary basis is now fairly well established Having regard to the legislative history of the provisions contained in Art The protection given by the rules to the Government servants against dismissal removal or reduction in rank which could not be enforced by action was incorporated in Sub sec and of to give them a statutory protection by indicating a procedure which had to be followed before the punishments of dismissal removal or reduction in rank could be imposed on them and which could be enforced in law These protections have now been incorporated in Art It is thus clear that every order terminating the services of a public servant who is either a temporary servant or a probationer will not amount to dismissal or removal from service within the meaning of Art His services can be terminated by one month notice without assigning any reason either under the terms of contract which expressly provide for such termination or under the relevant statutory rules governing temporary appointments or appointments of probationers Such a temporary servant can also be dismissed in a punitive way that means that the appropriate authority possesses two powers to terminate services of a temporary public servant it can either discharge him purporting to exercise its power under the terms of contract or the relevant rule and in that case it would be a straightforward and direct case of discharge and nothing more in such a case Art The authority can also act under its power to dismiss a temporary servant and make an order of dismissal in a straightforward way in such a case Art This simple position is sometimes complicated by the fact that even while exercising its power to terminate the services of a temporary servant under the contract or the relevant rule the authority may in fairness enquire whether the temporary servant should be continued in service or not In other words if a temporary servant or a probationer is found to be satisfactory in his work efficient and otherwise eligible it is unlikely that his services would be terminated and so before discharging a temporary servant the authority may have to examine the question about the suitability of the said servant to be continued and acting bona fide in that behalf the authority may also give a chance to the servant to explain if any complaints are made against him or his competence or suitability is disputed on some grounds arising from the discharge of his work but such an enquiry would be held only for the purpose of deciding whether the temporary servant should be continued or not There is no element of punitive proceedings in such an enquiry the idea in holding such an enquiry is not to punish the temporary servant but just to decide whether he deserves to be continued in service or not If as a result of such an enquiry the authority comes to the conclusion that the temporary servant is not suitable to be continued it may pass a simple order of discharge by virtue of the powers conferred on it by the contract or the relevant rule in such a case it would not be open to the temporary servant to invoke the protection of Art for the simple reason that the enquiry which ultimately led to his discharge was held only for the purpose of deciding whether the power under the contract or the relevant rule should be exercised and the temporary servant discharged On the other hand in some cases the authority may choose to exercise its power to dismiss a temporary servant and that would necessitate a formal departmental enquiry in that behalf If such a formal enquiry is held and an order terminating the services of a temporary servant is passed as a result of the finding recorded in the said enquiry prima facie the termination would amount to the dismissal of the temporary servant It is in this connexion that it is necessary to remember cases in which the services of a temporary servant have been terminated directly as a result of the formal departmental enquiry and cases in which such termination may not be the direct result of the enquiry and this complication arises because it is now settled by decisions of this <ORG> that the motive operating in the mind of the authority in terminating the services of a temporary servant does not alter the character of the termination and is not material in determining the said character vide <NAME> LLJ vide supra Take a case where the authority initiates a formal departmental enquiry against a temporary servant but whilst the enquiry is pending it takes the view that it may not be necessary or expedient to terminate the services of the temporary servant by issuing an order of dismissal against him That is why in dealing with temporary servants against whom formal departmental enquiries may have been commenced but were not pursued to the end the principle that the motive operating in the mind of the authority is immaterial has to be borne in mind But since considerations of motive operating in the mind of the authority have to be eliminated in determining the character of the termination of services of a temporary servant it must be emphasized that the form in which the order terminating his services is expressed will not be decisive In dealing with this aspect of the matter we must bear in mind that the real character of the termination of services must be determined by reference to the material facts that existed prior to the order But the main principles which have been accepted by this <ORG> and applied in dealing with cases of temporary servants who have been discharged are no longer in doubt applied this <ORG> observed that he had been discharged from service really because the Government had on enquiry come to the conclusion rightly or wrongly that he was unsuitable for the post he held on probation In this connexion it is necessary to point out that the impugned order was preceded by an enquiry which had been held against the probationer and notice was served on him at the said enquiry calling upon him to show cause why his services should not be terminated forthwith The termination of employment of a person holding a post on probation without any enquiry whatsoever cannot be said to deprive him of any right to a post and is therefore no punishment But if instead of terminating such a person service without any enquiry the employer chooses to hold an enquiry into his alleged misconduct or inefficiency or for some similar reason the termination of service is by way of punishment because it puts a stigma on his competence and thus affects his future career In such a case he is entitled to the protection of Art It would be noticed that these propositions were laid down in a case where the order of discharge on its face attributed stigma to the probationer whose services were discharged and it was preceded by an enquiry held with a view to decide whether the said probationer services should not be terminated forthwith and so with respect in appreciating the effect of proposition as enunciated in the judgment these material facts must be borne in mind An enquiry of this character must be distinguished from the formal departmental enquiry where charges are served on the servant and which is undertaken for the purpose of punishing him otherwise it would lead to this anomalous result that in the case of a temporary servant or a probationer the authority must discharge him without inquiring into his alleged inefficiency or unsuitability but if the authority chooses to act fairly and makes some kind of enquiry and gives an opportunity to the servant concerned to explain his alleged deficiency the discharge becomes dismissal We have no doubt that in laying down third proposition this Court did not refer to such informal enquiries and did not intend to take in cases of simple and straightforward discharge of temporary servants which follow such informal enquiries His case that the discharge amounted to dismissal had been upheld by <ORG> but was rejected by this Court in appeal because this Court came to the conclusion that the impugned order of discharge could not properly be held to be an order of dismissal It is true that the impugned order of discharge did refer to the adverse comments made against the probationer conduct and did say that it was therefore no good retaining him further in service and that prima facie would amount to attaching a stigma to the probationer who was discharged nevertheless the order was construed by this Court to be an order of discharge simpliciter and no more because rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules required that before the services of a probationer were terminated an enquiry had to be held about his competence after giving him an opportunity to show cause against the grounds alleged against him and it was because such an enquiry had to be held that the result of the enquiry was communicated to the probationer when he was discharged In other words the statements in the order of discharge on which the probationer had relied for the purpose of showing that the said order amounted to dismissal had to be made in the order as a result of the requirements of rule and so this Court came to the conclusion that merely on the strength of the said statements the impugned order could not be characterized as an order of dismissal Thus this decision illustrates the importance of the character of the enquiry held against a temporary servant which may ultimately lead to the termination of his services It also emphasizes that if the probationer contention had been upheld it would virtually have meant that every order of discharge passed against a probationer after complying with the requirements of rule would have to be treated as an order of dismissal and that obviously cannot be right It appears that the officer challenged the validity of the order reverting him to the post of a tahsildar on the ground that it amounted to punishment and he also alleged that it was the result of mala fides Thus the decision in this case was based mainly if not solely on the ground that the reversion of the officer was mala fide The record of the said case shows that the Settlement Officer who apparently held the departmental enquiry against <NAME> had found that he was guilty of the charges and had recommended that he should be removed from service immediately That is why this <ORG> set aside the order as being illegal inasmuch as it had contravened Art We ought to add that in his petition <NAME> had alleged that no reasonable opportunity was given to him to show cause against the order of dismissal as required by Art We are satisfied that the principles laid down in all these decisions are in no sense inconsistent We have already stated that before the service of the appellant were terminated some enquiry was held on the complaint of one <NAME> and at this enquiry it transpired that <NAME> the brother of the appellant had used a reply paid postcard sent by <NAME> without scoring the address of <NAME> written on it by him The appellant contention is that in the present case the order itself shows that it is not a discharge but a dismissal and that naturally involves the question as to the construction of the order He fairly conceded that the words used in the order were somewhat unfortunate but he urged that the order should be liberally construed and should be held to have been passed by the authority by virtue of its power to terminate the services of the appellant on one month notice It seems that anyone who reads the order in a reasonable way would naturally conclude that the appellant was found to be undesirable and that must necessarily import an element of punishment which is the basis of the order and is its integral part The test in such cases must be Does the order cast aspersion or attach stigma to the officer when it purports to discharge him If the answer to this question is in the affirmative then notwithstanding the form of the order the termination of service must be held in substance to amount to dismissal In the result the appeal is allowed and the decree passed by the lower appellate Court is restored with costs throughout
