The facts as stated in the order under revision show that the value of the property in dispute was perhaps more than Rs that court had no jurisdiction to hear the reference The <ORG> however on hearing the parties came to the view that the word competent means the competent court of territorial jurisdiction and Section of the will apply to suits and not to a proceeding and accordingly held that the objection was not tenable in law If the Magistrate is of opinion that none of the parties was then in such possession or is unable to decide as to which of them was then in such possession of the subject of dispute he may attach it and draw up a statement of the facts of the case and forward the record of the proceedings to a Civil Court of competent jurisdiction to decide the question whether any and which of the parties was in possession of the subject of dispute at the date of the order as explained in Sub section of Section and he shall direct the parties to appear before <ORG> on a date to be fixed by him Therefore in my opinion a reference made under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure to <ORG> not being either a suit or a proceeding as held above cannot be put to any limitation of pecuniary jurisdiction nor there is any indication cither in that section or in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure in support of any construction like that That being so the contention raised in this case behalf of the petitioner that the learned Munsif to whom the reference was made is not competent to hear it fails In the case reported in AIR All the reference made to <ORG> was by a revenue <ORG> and in those circumstances the question raised was whether the provision of the Code of Civil Procedure applied to that proceeding In answer thereto the learned Judges held that it was a proceeding of a character as contemplated under Section and therefore the procedure laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure did apply to it Yet in the course of discussion their Lordships expressed the view that the objection taken on the ground of pecuniary jurisdiction was a valid one But the discussion on this point is rather scanty and is based on the general proposition that the competency of a <ORG> consists both in territorial and pecuniary jurisdiction without any detailed discussion on the consideration as to whether the provisions of Section of the Code of Civil Procedure did at all apply to a case like that Lastly our attention has also been drawn by the petitioners to the difficulties which may arise in cases where Civil <ORG> of different grades having the same territorial jurisdiction are found situated in the same area But on the language as it stands at present it has to be held that in such cases all these <ORG> will have concurrent jurisdiction and in law the reference to any of them shall be a valid reference There is yet another pertinent question of practical value It will in any case give rise to a new proceeding of an incidental character which may be open to challenge in a superior <ORG>
