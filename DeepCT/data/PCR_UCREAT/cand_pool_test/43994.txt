The said property continued to be occupied by the deceased as a continuing tenant for the last days of his life Before the Assistant Controller of Estate Duty two alternative contentions were raised on behalf of the accountable persons He took the view that the entire property did pass on the donor death because continued possession and enjoyment of the property was not immediately assumed by the donees and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or to the entire exclusion of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise The <ORG> was of opinion that the questions raised on behalf of the parties were counterparts of each other and framed the following question of law and referred it to this Court for opinion Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case and on a true interpretation of the provisions of Section of the Estate Duty Act the <ORG> was justified in holding that only that portion of the property at Queens Park Calcutta which was in the occupation of the deceased could be deemed to pass on the death of the deceased and not the whole of the property From the statement of the case relevant portions whereof I have referred to already it seems to me that this argument is of no substance Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the applicants has argued that the question at issue depends upon the true construction of Section of the Estate Duty Act which reads Property taken under any gift whenever made shall be deemed to pass on the donor death to the extent that bona fide possession and enjoyment of it was not immediately assumed by the donee and thenceforward retained to the entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise Mr <NAME> then relied on a passage in the judgment of Lord <NAME> of Killowen in Commr For the propositions aforesaid Mr <NAME> has also relied on the cases of <NAME> Commr of Stamp Duties AC and the dictum of <ORG> in the case Lang <NAME> CLR In order to bring the case within the scope of the Section it is not sufficient states Mr <NAME> to take the situation as a whole and find that the donor has been allowed to enjoy substantial advantages which have some relation to the property given it is necessary to consider the nature and source of each of the advantages and determine whether or not it is a benefit of such a kind as to come within the section <NAME> Commr Learned counsel then urged that in order that duty may be levied the burden of proof is upon the taxing authority who must bring the subject within the charge i establish that there was not an entire exclusion of the donor or of any benefit to him by contract or otherwise It follows according to learned counsel that if there is any doubt as to the nature of the possession and enjoyment granted to the donor being that which he had before the cession then the duty is not exigible I propose to rely on the observations made in <NAME> book confining myself however to the points that arise for our consideration in the instant case There is a finding by the Appellate Controller at page of the paper book that bonafide possession and enjoyment of the property was perhaps assumed by the donees immediately upon the gift In this case the deceased gave his son a farming property Mia Mia in in the deceased the son and another son entered into a partnership agreement as graziers and Stock dealers on the terms inter alia that the deceased should be the Manager and that his decision should be final in all matters relating to the conduct of the business that the capital should consist of the live stock and plant owned by the partners that the business should be conducted on their respective holdings including Mia Mia and that the land held by each partner should be his sole property and he should have the sole and free right to deal with it as he might think fit There was an initial out right gitf of the property not of the property shorn of certain rights contrast AC Viscount <NAME> in <NAME> case AC has fully considered the effect of the decision in <NAME> case CLR and makes the following observations As long ago as in Lang <NAME> CLR a case whether a testatrix gave certain blocks of land to her son and on the same day took leases from them of the same land <NAME> <NAME> said the lease however gave to the doner possession and enjoyment of the land itself which is a simple negation of exclusion and bring the case within the statutory liability To my mind the correct view is that so far as the upper portion of premises No Queens Park is concerned the lease gave to the donor possession and enjoyment of the property itself which is a negation of exclusion and brings the case within the statutory liability There is no difficulty it seems therefore in drawing upon the principles laid down in <NAME> case CLR for construing the relevant provisions in lection of the Estate Doty Act In other words the first limb of the condition may be infringed if the donor occupies OK enjoys the property or its income even though he has no right to do so which he could legally enforce against the donee decision on which Mr <NAME> placed strong reliance in which cases the deceased either released with the decision in <NAME> case SC LR or made an absolute gift of the <NAME> a house and furniture to a relative without any stipulation but continued to live there as the donee guest until his death more than five years later and it was held that duty was not chargeable In the <NAME> case KB <NAME> in his remarks at of the report appears to have considered that the deceased exclusion from the property itself the first limb of the condition would like his exclusion from any benefit by contract or otherwise the second limb be achieved unless he had some enforceable right It may be observed however that although in cases like the Permanent Trustee case AC the donee could at any time have terminated the arrangement under which the deceased was not excluded nevertheless so long as the arrangement continued the deceased had a specific right whereas in the <NAME> case ScLR and the <NAME> case KB it appears that there was no specific arrangement at all and the deceased was simply the guest of the donee I have no doubt that neither the donor nor the donee contemplated for one moment that the former would under any circumstances be turned out of the house but there was no discussion on the point and the donor befors he executed the Deed was fully aware that after executing the Deed he would be at the defendant mercy and was fully content to rely upon the affection which the defendant Bore towards his grand uncle and benefactor I have discussed alt the authorities which appear to me to be relevant for answering the question raised in this reference That is not the plain meaning of the expression at all and there is no reason why the meaning should be strained in the manner suggested by Mr <NAME>
