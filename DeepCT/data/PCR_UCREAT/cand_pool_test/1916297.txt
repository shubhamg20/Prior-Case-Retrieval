The assessee commenced doing business in Bombay from that date and there was a credit entry in his books of account on that very day for a sum of Rs The <ORG> to which an appeal was preferred from the decision of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner also held that the sum of Rs out of profits made by the assessee in the years preceding the Maru year as a non resident could be included under Section iii of the Indian Income tax Act in his total income of the year of account in which he was a resident in British India This <ORG> merely exercises an advisory jurisdiction Its judgments are in the nature of advice given on the questions submitted to it by the <ORG> Its advice must be confined to questions referred by the <ORG> to this <ORG> and those questions must be questions of law which must arise out of the order made by the <ORG> Now looking at the plain language of the section apart from any authority I should have stated that a question of law arose out of the order of the <ORG> if such a question was apparent on the order itself or it could be raised on the facts found by the <ORG> and which were stated in the order I see no reason to confine the jurisdiction of this <ORG> to such questions of law as have been argued before the <ORG> or are dealt with by the <ORG> The section does not say so and there is no reason why we should construe the expression arising out of such order in a manner unwarranted by the ordinary grammatical construction of that expression This <ORG> has no jurisdiction to decide questions which have not been referred by the <ORG> If the <ORG> does not refer a question of law under Section which arises out of the order then the only jurisdiction of the <ORG> is to require the <ORG> to refer the same under Section It is true that the <ORG> has jurisdiction to resettle questions of law so as to bring out the real issue between the parties but it is not open to the <ORG> to raise new questions which have not been referred to it by the <ORG> That was a ease under the old Act and an application was made under Section asking the Commissioner of Income tax to state a case on certain points With regard to the second question <ORG> took the view that although a question of law might be involved as the question was not raised in the appeal to the Assistant Commissioner the question did not arise out of the order under Section of the Act and the petitioner had no right to demand that the Commissioner should refer that question An assessee may raise a question and argue it before the <ORG> but if the <ORG> thought fit to ignore that argument and not to refer to that point of law in its order then the <ORG> would have no jurisdiction to call upon the <ORG> to refer that question of law to <ORG> It is true that the Income tax Act is a very technical statute but I see no reason why when the plain grammatical construction of the section does not make it necessary to come to that conclusion it is necessary to do so and arrive at such an anomalous result Under the old Act it was for the Commissioner of Income tax to formulate the questions of law arising out of the order made by the Assistant Commissioner and in the case which came before <NAME> and <NAME> the Commissioner refused to state a case taking the view that the question of law as formulated by the assessee did not arise out of the order and therefore no question arose of stating the case It was then argued that this <ORG> had no jurisdiction to direct the Commissioner to state the case arising on a question of law not formulated before him Various decisions of other High <ORG>s were cited in support of that view In my opinion the present attempt of the Advocate General is also to restrict the powers of <ORG> in a manner not authorised by the Act and to confine the questions of law arising out of the order merely to those questions of law which have been raised before the <ORG> or dealt with by the <ORG> is in my opinion restricting unauthorisedly the advisory jurisdiction of this <ORG> Now in the assessees appeal to the Appellate <ORG> one of the grounds taken was that on the proper construction of Section the amount paid for the municipal taxes and Urban Immoveable Property Tax should be allowed as a deduction in computing the income from property <NAME> pointed out that that contention could cover two grounds one that the taxes should be deducted in the first instance before arriving at the bona fide annual value within the meaning of Section and the other that the annual value of the property being ascertained those were permissible deductions under heads iv and of Sub section <NAME> stated in his judgment that there appeared force in that contention although he took the view that the assessee was in a position to raise that contention by the ground of appeal formulated by him If the Advocate General were right this <ORG> had no jurisdiction to consider that contention at all Under Section we have to decide the questions of law raised and submitted to us I see no reason why these words should be interpolated in Section iii Therefore in any particular year the total income of a resident in India would also include all income which accrued or arose to him without British India It is necessary to note that under this sub clause what is being taxed is not income but remittances and the <ORG> is only concerned with the fact that the person who remits it is a resident in British India and that the remittance takes place in the year of accounting I would therefore answer the first question in the affirmative and the second question in the negative The assessee must pay the costs of this reference To this preliminary objection there is to my mind a very short answer for the purposes of this reference If they do so and they have done so in the present reference then it is the duty of <ORG> under Sub section thereof to decide the question of law raised by the case stated It is only if the <ORG> takes the view that no question of law arises and refuses to state a case that either party is entitled to apply to <ORG> under Sub section for an order requiring the <ORG> to state a case Since the <ORG> has although the question was not argued before it raised the question of law and deferred it to us we are bound to determine it under Sub section There has been a wide divergence of judicial opinion on the interpretation of these words and the various High <ORG>s have taken various views which are difficult to reconcile These words would in my opinion fall to be determined only when an application under Section is made requiring the <ORG> to state a case I therefore refrain from expressing any opinion on the correct interpretation to be placed on these words It provides that the total income of an assessee resident in British India shall include income profits and gains which have accrued or arisen to him without British India before the beginning of the accounting year and after April and are brought into or received in British India during the accounting year There is no doubt that in this case on the facts found Rs To my mind there is no justification for restricting the meaning of the sub clause in this manner Moreover if such was the true intention of the <ORG> it is difficult to understand why Sub clauses ii and iii should have existed side by side in respect of any year subsequent to the year when these sub clauses were inserted in the Income tax Act by the amendment of I am therefore not prepared to restrict Section iii in the manner suggested by Mr <NAME> and I agree that the first question must be answered in the affirmative This amount is included in the total income of the assessee by reason of the fact that it was remitted to British India during the accounting year and therefore it has been quite rightly taxed by the Income tax Officer under the head Income from other sources The second question referred to us must therefore be answered in the negative
