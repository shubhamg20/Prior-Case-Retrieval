The referring Bench was of the opinion that the interpretation given to those two terms in the decision in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra was in conflict with the statutory provisions enacted by the <ORG> in the said Mathadi Act The question referred to <ORG> was as under In view of the statutory definition of the expression unprotected worker in Section of the Maharashtra Mathadi Hamal and other Manual Workers Regulation of Employment and Welfare Act is the interpretation placed by <ORG> in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra II CLR on the aforesaid expression that it is only casually engaged workers who come within the purview of the Act correct and proper In the two aforementioned judgments of <ORG> the Learned Judges writing the majority judgment recorded as under For the aforesaid reasons we find that the interpretation placed by <ORG> in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra <ORG> II CLR on the definition of the words unprotected worker and worker for the purpose of applicability to Mathadi Act that it is only the casual workmen who come within the purview of the Act is not correct and proper and it is erroneous which deserves to be ignored and is overruled Therefore with a view to studying the conditions of the work of the persons engaged in these occupations the Government had appointed <ORG> on to examine whether relief could be given to these workers within the ambit of the existing labour legislation and make recommendation as to how such relief could be given They are not employed directly but are either engaged through <ORG> or Toliwalas or gangs as and when there is work and they also work for different employers on one and the same day Ultimately the Act came on the legal anvil vide Act No XXX of after it received assent of the Vice President acting on behalf of the President on It was clarified in Section that it applies to the employments specified in the Schedule and that it shall come into force on such date as the State Government may by notification in the Official Gazette appoint and different dates may be appointed for different areas and for different provisions of the Act To begin with it came into force in Thane District in various areas Some other sub Sections of Section runs as under contractor in relation to an unprotected worker means a person who undertakes to execute any work for an establishment by engaging such workers on hire or otherwise or who supplies such worker either in groups gangs tollis or as individuals and includes a sub contractor an agent a mukadum or a tolliwala employer in relation to any unprotected worker engaged by or through contractor means the principal employer and in relation to any other unprotected worker the person who has ultimate control over the affairs of the establishment and includes any other person to whom the affairs of such establishment are entrusted whether such person is called an agent manager or is called by any other name prevailing in the scheduled employment establishment means any place or premises including the precincts thereof in which or in any part of which any scheduled employment is being or is ordinarily carried on principal employer means an employer who engages unprotected workers by or through a contractor in any scheduled employment unprotected worker means a manual worker who is engaged or to be engaged in any scheduled employment worker means a person who is engaged or to be engaged directly or through any agency whether for wages or not to do manual work in any scheduled employment and includes any person not employed by any employer or a contractor but working with the permission of or under agreement with the employer or contractor but does not include the members of an employer family wages means all remunerations expressed in terms of money or capable of being so expressed which would if the terms of contract of employment express or implied were fulfilled be payable to an unprotected worker in respect of work done in any scheduled employment but does not include i the value of any house accommodation supply of light water medical attendance or any other amenity or any service excluded from the computation of wages by general or special order of <ORG> ii any contribution paid by the employer to any pension fund or provident fund or under any scheme of social insurance and the interest which may have accrued thereon iii any travelling allowance or the value of any travelling concession iv any sum paid to the worker to defray special expenses entailed on him by the nature of his employment or any gratuity payable on discharge Some other Sections of the Act which were referred to by the Learned Senior Counsel during the arguments are as under For the purpose of ensuring an adequate supply and full and proper utilization of unprotected workers in scheduled employments and generally for making better provision for the terms and condition of employment of such workers <ORG> may by means of a scheme provide for the registration of employers and unprotected workers in any scheduled employment or employments and provide for the terms and conditions of work of registered unprotected workers and make provision for the general welfare in such employments If any question arises whether any scheme applies to any class of unprotected workers or employers the matter shall be referred to <ORG> and the decision of <ORG> on the question which shall be taken after consulting <ORG> constituted under Section shall be final The Board may take such measures as it may deem fit for administering the scheme The <ORG> shall submit to <ORG> as soon as may be after the st of April every year and not later than the st day of October an annual report on the working of the scheme during the preceding year ending on the st day of March of that year The Board may appoint such persons as it thinks fit to be Inspectors possessing the prescribed qualifications for the purpose of this Act or of any scheme and may define the limits of their jurisdiction Subject to any rules made by the State Government in this behalf an Inspector may a enter and search at all reasonable hours with such assistants as he thinks fit any premises or place where unprotected workers are employed or work is given out to unprotected workers in any scheduled employment for the purpose of examining any register record of wages or notices required to be kept or exhibited under any scheme and require the production thereof for inspection examine any person whom he finds in any such premises or place and who he has reasonable cause to believe is an unprotected worker employed therein or an unprotected worker to whom work is given out therein require any person giving any work to an unprotected worker or to a group of unprotected workers to give any information which is in his power to give in respect of the names and addresses of the persons to whom the work is given and in respect of payments made or to be made for the said work seize or take copies of such registers records of wages or notices or portions thereof as he may consider relevant in respect of an offence under this Act or scheme which he has reason to believe has been committed by an employer and exercise such other powers as may be prescribed Provided that no one shall be required under the provisions of this section to answer any question or make any statement tending to incriminate himself Nothing contained in this Act shall affect any rights or privileges which any registered unprotected worker employed in any scheduled employment is entitled to on the date on which this Act comes into force under any other law contract custom or usage applicable to such worker if such rights or privileges are more favourable to him than those to which he would be entitled under this Act and the scheme Provided that such worker will not be entitled to receive any corresponding benefit under the provisions of this Act and the scheme In that case it was held by the Division Bench of that Court that the workers who were working in the factory of the petitioner could not be termed as unprotected workers It was further held that it was only the casually engaged workmen who would come within the purview of the Mathadi Act <ORG> further said that where the material produced on record clearly show that the workmen are protected workmen more particularly with reference to the Agreement under Section of the Industrial Disputes Act the Act in question would not apply Therefore the referred question was whether it was only casually engaged workers who came within the purview of the Act The objection in that behalf raised by the appellant to <ORG> judgment is not correct When we see the judgment in <ORG> Vs <ORG> Mumbai Ors The referring judgment clearly goes on to show that it did not agree with the narrower judgment in the case of <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra but it cannot be forgotten that the two questions framed by it clearly show that the consideration could not be restricted to the narrower question as to whether the view taken in the case of <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra was correct or not instead the question which arose for consideration on account of the two <ORG> not agreeing was as to what was the true scope of the definition of the expression unprotected worker in Section of the Mathadi Act Considering the clear language and the questions considered in the referring judgment by Hon ble <NAME> and Dr <NAME> <NAME> We will therefore proceed on the basis that <ORG> had to decide the true scope of the term unprotected worker as defined in Section of the Mathadi Act and to point out as to who could be covered under that definition Basically the contentions raised by the parties are as follows Legal Submissions on behalf of the Appellants A Section of the Mathadi Act cannot be interpreted independently of Section of the Mathadi Act which is the definition of worker and conjoined reading of these two Sections in the light of other provisions of the Act would clearly bring out that those workers who are regularly employed and who have the protection of other labour legislations cannot be termed as unprotected workers Reference was also made to Article of the Constitution of India and it was suggested that in the matters falling in the Concurrent List the Central Legislation will supersede the <ORG> Legislation if both cover the same field It was suggested that there was no need for direct conflict between the two enactments and the repugnancy arises even if obedience to both laws is possible It is enough if <ORG> had evinced the intention to cover the whole field It was tried to be pointed out that there was nothing on record to indicate as to what extent the Presidential assent was obtained Various Sections were referred like Section a Sections and to show that the interpretation given by <ORG> would lead to absurdity Reliance was also placed on Sections and of the Mathadi Act and Clauses and of the Scheme framed under the Mathadi Act In short it was contended that under Section the workmen could retain the privileges and benefits under any Act Award or Contract if such privileges were better than the ones offered by the Act and in that sense even if the manual worker was protected under the various labour laws he could still be governed by the Mathadi Act Same argument was in respect of Section of the Mathadi Act providing that a manual worker who is in receipt of better benefits from his employer either on the date of commencement of this Act or at any time thereafter he could seek exemption from all or any of the provisions of the Mathadi Act It was pointed out that though in the Bill as originally introduced the words is not adequately protected by legislation were to be found and though the note on the Clauses also mentioned about such non protection by the welfare <ORG> the amended Bill omitted those words so also the necessary amendments were made in Item of the Schedule attached to the Bill Therefore the Learned Counsel argued that there was a clear deliberate and cautious intendment to include all manual workers engaged in the scheduled employment whether protected by any labour law or not in the definition of protected worker It was pointed out that if the service conditions of a workman were better before the commencement of the Mathadi Act he would still continue to be benefited by those better conditions and as such there was no anomaly created by giving the plain meaning to the Section depending upon its language The argument that giving the plain meaning would deprive the workers of the protection under Bombay Industrial Relations Act of raising industrial disputes before <ORG> and <ORG> was also termed as incorrect argument as firstly there was no vested right for selecting the forum and secondly the <ORG> had the competence to enact special laws for a class or section of workmen for improving their conditions of service and such special law would always prevail over any general law covering the same field The cases relied upon by the appellants were distinguished on various grounds This was especially done in the case of <ORG> Vs Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited <ORG> cited supra the Learned Judge has called upon the constitutionality of the certain provisions of the Cotton Merchants Unprotected Workers Regulation of Employment and Welfare Scheme and in that sense the question of interpretation of Section did not fall for consideration in those cases It was pointed out that the referring judgment itself differed with the view expressed in the decision in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra It was therefore pointed out that it could not be said that there was a breach of doctrine of stare decisis in giving a contrary meaning of Section as it was pointed out that the doctrine of stare decisis was not an absolute doctrine and that it was for this <ORG> to lay down the correct law under Article of the Constitution of India As regards the Rule of Contemporanea Expositio Est Optima Et Fortissima In Lege the argument was that there was no evidence that the law makers or as the case may be the Government understood the scheme in the particular manner <ORG> accepted the contentions raised on behalf of the Board that <ORG> in the decision in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra adopted a meaning which could be attributed in common parlance to the expression unprotected worker totally ignoring the plain meaning of the expression as defined in Section of the Mathadi Act It was pointed out further that if the legislature intended that the benefit of Act could not be available to workers who were otherwise governed by some other industrial legislation it was open to the legislature to legislate accordingly and it was therefore that <ORG> did not agree with the decision in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra A reference was then made to Section of the Mathadi Act and the same logic was used as was relied and argued by the Learned Counsel for the respondents before us Therefore even if such person does not earn the wages as contemplated in Section such person who is engaged to do manual work in any scheduled employment would be a worker It has been correctly held in the judgment of the Learned Single Judge Hon ble <NAME> that these two definitions worker and unprotected worker given in Sections and of the Mathadi Act would have to be read together for realizing the scope of the Section of the Mathadi Act According to the Learned Senior Counsel the acceptance of such plain meaning would result in rendering some other provisions of the Act otiose Further such interpretation would also hit doctrine of stare decisis as the interpretation of this doctrine prior to the impugned <ORG> and more particularly given in various judgments of <ORG> including judgment in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra has remained intact for more than years which is a long period Even as regards the rule of <ORG> In Lege the Learned Senior Counsel argued that there was no evidence that the law makers or as the case may be the <ORG> understood the scheme in a particular manner It was contended by <NAME> Learned Senior Counsel for the respondents that when a definition of the word begins with means it is indicative of the fact that the meaning of the word is restricted that is to say it would not mean anything else but what has been indicated in the definition itself In support of this proposition he relied on the decision in <NAME> Vs <NAME> SCC The Learned Senior Counsel also pointed out that in the decision in <NAME> Vs <ORG> AIR SC it has been held by this Court that the use of the word means indicates that the definition is a hard and fast definition and no other meaning can be assigned to the expression than that is put down in the definition We have already referred to the decision in <NAME> Vs Sub Divisional Officer <ORG> cited supra We may also say as we have already expressed that once the language of the Section is absolutely clear there is hardly any scope for interpretation One more decision of this Court which was heavily relied upon by the respondents was <NAME> Vs <NAME> SCC wherein in para it was observed The golden rule of construction is that when the words of the legislation are plain and unambiguous effect must be given to them But the primary rule of construction would be to ascertain the plain language used in the enactment which advances the purpose and object of the legislation Emphasis supplied However <NAME> Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants submitted that in this case unless the context is taken into account it would lead to absurd and unintended result He has relied on the decision in <ORG> Anr About the principles to be borne in mind while interpreting a definition the Learned Senior Counsel has relied on the decision in <NAME> Vs <NAME> SCC wherein in para this Court has observed that the interpretation placed on a definition should not only be repugnant to the context but it should also be such as would aid the achievement of the purpose which is sought to be served by the Act <NAME> and his colleagues also heavily relied upon the history which led to the introduction of the Bill as also the Statement of Objects and Reasons for introducing the Bill in the legislature by the then Hon ble Labour Minister It was argued by <NAME> Learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants that in Chapter thereof under the heading Employer and Employee relationship there is expression the real difficulty is that there is no employer as such It was also pointed out that the difficulty which was felt was that the employment of the worker was only through the contractor and technically there was no direct relationship of employer and employee as between <ORG> and the Mathadi workers Similar was the case with the merchants traders and other concerns as they engage the labour through <ORG> or Toliwala and such <ORG> or Toliwala engaged his men or the workers with him and paid wages to them and therefore technically there was no direct relationship of the employer and employee as between the merchants or concerns and the workers From this the Learned Senior Counsel argued that where there is a direct relationship in case of the monthly workers there would be no question of applying this broad definition to such workers In a number of cases they are not employed directly but are either engaged through Mukadams or Tolliwalas as and when there is work Reliance was also placed on the decision in <NAME> Vs <NAME> Ors SCC Paras and wherein it was held that the definition is not to be read in isolation and it must be read in the context of the phrase which would define it We must point out here that this ratio will not apply for the simple reason that the definition given in Section of the Mathadi Act is extremely clear and there is no vagueness or ambiguity about it We have already pointed out that even if it is read in the context we cannot ignore the fact that the legislature had deliberately deleted the words but for the provisions of this Act is not adequately protected by legislation for welfare and benefits of the labour force in the State Therefore there was a specific act on the part of the legislature to enlarge the scope of the definition and once we accept this all the arguments regarding the objects and reasons the Committee Reports the legislative history being contrary to the expressed language are relegated to the background and are liable to be ignored The case is clearly not applicable since there is no constitutional matter involved engaged in certain employments to make better provision for their terms and conditions of employment to provide for their welfare and for health and safety measures where such employments require these measures to make provision for ensuring an adequate supply to and full and proper utilization of such workers in such employments to protect avoidable unemployment for these and similar purposes to provide for the establishment of Boards in respect of these employments and where necessary in the different areas of the <ORG> and to provide for purposes connected with the matters aforesaid It is hereby enacted in the Twentieth Year of the Republic of India as follows Great stress was led on the words such as and it was tried to be suggested that the Preamble carves out a class of the unprotected manual workers We have already referred to those Reports and we find nothing contradictory in those Reports in view of our finding on the plain language of the Section We have examined this decision In the first mentioned decision the word include was used which would make all the difference and thereby it was held that the definition may deserve a broader meaning and therefore it was necessary to keep in view the scheme of the object and purport of the statute We have already referred to the second mentioned case of <NAME> Vs <NAME> cited supra <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Learned Counsel invited our attention to Section of the Mathadi Act and pointed out that there was absolutely no inconsistency because where a directly appointed worker was having better rights or privileges then those rights or privileges remains unaffected and in that case such worker would have the choice for those more favourable rights and privileges under other beneficial legislations the only rider being that such worker would not be entitled to receive any corresponding benefit under the provisions of the Mathadi Act and the scheme We were also taken through Section of the Mathadi Act which provides for the exemptions The Section provides that <ORG> may exempt from the operation of all or any of the provisions of the Act or any scheme all or any of the classes of unprotected workers employed in any scheduled employment or the establishment or part of any establishment if in the opinion of <ORG> all such unprotected workers are in the enjoyment of benefits which are on the whole not less favourable to such unprotected workers than the benefits provided by or under the Mathadi Act of course subject to certain conditions and after the consultation with <ORG> Now if inspite of this the legislature went on to delete those words which we have already quoted the intention of the legislature must be loud and clear and we cannot persuade ourselves to hold that there is anything contradictory to the definition in the Statement of Objects and Reasons Clause on which great stress was led by <NAME> runs as under examine any person whom he finds in any such premises or place and who he has reasonable cause to believe is an unprotected worker employed therein or an unprotected worker to whom work is given out therein According to <NAME> when all the persons working in a scheduled industry doing manual work become the unprotected workers then there is no question of the Inspector examining any such person because everybody would be an unprotected worker Similarly Section provides that provisions of Workmen Compensation Act shall mutatis mutandis apply to registered unprotected workers and they shall be deemed to be workmen within the meaning of that Act Section makes the similar provision regarding the Payment of Wages Act to the workers while Section provides the application of Maternity Benefit Act There is a provision for creation of the <ORG>s under Section of the Mathadi Act and every unprotected worker has to register himself with the <ORG> We do not therefore see any reason to take any different view in the light of these Sections He further argued that this interpretation would lead to absurd results whereby Sections and would be identical It was argued by <NAME> Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants that as per Sections and of the Bombay Industrial Relations Act all the employees are covered and any reduction from those employees has to be only after the notice of change is given Similarly reliance was placed by <NAME> Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants on the decision in <ORG> Vs <NAME> SCC The provisions of Motor Vehicles Act and more particularly Sections and fell for consideration therein It was only when such grammatical and literal interpretation leads to unjust results which the legislature never intended that the said rule has to give place to the rule of legislative intent Reliance was placed on the observations made in para Common sense construction rule It is a rule of the common law which may be referred to as the common sense construction rule that when considering in relation to the facts of the instant case which of the opposing constructions of the enactment would give effect to the legislative intention the <ORG> should presume that the legislator intended common sense to be used in construing the enactment Nature of presumption against absurdity It is presumed that <ORG> intends that the <ORG> when considering in relation to the facts of the instant case which of the opposing construction of an enactment corresponds to its legal meaning should find against a construction which produces an absurd result since this is unlikely to have been intended by <ORG> Where each of the constructions contended for involves some anomaly then insofar as the <ORG> uses anomaly as a test it has to balance the effect of each construction and determine which anomaly is greater It may be however that the anomaly is clearly intended when effect must be given to the intention We do not think that such absurdity could be arrived at if the literal interpretation is given to the term We therefore reject the argument of <NAME> in this behalf That takes us to the next argument regarding stare decisis It was urged by the Learned Senior Counsel that there was a consistent line of judgments starting from year right upto the present judgment of the Full Bench in covering period of years wherein <ORG> has taken a consistent view in interpretation of the term unprotected workers to mean only casual workers or as the case may be the workers who did not enjoy the protection of the other labour welfare legislations Very heavy reliance was placed on the decision in <ORG> Vs <ORG> cited supra where <ORG> has specifically rejected the employers arguments under Article of the Constitution of India solely on the ground that in the docks the expression mathadis would be limited to only such workers doing loading and unloading operations as were not protected by legislation under the Dock Workers Act Heavy reliance was placed on paras and of that decision Reliance was also placed on the decision in <ORG> <ORG> Mumbai Vs State of Maharashtra Ors It was urged by <NAME> that in the aforementioned judgments of <ORG> excepting the judgment in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra this question has not fallen for consideration at all The Learned Judge noted that this question did not fall for consideration either in the two judgments by Hon ble <NAME> in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra and <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra Ors cited supra will show that the question about the correct interpretation and scope of the Section of the Mathadi Act did not fall for consideration in those cases cited supra has specifically quoted from the decision in <NAME> Vs <NAME> Appeal Cases as follows Before discussing <NAME> Vs <NAME> Appeal Cases and what was decided therein there are two observations of a general character which I wish to make and one is to repeat what I have very often said before that every judgment must be read as applicable to the particular facts proved or assumed to be proved since the generality of the expressions which may be found there are not intended to be expositions of the whole law but are governed and qualified by the particular facts of the case in which such expressions are to be found The Court further relied upon the decisions in <ORG> Vs <ORG> SCC <ORG> Vs Vairamani SCC and finally the decision in <ORG> Vs <NAME> All ER and has quoted the following observations therefrom There is always peril in treating the words of a speech or a judgment as though they were words in a legislative enactment and it is to be remembered that judicial utterances are made in the setting of the facts of a particular case Now when we examine all <ORG> judgments on the basis of this ratio it is clear that excepting the decision in <ORG> Vs State of Maharashtra cited supra such position could not be obtained There can be no dispute about the importance attached by this <ORG> in the above mentioned cases as relied upon by the appellants which favour the consistency of law The guiding philosophy is that a view which has held the field for a long time should not be disturbed only because another view is possible cited supra we have no hesitation but to hold that the application of doctrine of stare decisis cannot help the appellants in this case We must express here that while rejecting the arguments of appellants we have in our minds those thousands of workmen who are otherwise exploited by Toliwalas Mukadams and at times the employers It is with this idea that we reject the argument of the stare decisis though very ably put by <NAME> <NAME> Learned Senior Counsel and other Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants According to the Black Law Dictionary this is the doctrine that the best meaning of a statute or document is the one given by those who enacted it or signed it and that the meaning publicly given by contemporary or long professional usage is presumed to be the true one even if the language may have a popular or an etymological meaning that is very different However the Learned Judge was careful enough to say that While this may not be really conclusive it certainly indicates the manner of the <ORG> authority viewing its power and the Rules under which it was exercising the power The Court can certainly take into account this situation on the doctrine of contemporanea expositio There are number of authorities which speak about the powers of the <ORG> vis vis this doctrine It has been held in <ORG> Vs <NAME> Appeal Cases <NAME> Vs <NAME> Ch <ORG> Vs <NAME> KB Senior Electric Inspector Vs <NAME> AIR SC <NAME> Vs State of Bihar AIR SC <ORG> Vs <ORG> AIR SC <ORG> Vs <ORG> AIR SC that even if the person who dealt with the Act understood it in a particular manner that does not prevent the <ORG> in giving to the <ORG> its true construction It is pointed out in the decision in <ORG> Vs <ORG> cited supra that the doctrine is confined to the construction of ambiguous language used in very old statutes where indeed the language itself have had a rather different meaning in those days Considering this settled position we do not think we are in a position to accept the contention raised It was suggested that the said Article prescribes that in the matters falling in the Concurrent List any Central legislation whether made before or after a State legislation supersede such State legislation if they both cover the same field An exception to this lies in sub Article which preserves and protects a State enactment to the extent it has received the assent of the Vice President Therefore reliance placed on the decisions in <ORG> Vs <ORG> SCC and <NAME> Medical Educational and Charitable Trust Vs State of Tamil Nadu Ors Before parting with the judgment we must refer to the fact that this legislation which came way back in have in its view those poor workmen who were neither organized to be in a position to bargain with the employers nor did they have the compelling bargaining power
