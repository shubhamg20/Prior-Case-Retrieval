DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH REDDY CHINNAPPA BENCH REDDY CHINNAPPA RAY SINGH CITATION AIR SCR SCC SCALE CITATOR INFO RF SC RF SC ACT Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act ii Provisions excepting from the application of the Act residential buildings fetching rent exceeding four hundred rupees Whether violative of Article of the Constitution The petitioners in their writ petitions challenged the vires of this provisions contending that though the Act was designed to apply generally to all residential and non residential buildings residential buildings or parts thereof fetching a rent of more than rupees four hundred were singled out and taken out of the purview of the Act by ii arbitrarily and without any reason It has not been shown in the instant case that the tenants of non residential buildings are in a disadvantageous position as compared with tenants of residential buildings and therefore they need greater protection Tenants of both kinds of buildings equally need the protection of the beneficient provision of the Act It cannot be said that the tenant of a residential building paying a rent of rupees five hundred is able to protect himself better than the tenant of a non residential building paying a rent of rupees five thousand per month or that the tenant of a residential building who pays a rent of rupees five hundred per month is not in need of any statutory protection It is one thing to say that tenants belonging to the weaker sections of the people need protection and an altogether different thing to say that denial of protection to tenants paying higher rents will protect the weaker sections of the society Inconsistently enough the tenants of non residential buildings who are in a position to pay much higher rents than those in occupation of residential buildings can ever pay are afforded protection by the impugned provision while the latter paying rent in excess of rupees four hundred are left high and dry Sections and A prescribe the procedure to be followed after intimation of vacancy is given either by way of allotment to some other person or release in favour of the landlord Section provides for recovery of possession of a building bona fide required by a landlord for carrying out repairs which cannot be otherwise carried out or for the demolition of the building and construction of a new building Section makes provisions for effecting repairs to a building where the landlord fails to make the necessary repairs We may now turn to ii which reads as follows Nothing contained in this Act shall apply to any residential building or part thereof occupied by anyone tenant if the monthly rent paid by him in respect of that building or part exceeds four hundred rupees Does it mean that the tenant of a residential building paying a rent of Rs is better able to protect himself than the tenant of a non residential building paying a rent of Rs per month is not in need of any statutory protection Is there any basis for the distinction between the tenant of a residential building and the tenant of a non residential building and that based on the rent paid by the respective tenants Is there any justification at all for picking out the class of tenants of residential buildings paying a rent of more than four hundred rupees per month to deny them the rights conferred generally on all tenants of buildings residential or non residential by the Act Neither from the Preamble of the Act nor from the provisions of the Act has it been possible for us even to discern any basis for the classification made by ii of the Act In the counter affidavit filed by <NAME> on behalf of the State of Tamil Nadu the classification is sought to be justified in the following manner I submit that the plea of hostile discrimination and inequality of treatment is not involved in There is also a clear and discernible nexus between the object of the measure and the differentia themselves I submit that the classification based on the purpose residential and non residential is based on well recognised and rational principle of differentia It is incorrect to say that ii of the Act defeats the purpose of the Act As submitted already a distinction based on rent in an intelligent one and has also got rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved It is equally incorrect to say that the provisions of ii are a total departure from the rent Act and takes away the protection afforded to the tenant under the Act thus rendering the Act nugatory Tenants of both kinds of buildings equally need the protection of the beneficent provisions of the Act No attempt has been made to show that the tenants of non residential buildings are in a disadvantageous position as compared with tenants of residential buildings and therefore they need greater protection The counter affidavit has repeatedly referred to the weaker sections of the people and stated that in order to protect the weaker sections of the people a distinction has been made between them and those who are in a position to pay higher rent It is one thing to say that tenants belonging to the weaker sections of the community need protection and an altogether different thing to say that denial of protection to tenants paying higher rents will protect the weaker sections of the community Further the distinction suggested in the counter appears to be quite antipathic to the actual provision because as we pointed out earlier there is no such ceiling in the case of tenants of non residential buildings and therefore a tenant of a non residential building who is in a position to pay a rent of Rs Here the object of the legislature clearly was that the protection of the beneficent provisions of the Act should be available only to small tenants paying rent not exceeding Rs As we pointed out earlier the argument based on protection of the weaker sections of the community is entirely inconsistent with the protection given to tenants of non residential buildings who are in a position to pay much higher rents than the rents which those who are in occupation of residential buildings can ever pay
