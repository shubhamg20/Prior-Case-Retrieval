This appeal is directed against an order of an additional District Judge of Muzaffarpur who dismissed an appeal preferred by the judgment debtor against the order of the Subordinate Judge dismissing his application under Section of the Civil Procedure Code The respondent filed a suit against the appellant and other members of his family to recover a certain amount on the basis of a promissory note executed by the judgment debtor appellant After the service of notice under Order rule of the Code the appellant filed the aforesaid application under Section asserting that the decree holder dues could not be realised from him by arrest and detention in civil prison as the conditions laid down in the proviso to Section of the Code were not fulfilled Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the judgment debtor appellant drew our attention to Rules and of Order read with Section of the Civil Procedure Code The circumstances which justify an order for arrest are contained in Section of the Code which provides for the different modes of execution of a decree and lays down that where the decree is for the payment of money execution by detention in prison shall not be ordered unless after giving the judgment debtor an opportunity of showing cause why he should not be committed to prison the court for reasons recorded in writing is satisfied In the instant case having gone through the evidence of the two witnesses examined on behalf of each party we do not find any of the circumstances mentioned in any of these clauses He could not say the boundaries of any land belonging to the judgment debtor and other members of his family He had not even filed any petition for taking copy of the survey proceedings He did not even make any enquiry from the landlord office or seen any paper relating to the land of the judgment debtor and other members of his family Where however there is sufficient material shown to warrant an inference as in the present case that the judgment debtor has actually been in the possession of substantial assets a few months prior to suit an inference is perfectly justifiable that he has since the institution of the suit dishonestly concealed them and furthermore that he has since the date of the decree means to pay a substantial portion of it from assets he is concealing from the <ORG> In the Madras case referred to above there were sufficient materials which justified the inference that the decree holder had discharged that onus and the judgment debtor was liable to be arrested and detained in civil prison In the instant case however there is no material at all on the basis of which it can be said that the decree holder has discharged the onus Substantially the same view was taken by Mr Justice <NAME> in the case of <NAME> Municipal Commissioner From a persual of the judgment of the courts below it is manifest that the finding that the decree holder had been able to bring the case within the relevant clauses of the proviso to Section of the Code of Civil Procedure is based on no evidence and therefore we are entitled to take a different view in this case In view of the foregoing discussions we hold that there is absolutely no material on the record in the instant case to justify the arrest and detention of the judgment debtor appellant in civil prison The learned Judge has referred to Clause of the compromice petition in which it was stated that on the failure of any of the instalments on the due date the entire remaining decretal amount would become payable at once and would be realisable from the person and properties of defendants Nos and It was argued by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellant that the portion of Clause of the compromise petition stated above does not mean that defendants and of the suit meant to forego this privilege Mr <NAME> on the other hand contended that in Clause of the compromise the appellant did forgo his privilege but we are unable to agree with him and we accept the contention of Mr <NAME> It is well settled that every one has the right to waive and to agree to waive the advantage of a law or rule made solely for the benefit and protection of the individual in his private capacity which may be dispensed with without Infringing any public right or public policy See Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes Eleventh Edition page In the Madras case which was in respect of the Madras Buildings Lease Rent and Control Act there was a document of lease which expressly provided that if the rent remained unpaid for two tenancy months after it became payable the landlord would be entitled to re entry upon the demised premises Section i of the Act however provided that the landlord may be entitled to apply for eviction even when there was default in payment of a month rent It was held by their Lordships that such a contract was quite valid as the privilege given to the landlord by section of the Act could be waived if such a waiver would not infringe any public right or public policy The other three decisions deal with the waiver by the judgment debtor in respect of his privilege under Section that his house could not be attached in execution of a money decree and it was held by their Lordships that such a waiver was permissible In the Calcutta case there were other properties also besides the house but they were also not attachable in law Sub section of Section contains a list of properties which are liable to attachment and sale in execution of a decree and then there is a proviso to the effect that in spite of the contents of that list some properties shall not be liable to such attachment or sale On the other hand the proviso to Section enjoins on the court itself not to order arrest and detention of the judgment debtor in prison unless the court for reasons recorded in writing is satisfied that the materials on the record of the case come within any of the clauses of the proviso Irrespective of the fact whether the judgment debtor appears or not the court has to satisfy itself before issuing any warrant of arrest against the judgment debtor whether the materials on the record bring the case within any of the clauses of the proviso to Section of the Code This section lays down that subject to the provisions contained in Sections to every suit instituted appeal preferred and application made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although limitation has not been set up as a defence Here too the <ORG> has given a mandate to the court to dismiss suits appeals or applications filed after the prescribed period of limitation even though the other party does not take up the plea of limitation It is by now well settled that the court must dismiss a suit as barred by limitation even though the defendant does not raise such a plea or press the same In the result the appeal is allowed and the orders of the courts below are set aside In the circumstances of the case the parties will bear their own costs
