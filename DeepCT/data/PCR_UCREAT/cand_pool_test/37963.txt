DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH JEEVAN REDDY BENCH JEEVAN REDDY KULDIP SINGH CITATION SCR SCC JT SCALE ACT Rajasthan Land Acquisition Act Sections A Acquisition of land Notification dispensing with the enquiry Validity of notification Large extent of land acquired Existence of superstructures here and there Whether prevents the <ORG> from exercising its power to acquire the land Against this the respondent <ORG> preferred the present appeal housing the Urban Development Minister had recommended that the land allotted to the petitioner The material placed before the Court disclosed that the government found on due verification that there was an acute scarcity of land and there was heavy pressure for construction of houses for weaker sections and middle income group people that <ORG> had obtained a loan of Rs crores under a time bound programme to construct and utilise the said amount by that in the circumstances the <ORG> was satisfied that unless possession was taken immediately and <ORG> permitted to proceed with the construction the <ORG> will not be able to adhere to the time bound programme There were also certain other materials upon which the government had formed the said satisfaction viz that In view of the time bound programme stipulated by the lendor <ORG> the <ORG> and already appointed a large number of engineers and other subordinate staff for carrying out the said work and that holding an inquiry under Section A would have resulted in uncalled for delay endangering the entire scheme and time schedule of <ORG> The satisfaction under Section of the Act Is a subjective one and that so long as there is material upon which the government could have formed the said satisfaction fairly the court would not interfere nor would it examine the material as an appellate authority This is the principle affirmed by decision of this Court not only under Section but also generally with respect to subjective satisfaction Before this could be done there was a change In the <ORG> and the said tentative decision was reversed The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals are preferred against the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> allowing a batch of special appeals The special appeals were preferred against the judgment of a learned Single Judge dismissing a batch of writ petitions The result of the judgment of <ORG> is that the notification issued by <ORG> under Section of the Rajasthan Land Acquisition Act proposing to acquire a large extent of land stands quashed On another notification was issued under Section of the said Act dispensing with the provisions of Section A If so the power under sub section and sub sec tion of Section could not have been invoked to dispense with the enquiry under Section A ii that there was no real urgency warranting the invocation of urgency clause An inquiry under Section A ought to have been held which is a valuable right given to the land owners whose land is acquired under the Act and iii that at any rate the houses and other structures on the land acquired should not have been acquired The learned Judge rejected all the three contentions and dismissed the writ petitions Accordingly the matter was referred to a third Judge by an order dated Three questions were framed for the consideration of third Judge viz whether it was necessary for the <ORG> to mention in the notification that the land is waste or arable and whether the non men tion of the said fact vitiates the notification whether it was obligatory upon the <ORG> to mention in the notification issued under Section that the land proposed to be acquired is waste or arable and whether the non mention thereof vitiates the said notification and if a small fraction of an arable land proposed to be acquired is occupied by buildings like huts kham houses and pucca houses for residential purposes and for keeping fodder cattle farms cattle sheds and for similar other purposes is it still permissible to treat the entire land as arable land and issue notification under Section read with Section of the Rajasthan Land Acquisition Act If not what are the legal consequences which such buildings aforementioned entail in the context of the said notification The third Judge recorded his opinion on the said questions but when the matter went back to <ORG> it was of the opinion that while the opinion of the learned third Judge on questions and was categorical affirming the view of the learned Single Judge his opinion on question No was not clear or categorical supports their contention that the notification under Section read with Section should itself expressly recite that the land in respect of which the said power is being invoked is a waste or arable land and that non recital of the said fact vitiates the notification The learned counsel also sought to argue that there was no such urgency as to call for dispensing with the inquiry under Section A We may quote the following observation from the judgment of <NAME> <NAME> majority opinion From the pleadings of the parties it can also no longer be disputed that in the case of some of the appellants on fraction of this land kuchcha houses kham houses and even some pucca constructions are situated which are being used by the appellants for tethering their cattle storage of fodder and grain and also for residential purposes It reads It was next contended that in the large extent of land Acquired which has about acres there were some buildings here and there and so the acquisition of those parts of the land on which buildings were situated was unjustified since those portions were not either waste or arable lands which could be dealt with under Section of the Act We do not however find any substance in it In such a situation where there is real urgency it would be difficult to apply Section A of the Act in the case of few bits of land on which some structures are standing and to exempt the rest of the property from its application It is not necessary in this case to consider any further legality or the propriety of the application of Section of the Act to such portions of land proposed to be acquired on which super structures were standing because of the special provision which is inserted as sub section A of Section of the Act by the Land Acquisition Amendment Act which reads thus A The power to take possession under sub section may also be exercised in the case of land other than waste or arable land where the land is acquired for or in connection with sanitary improvements of any kind or planned development It was contended by Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of <ORG> Basti that a part of the land notified for acquisition was waste or arable and in support of his contention counsel referred us to certain revenue record It would not be open to the <ORG> to regard the notification as partially good and partially bad for if the State had no power to dispense with the inquiry in respect of any part of the land notified under an inquiry must be held under A giving an opportunity to persons interested in the land notified to raise their objections to the proposed acquisition and in that inquiry the persons interested cannot be restricted to raising objections in respect of land other than waste or arable land We don not think that in a case where only a fraction of a large extent of land sought to be acquired is not waste or arable the observations made in the said judgment are applicable For making the provisions of sub section applicable two things must be satisfied firstly that the land in respect of which the urgency provision is being applied is waste or arable and secondly that there is an urgency to proceed in the matter of taking immediate possession and so the right of the owner of the land for filing an objection under Section A should not be made available to him In the portion of the notification which we have extracted above it is neither mentioned that the land is waste or arable nor has it been stated that in the opinion of the Government there was any urgency to take recourse to the provisions of Section of the Act A direction to the Collector has been given to take action under Section on the ground of urgency but this is not a legal and complete fulfillment of the requirement of the law It is to be remembered that the right of a person having any interest in the property to file an objection under Section A of the Act should not be interfered with in such a casual or cavalier manner as has been done in this case The learned Judges observed that the notification neither mentions that the land is waste or arable nor does it mention that in the opinion of the government there was urgency to take recourse to the provision of Section In such a situation there is no basis for the respondent contention that the notification should itself recite the said fact nor does the said decision support their contention Secondly we are satisfied that there was material before the government in this case upon which it could have and did form the requisite opinion that it was a case calling for exercise of power under Section The material placed before the Court disclosed that the government found on due verification that there was an acute scarcity of land and there was heavy pressure for construction of houses for weaker sections and middle income group people that the <ORG> had obtained a loan of Rs that in view of the time bound programme stipulated by the lender <ORG> the Board had already appointed a large number of engineers and other subordinate staff for carrying out the said work and that holding an inquiry under Section A would have resulted in uncalled for delay endangering the entire scheme and time schedule of the <ORG> It must be remembered that the satisfaction under Section is a subjective one and that so long as there is material upon which the government could have formed the said satisfaction fairly the court would not interfere nor would it examine the material as an appellate authority This is the principle affirmed by decisions of this court not only under Section but also generally with respect to subjective satisfaction For the above reasons the appeals are allowed and the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> impugned herein as set aside WITH PETITION NO OF This writ petition is preferred by <ORG> questioning the very same notification which were questioned in the writ petitions filed in Rajasthan <ORG> and which have given rise to the aforementioned Civil Appeals This procedure is being followed by <ORG> in other matters as well It appears that the matter again came before the Hon ble Chief Minister on when he approved a note the latter half of which reads as follows Therefore it will be in the interest of broad public interest that this land of the society be regularised according to the decision of <ORG> after releasing it from acquisition as is the opinion of Honourable Minister Incharge Local Self Govt and <ORG> Minister Sub In the matter of De acquisition of land of Indira Bihar Scheme Sahkari Samiti situated in village Devri Sukhalpura Jhalana Chaur and Goliyabas It has been brought to the notice of <ORG> that some improvement has been done by you on the land covered by this scheme The learned counsel for the writ petitioners stops here and says that the above proceedings constitute a definite and final decision to de notify and de acquire the lands and that nothing more was required to be done to constitute withdrawal from acquisition within the meaning of section <ORG> reported that the decision to de acquire the lands of the petitioner society was in contravention of the earlier decision of the <ORG> contrary to law and against public interest Accepting the said report the government intimated the <ORG> that there is no question of de acquiring the said land The letter dated was also formally withdrawn on It is also stated in the said additional affidavit that the Khatedars from whom the society claimed to have purchased the said land under agreements of sale have by separate letters intimated the Secretary <ORG> and the Land Acquisition Collector as far back as th April that they had no objection to the acquisition of their lands From the above material it is clear that there was no final decision at any time to de notify the said lands Before this could be done there was a change in the government and the said tentative decision was reversed In this view of the matter it is not necessary for us to go into the question whether there was a communication of the decision of the government to the petitioner Reading the letter as a whole it cannot but be said that the possession of the land was taken by the government and was also delivered to <ORG>
