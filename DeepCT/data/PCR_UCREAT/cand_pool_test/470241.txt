Under the Cement Control Order <ORG> fixed the price at which the producers were required to sell the cement including the price of gunny bags The petitioner filed reply to the said show cause notice stating that packing material used by the cement companies is returned by the buyer and is used again and again Against that order the petitioner has preferred this petition At the time of admission the <ORG> has passed the following interim order on The short question involved in this petition is whether the cost of gunny bags packing material is required to be included or excluded while determining the value of the cement bags as required under Section i of the Central Excise Act Where under this Act the duty of excise is chargeable on any excisable goods with reference to value such value shall subject to the other provisions of this section be deemed to be a the normal price thereof that is to say the price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer is not a related person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale Provided that i xx xx xx ii Where such goods are sold by the assessee in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal at a price fixed under any law for the time being in force or at a price being the maximum fixed under any such law then notwithstanding anything contained in Clause iii of this proviso the price or the maximum price as the case may be so fixed shall in relation to the goods so sold deemed to be the normal price thereof iii xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx for the purposes of this section a assessee means the person who is liable to pay the duty of excise under this Act and includes his agent xx xx xx xx xx xx value in relation to say excisable goods i where the goods are delivered at the time of removal in a packed condition includes the cost of such packing except the cost of the packing which is of a durable nature had is returnable by the buyer to the assessee From the aforesaid section it is clear that for fixing the value of the excisable goods normal price at which such goods are ordinarily sold by the assessee to a buyer in the course of wholesale trade for delivery at the time and place of removal where the buyer is not a reached person and the price is the sole consideration for the sale is to be taken into consideration For getting benefit of this sub section the assessee must satisfy these conditions namely i packing material is of durable nature and is returnable ii there is agreement between the assessee and the buyer for the return of such packing material gunny bags and iii the cost of such packing material is either not included in the price or it is required to be refunded to the buyer on the return of packing material The question which has to be asked in each case is Is the packing in this case returnable by the buyer to the assessee and obviously it cannot be said that the packing is returnable by the buyer to the assessee there is an arrangement between them that it shall be returned Does it mean physically capable of being returned or does it postulate an arrangement under which the packing is returnable While interpreting this word we must bear in mind that what Section i excludes from computation is cost of packing which is of a durable nature and is returnable by the buyer to the assessee It is not the physical capability of the packing to be returned which is the determining factor because in the event the words by the buyer to the assessee need not have found a place in the section they would be superfluous The question which has to be asked in each case is Is the packing in this case returnable by the buyer to the assessee and obviously it cannot be said that the packing is returnable by the buyer to the assessee unless there is no arrangement between them that it shall be returned Here in the present case it is not the contention of the petitioner that there was any such arrangement for return of the packing by the wholesale buyers to the petitioner nor is there any evidence to that effect In the present case also it is not the contention of the petitioner that there was any such arrangement for return of gunny bags by the wholesale dealers or authorised dealers to the petitioner nor the petitioner has produced any evidence to that effect before the Assistant Collector There is nothing on the record to the effect that second hand unserviceable bags were returned to the petitioner and that he had refunded the cost of the said bags and what was the price of the second hand serviceable bags which were returned As there is no material on the record of this case or no material is produced by the petitioner before the Assistant Collector the contention raised by the learned advocate for the petitioner requires to be rejected This means that if there is an agreement between the assessee and the buyer that buyer was entitled to return the packing material and get refund of the cost of packing material then that cost is required to be excluded for the purpose of Section i of the Act <ORG> has relied upon the material which was produced on the record and arrived at a conclusion that cement if a controlled commodity and the sale of cement was fully controlled by various orders and directions issued by the Cement Controller The Cement Controller has fixed the packing charges separately and a specific provision was made in Annexure A to the effect that the manufacturers should purchase empty bags at the rates specified by the Cement Controller There were further documents on the record to show arrangement that purchaser should return the empty bags to the petitioner The Court therefore held that there was a statutory condition which constituted an arrangement between the seller and the purchaser or portland cement to the effect that the gunny bags were returnable In the present case there is no such material on record However at this page after the lapse years Mr <NAME> learned advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner has filed an application for allowing him to produce on record the authorisation order issued by the Cement Controller whereby Project Officer <ORG> Bombay was directed to purchase from the petitioner factory tons of portland cement It is an admitted fact that the price of cement and gunny bags is fixed by statutory order Along with the cement its packing material i gunny bags are sold to the buyer and for that price is fixed under the statutory order In our view exception to Section i would be applicable only when there has been a sale of packed material and a separate price is charged for the cost of durable and returnable packing and there is an agreement or arrangement between the parties for return of the said packing material and refund of its cost At the time of hearing of this matter the learned advocate for the petitioner has also filed Civil Application No of for amending the petition by adding the ground that as Rule of the Central Excise Rules was amended with effect from and as there is no saving clause the proceedings initiated under the old Rule would come to an end With regard to this contention learned advocate Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the respondents vehemently submitted that the decisions rendered by this Court in the case of <ORG> supra and in the case of <ORG> supra are not followed by this Court in the case of <ORG> Ahmedabad <ORG> The <ORG> further held that there was omission of Rule and as it is not a provision of Central Act or Regulation Section of the General Clauses Act cannot be pressed into service The Court relied upon the decision in the case of <ORG> and the decision in the case of <ORG> and held that Section of the General Clauses Act cannot apply to cases of omissions of Rules The Court further arrived at the conclusion that Rules and A which were existing prior to were omitted and new Rule was substituted and as there was no saving clause of Rule or A the authorities were not competent to adjudicate upon the show cause notice issued under Rule prior to It further held that even otherwise the view taken by <ORG> on the applicability of Section of the General Clauses Act ran counter to the view taken by the Constitution Bench of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> Rayala Corporation These decisions cannot be treated as precedent for deciding the question as to what is the effect of partial amendment of Rule I of the Rules Thus the provision which came up for consideration before two different Division Benches of <ORG> was altogether different There is difference between amendment of rule and repeal of rule or for that matter amendment of any provision of statute and repeal of statute The contention that there is no difference between amendment and repeal cannot be accepted The decision of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> Union of India reported in AIR SC does not lay down the principle that there is no difference between amendment and repeal But reading the entire decision and particularly paragraphs and of the report it becomes clear that howsoever fine the distinction may be but there is distinction between amendment of a statute and repeal of a statute For the aforesaid reasons the decisions rendered by <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra and <NAME> supra are of no help to the petitioners and they are not required to be gone into in further details In fairness to the learned Counsels appearing for the petitioners it must be stated that during the course of dictation of the judgment Mr <NAME> who was present on behalf of Mr <NAME> for <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> fairly stated that we need not go into the correctness or otherwise of the decisions of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra and in the case of <NAME> supra However we may make it clear that we have reservations about the correctness of these two decisions and we prima facie feel that the relevant decisions of <ORG> on the point were not brought to the notice of this Court In view of the aforesaid observations made by <ORG> of this Court it is apparent that the Court has not followed the aforesaid two decisions but as there was concession from the learned counsel appearing for the petitioners the point was not pursued further With great respect it is difficult for us also to agree with the view taken in the aforesaid two decisions namely <ORG> and <ORG> for the following reasons in short The aforesaid two cases are decided on the basis of the <ORG> judgment in the case of <ORG> supra where in the <ORG> was only required to deal with the effect of repeal of statute i the Defence of India Rules which were in force for temporary period There is no question of repeal because Rules A and were substituted by Notification dated by Rule Even in the case of <ORG> supra it is not held that the proceedings which are initiated would come to an end as soon as rules are repealed This would be clear from the following observations The argument of Mr <NAME> was that even if there was a contravention of Rule A by the accused when that Rule was in force the act of contravention cannot be held to be a thing done or omitted to be done under that rule so that after that rule has been omitted no prosecution in respect of that contravention can be instituted We are inclined to agree with the submission of Mr <NAME> that the language contained in Clause of the Defence of India Amendment Rules can only afford protection to action already taken while the rule was in force but cannot justify initiation of a new proceeding which will not be a thing done or omitted to be done under the rule but a new act of initiating a proceeding after the rule had ceased to exist Even with regard to the temporary statute rights and liabilities created under the repealed statute are not ipso facto terminated Liability to pay duty of excise arises immediately when excisable goods are removed <ORG> has held that bye laws and the rules made under a rule making power conferred by a statute do not stand on the same footing After discussion of a number of judgments the <ORG> held that the decisions which were referred could not be understood to mark a radical departure from the fundamental principle of construction that rules made under a statute must be treated as exactly as if they were in the Act and are of the same effect as if contained in the Act The Central Excise Rules are framed in exercise of powers conferred by Sections and of the Central Excise Act Section of the Act empowers <ORG> to make rules to carry into effect the purposes of the Act The rules inter alia provide for assessment and collection of duties of excise and the manner of collection of duties of excise its refund procedure for removal of excisable goods licence and the powers of the concerned officers It provided in express terms that provisions of Section of the General Clauses Act shall apply in respect of the repeal The Court dealt with the effect of the repeal and held that without the said express provision Section read with Section of the General Clauses Act might have achieved the said result but ex abundanti cautala and to place the matter beyond any controversy Section of the General Clauses Act was expressly made applicable to the repeal The Court further held that under Section of the General Clauses Act so far it is material to the present case the repeal did not affect the right of the railway to recover the freight or the liability of the defendants to pay the same and the remedy in respect of the said right and liability The Court further held that the result was that Ordinance of and the rules made thereunder must be held to continue to be in force in respect of the said right and liability accrued or incurred before the said Ordinance was repealed and the remedies available thereunder But in express terms it declared that the provisions of of the General Clauses Act of shall apply in respect of the repeal Without the said express provision Section read with Section of the General Clauses Act might have achieved the said result but ex abundanti cautela and to place the matter beyond any controversy of the General Clauses Act was expressly made applicable to the repeal What was the effect of the expiry of the repealing Ordinance on the said liability continued after repeal in respect of past transactions The repealing Ordinance being a temporary one expired after it fulfilled its purpose The decisions relating to the repeal of a temporary Ordinance with a saving clause have no bearing in the present context for in that case the repealed Ordinance in so far as it was kept alive could not have a larger lease of life than the repealed and the repealing Ordinances possessed The court has also observed therein that Excise duty is primarily a duty on the production or manufacture of goods produced or manufactured within the country With regard to interpretation of Section of the General Clauses Act it has been laid down that in cases where there is a repeal of enactment followed by a fresh legislation the line of inquiry would be not whether the new Act expressly keeps alive old rights and liabilities but whether it manifests an intention to destroy them What is unaffected by repeal of the statute is a right acquired or accrued under it and not a mere hope or expectation of or liberty to apply for acquiring a right If however the right created by the statute is of an enduring character and has vested in the person that right cannot be taken away because the statute by which it was created has expired Under that provision the assessee was entitled to carry forward to be set off such losses against the profits made from that business in future In that case the <ORG> has held that when there is a repeal of a statute accompanied by re enactment of a law on the same subject the provision of the new enactment would have to be looked into not for the purpose of ascertaining whether the consequences envisaged by Section of the General Clauses Act ensued or not Section would indeed be attracted unless the new legislation manifests a contrary intention but only for the purpose of determining whether the provisions in the new statute indicate a different intention But there is a manifest distinction between an investigation which is to decide whether some right should be or should not be given Rules and A were substituted by Rule by amendment dated No provision is made while substituting Rules and A by Rule or by substituting Rule by Section A to the effect that pending proceedings would come to an end or accrued liability to pay excise duty would not remain in force Therefore there was neither any repeal nor omission of an enactment but continuance of the same provision as part of the Act the only difference being that prior to it was in one part of the Act and subsequent to that it was in another part of the same Act In our view the show cause notices issued or actions taken under substituted Rules and A or ommitted Rule of the Central Excise Rules would not come to an end as soon as rules are substituted The question that requires consideration by a Larger Bench is Whether the notices issued or action taken under substituted Rules and A or omitted Rule of the Central Excuse Rules would stand discharged or terminated upon substitution or omission as the case may be It is clarified that because the learned advocate for the petitioner had raised the contention that show cause notice issued under Rule would not survive in view of substitution of Rules and A by Rule on we have not passed the final order in the matter even though we have arrived at the conclusion that the order Annexure passed by the Assistant Collector confirming the demand for recovery of differential duty amounting to Rs We direct the office to place this mater before the learned Chief Justice for passing appropriate orders for placing it before a Larger Bench
