It is important to emphasise that we are not a court of Appeal and accordingly are not free to debate such questions as might seem to us to arise in the case however important they may appear to be We have certain other powers and indeed it will be necessary to exercise them in one of the cases heard along with these we shall deal separately with that but these powers only enable us to send the matter back and compel a reference Until that is done we have no power to debate questions which have not been referred The definition given in the Act is that agricultural Income means a any rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes and is either assessed to land revenue in British India or subject to a local rate assessed and collected by officers of the <ORG> as such any income derived from such land by i agriculture It is land which is used for agricultural purposes and either assessed to land revenue in British India or subject to a local rate assessed and collected by officers of the <ORG> as such It is admitted that the land in all these cases is either assessed to land revenue or is subject to a local rate assessed and collected by officers of the <ORG> as such and that therefore to that extent the income complies with the definition The learned Judges were dealing with the expression agricultural land in the Constitution Act and after pointing out that it had not been defined there said at page It must accordingly be understood in the sense which it ordinarily bears in the English language and again at page As regards the connotation of the word agricultural it may be pointed out that agriculture has been variously defined in several English and Indian status for the purposes of these statutes and it is neither useful nor legitimate to attempt to draw any inference from these statutory definitions for the purpose of determining the ordinary connotation of the word in the English language The other cases in this class though dealing with special Acts base the decision on general grounds and to that extent are more in point The only decisions in this class which in our opinion lay down general rules are best referred to in the language of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> Their Lordships confirmed a decision of <ORG> to the effect that land used as a tea garden was used for agricultural purposes In the judgment of <ORG> which was generally approved by their Lordships it was observed that the term agricultural land is used in the Act of in its widest sense to denote all land which is From here we proceed to consider cases under the Income tax Act But that apart nearly every rule has its exceptions and the pasturing of cattle is so closely allied to agriculture that it has become to be considered part and parcel of it and the meaning of the term is now so well established that there is no longer room for doubt All we need say with respect to them excluding of course the judgment of <ORG> is that in so far as their more general observations agree with the distinction we make they support us and in so far as they do not then with great respect we differ from them It was suggested in some of the cases that object of exempting agricultural income from tax was that it already pays tax in another form namely land revenue or ceases and therefore the idea is to avoid double taxation The learned judges point out there that the fact that the Act requires the income not only to be subject to land revenue or ceases but also to be derived from agriculture or from land used for agricultural purposes shows that incomes from other types of land are not exempt even though they pay land revenue It cannot fall under the head income from property because Section defines that and there is no room for forest produce there Central Act apply all over India while Provincial Act have limited provincial application also Acts touching the same topics can and often do differ from Province to Province It would be impossible for us to conclude that the words in a Central Act have one meaning in one Province and another in another It would be impossible for us to hold that his income from forests is exempt here while taxable elsewhere because the same words used in the Income Tax Act mean one thing in one place and another in another we must come to the absurd conclusion that the same words are to be interpreted by <ORG> in one sense when it is exercising its original jurisdiction or sitting on an appeal from a decree made under that jurisdiction and in a different sense when it is sitting on an appeal from <ORG> and further that the legislature has by the same form of words intended to make one law for the mofussil <ORG> and another for those of the Presidency towns Mr <NAME> stressed the difference between the words any rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes in section a and the words any income derived from such land by agriculture In our judgment the first clause refers to income derived from land which is used directly for agricultural purposes and the second to by professes such as the selling of milk the pasturing of cattle etc provided the endeavour is agricultural and provided it is reasonably connected with land used for agricultural purposes An attempt was also made to get us to take into consideration the previous practice of the department and the instructions embodied in the Income tax Manual Having enumerated the general rule we will now proceed to examine the facts in each case separately and determine how far they conform to the rule we have enumerated It appears from the order of reference as also from the decision of <ORG> in appeal that the forest here was not a cultivated one and was of spontaneous growth But the decision was based on the Tenancy Act and it was made clear that that Act had extended the definition of agriculture Our answer to the question referred in this case is that the Rs also from the sale of tendu leaves which are used in the manufacture of bidis In the circumstances the burden being on the assessee to bring himself within the purview of the exemption and he not having proved that the forest was cultivated by him in the sense that its produce was due to the skill and labour which he expended on it as opposed to produce which would come in any way from natural cause despite inaction on his part we are of opinion that the Rs The question has been posed in much the same language in all three cases except for the figure We do not feel free to differ from this decision though had the matter been res integra we might have taken another view It was contended by the learned acting Advocate General that the decision is distinguishable and that it is in any event wrong The ground of distinction is said to be that the question posed there narrows the scope of the enquiry to the Central Provinces Tenancy Act whereas here there are no such limitations It is true the Central Provinces Tenance Act is expressly mentioned in the question referred in that case whereas it is not mentioned in the present cases but that makes no difference As regards the contention that the decision is in any event wrong we find that the matter is debatable and that it is as easy for a Judge acting judicially to reach the one conclusion as the other In our view either the legislature should step in and say which view should prevail or we should in this Province accept the view of our own <ORG> Miscellaneous Civil Case No of raises the following additional question Whether there was any material to hold that the bazar dues and nazrana receipts of Rs We asked counsel to point out any evidence to us which would indicate the nature of the nazrana and he admitted that was none We hold there is no material and that the sum of Rs
