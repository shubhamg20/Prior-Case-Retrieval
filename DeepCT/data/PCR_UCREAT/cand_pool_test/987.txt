This appeal with special leave is directed against the order of <ORG> Madras A Bench dated August made in I A No of allowing the appeal and reversing the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner in I A No of for the assessment year dated June whereby the Appellate Assistant Commissioner had allowed the appellant claim for a reduction of his total income by Rs The appellant was called upon to explain these entries and he made his statement on January before the Income tax Officer who recorded the same That affidavit showed that she had been residing in <NAME> till March and thereafter she came away to Madurai in the last week of that months along with her granddaughter <NAME> that on account of communal troubles which broke out subsequently in the neighbourhood of her residence at <NAME> she decided to settle down in Madurai permanently that she was then staying with her granddaughter <NAME> and her husband the appellant that besides the jewels given to her daughter and after her death to her granddaughter and the sum of Rs On March the Income tax Officer pointed out that on a former occasion <NAME> had made a statement which according to him showed that she had given all her jewels to the wife of the appellant on the occasion of her marriage in and enquired which of the two statements i one made on the previous occasion on November or that made in her affidavit dated February was correct He further asked the appellant whether he had any evidence to prove that she actually possessed considerable jewels and sovereigns When this notice under section was served on the appellant he obtained three affidavits from three respectable residents of <ORG> who knew <NAME> intimately and who could speak about her status and wealth These affidavits were submitted by the appellant along with his reply to the penalty notice dated April which recounted all the facts which supported the contentions of the appellant and pointed out that there was no discrepancy between the statements made in the affidavit dated November and that dated February and the affidavits dated April which had been obtained by him from the parties at <ORG> above mentioned showed that <NAME> was possessed of plenty of jewels gold and sovereigns which were sold by the appellant as aforesaid at Porbandar having been armed with the power of attorney granted in his favour by her On the very same day i April the appellant filed an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner against the order of the Income tax Officer dated March being I A No of The appellant replied by his letter dated May pointing out that the deponents were residents of Ranavav in Porbandar which was more than miles from Madurai that <NAME> was aged and <NAME> was aged and it would not be reasonable to compel them to undertake the journey to Madurai as it might well cost their lives that the affidavit themselves gave full particulars about the deponents that the reasonable course to be adopted was either to administer in interrogatories to the said persons on the matters referred to in the affidavits or to send a letter of request to <ORG> of Porbandar to examine the said persons on commission for purpose of verifying the correctness of the contents of the affidavits This statement obviously had reference to the letter dated May which had been sent by <ORG> in reply to the letter dated December addressed to them by the Income tax Officer He had also asked them to send along with their reply a copy of the account of the appellant as found in their books for the year An early reply was solicited in order to enable him to report to <ORG> Delhi <NAME> stated that he had been asked by <NAME> to keep watch over her house and household things during her absence from Ranavav as she went to Madurai for a short period that she thereafter changed her mind about coming back to Ranavav on account of communal troubles and sent the appellant who was the son in law of her daughter to dispose of all the furniture and valuables lying in the house that he was present at the time of the removal of valuables from an old treasure which was in the house that he also witnessed the removal of the ornaments and the sovereigns that he did ask for the authority which she had given to the appellant for the removal of valuables as while going to Madurai she had particularly asked him to keep a watch as a good amount by way of gold jewellery and sovereigns was lying in the house and that the ornaments which she had inherited from her father and husband whose only heir she was were of old type The Income tax Officer <NAME> enclosed these statements along with his letter dated March addressed to the Additional Income tax Officer Madurai wherein he stated that he had taken an opportunity of visiting Ranavav which was miles away from Porbandar that he had seen the house belonging to her which was a pacca building but of old style and if put in market would not fetch more than Rs He further stated that there were few cloth dealers in Ranavav and they were mostly Hindus who did not know her but there was one Mohammadan cloth dealer who knew her and who was also cross examined by him and his answers were also sent by him along with the letter This letter appears to have put an end to further enquiries in the matter of the said transaction in connection with the penalty notice and on December a letter was addressed by the Additional Income tax Officer Madurai to the appellant intimating that the penalty proceedings under section instituted for the assessment year had been dropped The appeal which had been filed by the appellant before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner being I A No of came up for hearing in about June On her death I took possession of the jewels and I was keeping the same for the benefit of my only granddaughter <NAME> aforesaid The Appellant Assistant Commissioner interpreted this affidavit to mean that all the jewels which she had referred in paragraph of that affidavit and which she stated she had given to <NAME> the wife of the appellant on the occasion of her marriage in had reference only to considerable jewels which she had given to her daughter <NAME> which she had taken possession of on the latter death and which she was keeping with her for the benefit of her only granddaughter <NAME> The Appellate Assistant Commissioner accordingly held that in the face of such overwhelming evidence there was no justification at all for disputing the appellant claim that the credits did really represent <NAME> monies and on no account could they be treated as profits camouflaged and both the items aggregating to Rs This appeal was disposed of by an order made by <ORG> on August whereby the <ORG> allowed the respondent appeal and vacated the order passed by the Appellate Assistant Commissioner to the extent of Rs to the letter addressed to them by the Income tax Officer Madurai dated December till after the issue of the notice under section on the appellant was also adversely commented upon and it was observed that the old lady in her declining years gave away all she had including gold and cash excepting jewellery etc Although it was agreed by the parties before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner that the material which has been collected by the Income tax Officer at Junagad be treated as evidence in the assessment proceedings it was not considered by the <ORG> that there was no proof or evidence as to how <NAME> kept this vast wealth and in whose safe custody it was kept that the handwritten patti given by showed that the gold was given on two different dates on February tolas and on February sovereigns and it was not explained why it was necessary to give gold ornaments bars and sovereigns in two different instalments that there was no specific entry in the appellant books regarding his travel to Porbandar and return and that there was a consolidated entry on March in his books showing expenses of journeys made to Madras Bombay Porbandar etc and that clearly showed that the appellant returned sometimes prior to March and as such it was inconceivable for the appellant to put his gold in the hands of a firm at Porbandar which had not even the decency to reply to the quarry of the Income tax Officer and to have come away without receiving the sums due to him and that the different modes of remitting one for the sum of Rs There is ample material to support this The appellant thereupon filed a petition being No of under section of the Income tax Act in <ORG> at Madras on September and <ORG> also by its order dated August dismissed the petition observing that the finding of the <ORG> that the total credit of Rs in favour of <NAME> appearing in the books of account of the appellant represented the income of the appellant was a finding of fact and that in their opinion there was certainly evidence on record to support that finding and the circumstances and the probabilities of the case were strongly in favour of the conclusion of the <ORG> The appellant thereafter filed an application in <ORG> on January for leave to appeal to this court which was dismissed on March with the result that the appellant filed in this court a petition for special leave to appeal under article of the Constitution on August By its order dated January this court granted special leave to appeal against the order dated August of <ORG> Madras in I A No of and that is how this appeal has come up for hearing and final disposal before us We have set out the facts in minute detail as we are setting aside the order of <ORG> and remanding the matter back to it in order to reconsider the same A finding on a question of fact is open to attack under section as erroneous in law when there is no evidence to support it or if it is perverse that no attempt was made to furnish a stock tally and that a mere trial balance sheet had been prepared and submitted to the Income tax Officer by the appellant were not sufficient by themselves to lead to an inference that there were undisclosed profits earned by the appellant in his said business It was submitted that no investigation appears to have been made by the Income tax Officer as regards those circumstances and no explanation was asked for from the appellant in regard to the same that the low rate of profits earned in the business might have been due to various causes which would have come to light had the appellant been examined by the Income tax Officer in that behalf and had been called upon to explain the same and that a trial balance sheet without any touching up was indeed more reliable than a balance sheet prepared by an assessee after due deliberation It was further submitted that the observation of <ORG> that the departmental authorities ought to have examined the veracity of the appellant accounts was also based on a conjecture that the books of account of the appellant did not represent the true state of affairs and was contrary to the statements contained in the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner to the effect that no defects or any other suspicious feature had been found by the Income tax Officer in the accounts of the appellant that his past history was good and that therefore the suspicion of the Income tax Officer was not based on any material that as a matter of fact the income tax returns submitted by the appellant in the previous assessment years had been accepted by the income tax authorities and he was assessed to income tax on the basis of those returns after duly examining his books of account for the relevant periods and before this enquiry was started by the Income tax Officer for the assessment year in regard to cash credits standing in the name of <NAME> the correctness of the books of account had never been assailed which had been given by <NAME> to the wife of the appellant in the year as stated by her in her affidavit dated November This circumstance also did not lead to any inference of undisclosed profits made by the appellant in his business during the assessment year in question and it was urged that the conclusion if any reached in that behalf by the appellate <ORG> was based on mere conjectures The affidavit dated November made by her had to be read as a whole and all the jewels referred to only her in paragraph of that affidavit obviously referred to the considerable jewels which according to her statement in paragraph thereof she had given to her only daughter <NAME> and which she had taken possession of the latter death and kept with her for the benefit of her only granddaughter <NAME> the wife of the appellant which had been given by her to the wife of the appellant in the year and she incidentally referred in paragraphs and of the affidavit to the jewellery which she had given to the wife of the appellant on the occasion of her marriage in but that appears to have been the value of the house as constructed and there was evidence to show that at the time of the enquiry made by <ORG> <NAME> it was valued at Rs There was nothing incredible about her keeping such a large amount of jewellery gold and sovereigns in her own house at her native place Even though she was about years old there was nothing to show that she was ailing when she left for Madurai in early and if regard be had to the longevity of life of these people in Saurashtra as also to the fact that not only in but also in the year of grace she was yet alive the mere fact of her being years old was not sufficient to create any apprehension in her mind that she was going to pass away in the near future jeopardizing the treasure which she possessed in her house Moreover there was evidence that she had secreted these valuables in an old treasure which was in the house vide the statement of <NAME> in his examination by <ORG> <NAME> dated March <NAME> was also looking after her and as a matter of fact he had been asked by her to keep a watch over her house when she left Ranavav for Madurai as aforesaid and if she had entertained the idea of returning from Madurai to Ranavav after some time there was really no necessity for her to take away these valuables jewellery gold and sovereigns from the old treasure where she had kept them and carry the same along with her to Madurai It would appear that she normally expected to live for some time more and even if she died perchance they did not appear to be much danger of anybody finding these valuables from the old treasure unless she herself gave information to anyone in regard to the same It was difficult to understand what connection there was between the losses alleged to have been suffered by the appellant in his business and the Pandora box of gold lying at his disposal in <NAME> <ORG> obviously forgot that when the Income tax Officer Madurai had by his letter dated May that these deponents were staying at Ranavav and <NAME> which was more than miles from Madurai and suggested that either interrogatories be administered to them or a letter of request be sent to <ORG> of <NAME> to examine those persons on commission <NAME> had also made a similar statement in his examination that the ornaments were of old type which she had inherited from her father and husband whose only heir she was That information had been gathered by the Additional Income tax Officer <NAME> after having duly communicated with the Additional Income tax Officer <NAME> in connection with the penalty notice addressed to the appellant and the Income tax Officer <NAME> the penalty notice addressed to the appellant and the Income tax Officer <NAME> in pursuance of the instructions given to him in that behalf had conducted the inquiry at that end He had examined several persons including <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and also made a report on date March and all this information was in the file of the appellant There was evidence on record to show how <NAME> kept this vast wealth in an old treasure in the house itself vide the statement of <NAME> before the Income tax Officer <NAME> on March There was therefore no question of any safe custody in regard to them and it was also in evidence that when she left Ranavav for Madurai in early she asked her neighbour <NAME> to keep a watch over the house inasmuch as a good amount by way of gold and sovereigns was lying in the house vide the statement of <NAME> ibid In places like these in the interior of Kathiawar there was no question of any other safe custody They were respectable Shroffs and merchants and there was nothing surprising if after the first remittance of Rs in their letter dated May that they had misplaced the letter of the Income tax Officer Madurai dated December and hence could not reply to the same earlier it was urged was a reasonable explanation and <ORG> was not justified in criticising the firm of Messrs <NAME> therefore submitted that the appellant did all that lay in his power to help the income tax authorities to arrive at the proper conclusion that his conduct all throughout was honest and above board and that the whole of the decision of <ORG> was vitiated inasmuch as it was based on mere conjectures surmises and suspicions and not supported by any evidence whatever on a misreading of the statements contained in <NAME> affidavit dated November and on improper rejection of evidence appearing in the file of the appellant consisting of the correspondence between the Income tax Officer Madurai and the Income tax Officers at Junagad and Porbandar and the statements made by the witnesses before the latter The only thing which he could point out was the passage from the order of <ORG> which criticised the impropriety of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner having looked into the evidence partially and arriving at his conclusion without giving the <ORG> an opportunity of leading further evidence by way of tracing the sale outside on remand This passage certainly did not show that <ORG> had applied its mind to the evidence which was there on the file of the appellant in the shape of information gathered subsequently and it merely confirmed that <ORG> had improperly rejected that evidence That being the position <NAME> could not very well resist the order which we proposed to make setting aside the order of <ORG> and remanding the matter back to it for dealing with the same in accordance with law after taking into consideration all the circumstances adverted to in the arguments of <NAME> the whole evidence which was available in the file of the appellant and such further evidence as the parties may be advised to lead before it We are aware that <ORG> is a fact finding <ORG> and if it arrives at its own conclusions of fact after due consideration of the evidence before it this court will not interfere It is necessary however that every fact for and against the assessee must have been considered with due care and the <ORG> must have given its finding in a manner which would clearly indicate what were the questions which arose for determination what was the evidence pro and contra in regard to each one of them and what were was the reached on the evidence on record before it The conclusions reached by the <ORG> should not be coloured by any irrelevant considerations or matters of prejudice and if there are any circumstances which required to be explained by the assessee the assessee should be given an opportunity of doing so In the result we set aside the order of <ORG> in I A No of dated August and remand the matter back to <ORG> Madras A Bench to reconsider the same in accordance with law in the light of the observations made above Costs of this appeal will abide the result of the decision of <ORG> reached hereafter
