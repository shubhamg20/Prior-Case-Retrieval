HEADNOTE A suit was filed by the appellants to challenge the imposition of a rate by <ORG> on vacant lands situate within the municipal limits The rate was levied under section of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act read with Explanation to of the Act Rule A read with rule was ultra vires It was further contended that the assessment based on rule A read with rule was ultra vires and the assessment list prepared pursuant to the said rule was illegal and void The trial court held that rule A read with rule was illegal and void and beyond the authority given to municipality under of the Act <ORG> reversed the order of the trial court and the appellants came to this court after getting a certificate That though mathematically it may be possible to arrive at the same figure of the actual tax to be paid as a rate whether based on a capital value or based on annual value the levying of the rate as a percentage of the capital value would still be illegal for the reason that the law provides that it should be levied on the annual value and not otherwise Rate is the name given to an impost levied by a local authority to raise funds for its expenses irrespective of the basis on which it is levied There is no authority for the proposition that the word rate has acquired a technical meaning indicating a levy on the basis only of yearly value of property In our country legislatures have used both the words tax and rates to indicate the impost by a local authority and in some cases have permitted a local authority to levy a property tax at a percentage of its capital value There is nothing to indicate that in the explanation the words capital value had been used only for the purpose of finding out the annual value from it and not to form by itself the basis of the valuation on which the rate is to be imposed The Act imposes a tax on lands and is within item of List of the Government of India Act The Judgments of the Court were delivered by WANCHOO This appeal on a certificate granted by <ORG> arises out of a suit brought by the appellants to challenge the imposition of a rate by the respondent <ORG> on vacant lands situate within the municipal limits The rate was levied under of the Bombay Municipal Boroughs Act No XVIII of hereinafter referred to as the Act read with the explanation to of the Act The trial court held that A read with was illegal and void and beyond the authority given to the municipality under of the Act inasmuch as it would amount to taxing the open lands as assets of individuals within the meaning of item of List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Government of India Act <ORG> therefore held that A read with was not ultra vires As to the other contention that the rule was ultra vires ss and of the Act <ORG> held that even if it be assumed that by adopting the basis of capital value the municipality must determine the annual value of the property and levy rate on such value it made no difference to the result as the municipality might levy much higher rate of tax on the annual value of the property determined on the basis of its capital value Thereupon the appellants applied for a certificate of fitness to enable them to appeal to this <ORG> which was granted and that is how the matter has come up before us We shall first consider the point whether A read with is ultra vires ss and of the Act The relevant part thereof is as follows A Municipality before imposing a tax shall observe the following preliminary procedure a it shall by resolution passed at a general meeting select for the purpose one or other of the taxes specified in section and approve rules prepared for the purposes of clause of section prescri bing the tax selected and in such resolution and in such rules specify It is urged that by the time the Act was passed the words rate on lands or buildings signified a tax not on their capital value but on their annual value and therefore when permitted the municipality to impose a rate on buildings or lands or both it only gave it jurisdiction to impose a tax by way of certain percentage on the annual value of lands or buildings and not by way of a percentage on their capital value where this Court held that the expression sale of goods was at the time when the Government of India Act was enacted a term of well recognised legal import in the general law relating to sale of goods and in the legislative practice relating to that topic and must be interpreted in Entry in List II in Sch The word rate thus gradually came to be applied to such local taxation till we find that the Poor Rate Act was passed providing for certain appeals and other remedies to persons on whom rates were levied Then came the Poor Rate Assessment and Collection Act which by its first section provided that the occupier of any rateable hereditament shall be entitled to deduct the amount paid by him in respect of any poor rate assessed upon such hereditament from the rent due or accruing due to the owner and every such payment shall be valid discharge of the rent to the extent of the rate so paid thus affording relief to the occupier This history will show that the rate was assessed generally on the occupier of lands and buildings on account of his beneficial occupation of such lands and buildings The very fact that the rate was assessed on the occupier of lands and buildings leads clearly to the inference that the rate was to be levied on the annual value of the land or building to the occupier and had nothing to do with the capital value of the land and building to the owner This Act was passed about the same time as the Act with which we are concerned and it provided for the levy of a general rate and the rateable value of a hereditament was to be the net annual value thereof Gross value was defined to mean the rent at which a hereditament might reasonably be expected to let from year to year and hereditament meant any lands tenements hereditaments or property which were or might become liable to any rate in respect of which the valuation list was made under the Act This history of the use of the word rate for purposes of local taxation in English Law clearly shows that the word rate was used with respect to a tax which was levied on the net annual value or rateable value of lands and buildings and not on their capital value The methods in use for the purpose of arriving at rateable value were generally three In England the usual percentage in the case where the property was used for commercial purposes was per centum for the building and per centum for the land <NAME> also mentions the same three ways of valuing this beneficial occupation for the purpose of arriving at the rateable value or annual value of lands and buildings in order to levy the rate see Chap <NAME> further points out that the Poor Relief Act of did not attempt accurately to define how the value of land was to be measured and it was for the first time in that the first statutory definition of net annual value was given in the Parochial Assessments Act thus giving statutory recognition to the pratice which was being followed till then and this definition was the rent at which the hereditament might reasonably be expected to let from year to year free of all usual tenant rates and taxes and tithe commutation rent charge if any and deducting therefrom the probable average annual cost of the repairs insurance and other expenses if any necessary to maintain it in a state to command such rent see pp There was some apparent if not real conflict of decisions upon the question whether interest on capital value or on cost might be considered at all but the difficulty disappears if the rule be thus stated the measure of net annual value is defined by statute as the rent which might reasonably be expected interest on cost or on capital value cannot be substituted for the statutory measure but in the ab sence of the best evidence that is actual rents it can be looked at as prima facie evidence in order to answer the question of fact what rent a tenant may reasonably be expected to pay It will thus be clear from the various statutes to which we have referred and the various books on rating in England that the rate always had the meaning of a tax on the annual value or rateable value of lands or buildings and this annual value or rateable value is arrived at by one of three modes namely i actual rent fetched by land or building where it is actually let ii where it is not let rent based on hypothetical tenancy particularly in the case of buildings and iii where either of these two modes is not available by valuation based on capital value from which annual value has to be found by applying a suitable percentage which may not be the same for lands and buildings and it was this position which was finally brought out in bold relief by the Rating and Valuation Act Section thereof provided for valuation of property assessable to property taxes in these terms In order to fix the rateable value of any building or land assessable to a property tax there shall be deducted from the amount of the annual rent for which such land or building might reasonably be expected to let from year to year a sum equal to ten per centum of the said annual rent and the said deduction shall be in lieu of all allowances for repairs or on any other account whatever Section provides for valuation of buildings and lands for the purposes of rate and it is the annual value of lands and buildings which is the basis of the rate and that annual value is deemed to be the gross annual rent at which the land might reasonably be expected to let from year to year subject to certain deductions It has not used the word rate but the levy is on the annual value of buildings and lands and the annual value by is deemed to be the gross annual rent at which the lands might reasonably be expected to let from year to year or from month to month subject to certain deductions It will thus be seen that all Indian statutes till dealing with municipal taxation impose a tax on the annual value of lands or buildings without always using the word rate The owners arc made primarily liable in some municipalities while in others both the owners and occupiers are made liable As the tax under a is on occupation it necessarily follows that it could only be levied on the annual value It will thus be seen that these Acts which were passed between and which repeal the earlier Acts also provide for taxation on lands and buildings and though the word rate is not used in any of these Acts the tax is still on the annual value of lands and buildings This shows that there was a uniform legislative history and practice in India also though sometimes the impost was called a tax on lands and buildings and at others a rate It will be clear further that in India up to the time the Act with which we are concerned was passed the word rate had acquired the same meaning which it undoubtedly had in English legislative history and practice up to the year when the Rating and Valuation Act came to be passed consolidating the various rates prevalent in England It may be added herewith some advantage that the word tax in the opening words of has been used in a general and all pervasive sense as defined in of the Act and not in any restricted sense and therefore when the word rate is used in cl i it was clearly used not only in the specific and limited sense but also with the intention to convey the meaning that it had acquired by the time the Act was passed Therefore when the first clause of gives power to the municipality to impose a rate on buildings or lands it meant that kind of tax which had acquired a special meaning and was known as rate in the legislative history and practice of England as well as of India upto then Therefore the fact that the explanation used the words the basis of valuation may be capital it does not mean that the tax would be at such and such percentage of the capital it only means that in order to arrive at the annual value for purposes of levying a rate which is a tax on the annual value the municipality may use the capital value and then a percentage thereon to arrive at the annual value Therefore we are of opinion taking into account the fact that the word rate has been used in the first clause to the explanation when it says that in the case of lands basis of valuation may be capital only means that method of valuation which was in vogue in England and which we have described as the third method of valuation may be used to arrive at the annual value from the capital value and the rate may then be determined as a tax on the annual value The amendment was made in before the Government of India Act had come into force with its separate legislative lists and there could be no question then of the competence of the provincial legislature to make such an amendment Therefore when the explanation uses these words it must in our opinion be held to refer to that well known method of valuation prevailing in England with respect to levy of rates and cannot be read to mean a percentage of the capital value itself At any rate there are no express words in the explanation to that effect and therefore it should be read to mean the third method of valuation in force in England to which we have already referred We may add that we express no opinion as to the validity of this amendment after the Government of India Act and the Constitution of India have come into force It is however urged that it really makes no difference whether the rate is levied at a percentage of the capital value or is a percentage of the annual value arrived at on the basis of capital value by fixing a certain percentage of the capital value as the yield for the year We are therefore of opinion that though mathematically it may be possible to arrive at the same figure of the actual tax to be paid as a rate whether based on capital value or based on annual value the levying of the rate as a percentage of capital value would still be illegal for the reason that the law provides that it should be levied on the annual value and not otherwise We therefore allow the appeal and set aside the order of <ORG> and declare that A read with is ultra vires of the Act read with the explanation to The appeal is hereby allowed with costs throughout in favour of the plaintiffs appellants There is no doubt that as a result of these sections and rules the appellants were being made to pay I of the capital value of their lands as assessed by <ORG> valuers It is first said that the <ORG> power to levy a tax on lands is confined by to that variety of tax which is called a rate and a rate is an impost which is leviable on the basis of an assessment in respect of the yearly value of property Hence it is contended the <ORG> had no power to levy any tax based on the capital value of the lands and its rules giving authority to do so are therefore void It seems to me that the problem here is different it has been said that Rates are principal means by which money to defray local government expenses is raised by direct levy on occupiers or in certain cases owners of property within the area of the authority making the rate Rate is only the name given to an impost and there is nothing inherent in its nature to indicate that the impost must be assessed in a certain way I find nothing in the Our legislatures have described the impost indifferently both as tax and as rate as it suited them and have in each case provided for the method of its assessment We have therefore not the advantage of the views of <ORG> as to whether the expression rate has acquired a technical meaning There is yet another difficulty in the appellant way Section gives the municipality the power to frame rules specifying the basis of the valuation on which a rate on lands is to be imposed In the present case I find no difficulty in so reading them Obviously the intention is that the tax is not a rate in the technical sense if there is such a sense in which it must be based on the annual value Then it was said that the explanation does not show that the basis of the tax was not intended to be annual value for one of the well known methods of finding out the annual value is first to find out the capital value and then from it the annual value by finding out what yearly income the capital would produce if invested at a rate of interest which would be considered reasonable at the current market conditions and it is only for the purpose of finding out the annual value by this method that the explanation provides that the basis of the valuation for the imposition of the rate might be the capital value It is based on the assumption that what is imposed being a rate which must be based on annual value the explanation must be read so as to harmonise with it If this were not so there would of course be no reason to contend that capital value had been mentioned only as the first step for ascertaining the annual value But there is nothing in the explanation to show that capital value has been mentioned only for the purpose of finding out the annual value from it We have to read many words into it to produce that result Such a thing is not permissible and there is no warrant for doing it either For if the impost was a rate in the sense the appellants stated it had necessarily to be based on annual value and there was therefore no need to enact by the explanation how it was to he based or to expressly provide that the annual value might be ascertained first by finding out the capital value or by any of the other recognised methods of doing so for all such methods would necessarily be available I turn now to the other ground on which the power to impose the tax on the basis of capital value was challenged After the Government of India Act had come into force a new sub section numbered sub section was inserted in of the Bombay Act which provided that Nothing in this section shall authorise the imposition of any tax which <ORG> has no power to impose in the Province under the Government of India Act contended that the power to impose the rate based on the capital value of lands even if conferred by or of the Bombay Act would be void unless it was a tax which the Bombay legislature could lawfully impose under the Government of India Act I think should point out now that as this case is concerned with assessment for the years and it is unnecessary to consider the question of legislative competence of the legislature of the State of Bombay under the Constitution The question then is Is the tax imposed in the present case outside the powers of the Provincial legislature under the Government of India Act The respective powers of the Provincial and Central legislatures as defined by that Act are contained in Lists II and I in the Seventh Schedule to it The Appellants on the contrary contend that it is really a legislation under item of List I under which the Central legislature has the power to legislate to impose taxes on the capital value of the assets exclusive of agricultural land of individuals and companies There is no question however that such a resolution was passed and it must have been in terms of The charging provision that we have in this case does not therefore travel outside the power conferred by item in List The only question therefore is whether by providing that the tax might be levied at of the capital value of the land taxed the entire scope of the charging section is being altered and in reality the tax levied becomes a tax on capital asset I feel no doubt that the question must be answered in the negative There are however other reasons why the tax in the present case cannot be said to be a tax on the capital value of assets Under of the Bombay Act however the present tax can be levied on a person in occupation of the land who holds it on a building lease taken from another I would for these reasons dismiss the appeal with costs By <ORG> In accordance with the majority opinion the appeal is allowed with costs throughout
