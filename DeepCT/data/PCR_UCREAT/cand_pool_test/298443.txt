The respondent whose tender was the highest challenged the decision of the appellants by filing a Writ Petition before <ORG> Being aggrieved by <ORG> decision the appellant Corporation preferred the present appeal It was contended on behalf of the appellant that there being no right in the person submitting the highest tender to claim acceptance thereof and since all tenderers were given equal opportunity to participate in the negotiations and to revise the bid before acceptance the action of the appellant was not arbitrary There is no unfettered discretion in public law A public authority possesses powers only to use them for public good This imposes the duty to act fairly and to adopt a procedure which is fairplay in action The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen in such a situation may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary and this is how the requirement of due consideration of a legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non arbitrariness a necessary concomitant of the rule of law The respondent filed the above Writ Petition in <ORG> challenging the appellant refusal to accept the highest tender submitted by it for the stock of damaged rice claiming that the appellant having chosen to invite tenders it could not thereafter dispose of the stocks of damaged foodgrains by subsequent negotiations rejecting the highest tenders on the ground that a higher bid was obtained by negotiations where all the tenderers including the respondent were invited for negotiation and given equal opportunity to participate and to revise the bid before acceptance of the highest bid offered during negotiation which resulted in obtaining an additional amount of Rs In reply <NAME> learned counsel for the respondent contended that even though the appellant had the right to reject any tender including the highest tender and thereafter negotiate with all the tenderers to procure the highest price for the commodity yet this right has to be exercised reasonably and not arbitrarily otherwise the credibility of the procedure of sale by inviting tenders would be lost <ORG> decision is based on the only ground that once tenders have been invited and the highest bidder has come forward to comply with the conditions stipulated in the tender notice it is not permissible to switch over to negotiation with all the tenderers and thereby reject the highest tender This is not the same as the submission of <NAME> which is limited to permissibility of such a course only on cogent grounds indicated while deciding to switch over to the procedure of negotiation after receiving the tenders to satisfy the requirement of non arbitrariness a necessary concomitant of the rule of law The proposition enunciated by <ORG> which forms the sole basis of its decision is too wide to be acceptable and has to be limited in the manner indicated hereafter There is no unfettered discretion in public law A public authority possesses powers only to use them for public good This impose the duty to act fairly and to adopt a procedure which is fairplay in action The mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a citizen in such a situation may not by itself be a distinct enforceable right but failure to consider and give due weight to it may render the decision arbitrary and this is how the requirement of due consideration of a Legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non arbitrariness a necessary concomitant of the rule of law In such a situation if the negotiations did not yield the desirable result of obtaining a significantly higher price the appellant had the option to accept the highest tender before the last date viz
