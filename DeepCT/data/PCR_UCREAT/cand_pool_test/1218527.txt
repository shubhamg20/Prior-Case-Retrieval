In petitions moved by the appellants for writs of certiorari and Mandamus against the orders of <ORG> <ORG> ordered refund of tax paid for certain periods and refused it in regard to other periods The Orissa Sales Tax Act was however amended in with retrospective effect incorporating A which provided that refund could be claimed only by the person from whom the dealer had realised the amount by way of sales tax or otherwise Held that under A of the Orissa Sales Tax Amendment Act refund of tax which the dealer was not liable to pay could be claimed by the person from whom the dealer had actually realised it whether as sales tax or otherwise and not by the dealer The legislature was competent to legislate for granting IS refund of sales tax improperly collected there is no reason to exclude the power to declare that refund shall be claimable only by the person from whom the dealer has realised the amount as sales tax or otherwise Under cl of the Act if the amount realised by the assessee exceeded the amount payable as tax such amount must be deposited in the Government treasury and the assessee having no beneficial interest in such amount the enactment that the amount shall be claimable only by the persons who paid the amounts to the dealers as sales tax is a reasonable restriction imposed on the right of the assessee to obtain refund in the interest of the general public and does not infringe the provisions of Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SHAH The <ORG> thereinafter called the assessees are a public limited company having their registered office at Brajrajnagar in the district of Sambalpur Orissa State Counsel for the State of Orissa contends that no refund could be granted because the orders of assessment had become final and of the Act applied only to cases of refund in which a superior taxing authority in appeal or revision against the order of assessment directs or declares that the tax has not been properly collected and it does not apply to cases of assessment which have become final even if made on an erroneous view of the law By A which was incorporated by the Orissa Sales Tax Amendment Act of it was provided Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act where any amount is either deposited by any person under sub section of or paid as tax by a dealer and where such amount or any part thereof is not payable by such person or dealer a refund of such amount or any part thereof can be claimed only by the person from whom such person or dealer has actually realised such amounts whether by way of sales tax or otherwise and the period of limitation provided in the proviso to shall apply to the aforesaid claims In terms the section provides that refund of tax id which the dealer was not liable to pay can only be claimed by the person from whom the dealer has actually realised it whether as sales tax or otherwise The section therefore deprives the assessees of the common law right to claim refund of the amounts paid as tax under an error of law that it was recoverable by the taxing authority Counsel for the assessees does not dispute that by the amending provision the right to obtain refund of tax is denied to him by the <ORG> He contends that the Act is beyond the competence of the State <ORG> and in any event it is void because it imposes an unreasonable restriction upon the assessees fundamental right guaranteed under Art The power to legislate with respect to a tax comprehends the power to impose the tax to prescribe machinery for collecting the tax to designate the officers by whom the liability may be enforced and to prescribe the authority obligations and indemnity of those officers If competence to legislate for granting refund of sales tax improperly collected be granted is there any reason to exclude the power to declare that refund shall be claimable only by the person from whom the dealer has actually realised the amounts by way of sales tax or otherwise We see none The question is one of legislative competence and there is no restriction either express or implied imposed upon the power of the <ORG> in that behalf of the Constitution prescribes the right to freedom of citizens to acquire hold and dispose of property but the right is by cl subject to tile operation of any law existing or prospective in so far as it imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of that right in the interest of the general public Assuming that by enacting that refund of tax shall only be made to the purchasers from whom the tax has been collected by the dealers and not to the dealers who have paid the tax the fundamental right under Art The <ORG> by of the Act authorised registered dealers to collect tax from the purchasers which they may have to pay on their turnover Under cl of the Act as it stood at the material time the amounts realised by any person as tax on sale of any goods shall notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of the Act be deposited by him in a Government treasury within such period as may be prescribed if the amount so realised exceeded the amount payable as tax in respect of that sale or if no tax is payable in respect thereof If with a view to prevent the assessees who had no beneficial interest in those amounts from making a profit out of the tax collected the <ORG> enacted that the amount so deposited shall be claimable only by the persons who had paid the amounts to the dealer and not by the dealer it must be held that the restriction on the right of the assessees to obtain refund was lawfully circumscribed in the interest of the general public Counsel for the assessees contended that they stood in danger of being compelled at the instance of the purchasers to repay the amount collected as tax even after it is deposited with or paid by them to the <ORG> Government and a statutory provision which deprives them of their right to claim refund amounts to an unreasonable restriction because they are under an obligation to pay the amount to purchasers but they cannot reimburse themselves by recourse to the <ORG> which holds the amounts But by the assessees were liable to deposit the amount in excess of what was lawfully recoverable from the purchasers as tax When under the orders of assessment they paid amounts to the <ORG> requirements of were complied with and the amount remained with the <ORG> in deposit subject to the obligation if a demand was made within the period prescribed to restore the same to the persons from whom the assessees had recovered it We do not think that there is any reason to hold that the assessees would be exposed to any enforceable claims at the instance of the purchasers to refund the tax collected by them if they have deposited it with the <ORG> in discharge of the statutory obligation incurred by them
