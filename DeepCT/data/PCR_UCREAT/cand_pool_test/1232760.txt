HEADNOTE The third respondent made an application for the grant of a licence for a temporary cinema and the District Magistrate issued a no objection certificate for a period of six months The appellants in their writ petition questioned the validity of <ORG> order on the ground that they were the residents of the locality and that they had objected to the grant renewal of licence on the ground that there was a mosque a madrasa and a temple in the vicinity of the place where the cinema house was to be constructed and even though their objections were upheld by the licensing authority the District Magistrate they were not heard in the appeal preferred by the third respondent and therefore the order of the first respondent State of suffers from the vice of violation of the principles of natural justice <ORG> held that since the matter was left to the subjective satisfaction of <ORG> <ORG> on being satisfied that there was no impediment to the grant of such a licence was perfectly justified in granting the same and that this was not a fit case for interference by <ORG> In the appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellants that as objectors they should have been heard and the decision arrived at by <ORG> in appeal at their back was violative of the principles of natural justice and the order granting licence for a quasi permanent cinema by <ORG> was invalid There is nothing in Cinema Regulation Act or the Cinema Regulation Rules which require the licensing authority to invite objections before grant of a quasi permanent cinema licence But there is no provision for inviting objections when the application is for a permanent or quasi permanent cinema licence or a touring cinema licence There is no provision in the Act or Rules which requires advertisement of such an application inviting objections and consideration of the objections before grant of a cinema licence There is no question of giving a personal hearing to each objector Sub of of the Act is unambiguous when it provides for an appeal only at the instance of a person aggrieved by the decision of the licensing authority refusing licence There is no substance in the grievance that before granting renewal of quasi permanent cinema licence <ORG> in the appeal filed by the third respondent had not heard them and that such a decision was rendered in violation of the principles of natural justice When the present appellants objected to the renewal of a quasi permanent cinema licence it was not the stage for grant of a no objection certificate but it was the stage of renewal of quasi permanent licence subsequent to the stage of granting of a no objection certificate when there was no statutory obligation in the licensing authority to invite objections nor were the appellants entitled to file objections and nor were they entitled to be heard <NAME> for Respondents and <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> for The following Judgments were delivered DESAI This appeal by special leave is directed against the order date th December made by the State of Madhya Pradesh granting a licence for a quasi permanent cinema to respondent no <NAME> son of <NAME> proprietor <ORG> Lalbagh Burhanpur against which a petition under Article of the Constitution by the petitioners was dismissed in limine by a speaking order by <ORG> at Jabalpur on th March Third respondent made an application on th December for grant of a licence for a temporary cinema and the District Magistrate having jurisdiction issued a no objection certificate vide his order dated th February for a period of six months Respondent carried the matter in appeal to <ORG> which by its order dated th December granted a licence for a quasi permanent cinema under the Cinemas Regulation Rules to the third respondent Present petitioners filed a petition under Article questioning the validity of the aforementioned order of <ORG> conceding inter alia that they were the residents of the locality and that they had objected to the grant renewal of licence on the ground that there is a mosque a madrasa and a temple in the vicinity or the place where the cinema house is to be constructed and even though their objections were upheld by the licensing authority the District Magistrate they were not heard in the appeal preferred by the third respondent and therefore the order of the first respondent State of Madhya Pradesh suffers inter alia from the vice of violation of the principles of natural justice <ORG> was of the opinion that District Magistrate was not influenced by the fact that there was a mosque and a temple in the vicinity of the place where the proposed cinema house was to be constructed but he was influenced by an extraneous consideration that a cinema having a permanent cinema licence having been re opened in the locality there was no need for a cinema house with a temporary licence and that it being a matter left to the subjective satisfaction of <ORG> <ORG> on being satisfied that there was no impediment to the grant of such a licence was perfectly justified in granting the same and therefore it is not a fit case for the interference of <ORG> The appellants thereupon filed this appeal by special leave Mr <NAME> learned counsel who appeared for the petitioners contended that if before the grant of a quasi permanent cinema licence to the third respondent the appellants filed their objections which were taken into consideration by the Distt Magistrate was impressed by the objections and therefore turned down the request for temporary cinema licence in an appeal against this order preferred by the third respondent the appellants as objectors should have been heard and the decision arrived at by the <ORG> appeal at their back was violative of the principles of natural justice and the order granting licence for quasi permanent cinema by the <ORG> is invalid Before we examine the contention canvassed on behalf of the appellants it is necessary to glance at the relevant provisions of Cinemas Regulation Act Act for short Section imposes a restriction on exhibition by means of cinematograph at any place other than a licensed place under the Act in compliance with the restrictions or conditions imposed by such licence Section provides for conditions subject to which licence may be granted Sub of provides for an appeal at the instance of a person aggrieved by the decision of a licensing authority refusing to grant a licence under the Act to <ORG> within the prescribed time Section confers power on <ORG> or the local authority to suspend exhibition of films Section prescribes penalties for breach of the provisions of the Act Section confers power to revoke a licence under certain circumstances i no objection certificate for the site on which the cinema house is to be constructed ii licence for the building conforming to the rules where films are to be exhibited and iii licence for exhibition of films are made in the rules and there is no reference to any of the three licences in the Act Secondly appeal is provided against the order of a licensing authority only at the instance of a person aggrieved by the decision of the licensing authority refusing to grant a licence The Act does not confer any right of appeal on a person who might have raised objections before the licensing authority against the grant of a no objection certificate or a licence as the case may be This last aspect is very relevant because the entire submission is based on a contention that the appellants who had objected to the grant of a no objection certificate to the third respondent and had succeeded in persuading the licensing authority to refuse the grant of no objection certificate to the third respondent yet in the appeal preferred by the third respondent under sub of the State Government did not give any opportunity to the successful objectors and decided the appeal at their back and thus the decision was rendered in violation of the principles of natural justice Sub rule of rule provides that such a person shall also give a similar notice in writing to the licensing authority viz It is also obligatory for the licensing authority to issue a notification inviting objections specifying therein the period within which the objections shall be lodged Rule provides that without prejudice to the right of the licensing authority to refuse or to grant a cinema licence under rules and the licensing authority may with the previous permission of the government grant a certificate to the applicant that there is no objection to the location of the cinema at the site notified by the applicant under rule Rule confers power on the licensing authority to grant a cinema licence on being satisfied that all the relevant rules have been complied with and the licence may be granted on such terms and conditions and subject to such restrictions as the licensing authority may determine There is a proviso to rule which reads as under Provided that a touring cinema licence shall not be beyond the district of issue and ordinarily touring cinema licences shall not be granted for places where there is already a permanent or a quasi permanent cinema but the licensing authority may in its discretion permit a touring cinema to operate at a place where there is already a permanent or quasi permanent cinema on occasions such as fairs and melas or when the touring cinema exhibits films of a kind different from those exhibited by non touring cinemas such as educational films or where it caters for a different public Rule provides that a permanent cinema may be licenced for any period not exceeding one year and a quasi permanent cinema or a touring cinema may be licenced for any period not exceeding six months A perusal of the relevant provisions of the Act and the Rules extracted above will show that there are various stages through which an application for a cinema licence has to be processed appeal against the refusal to grant the no objection certificate the appeal was decided at the back of those who had not only filed objections but whose objections had prevailed with the licensing authority and therefore the order granting the no objection certificate is violative of the principles of natural justice There is a two fold fallacy in this submission A perusal of this particular order would show that initial application for no objection certificate was made by the third respondent on th December No exception appears to have been taken to this order granting no objection certificate Let it again be made clear that the application was for a quasi permanent cinema licence There is no question of then giving a personal hearing to each objector But sub of of the Act is unambiguous when it provides for an appeal only at the instance of a person aggrieved by the decision of the licensing authority refusing licence There is however nothing in the Act or the rules which requires the licensing authority to invite objections before grant of a quasi permanent cinema licence But there is no provision for inviting objections when the application is for a permanent or quasi permanent cinema licence or a touring cinema licence There is no provision in the Act or Rules which requires advertisement of such an application inviting objections and consideration of the objections before grant of a cinema licence When the present appellants objected to the renewal of a quasi permanent cinema licence it was not the stage for grant of a no objection certificate but it was the stage of renewal of quasi permanent licence subsequent to the stage of granting of a no objection certificate when there was no statutory obligation on the licensing authority to invite objections nor were the appellants entitled to file objections and nor were they entitled to be heard There fore there is no substance in the grievance that before granting renewal of such licence <ORG> in the appeal filed by the third respondent had not heard them and that such a decision was rendered in violation of the principles of natural justice Undoubtedly in the aforementioned case this <ORG> in terms held that a rival in cinema business has no locus standi to question the validity of the order under which the other person has been granted a cinema licence but as the only contention raised on behalf of the appellants does not commend to us and therefore the appeal is likely to fail on that ground alone it is not necessary to explore this contention advanced on behalf of the respondents There was only one point raised in this appeal and as there is no merit in it the appeal fails and is dismissed but with no order as to costs Rules to of the Madhya Pradesh Cinemas Regulation Rules relate to the grant of a no objection certificate that is to say a certificate that there is no objection to the location of the cinema at the site proposed by the applicant I leave the question open whether a person who has objected to the grant of a no objection certificate when that grant was under consideration can subsequently oppose the grant of a cinema licence on the same grounds which he took against the no objection certificate The appeal is dismissed but without any order as to costs
