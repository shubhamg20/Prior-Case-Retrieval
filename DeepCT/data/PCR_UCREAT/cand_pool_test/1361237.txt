The following Judgment of the Court was delivered <NAME> Leave granted We have heard learned counsel on both sides On June the appellants filed a writ petition claiming that right from the post of Clerk upto the post of Superintendent the <ORG> of <ORG> they were senior to the reserved candidates Fifth respondent <NAME> was promoted to Group Class I <ORG> in his own right as a general candidate as there was no reservation Similarly as on the date of promotion of respondent Nos and the petitioner No has not been promoted as Deputy Superintendent and so far as petitioner No is concerned he came to be promoted as Deputy Superintended after almost years and months of the promotion of respondent No after years and months of the promotion of respondent No and after almost and years and months of the promotion of respondent Nos and as Superintendents This very principle has been reiterated in <NAME> case in which circular issued by <ORG> and the judgment of the <ORG> case in <NAME> case supra came up for consideration <ORG> which decided <NAME> case simply applied the observations made in the three decisions of the Supreme <ORG> and held that reserved categories employees have no right to be assigned seniority on the promoted posts over and above the general category employees who were senior in the lower cadre and who got promotion in the next higher post on a later date However in <ORG> case supra their Lordships clarified that the principle laid down in <NAME> case and <NAME> case supra will operate prospectively and not retrospectively Similarly the post of Deputy Superintendents Assistants and Clerks recruitment to which is governed by Rules constitute different cadres and seniority will have to be determined separately in each of these cadres and the general principle laid down in <NAME> case cannot be applied for the purpose of determination of seniority in a case like the present one On the basis of above discussion we hold that i the writ petition deserves to be dismissed on the ground of delay and laches in so far as challenge to the promotion of the respondents as Superintendents Registrar is concerned ii the principles laid down in <NAME> case supra and <NAME> case supra will operate prospectively and will not affect promotions of reserved category candidates which were made prior to the decision in <NAME> case supra or <NAME> case supra iii the decision in <NAME> case and <NAME> case cannot be applied in a case like the present one where the seniority is required to be determined in different cadres and categories of posts As soon as the general candidates get promoted even though later to the reserved candidates they have right to have their seniority restored The mere delay in filing the writ petitions cannot made the base to deny the relief to the general candidates The appellants have no right to claim seniority over the respondent reserved candidates Constitutional right to equality enshrined under Article the genus and Article the species thereof provide for protective discrimination in favour of the Dalit and Tribe Appointment by promotion to a post or Service under the <ORG> is a constitutional right given by Article or A of the Constitution In view of the diverse contentions the questions that arise for consideration are from what date seniority of reserved or general candidates should be determined Whether the accelerated promotions given to the reserved candidates to various cadres applying the rule of reservation will not enure to them the seniority from the date of respective promotion Conversely whether on the promotions given to the general candidates as per the roster point the promotions will have the effect of giving them the seniority over the reserved candidates in the respective feeder promoted cadres Whether the view taken by <ORG> is correct in law In order to appreciate the contention it is necessary to refer to Rule of the Rules and Rule of the Rules They read as under Rules Rule The seniority inter se seniority of members of service shall be determined by the length of continuous service on a post in the service Provided that where there are different Cadres of categories of the post in service the seniority will be determined separately for each cadre or category of posts Provided further that in the case of members appointed by direct recruitment the order of merit determined by the commission shall not be disturbed in fixing the seniority and candidates recommended earlier shall be senior to the candidate recommended later Provide further that in the case of two or more members appointed on the same date their seniority shall be determined as follows a a member appointed by direct recruitment shall be senior to a member appointed by promotion or by transfer a member appointed by promotion shall be senior to a member appointed by transfer in the case of members appointed by promotion or by transfer seniority shall be determined according to the seniority of such members in the appointments from which they were promoted or transferred and in the case members appointed by transfer from different cadres their seniority shall be determined according to pay preference being given to a member who was drawing a higher rate of pay in his previous appointment and if the rates of pay drawn are also the same then by the length of their service in the appointments and if the length of such service is also the same the older member shall be senior to the younger member Rules Rules Seniority of members of the service The seniority inter se of members of the Service shall be determined by the length of continuous service on a post in the service Provided that where there are different cadres or categories of posts in the service the seniority shall be determined separately for each cadre or category of posts Provided further that in the case of members appointed by direct recruitment the order of merit determined by the <ORG> shall not be disturbed in fixing the seniority and candidates recommended earlier shall be senior to the candidates recommended later Provided further that in the case of two or more members appointed on the same date their seniority shall be determined as follows a a member appointed by direct recruitment shall be senior to a member appointed by promotion or by transfer a member appointed by promotion shall be senior to a member appointed by transfer in the case of members appointed by promotion or by transfer seniority shall be determined according to the seniority of such member in the appointment from which they were promoted or transferred and in the case of members appointed by transfer from different cadres their seniority shall be determined according to pay preference being given to a member who was drawing a higher rate of pay in his previous appointment and if the rates of pay drawn are also the same the by the length of their service in the appointments and if the length of such service is also the same the older member shall be senior to the younger member All promotions whether from one grade to another or from one class of service to another class of service shall be made by selection based on merit and taking into consideration seniority but seniority alone shall not given any right to such promotions On appointment so made by operation of Rule person appointed to nay post in the Service shall remain on probation for a period of two years if appointed by direct recruitment and one year if he is appointed otherwise promotion Under sub rule of Rule if in the opinion of the appointing authority the work or conduct of a person during the period of probation is not satisfactory it may a if such person is appointed by direct recruitment dispense with his services and if such person is appointed otherwise then by direct recruitment promotion or transfer i revert him to his former post or ii deal with him in such other manner as the terms and conditions of his previous appointment permit On completion of the period of probation by a person under sub rule the appointing authority may a if his work or conduct has in its opinion been satisfactory i confirm such person from the date of his appointment if appointed against a permanent vacancy or ii confirm such person from the date from which a permanent vacancy occurs if appointed against a temporary vacancy or in case of non availability of permanent vacancy iii declare that he has completed his probation satisfactorily and awaits appointment to permanent vacancy or If his work or conduct has in its opinion not been satisfactory i dispense with his services if appointed by direct recruitment or if appointed otherwise revert him to his former post or deal with him in such other manner as the terms and conditions of his previous appointment permits or ii extend his period of probation and thereafter pass such order as it could have passed on the expiry of the period of probation Under proviso however the total period of probation including extension if any shall not exceed three years He gets appointed to a permanent vacancy subject to availability and thereafter he becomes full fledged member of the <ORG> The question then arises as to from what date the seniority is required to be determined As seen under Rule the inter se seniority of the member of the <ORG> shall be determined by the length of continuos service is a post in the <ORG> Under the first proviso where there are different cadres or categories of posts in the <ORG> the seniority shall be determined separately for each cadre or category of posts It is seen that as soon as a person is appointed to a cadre grade he starts discharging the duties of appointment to the post and his seniority is determined on the basis of that date unless he is appointed only as a stop gap arrangement or on ad hoc basis and de hors the Rules In case of regular appointment the appointing authority is enjoined to put him on probation and on successful completion of the probation period of one year including the period spent on the higher post unless the probation is extended upto a maximum of three year he stand confirmed in the promoted post as soon as his probation is declared he becomes a member of the <ORG> On availability of permanent post he gets appointed to the post and thereafter ceases to be a member of the feeder lower cadre A conjoint reading thus would establish that a Government servant shall always have a lien on the post and simultaneously he shall not have right to hold any lien on more than one post On promotion from the post of Clerk as Assistant on successful and satisfactory completion of probation and declaration thereof he becomes a member of the <ORG> in the cadre of Assistant and so on till the cycle is complete Vice versa there are various stages of promotion to the higher echelons of <ORG> and the same resultant consequence follow Union of India Supp SCC in paras and a Bench of three Judges to which one of us <NAME> was a member has held that no one has vested right to promotion or seniority but an officer has an interest in seniority acquired by working out the rules Chandrakant Anant Kulkarni another Bench of three Judges in paragraph at page had held that ere chances of promotion are not conditions of service and the fact that there was reduction in the chances of promotion did not tantanmount to a change in the conditions of service at in para it was held that a right to be considered for promotion is a term of service but mere chances of promotion are not so also the eligibility for promotion When the Rules prescribed the method of selection recruitment seniority is given as per the ranking given and governed by such as was laid in the rules In <ORG> Union of India to which tow of us <NAME> and <NAME> were members this <ORG> has held that no member of the service has a vested right to promotion or seniority but an officer has an interest in seniority acquired by working out the rules <ORG> SCR a Constitution Bench had held that a rule which confers a right of actual promotion or a right to be considered for promotion is a rule prescribing conditions of service In <NAME> vs <NAME> SLR a Bench of three Judges had held that any rule which affects the promotion of a person relates to conditions of service On his having satisfactorily completed probation and declaration thereof he is given seniority in the higher cadre He become a member of the higher cadre from the date of starting discharging duty of the post to which he is promoted unless otherwise determined in accordance with the rules In paragraph it is further stated that in a democracy governed by rule of law every segment of the society is entitled to a share in the governance of the country The object thereby is to provide economic equality Social equality gets realised through facilities and opportunities given to the Dalits and Tribes to live with dignity and with equal status in the society Article mandates the <ORG> that in the field of competition the claims of Dalits and Tribes shall be taken into consideration consistently with the maintenance in appointment of promotion in favour of Dalit and Tribes is a constitutional right under Article and A read with Article and other related Articles It would thus i a settled constitutional principle that facilities and opportunities should be given to the Dalits and Tribes for promotion to higher cadre or grade gain accelerated seniority by the Dalit and Tribes and delimit the seniority of the erstwhile general candidates in the lower cadre or grade in accordance with the roster point In <NAME> case therefore it was held that to give adequate representation to the Dalits and Tribes in all posts or classes of posts of services to make it a reality and truism facilities and opportunities are required to be provided to the Dalits as enjoined in Article for the purpose of achieving equality of representation as a real content It is constitutionally a valid principle which was declared to be so in several judgments referred to and followed and ultimately held as valid in <NAME> case <NAME> case followed by <NAME> case created euphoria among general candidates that reservation in promotion though till then had by the Dalits and Tribes slided back in the seniority scale to the bottom as and when the general candidates in their own turn had got promotion to higher echelons of service The corrolary of the above rules is that where the initial appointment is only ad hoc and not according to rules and is made as a stop gap arrangement the officiation in such post cannot be taken into account for purpose of determination of the seniority Explaining the meaning of the word panel prepared by the recruiting authority and in the absence of any specific rules as regards the nature of the effect of seniority in the higher cadre grade the Bench of two Judges considered its effect and held that the word panel used in that circular meant the panel prepared by the recruiting authority at the time of initial entry into service and that the seniority of the employees in the higher grades was also held to be determine with reference to the placement in the initial appointment It did not lay down any separate rule in that behalf It is also to be noted that the criteria for promotion in <NAME> case was seniority cum merit or merit cum seniority in which event the principle of seniority also gains relevancy and is one of the factors to be taken into consideration If this clarity of though is kept in fore front there is no occasion to adopt a mistaken application of the principle to all facts in all circumstance After the Constitution th Amendment Act Article A gives fundamental rights to the Dalits and Tribes to promotion to a post or a service in the <ORG> The protective discrimination is a contour to bring about equality in results to the Dalits and Tribes The administrative instructions issued by <ORG> after <NAME> case flies in the facet of statutory Rule of the rules But <NAME> and <NAME> cases kept at rest the promotion already made by that date and declared them as valid they were limited to the question of future promotions given by applying the rule of reservation to all the persons prior to the dated of judgment in <NAME> case which required to examined in the light of law laid in <NAME> case Thus earlier promotions cannot be reopened Only those cases arising after that date would be examined in the light of the law laid down in <NAME> case <NAME> case and equally <NAME> case considered the effect of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> cases and held that the seniority of those respondents who had already retired or promoted to higher posts could not be disturbed The seniority of the petitioner therein and the respondent who were holding the post in the same level or in the same cadre would be adjusted keeping in view the ratio in <NAME> and <NAME> cases but promotion if any had been given to any of them during the pendency of this writ petition was directed not to be disturbed
