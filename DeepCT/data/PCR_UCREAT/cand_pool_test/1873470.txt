If this allegation is true the time fixed for payment of the last instalment had not expired when the mortgagor preferred his objection The contention which found favour with the lower <ORG> was that even if the mortgagor paid Rs It is argued on behalf of the mortgagor that a mortgage suit does not terminate with the passing of the preliminary decree and that proceedings in such suit continue till a final decree is passed Whatever may be the correct view on the question whether money paid out of <ORG> in satisfaction of the preliminary decree wholly or in part can be recognized by a <ORG> when it is moved to pass a final decree a point on which we express no opinion it seems to us that the <ORG> cannot refuse to act under Order Rule Civil if the conditions required by that rule are fulfilled so that if a suit had been adjusted wholly or in part by any lawful agreement or compromise or where the defendant satisfies the plaintiff in respect of the whole or any part of the subject matter of the suit the <ORG> has no option but to order that such agreement compromise or satisfaction be recorded and to pass a decree in accordance therewith This is a necessary corollary of the view taken by this <ORG> that a preliminary decree does not terminate the suit which continues till a final decree is passed Once a suit is finally disposed of Order Rule cannot have any application but so long as the suit is pending it is open to the parties to enter into a compromise or otherwise adjust their differences Great stress is laid on behalf of the respondent on the imperative language of the preliminary decree that if the amount declared due by the preliminary decree is not paid in <ORG> on or before the date fixed for payment the plaintiff shall be entitled to apply for a final decree directing that the mortgaged property or a sufficient part thereof be sold It is argued that the payment not having been made in the manner directed by the preliminary decree the plaintiff has an absolute right to apply for a final decree being passed Reference is also made to Order Rule which provides for the consequences of non payment in the manner laid down by the preliminary decree namely that the Court shall pass a final decree directing that the mortgaged property or a sufficient portion thereof be sold The provisions contained in this rule should however be read with other parts of the Civil Procedure Code including Order Rule which is equally imperative and gives no discretion to the <ORG> where an agreement compromise or satisfaction of the suit wholly or in part has taken place Such decrees are passed in suits for partition dissolution of partnership for accounts in administration suits and others We do not think it can be seriously contended that where a preliminary decree is passed directing that a partition shall take place or that accounts shall be taken between the parties it is not open to the parties amicably to settle their differences before a final decree is passed In the case before us the petition of objection filed by the appellant clearly alleged not a mere payment but au adjustment between the parties In these circumstances we allow the appeal set aside the order of the lower <ORG> and remand the case to that <ORG> for disposal according to law as herein indicated Costs shall abide the result
