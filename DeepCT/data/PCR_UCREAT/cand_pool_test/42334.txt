The appellant <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> then went towards the house of appellant There is no evidence that any person other than PWs and saw the cocuerence We see no force in the contention that because neighbours residing near the place of occurrence have not been examined therefore these witnesses should not have been believed It would be incogruous if the <ORG> were to come to the conclusion that the occurrence did not take place as stated by the prosecution witnesses and would clearly show that he had common intention with <NAME> to commit the murder of <NAME> with whom they were on inimical terms But the part played by him in the incident as found by <ORG> would clearly indicate that he was guilty of the offence under Section read with Section Counsel for the appellant submitted that the charge against the appellant was under Section read with Section and therefore his conviction under Section read with Section was illegal We do not think that there is in any substance in this contention The State of Punjab <NAME> SCR speaking for the <ORG> held It is true that there is substantial difference between the two sections but they also to some extent overlap and it is a question to be determined on the facts of each case whether the charge under Section overlaps the ground covered by Section The facts proved and the evidence adduced would have been the same if the appellant had been charged under Section read with Section and we do not see how the appellant was prejudicied We have no hesitation in holding that <ORG> was right in its conclusion that as the appellant had common intention with <NAME> to murder <NAME> there was no illegality in convicting him under Section read with Section
