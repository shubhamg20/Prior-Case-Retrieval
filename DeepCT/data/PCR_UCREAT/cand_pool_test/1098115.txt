By the present application filed under sections and of the Companies Act hereinafter called the Act read with rule of the Companies Court Rules the applicant namely <ORG> in liquidation through the official liquidator has sought the following reliefs a Issue ad interim ex parte stay injunction restraining the respondents from disposing of any goods of the company and or land building plant and machinery and other goods housed at the factory situated at Biwandi Distt One Mr <NAME> as creditor filed a petition being No of on May for winding up the applicant namely <ORG> hereinafter called the company on the ground that it was unable to pay it debts From the papers and correspondence as handed over by one of the ex directors of the company namely <NAME> the official liquidator came to know that the company had started its production in Order and that the business virtually closed down in Vide letter dated October the official liquidator informed the <ORG> that the company had been wound up by order of this court and that under provisions of section of the Act all the records properties assets and other claim were deemed to be under the custody and jurisdiction of the winding up court and the same were liable to be delivered to the official liquidator In replay the respondent vide its letter dated October alleged that by virtue of the provisions of section of the State Financial <ORG>s Act hereinafter called the said Act the company had been taken over by the respondents since the <ORG> was a secured creditor The notification issued on March could not have retrospective effect The <ORG> has denied that it had illegally taken over the possession of the factory on September or for that matter on any other date It has been denied that on the passing of the order of winding up the assets taken over by the <ORG> immediately came into the power and possession of the official liquidator by the deeming provisions of the Act Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand has contended that under section of the said Act <ORG> has been given a statutory right to resort to the remedies as provided therein without approaching a civil court for enforcement of a mortgage Besides that even under the deed of hypothecation and mortgage the <ORG> was given the right by the company to take possession of its assets including the immovable properties and sell the same A mortgage or any person acting on his behalf shall subject to the provisions of this section have power to sell or concur in selling the mortgaged property or any part thereof in default of payment of the mortgage money without the intervention of the court in the following cases and in no others namely a where the mortgage is an English mortgage and neither the mortgage nor the mortgagee is a Hindu Muhammadan or Buddhist or a member of any other race sect tribe or class from time to time specified in this behalf by <ORG> in the Official Gazette where a power of sale without the intervention of the court is expressly conferred on the mortgagee by the mortgage deed and the mortgagee is the Government where a power of sale without the intervention of the court is expressly conferred on the mortgagee by the mortgage deed and the mortgaged property or any part thereof was on the date of the execution of the mortgage deed situate within the towns of Calcutta Madras Bombay or in any other town or area which <ORG> may by notification in <ORG> specify in this behalf No such power shall be exercised unless and until a notice in writing requiring payment of the principal money has been served on the mortgagor or on one of several mortgagors and default has been made in payment of the principal money or of part thereof for three months after such service or some interest under the mortgage amounting at least to five hundred rupees is in arrear and unpaid for three months after becoming due When a sale has been made in professed exercise of such a power the title of the purchaser shall not be impeachable on the ground that no case had arisen to authorize the sale or that due notice was not given or that the power was otherwise improperly or irregularly exercised but any person damnified by an unauthorized or improper or irregular exercise of the power shall have his remedy in damages against the person exercising the power Where any industrial concern which is under a liability to the <ORG> under an agreement makes any default in repayment of any loan or advance or any Installment thereof or in meeting its obligations in relation to any guarantee given by the <ORG> or otherwise fails to comply with the terms of its agreement with the <ORG> the <ORG> shall have the right to take over the management or possession or both of the industrial concern as well as the right to transfer by way of lease or sale and realised the property pledged mortgaged hypothecated or assigned to the <ORG> <ORG> shall have the same rights and powers with respect to goods manufactured or produced wholly or partly from goods forming part of the security held by it as it had with respect to the original goods Where any action has been taken against an industrial concern under the provisions of sub section all costs charges and expenses which in the opinion of <ORG> have been properly incurred by it as incidental thereto shall be recoverable from the industrial concern and the money which is received by it shall in the absence of any contract to the contrary be held by it in trust to be applied firstly in payment of such costs charges and expenses and secondly in discharge of the debt due to <ORG> and the residue of the money so received shall be paid to the person entitled thereto Where <ORG> has taken any action against an industrial concern under the provisions of sub section <ORG> shall be deemed to be the owner of such concern for the purposes of suits by or against the concern and shall sue and be sued in the name of the concern It is thus clear that under section of the Transfer of Property Act a mortgagee subject to its provisions has the power to sell or concur in selling the mortgaged property or any part thereof in default of the payment in mortgage without the intervention of the court in various cases as mentioned therein Thus there is no force in the argument of learned counsel for the applicant that the mortgage can be enforced only through the procedure as laid down in order of the Code of Civil Procedure the right to take over the management the right to transfer by way of lease or sale and realise the property pledged mortgaged or assigned to <ORG> In the second place Mr <NAME> has contended that section of the said Act clearly provides that where the proceedings for liquidation in respect of an industrial concern have commenced before an application is made under sub section of section of the said Act then nothing shall be construed as giving to <ORG> any preference over the other creditors of the industrial concern and conferred by any other law He has thus urged that as in the present case the petition for winding up was filed on May and admittedly the respondents took over possession of the secured assets of the company during the pendency of the liquidation proceedings under section of the said Act the respondents have no preference over the other creditors of the company Where proceedings for liquidation in respect of an industrial concern have commenced before an application is made under sub section of section nothing in this section shall be construed as giving to <ORG> any preference over the other creditors of the industrial concerns not conferred on it by any other law Mr <NAME> on the other hand has urged that the <ORG> has exercised it power of taking over possession of the company under section of the said Act Section applies only to a case where a Financial <ORG> makes an application under section of the said Act There is a clear distinction between the two provisions as contained in sections and In Srinivasa Kandasari Sugars the question for consideration before <ORG> was whether <ORG> had the choice to resort to either of the procedures as laid down in section and of <ORG>s Act Sub section of section is in the following terms <ORG> shall be a body corporate by the name notified under sub section having perpetual succession and a common seal with power subject to the provisions of this Act to acquire hold and dispose of property and shall by the said name sue and be sued As we find in section very responsible and highly placed persons will be the directors of the <ORG> Again under section it is the <ORG> as managed by the <ORG> that is empowered to grant loans or advances to an industrial concern repayable within a period not exceeding years Section empowers <ORG> to impose such conditions as it may think necessary or expedient for protecting the interest of <ORG> and securing that the accommodation granted by it is put to the best use by the industrial concern As already mentioned the two procedures mentioned in sections and are different and there are no provisions by way of guidelines in these two sections as to when a particular procedure can be resorted to It may also be noted that under section <ORG> shall have the right to take over the management of the defaulting industrial concern as well as the right to transfer by way of lease or sale For these reasons we are of the opinion that there is a guiding policy and principle available from the statute for the <ORG> to act in this regard and accordingly we hold that section is not violative of article of the Constitution Further we are also of the view that in this case the <ORG> acted with due care and caution and that it did not act arbitrarily or capriciously and we will be be considering this aspect in detail at a later stage I am in respectful agreement with the view expressed by <ORG> in the aforesaid case Section sub section specifically provides that where proceedings for liquidation in respect of industrial concern have commenced before an application is made under section of the Act then nothing in the section shall be construed as giving to a financial corporation any preference over other creditors of that industrial concern Now the questions arising for consideration are whether the respondents could sell the properties of the company which were mortgaged with it without the permission of the company court as admittedly no permission was obtained by the respondents whether the sale by respondents to <ORG> is void under section of the Act and whether during the pendency of the winding up petition the respondents could not take possession of the assets of the company under section of the said Act without the permission of the court He has placed reliance upon the judgment in <ORG> He has further argued that section of the said Act is applicable only when the directors of the company are in charge of and have control over the assets of the company but when the assets of the company come under the control and custody of the company court in chamber under section of the Act then section of the said Act has no application Thus Mr <NAME> argued that when <ORG> omits to take into consideration the obvious provisions of the Indian law the law laid down in that case does not have the binding sway of a precedent to be followed qua immovable property This is evident from the order dated July wherein <NAME> specifically mentioned this fact and then passed the order of winding up on this ground The said Act was made applicable to the <ORG> by means of a notification dated March The <ORG> issued an order under section of the said Act on April for taking over the possession of the industrial concern namely <ORG> This order was issued before the passing of the order of winding up Mr <NAME> further contends that the respondents had full legal rights under the various agreements as well as under section of the said Act to take over the company in payment of its dues to the respondents He has placed reliance upon the judgment in Ranganathan Comp Case SC The next contention of Mr <NAME> is that the action taken by the respondents could not be questioned in proceedings under the Act as by necessary application and by express enactment the provisions of general law like the Act the Code of Civil Procedure or the Transfer of Property Act hardly apply As the company committed defaults in repayment of the loan in October the <ORG> took possession of the secured assets of the company under the agreements Section reads as under Where a winding up order has been made or where a provisional liquidator has been appointed the liquidator or the provisional liquidator as the case may be shall take into custody or under his control all the property effects and actionable claims to which the company is or appears to be entitled A For the purpose of enabling the liquidator or the provisional liquidator as the case may be to take into his custody or under his control any property effects or actionable claims to which the company is or appears to be entitled the liquidator or the provisional liquidator as the case may be may by writing request the Chief Presidency Magistrate or the District Magistrate within whose jurisdiction such property effect or actionable claims or any books of account or other documents of the company may be found to take possession thereof and the Chief Presidency Magistrate or the District Magistrate may thereupon after such notice as he may think fit to give to any party take possession of such property effects actionable claims books of account or other documents and deliver possession thereof to the liquidator or the provisional liquidator For the purpose of securing compliance with the provisions of sub section A the Chief Presidency Magistrate or the District Magistrate may take or cause to be taken such steps and use or cause to be used such force as may in his opinion be necessary Their Lordships with regard to section held as under para at page The learned Advocate General who appeared for the <ORG> laid emphasis upon section Section no doubt defines the rights of the Financial <ORG> to take over the management of the industrial concern or realise the mortgage property by way of lease or sale As we have already mentioned the right given to the <ORG> under section will extend to the property of the surety also But such a right can be enforced by taking recourse to the ordinary law contained in the Transfer of Property Act and the Code of Civil Procedure There is no conflict between the two provisions Section defines the general right of the <ORG> in cases of default and section provides for a speedy and summary remedy Thus <ORG> observed that the right given to the <ORG> under section could not extend to the property of the surety but such a right could be enforced by taking recourse to the ordinary law as contained in the Transfer of Property Act and the Civil Producer Cod In <ORG> Comp Case Delhi a Full Bench of this court was considering the question whether for initiating legal proceedings for recovery of the arrears of rent and possession against a company which is in the process of winding up under section and of the Public Premise Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants Act the permission under section of the Act was required or not In this case <ORG> was also considering the question whether the taking over of the assets of the company by <ORG> was arbitrary and in violation of the principles of natural justice or not Thus this authority is of no help to learned counsel for the applicant because the questions involved in the present case are different from the questions involved in that case As such this case does not help learned counsel for the applicant In the present case the order of winding up was passed on July while the <ORG> had already taken possession of the industrial concern Section of the State Financial Corporations Act reads as under Effect of Act on other laws The provisions of this Act and of any rules or orders made there under shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in the memorandum or articles of association of an industrial concern or in any other instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than this Act but save as aforesaid the provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other law for the time being applicable to an industrial concern The provisions of the Act override any inconsistent provisions in other laws In my view the provisions of the said Act and any of the rules or orders made there under shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or the memorandum or articles of association of any industrial concern In Maharashtra State Financial Corporation Comp Case Bom it has been held that the State Financial Corporations Act being a special enactment the effect of an order passed under section of the said Act would be binding on the liquidator of the company notwithstanding what is mentioned in section of the Act Mr <NAME> placed reliance upon the judgment in <ORG> in support of the contention that precedents sub silentio are of no importance In Ranganathan Comp Case <ORG> was interpreting the provisions as contained in section and of the Indian Companies Act as well section as amended by Act of He took possession as a receiver from the midnight of April of all the assets of the company One Mr <NAME> one of the directors of the company filed a petition for winding up the company on the ground that it was unable to pay its debts and further that it had ceased to run its business An order for winding up of the company was made by the court on January and the official receiver <ORG> Madras was appointed the official liquidator On July the official receiver filed an application for setting aside the aforesaid sale of the assets of the company on the ground inter alia that it was prejudicial to the interest of the general body of unsecured creditors that the same had been concluded with undue haste and without adequate publicity and in violation of respondent No undertaking to the court The secured creditor is thus outside the winding up and can realise his security without the leave of the winding up court though if he files a suit or takes other legal proceedings for the realisation of his security he is bound under section corresponding to section Indian Companies Act to obtain the leave of the winding up court before he can do so although such leave would almost automatically be granted Prior to the amendment the law was well settled both in England and in India that the secured creditor was outside the winding up and he could realise his security without the intervention of the court by effecting a sale of the mortgaged premises by private treaty or by public auction It was only when the intervention of the court was sought either by putting in force any attachment distress or execution within the meaning of section as it stood before the amendment or proceeding with or commencing a suit or other legal proceedings against the company within the meaning of section that leave of the court was necessary and if no such leave was obtained the remedy could not be availed of by the secured creditor The sale of the mortgaged premises was also brought by the amendment on a par with the attachment distress or execution put in force at the instance of the secured creditor and having regard to the context such sale could only be construed to be a sale held through the intervention of the court and not one effected by the secured creditor outside the winding up and without the intervention of the court At pages and If the construction sought to be put upon the words or any sale held without leave of the court of any of the properties by the appellants were accepted it would effect a fundamental alteration in the law as it stood before the amendment was inserted in section by Act of Whereas before the amendment the secured creditor stood outside the winding up and could if the mortgage deed so provided realise his security without the intervention of the court by effecting a sale either by private treaty or by public auction no such sale could be effected by him after the amendment and that was certainly a fundamental alteration in the law which could not be effected unless one found words used which pointed unmistakably to that conclusion or unless such intention was expressed with irresistible clearness Such a great and sudden change of policy could not be attributed to the <ORG> and it would be legitimate therefore to adopt the narrower interpretation to those words of the amendment rather than an interpretation which would have the contrary effect Section of the Indian Companies Act is identical to section of the Act which is reproduced as under Where any company is being wound up by or subject to the supervision of the court any attachment distress or execution put in force without leave of the court against the estate or effects or any sale held without leave of the court of any of the properties of the company after the commencement of the winding up shall be void Nothing in this section applies to proceedings by the Government Where any company is being wound up by or subject to the supervision of the court a any attachment distress or execution put in force without leave of the court against the estate or effects of the company after the commencement of the winding up or any sale held without lave of the court of any of the properties or effects of the company after such commencement shall be void Nothing in this section applies to any proceedings for the recovery of any tax or impost or any dues payable to the Government In October under the loan documents the <ORG> took possession of the secured assets So I have no hesitation in holding that the present case is fully covered by the judgment of <ORG> in Ranganathan Comp Case A due and proper notice was given by the <ORG> to the company on March In <NAME> Ch it was held that if a mortgagee exercises his power of sale bona fide for the purpose of Realizing his debt and without collusion with the purchaser the court will not interfere even though the sale be very disadvantageous unless the price is so low as in itself to be evidence of fraud Thus their bona fides in dealing with the assets of the company which had been mortgaged with them cannot be doubted by this court unless sufficient material is placed on record by the official liquidator to the contrary There is no evidence of any mala fides on the part of the <ORG>
