SCR The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal is directed against an interim order of <ORG> by which the appellant is injuncted from using the trade mark MICROTEL the logo arid the carton for manufacturing and selling his products which consist of electrical and electronic apparatus instruments TV boosters and TV tuners We have heard the learned Counsel on both sides He took simple <ORG> as his logo with the letter and back ground designed completely differently The respondent plaintiff thereafter filed the present suit and sought for injunction against the use of the trade name <ORG> the logo <ORG> and the <ORG> At this stage we are concerned only with the question as to whether <ORG> was right in exercising us jurisdiction in granting interim injunction restraining the appellant from using his trade name logo and the carton There are two things which impress Us Firstly the appellant is not manufacturing any one product such as the boosters which has been mainly taken into consideration by <ORG> Thus micro chip technology being the base of many of the products the word micro has much relevance in describing the products Further the word micro being descriptive of the micro technology used for production of many electronic goods which dairy come to the market no one Can claim monopoly over the use of the said word Anyone producing any product with the use of micro chip technology would be justified in using the said word as a prefix to his trade name Once therefore it is held that tie word micro is a common or general name descriptive of the products which are sold or of the technology by which the products are manufactured and the users of such products are therefore not likely to be misguided or confused by the said word the only question which has to be prima facie decided at this stage is whether the words tel and nix in the trade names of the appellant and the respondent are deceptive for the buyers and users and are likely to misguide or confuse them in purchasing one for the other the word <ORG> and all these letters and words are written in white in a black square in north south direction There is no other letter nor is it set against any background This being the case we are of the view that there is not even the remotest chance of the buyers and users being misguided Or Confused by the two trade names and logos Same is the case with the carton which merely reproduces both trade names and the logos He also tried to show us that there was a similarity in the words and letters in the two cartons inasmuch as the respondent plaintiffs carton mentioned the words MODEL TB in door type while the appellant has also mentioned the words MODEL MT Indoor Unit Hence he submitted that there was a resemblance to the extent of the word MODEL and the figure Hence we allow the appeal and set aside the impugned order of <ORG> It is made clear that the observations made above are only for deciding whether the appellant should be restrained from using the trade mark the logo and the carton at this interim stage
