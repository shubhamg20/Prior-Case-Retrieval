HEADNOTE Where the report made by a police officer to the Magis trate complies with the requirements of of the Criminal Procedure Code the Magistrate can take cognisance of the case under of the Code That is a privilege given to him and it is his duty to ask for a lawyer if he wants to engage one or to engage one himself or get his relations to engage one for him In view of the words subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act which occur in of the Criminal Procedure Code the evidence given by a witness in <ORG> cannot be used as substantive evidence in <ORG> unless the witness is confronted with those parts of his evidence which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him even though if the only object of the prosecution is to discredit the evidence given in <ORG> by cross examining him with reference to previous statements made in <ORG> it is not necessary to do so The appellant <NAME> was convicted of murder by the Additional Sessions Judge of Amritsar and sentenced to death The first objection taken to the trial is that the Magistrate had no power to take cognizance of the case on the rd October Accordingly the depositions of the three so called eye witnesses which he recorded on the and cannot be received in evidence and if they are excluded then for reasons which I shall set out hereafter the whole case against the appellant collapses because according to the learned counsel there is no other evidence on which the conviction can properly be based We are concerned here with the method set out in clause of sub section namely upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer It is always permissible for the Magistrate to take additional evidence not set out in the challan All that section a requires is that as soon as the police investigation under Chapter XIV of the Code is complete there should be forwarded to the Magis trate a report in the prescribed form setting forth the names of the parties the nature of the information and the names of the persons who appear to be acquainted with the circumstances of the case There is no force in this argument The next point urged was that when the Magistrate re corded the evidence of the three eye witnesses he did not afford the appellant an opportunity of being represented by counsel though he is given that right by section of the Criminal Procedure Code On the other hand if the present story of the appellant is correct and the witnesses were intimidated by the police equally they would take no steps to assist the appellant Therefore had it not been for the fact that there were subsequent proceedings in which the appellant could have raised this objection had there been any sub stance in it we might have considered the argument with more favour But the appellant subsequent conduct indi cates that he had no intention of engaging counsel and made no grievance of the fact That is a privilege given to him and it is his duty to ask for a lawyer if he wants to engage one and to engage one himself or get his relations to engage one for him There is no force in this contention either I refer for example to the first question which reads as follows issueless Was <NAME> deceased your uncle issueless and wanted to gift away his land to <ORG> which fact you resented and to the second question which reads Did you also resent your father mortgaging his land The proper form in these two cases would have been to had to consider was whether under section there were sufficient grounds for committing the appellant for trial and not whether on an appreciation of the whole evidence and other material in the case including witnesses for the defence the charge against him was proved I turn next to the proceedings in <ORG> There are two grave defects there which in my opinion vitiate the trial The second is that when the depositions of some of the witnesses examined before the <ORG> were brought on record in <ORG> under section the witnesses who made the statements were not confronted with their previous statements as required by section of the Evidence Act Now it is evident that when <ORG> is required to make the examination under this section the evidence referred to is the evidence in <ORG> and the circumstances which appear against the accused in that Court There is also more than that in this case He was questioned about this motive in the committal pro ceedings by the Committing Magistrate but even there he was not told who had given the evidence and the material on which the Committing Magistrate relied to establish the presence of motive was not disclosed There is not a single question regarding that either in <ORG> or in <ORG> Another ground on which the Sessions Judge proceeded was the extra judicial confessions made by the appellant to <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The Sessions Judge also relied on the two statements of <NAME> made before the police one of which the police recorded as his dying declaration They also rely on the fact that <NAME> evidence in <ORG> is corroborated by the First Information which he gave to the police It may be that in a given case cross examina tion would be futile for it would only elicit a denial whereas a statement made by the accused which the Code directs should be used as evidence for or against him might be of great value Then in <ORG> there was the additional evidence of the Imperial Serologist showing that the <NAME> had stains of human blood on it It may mean either that the questioner wants to know whether the recording is cor rect or whether the answers given are true or whether there is some mistake or misunderstanding despite the accu rate recording In my opinion the disregard of the provisions of section Criminal Procedure Code is so gross in this case that I feel there is grave likelihood of prejudice But the section goes on but if it is intended to contradict him by the writ ing his attention must before the writing can be proved be called to those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him dis place the evidence given before <ORG> because until that evidence was contradicted and displaced there was no room in this case for permitting the previous state ments to be brought on record and used under section There is some difference of opinion regarding this matter in the High Courts Section provides that the evidence recorded by the Committing Magistrate in the presence of the accused may in the circumstances set out in the section be treated as evidence in the case for all purposes subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act One line of reasoning is that section Evidence Act is not attracted because that section relates to previous statements in writing which are to be used for the purpose of contradiction alone Judges who hold that view consider that the provisions of the Evidence Act referred to are those relating to hearsay and matters of that kind which touch substantive evidence I see no reason why section of the Evidence Act should be excluded when section states that the previous statements are to be subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act Even the learned Judges who take the first view consider for the most part that though it is not obligatory to confront a witness with his former statement when section is re sorted to it is always desirable that that should be done if only for the reason that an omission to do so weakens the value of the testimony If that serves the purpose of the prosecution then nothing more is required but if the prosecution wishes to go further and use the previous testi mony to the contrary as substantive evidence then it must in my opinion confront the witness with those parts of it which are to be used for the purpose of contradicting him The conviction and sentence are set aside and the case is sent back to <ORG> with a direction that that Court will order a retrial de novo in <ORG> treating the committal as good DAs I agree to the order proposed by my learned brother <NAME>
