This appeal is directed against order dated passed by <ORG> of <ORG> whereby the writ petition filed by the appellants questioning the acquisition of their land for planned industrial development of District Gautam Budh Nagar through <ORG> hereinafter referred to as the <ORG> by invoking Section and of the Land Acquisition Act for short the Act as amended by Uttar Pradesh Act No of was dismissed The relevant portions of the notification are extracted below Under Sub Section of Section of the Land Acquisition Act Act no of the Governor is pleased to notify for general information that the land mentioned in the scheduled below is needed for public purpose namely planned industrial development in District Gautam Budh Nagar through <ORG> The appellants challenged the acquisition of their land on several grounds including the following i That the land cannot be used for industrial purposes because in the draft Master Plan of Greater NOIDA the same is shown as part of residential zone That as per the scheme of the said Act each and every section from sections to has an independent role to play though there is an element of interaction between them It is relevant to point out that the acquisition proceedings under the Act are based on the principal of eminent domain and the only protection given to the person whose land is sought to be acquired is an opportunity under Section A of the Act to convince the enquiring authority that the purpose for which the land is sought to be acquired is in fact is not a public purpose and is only purported to be one in the guise of a public purpose It is pertinent to mention here that the respondents No without the application of mind dispensed with the enquiry on the ground of urgency invoking the power conferred by Section or of the Act Further the respondent No without application of mind did not considered the survey report of the abadi of the village Makaura where the entire land is being used for the purpose of residence and grazing of cattle in Khasra No That the said notification under Section of the Act issued by the respondent No and is without application of mind and there was no urgency in the acquisition of land for the planned industrial development as the land as per the master plan the land of the village Makaura is reserved for residential of which the respondent No invoked Section and sub section of the Act by dispensing with an enquiry under Section A of the Act The impugned notification is without any authority of law and volatile of Article A of the Constitution of India which limits the power to acquire land to the authority under the Land Acquisition Act Though in para of the writ petition an averment has been made that the respondents no and without the application of mind dispensed with the enquiry on the ground of urgency invoking the power conferred by Section or of the Act but in the affidavit the said paragraph has been sworn on the basis of perusal of record That the said notification under Section of the Act issued by the respondent No and is without application of mind and there was no urgency in the acquisition of land for the planned industrial development as the land as per the master plan the land of the village Makaura is reserved for residential of which the respondent No invoked Section and sub section of the Act by dispensing with an enquiry under Section A of the Act <ORG> also rejected the appellants plea that in terms of the policy framed by the State <ORG> the land covered by abadi cannot be acquired by observing that no material has been placed on record to show that the policy framed in was still continuing In paragraph of his affidavit <NAME> has attempted to justify invoking of the urgency clause by making the following assertions That in invoking the urgency clause <ORG> has taken into consideration the following factors i <ORG> was constituted under the Industrial Area Development Act to promote Industrial and Urban Development in the Area If objections are to be invited and hearing be given to such large number of tenure holders it would take long time to dispose of the objections thereof and would hamper the planned development of the area The first of the documents marked Annexure A is copy of letter dated sent by the Commissioner and Director <ORG> to the Special Secretary <ORG> on the subject of issuance of notification under Sections and of the Act for acquisition of lands measuring hectares of village Makora The second document is an undated letter signed by Deputy Chief Executive Officer Greater Noida Collector <NAME> and four other officers officials The last document which forms part of Annexure A is form No showing the list of properties having constructions etc Annexure A is copy of letter dated sent by the Director <ORG> to the Special Secretary <ORG> Learned counsel submitted that the appellants had specifically pleaded that there was no valid ground to invoke the urgency clause contained in Section and to dispense with the application of Section A but <ORG> did not even call upon the respondents to file counter affidavit and brushed aside the challenge to the acquisition proceeding on a wholly untenable premise that the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition was laconic Another argument of the learned counsel is that <ORG> misdirected itself in summarily dismissing the writ petition ignoring the substantive plea of discrimination raised by the appellants <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondents urged that this Court should not nullify the acquisition at the instance of the appellants because the pleadings filed before <ORG> were not supported by proper affidavit <NAME> argued that <ORG> was justified in non suiting the appellants because they did not produce any evidence to effectively challenge the invoking of urgency provision contained in Section We shall also consider an ancillary issue as to whether the appellants had succeeded in prima facie proving that there was no justification to invoke the urgency clause and to dispense with the inquiry envisaged under Section A That Act envisaged that if the person having interest in land is not agreeable to part with possession by accepting the amount offered to him then the Collector may make a reference to <ORG> With a view to overcome this problem the legislature enacted the Act on the line of the English Lands Clauses Consolidation Act However the land owners or persons having interest in land did not have any say in the acquisition process either under pre legislations or the Act un amended The statement of Objects and Reasons contained in Bill No of which led to enactment of the amending Act read as under The Land Acquisition Act I of does not provide that persons having an interest in land which it is proposed to acquire shall have the right of objecting to such acquisition nor is Government bound to enquire into and consider any objections that may reach them The object of this Bill is to provide that a Local Government shall not declare under Section of the Act that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the notification under Section for persons interested in the land to put in objections and for such objections to be considered by <ORG> Similarly large scale acquisitions have been made on behalf of the companies by invoking the provisions contained in Part VII of the Act Therefore while examining the land owner challenge to the acquisition of land in a petition filed under Article of the Constitution <ORG> should not adopt a pedantic approach as has been done in the present case and decide the matter keeping in view the constitutional goals of social and economic justice and the fact that even though the right to property is no longer a fundamental right the same continues to be an important constitutional right and in terms of Article A no person can be deprived of his property except by authority of law In cases where the acquisition is made by invoking Section read with Section and or <ORG> should insist upon filing of reply affidavit by the respondents and production of the relevant records and carefully scrutinize the same before pronouncing upon legality of the impugned notification action because a negative result without examining the relevant records to find out whether the competent authority had formed a bona fide opinion on the issue of invoking the urgency provision and excluding the application of Section A is likely to make the land owner a landless poor and force him to migrate to the nearby city only to live in a slum If the acquisition is intended to benefit private person and the provisions contained in Section and or are invoked then scrutiny of the justification put forward by the <ORG> should be more rigorous in cases involving the challenge to the acquisition of land the pleadings should be liberally construed and relief should not be denied to the petitioner by applying the technical rules of procedure embodied in the Code of Civil Procedure and other procedural laws In this context it is apposite to observe that while dealing with challenge to the acquisition of land belonging to those who suffer from handicaps of poverty illiteracy and ignorance and do not have the resources to access the material relied upon by the functionaries of the <ORG> and its agencies for forming an opinion or recording a satisfaction that the urgency provisions contained in Section should be resorted to and or the enquiry envisaged under Section A should be dispensed with <ORG> should not literally apply the abstract rules of burden of proof enshrined in the Evidence Act The Court should also bear in mind that the relevant records are always in the exclusive possession domain of the authorities of the <ORG> and or its agencies It can be challenged firstly on the ground of mala fides secondly on the ground that the authority which formed that opinion or which arrived at such satisfaction did not apply its mind to the material on which it formed the opinion or arrived at the satisfaction and thirdly that the material on which it formed its opinion or reached the satisfaction was so insufficient that no man could reasonably reach that conclusion The court can interfere only in such cases where there was no material at all or the material was so insufficient that no man could have reasonably reached that conclusion To start with this statement itself is vague in the sense that it is not clear whether the development and utilization of the lands referred to in that statement was confined to the lands mentioned in the schedule to the notification or it applied to a wider area of which such lands formed only a part emphasis supplied While dealing with the argument of the <ORG> that it was for the petitioner to prove that there was no material to justify invoking of the urgency clause this Court observed We do not think that a question relating to burden of proof is always free from difficulty or is quite so simple as it is sought to be made out here But as soon as we speak of a challenge we have to bear in mind the general burdens laid down by Sections and of the Evidence Act On the other hand if in addition to the bare assertions made by the petitioners that the urgency contemplated by Section did not exist there were other facts and circumstances including the failure of the <ORG> to indicate facts and circumstances which it could have easily disclosed if they existed the petitioners could be held to have discharged their general onus If it appears upon an examination of the totality of facts in the case that the power conferred has been exercised for an extraneous or irrelevant purpose or that the mind has not been applied at all to the real object or purpose of a power so that the result is that the exercise of power could only serve some other or collateral object the court will interfere The <ORG> finally held as under There is no indication whatsoever in the affidavit filed on behalf of the <ORG> the mind of the Commissioner was applied at all to the question whether it was a case necessitating the elimination of the enquiry under Section A of the Act We shall now consider whether there was any valid ground or justification for invoking the urgency provision contained in Section and to exclude the application of Section A for the acquisition of land for planned industrial development of the district Sections A as amended and of the Act which have bearing on this question read as under Whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose or for a company a notification to that effect shall be published in <ORG> and in two daily newspapers circulating in that locality of which at least one shall be in the regional language and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the said locality the last of the dates of such publication and the giving of such public notice being hereinafter referred to as the date of the publication of the notification Thereupon it shall be lawful for any officer either generally or specially authorized by such Government in this behalf and for his servants and workmen to enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in such locality to dig or bore into the sub soil to do all other acts necessary to ascertain whether the land is adapted for such purpose to set out the boundaries of the land proposed to be taken and the intended line of the work if any proposed to be made thereon to mark such levels boundaries and line by placing marks and cutting trenches and where otherwise the survey cannot be completed and the levels taken and the boundaries and line marked to cut down and clear away any part of any standing crop fence or jungle Provided that no person shall enter into any building or upon any enclosed court or garden attached to a dwelling house unless with the consent of the occupier thereof without previously giving such occupier at least seven days notice in writing of his intention to do so Any person interested in any land which has been notified under section sub section as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose or for a company may within thirty days from the date of the publication of the notification object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case may be Every objection under sub section shall be made to the Collector in writing and the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard in person or by any person authorized by him in this behalf or by pleader and shall after hearing all such objections and after making such further inquiry if any as he thinks necessary either make a report in respect of the land which has been notified under section sub section or make different reports in respect of different parcels of such land to the appropriate <ORG> containing his recommendations on the objections together with the record of the proceedings held by him for the decision of that <ORG> Declaration that land is required for a public purpose Subject to the provisions of Part VII of this Act when the appropriate Government is satisfied after considering the report if any made under section A sub section that any particular land is needed for a public purpose or for a <ORG> a declaration shall be made to that effect under the signature of a Secretary to such Government or of some officer duly authorized to certify its orders and different declarations may be made from time to time in respect of different parcels of any land covered by the same notification under section sub section irrespective of whether one report or different reports has or have been made wherever required under section A sub section Provided that no declaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification under section sub section i xx xx xx xx ii published after the commencement of the Land Acquisition Amendment Act shall be made after the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the notification Provided further that no such declaration shall be made unless the compensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid by a Company or wholly or partly out of public revenues or some fund controlled or managed by a local authority In computing any of the periods referred to in the first proviso the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the notification issued under section sub section is stayed by an order of a <ORG> shall be excluded Where the compensation to be awarded for such property is to be paid out of the funds of a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> such compensation shall be deemed to be compensation paid out of public revenues Every declaration shall be published in the Official Gazette and in two daily newspapers circulating in the locality in which the land is situate of which at least one shall be in the regional language and the Collector shall cause public notice of the substance of such declaration to be given at convenient places in the said locality the last of the date of such publication and the giving of such public notice being hereinafter referred to as the date of the publication of the declaration and such declaration shall state the district or other territorial division in which the land is situate the purpose for which it is needed its approximate area and where a plan shall have been made of the land the place where such plan may be inspected The said declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or for a Company as the case may be and after making such declaration the appropriate Government may acquire the land in manner hereinafter appearing In cases of urgency whenever the appropriate <ORG> so directs the Collector though no such award has been made may on the expiration of fifteen days from the publication of the notice mentioned in section sub section take possession of any land needed for a public purpose Whenever owing to any sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency it becomes necessary for any Railway Administration to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the maintenance of their traffic or for the purpose of making thereon a river side or ghat station or of providing convenient connection with or access to any such station or the appropriate <ORG> considers it necessary to acquire the immediate possession of any land for the purpose of maintaining any structure or system pertaining to irrigation water supply drainage road communication or electricity the Collector may immediately after the publication of the notice mentioned in sub section and with the previous sanction of the appropriate <ORG> enter upon and take possession of such land which shall thereupon vest absolutely in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances Provided that the Collector shall not take possession of any building or part of a building under this sub section without giving to the occupier thereof at least forty eight hours notice of his intention so to do or such longer notice as may be reasonably sufficient to enable such occupier to remove his movable property from such building without unnecessary inconvenience In every case under either of the preceding sub sections the Collector shall at that time of taking possession offer to the persons interested compensation for the standing crops and trees if any on such land and from any other damage sustained by them caused by such sudden dispossession and not excepted in section and in case such offer is not accepted the value of such crops and trees and the amount of such other damage shall be allowed for in awarding compensation for the land under the provisions herein contained A Before taking possession of any land under sub section or sub section the Collector shall without prejudice to the provisions of sub section a tender payment of eighty per centum of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to the persons interested entitled thereto and pay it to them unless prevented by some one or more of the contingencies mentioned in section sub section and where the Collector is so prevented the provisions of section sub section except the second proviso thereto shall apply as they apply to the payment of compensation under that section The amount paid or deposited under sub section A shall be taken into account for determining the amount of compensation required to be tendered under section and where the amount so paid or deposited exceeds the compensation awarded by the Collector under section the excess may unless refunded within three months from the date of Collector award be recovered as an arrear of land revenue In the case of any land to which in the opinion of the appropriate Government the provisions of sub section or sub section are applicable the appropriate Government may direct that the provisions of section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under section in respect of the land at any time after the date of the publication of the notification under section sub section That proviso reads as under Provided that where in the case of any land notification under section sub section has been published in the Official Gazette on or after September but before January and the appropriate Government has under this sub section directed that the provisions of section A shall not apply a declaration under section in respect of the land may be made either simultaneously with or at any time after the publication in the Official Gazette of the notification under section sub section A duty is also cast on the Collector as defined in Section to cause public notice of the substance of such notification to be given at convenient places in the locality Section lays down that after publication of the notification under Section any officer authorised by the <ORG> in this behalf his servants or workmen can enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in the locality or to dig or bore into the sub soil and to do all other acts necessary for ascertaining that land is suitable for the purpose of acquisition The Collector is required to give the objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by any person authorized by him or by pleader After hearing the objector and making such further inquiry as he may think necessary the Collector has to make a report in respect of land notified under Section with his recommendations on the objections and forward the same to the <ORG> along with the record of the proceedings held by him Upon receipt of the Collector report the appropriate <ORG> is required to take action under Section which lays down that after considering the report if any made under Section A the appropriate <ORG> is satisfied that any particular land is needed for a public purpose then a declaration to that effect is required to be made under the signatures of a Secretary to the <ORG> or of some officer duly authorised to certify its orders This section also envisages making of different declarations from time to time in respect of different parcels of land covered by the same notification issued under Section In terms of clause ii of proviso to Section no declaration in respect of any particular land covered by a notification issued under Section which is published after can be made after expiry of one year from the date of publication of the notification In terms of Section every declaration made under Section is required to be published in the official gazette and in two daily newspapers having circulation in the locality in which land proposed to be acquired is situated The Collector is also required to cause public notice of the substance of such declaration to be given at convenient places in the locality Section lays down that the declaration made under Section shall be conclusive evidence of the fact that land is needed for a public purpose Section envisages holding of an enquiry into the claim and passing of an award by the Collector who is required to take into consideration the provisions contained in Section If the appropriate <ORG> decides that land proposed to be acquired is urgently needed for a public purpose then it can authorise the competent authority to take possession Section lays down that in cases where appropriate <ORG> comes to the conclusion that there is existence of an urgency or unforeseen emergency it can direct that provisions of Section A shall not apply <NAME> argued that even though the board had the legal authority to tear his house down no person should be deprived of their property without notice <NAME> stated Although there are not positive words in a statute requiring that the party shall be heard yet the justice of the common law shall supply the omission of the legislature But I do not think they are bound to treat such questions as though it were a trial they can obtain information in any way they think best always giving a fair opportunity to those who are parties in the controversy for correcting or contradicting any relevant statement prejudicial in their view In <NAME> <NAME> AC Lord <NAME> said that the right of a man to be given a fair opportunity of hearing what is alleged against him and of presenting his own case is so fundamental to any civilized legal system that it is to be presumed that <ORG> intended that failure to observe the same should render null and void any decision reached in breach of this requirement To use the phrase which better expresses the underlying concept what the requirements of fairness demand when any body domestic administrative or judicial has to make a decision which will affect the rights of individuals depends on the character of the decision making body the kind of decision it has to make and the statutory or other framework in which it operates In particular it is well established that when a statute has conferred on any body the power to make decisions affecting individuals the courts will not only require the procedure prescribed by the statute to be followed but will readily imply so much and no more to be introduced by way of additional procedural safeguards as will ensure the attainment of fairness This right has its roots in the notion of fair procedure It draws the attention of the party concerned to the imperative necessity of not overlooking the other side of the case before coming to its decision for nothing is more likely to conduce to just and right decision than the practice of giving hearing to the affected parties The exceptions to the rules of natural justice are a misnomer or rather are but a shorthand form of expressing the idea that in those exclusionary cases nothing unfair can be inferred by not affording an opportunity to present or meet a case But at the same time it must be remembered that this is a rule of vital importance in the field of administrative law and it must not be jettisoned save in very exceptional circumstances where compulsive necessity so demands The core of it must however remain namely that the person affected must have a reasonable opportunity of being heard and the hearing must be a genuine hearing and not an empty public relations exercise After hearing all objections and making further inquiry he is to make a report to the appropriate <ORG> containing his recommendation on the objections The legislature has therefore made complete provisions for the persons interested to file objections against the proposed acquisition and for the disposal of their objections The person interested or known to be interested in the land is to be served personally of the notification giving him the opportunity of objecting to the acquisition and awakening him to such right That at the time of the enquiry for which prior notice shall be essential the objector has the right to appear in person or through pleader and substantiate his objection by evidence and argument The acquisition of land under Section read with Section and or has generated substantial litigation in last years The learned Single Judge and <ORG> of <ORG> negatived the appellants challenge by observing that once Section is invoked there was no necessity to hold enquiry under Section A This Court set aside the order of <ORG> of <ORG> and held It will be seen that Section gives power to the Government to direct the Collector though no award has been made under Section to take possession of any waste or arable land needed for public purpose and such land thereupon vests absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances If action is taken under Section taking possession and vesting which are provided in Section after the award under Section are accelerated and can take place fifteen days after the publication of the notice under Section Then comes Section which provides that in case of any land to which the provisions of sub section are applicable the Government may direct that the provisions of Section A shall not apply and if it does so direct a declaration may be made under Section in respect of the land at any time after the publication of the notification under Section It will be seen that it is not necessary even where the Government makes a direction under Section that it should also make a direction under Section If the Government makes a direction only under Section the procedure under Section A would still have to be followed before a notification under Section is issued though after that procedure has been followed and a notification under Section is issued the Collector gets the power to take possession of the land after the notice under Section without waiting for the award and on such taking possession the land shall vest absolutely in Government free from all encumbrances It may be that generally where an order is made under Section an order under Section is also passed but in law it is not necessary that this should be so It will also be seen that under the Land Acquisition Act an order under Section or Section can only be passed with respect to waste or arable land and it cannot be passed with respect to land which is not waste or arable and on which buildings stand <ORG> dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellant by observing that the Court cannot interfere with the subjective satisfaction reached by <ORG> on the issue of urgency If therefore in a case the land under acquisition is not actually waste or arable land but <ORG> has formed the opinion that the provisions of sub section of Section are applicable the court may legitimately draw an inference that <ORG> did not honestly form that opinion or that in forming that opinion <ORG> did not apply its mind to the relevant facts bearing on the question at issue It follows therefore that the notification of <ORG> under Section of the Act directing that the provisions of Section A shall not apply to the land is ultra vires In more lands were acquired from the same village by issuing notification under Section This time the land owners were given opportunity to file their objections and after considering the same <ORG> issued notification under Section for the acquisition of acres land In <ORG> submitted fresh proposal for the acquisition of land belonging to the appellants and others total land measuring acres The State Government issued notification under Section read with Section and of the Act clearly indicating therein that Section A was not applicable But curiously enough nothing happened urgently and Section notification which is impugned in the present case was issued on Why this delay took place and why the State did not think it fit to urgently respond to the proposal of <ORG> has remained a question mark for which there is no answer furnished by the respondent authorities in the present cases and nothing is brought on the record by them to explain the delay But so far as the process of the acquisition was concerned the respondents were taking their own time which would be evident from the fact that the notification under Section read with Section was issued on but was published in the newspaper on whereas the declaration under Section of the Act was made on and that on the one hand the respondents had deprived the petitioners of filing their objections under Section A of the Act on the ground of urgency of acquisition but on the other hand they themselves had taken more than nine months in issuing the declaration under Section of the said Act When we turn to these annexures we find that AnnexureCA is a letter dated written by the District Magistrate Ghaziabad to the Joint Secretary <ORG> <ORG> The last Annexure CA is the letter dated written by <ORG> to the Land Acquisition Officer proposing urgent acquisition of the lands in question We have already made a reference to the said letter It recites that if immediate action for acquisition of the aforesaid lands adjacent to Sector for development of which the acquisition was to be resorted to was not taken then there was possibility of encroachment over the area cannot by any stretch of imagination be considered to be a germane ground for invoking urgency powers for dispensing with Section A inquiry Even if acquisition takes place urgently by dispensing with inquiry under Section A and the possession is taken urgently after Section notification within days of issuance of notice under Section sub section even then there is no guarantee that the acquired land would not be encroached upon by unruly persons It is a law and order problem which has nothing to do with the acquisition and urgency for taking possession It requires an opinion to be formed by the <ORG> concerned that along with the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency there is also a need for dispensing with Section A inquiry which indicates that the legislature intended the appropriate <ORG> to apply its mind before dispensing with Section A inquiry But then that is not the language of the section which in our opinion requires the appropriate <ORG> to further consider the need for dispensing with Section A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency An argument was sought to be advanced on behalf of the appellants that once the appropriate Government comes to the conclusion that there is an urgency or unforeseen emergency under Sections and the dispensation with inquiry under Section A becomes automatic and the same can be done by a composite order meaning thereby that there is no need for the appropriate Government to separately apply its mind for any further emergency for dispensation with an inquiry under Section A We are unable to agree with the above argument because sub section of Section itself indicates that the Government may direct that the rovisions of Section A shall not apply emphasis supplied which makes it clear that not in every case where the appropriate Government has come to the conclusion that there is urgency and under sub section or unforeseen emergency under sub section of Section the Government will ipso facto have to direct the dispensation of the inquiry Section confers extraordinary powers on the authorities under which it can dispense with the normal procedure laid down under Section A of the Act in exceptional case of urgency Such powers cannot be lightly resorted to except in case of real urgency enabling the <ORG> to take immediate possession of the land proposed to be acquired for public purpose Section no doubt deals with special situations and exceptional circumstances covering cases of urgency and unforeseen emergency The use of the expression may in sub section of Section leaves no room of doubt that it is a discretionary power of the government to direct that the provisions of Section A would not apply to such cases covered by sub section or of Section of the Act In our opinion therefore the contention of learned counsel for the respondent authorities is not well founded and cannot be upheld that once a case is covered by sub section or of Section of the Act sub section of Section would necessarily apply and there is no question of holding inquiry or hearing objections under Section A of the Act Such observations had been made in reference to an observation made in the earlier decision in <NAME> case and keeping in mind the fact that right to property was no longer a fundamental right an observation was made that even if the right to property was no longer a fundamental right the observations relating to Article would continue to apply in full force with regard to Section A of the LA Act It is true that power conferred upon the <ORG> under Section is administrative and its opinion is entitled to due weight but in a case where the opinion is formed regarding the urgency based on considerations not germane to the purpose the judicial review of such administrative decision may become necessary Generally speaking the development of an area for residential purposes or a planned development of city takes many years if not decades and therefore there is no reason why summary enquiry as contemplated under Section A may not be held and objections of landowners persons interested may not be considered The special provision has been made in Section to eliminate enquiry under Section A in deserving and cases of real urgency The Government has to apply its mind on the aspect that urgency is of such nature that necessitates dispensation of enquiry under Section A In Civil Appeal No decided on March the acquisition of land for construction of district jails was quashed on the ground that there was no valid ground or justification to exclude the application of Section A of the Act and it was observed Admittedly the Land Acquisition Act a pre Constitutional legislation of colonial vintage is a drastic law being expropriatory in nature as it confers on the <ORG> a power which affects person property right If must be remembered that the satisfaction under Section is a subjective one and that so long as there is material upon which the <ORG> could have formed the said satisfaction fairly the <ORG> would not interfere nor would it examine the material as an appellate authority of and of by which amendments were made in Section of the Act We are completely convinced that there was necessity in this <ORG> considering the various reasons like enormousness of the <ORG> likelihood of the encroachments number of appellants who would have required to be heard and the time taken for that purpose and the fact that the <ORG> had lingered already from till We do not see any reason why we should take a different view than what is taken by the <ORG> Section read with Section confers extraordinary power upon the <ORG> to acquire private property without complying with the mandate of Section A vi The satisfaction of the Government on the issue of urgency is subjective but is a condition precedent to the exercise of power under Section and the same can be challenged on the ground that the purpose for which the private property is sought to be acquired is not a public purpose at all or that the exercise of power is vitiated due to mala fides or that the concerned authorities did not apply mind to the relevant factors and the records vii The exercise of power by the Government under Section does not necessarily result in exclusion of Section A of the Act in terms of which any person interested in land can file objection and is entitled to be heard in support of his objection The use of word may in sub section of Section makes it clear that it merely enables the Government to direct that the provisions of Section A would not apply to the cases covered under sub section or of Section The <ORG> can take judicial notice of the fact that planning execution and implementation of the schemes relating to development of residential commercial industrial or institutional areas usually take few years A recapitulation of the facts shows that upon receipt of proposal from <ORG> <ORG> issued directions to the concerned authorities to take action for the acquisition of land in different villages including village Makora If there is any delay in the acquisition of land then the same is likely to be encroached and that will adversely affect the concept of planned industrial development of the district It is neither the pleaded case of the respondents nor any evidence has been produced before the Court to show that <ORG> and or agencies instrumentalities of the <ORG> are intending to establish industrial units on the acquired land either by itself or through its agencies instrumentalities The respondents have justified the invoking of urgency provisions by making assertions which are usually made in such cases by the executive authorities i the inflow of funds in the <ORG> in the form of investment by private entrepreneurs and availability of larger employment opportunities to the people of the area However we do not find any plausible reason to accept this tailor made justification for approving the impugned action which has resulted in depriving the appellants of their constitutional right to property Of course in terms of sub section the Collector is required to give opportunity of hearing to the objector and submit report to the <ORG> after making such further inquiry as he thinks necessary The authorities up to the level of the Commissioner completed the exercise of survey and preparation of documents by the end of December but it took one year and almost three months to <ORG> to issue notification under Section read with Section and The time limit of one year specified in clause ii of the proviso to Section is the outer limit for issue of declaration The only possible conclusion which can be drawn from the above discussion is that there was no real and substantive urgency which could justify invoking of the urgency provision under Section and in any case there was no warrant to exclude the application of Section A which as mentioned above represent the statutory embodiment of the rule of <ORG> We also find merit in the appellants plea that the acquisition of their land is vitiated due to violation of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article of the Constitution Why their land was not left out from acquisition has not been explained in the counter affidavit filed by the respondents The impugned order is set aside and the writ petition filed by the appellants is allowed It is however made clear that the respondents shall be free to proceed from the stage of Section notification and take appropriate action after complying with Section A and of the Act
