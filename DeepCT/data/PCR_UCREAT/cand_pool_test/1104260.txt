Vs RESPONDENT THE COMMISSIONER OF INCOME TAX BOMBAY DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> SHAH GROVER A CITATION AIR CITATOR INFO SC SC ACT Indian Income tax Act vii and Full disclosure of material facts to Income tax Officer within meaning of a what amounts to Failure to show excess of price for which assets sold in return and further failure to show written down value amounts to failure to disclose facts <ORG> must determine whether any profits are made under section vii Without this being first determined <ORG> in reference under section cannot decide whether there has been failure to disclose material facts He hold that the appellant had not disclosed its profit under vii of the Act resulting from the sale of its assets and determining the said profits at Rs he made a re assessment The <ORG> however held that the material facts were all disclosed to the Income tax Officer at the time of the original assessment and a mere change of opinion did not justify proceedings under a At the request of the Commissioner of Income tax the <ORG> referred to <ORG> the questions i whether in the circumstances of the case it could be held that in the original assessment proceedings the assessee had made a full disclosure of material particulars and ii whether having initiated proceedings under a the Income tax Officer could have later relied on HELD The law casts a duty on the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for the relevant year This failure amounted to a failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly the material facts necessary for its assessment RM RM Muthiah Chettiar Commissioner of Income tax Madras I held inapplicable It also brought to the notice of the Income tax Officer the following documents a Appropriate extract from the minutes of the meeting of the Board of Directors of <ORG> held on agreeing to purchase the assets of the assessee company Resolution passed on by <ORG> for the assessee company deciding to sell the concern to <ORG> Agreement dated between the said two companies Later on in response to a letter from <ORG> the assessee company informed him the manner in which the sale price of Rs We may mention at this stage that the consideration received by the assessee company for the sale of its assets was much more than their written down value The assessee unsuccessfully contended that there was no basis for his conclusion that there was any failure on its part to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessment It was urged before the tribunal on behalf of the assessee that no portion of the price realised by the sale of its assets came within the scope of vii and further even if any portion of that price can be considered as deemed profits under vii it was impermissible for the Income tax Officer to initiate proceedings under a as the assessee had placed all the primary facts before the Income tax Officer and therefore it cannot be said that it had not fully and truly disclosed all material facts On behalf of the <ORG> it was urged before the tribunal that the part of price realised by the sale of the assets should be deemed as profits under vii those profits had not been included in the return of the assessee nor has the assessee placed all the material facts necessary for determining its tax liability therefore the income tax Officer was justified in initiating proceedings under a and at any rate the impugned assessment can be justified under The tribunal did not go into the question whether any part of the sale proceeds can be considered as deemed profits under vii but it held that the assessee had placed before the Income tax Officer all the primary facts necessary for its assessment and therefore it cannot be said that it had failed to disclose fully and truly all material facts Whether or not there was any profit under vii and if so whether it was taxable was an inference to be drawn from the facts which were fully placed before the Income tax Officer The mere omission of the sale transaction from section of Part I of the return of income would not enable the Departmental authorities to hold that the assessee had failed to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for its assessment It rejected the contention of the <ORG> that the impugned assessment can be justified under as according to it the facts proved in the case do not bring the case within that Provision and further the Income tax Officer did not proceed under that provision at the very outset for the purpose of considering whether the assessee had placed before the Income tax Officer truly and fully all material facts necessary for the purpose of its assessment If it is found that any portion of that sale price are profits then in our opinion <ORG> was right in holding that the assessee had failed to place before the Income tax Officer during the original assessment truly and fully all material facts necessary for the purpose of assessment The law casts a duty oil the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for his assessment for that year If the assessee had disclosed to the Income tax Officer the surplus price realised by it over and above the written down value of the assets sold or in the alternative if it had informed the Income tax Officer the price realised as well as the written down value of the assets sold then it could have been said that the assessee had done its duty and it was for the Income tax officer to draw any inference on the facts placed before him But the failure of the assessee to disclose to the Income tax Officer the fact that the price realised by it by sale of its assets was more than the written down value of those assets or at least the written down value of those assets amounts in our opinion to a failure on its part to disclose fully and truly the material facts necessary for its assessment In that case the question that arose for decision was whether the assessee failure to include in his return the income of his wife and his minor sons admitted to the partnership of which he was a partner assessable in his hands under a ii can be considered as a failure to disclose This <ORG> came to the conclusion that the omission in question did not come within the scope of a Therein this <ORG> observed that in the form of return prescribed under rule of the Indian Income tax Rules framed under of the Act there was no clause which required disclosure of the income of any person other than the income of the assessee which was liable to be included in his total income Indeed when it is remembered that people often differ as regards what inferences should be drawn from given facts it will be meaningless to demand that the assessee must disclose what inferences whether Of facts or law he would draw from the primary facts The tribunal must first decide that question and thereafter decide the other questions of law arising for decision on the basis of its decision whether there was any profits falling within vii In the result we allow this appeal and in place of the answers given by <ORG> we enter a decision to decline to answer those questions In the circumstances of the case we make no order as to costs
