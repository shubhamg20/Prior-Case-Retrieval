HEADNOTE Section of the Special Powers Act XIV Of provided as follows Whoever by word either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise instigates expressly or by implication any person or class of persons not to pay or to defer payment of any liability and whoever does any act with intent or knowing it to be likely that any words signs or visible representations containing such instigation shall thereby be communicated directly or indirectly to any person or class of persons in any manner whatsoever shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine extending to Rs It is well settled by decisions of this Court that in a restriction in order to be reasonable must have a reasonable relation to the object the Legislation has in view and must not go beyond it So judged it cannot be said that the acts prohibited under the wide and sweeping provisions of of the Act can have any proximate or even foreseeable connection with public order sought to be protected by it and consequently that section being violative of the right to freedom of speech guaranteed by Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal raises the question of interpretation of the words in the interest of public order in Art Thereafter the respondent filed a petition before <ORG> for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground among others that of the Special Powers Act Act No XIV of hereinafter called the Act was void under the Constitution The restrictions imposed by section of the Special Powers Act were not in the interests of public order In the usual course the matter was placed before the two learned Judges who first heard the case and they on the basis of the majority view allowed the petition and directed the respondent to be released The State has preferred the present appeal against the said order of <ORG> The gist of the argument of the learned Advocate General may be stated thus The legislature can make laws placing reasonable restrictions on the rights of a citizen to freedom of speech and expression in the interests of public order among other grounds The avowed object of of the Act was to prevent persons from instigating others to break the laws imposing a liability upon a person or class of persons to pay taxes and other dues to the <ORG> any authority or to any land owner As the argument centres round this section it will be convenient to read the same Section Whoever by word either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise instigates expressly or by implication any person or class of persons not to pay or to defer payment of any liability and whoever does any act with intent or knowing it to be likely that any words signs or visible representations con taining such instigation shall thereby be communicated directly or indirectly to any person or class of persons in any manner whatsoever shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine extending to Rs The impugned section may be dissected into the following components i whoever by word either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise ii instigates iii expressly or by implication iv any person or class of persons not to pay any liability vi to defer payment of any liability vii does an act with intent that any words etc A instigates not to pay any liability to <ORG> any authority or to any land owner A instigates to defer payment of any liability to <ORG> any authority or landlord A instigates a class of persons to do the same A may do any one of the foregoing things not only by word but also by signs visible representations or otherwise A may do any one of the things bona fide either to get the claim decided in a Court of law or to gain time to get the law changed A may instigate not to pay any amount due to <ORG> or to any authority but the said amount can be recovered by the authority concerned as arrears of land revenue A may tell with intention or with knowledge that the said instigation may be communicated to so that he may not pay any statement by A to may imply such instigation The material portions of the relevant provisions of the Constitution may now be read Article All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression Nothing in sub clause a of clause shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the <ORG> from making any law in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause in the interests of the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decenc or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence therefore does not affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the <ORG> from making any law in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right of freedom of speech in the interest of public order among others The expression has not been define in the Constitution but it occurs in List II of its Seventh Schedule and is also inserted by the Constitution First Amendment Act in el In considering whether the impugned Act was made in the interests of security of the <ORG> <NAME> as he then was after citing the observation of <NAME> in his Criminal Law of England states Though all these offences thus involve disturbances of public tranquillity and are in theory offences against public order the difference between them being only a difference of degree yet for the purpose of gurading the punishment to be inflicted in respect of them they may be classified into different minor categories as has been done by the Indian Penal Code Similarly the Constitution in formulating the varying criteria for permissible legislation imposing restrictions on the fundamental rights enumerated in article has placed in a distinct category those offences against public order which aim at undermining the security of the <ORG> or overthrowing it and made their prevention the sole justification for legislative abridgement of freedom of speech and expression that is to say nothing less than endangering the foundations of the <ORG> or threatening its overthrow could justify curtailment of the rights to freedom of speech and expres sion The learned Judge continued to state The Constitution thus requires a line to be drawn in the field of public order or tranquillity marking off may be roughly the boundary between those serious and aggravated forms of public disorder which are calculated to endanger the security of the <ORG> and the relatively minor breaches of the peace of a purely local significance treating for this purpose differences in degree as if they were differences in kind The learned Judge proceeded further to state We are therefore of opinion that unless a law restricting freedom of speech and expression is directed solely against the undermining of the security of the <ORG> or the overthrow of it such law cannot fall within the reservation under clause of article although the restrictions which it seeks to impose may have been conceived generally in the interests of public order <NAME> case could easily have been avoided as it was avoided by <NAME> who in very emphatic terms said as follows I have read and re read the judgments of <ORG> and I can find nothing in them myself which bear directly on the point at issue and leads me to think that in their opinion a restriction of this kind is no longer permissible It enables the imposition of reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right to freedom of speech and expression in the interests of the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence The next question is what do the words interest of public order mean The learned Advocate General contends that the phrase in the interest of public order is of a wider connotation than the words for the maintenance of public order and therefore any breach of law which may have the tendency however remote to disturb the public order would be covered by the said phrase It is not necessary to state the facts of that case as reliance is placed only on the observations of <NAME> at which read It will be noticed that the language employed in the amended clause is in the interests of and not for the maintenance of The question was whether the preventive detention provided for in i of the said Act was preventive detention for reasons connected with the maintenance of public order The limitation imposed in the interests of public order to be a reasonable restriction should be one which has a proximate connection or nexus with public order but not one far fetched hypothetical or problematical or too remote in the chain of its relation with the public order There is no proximate or even forseeable connection between such instigation and the public order sought to be protected under this section We cannot accept the argument of the learned Advocate General that instigation of a single individual not to pay tax or dues is a spark which may in the long run ignite a revolutionary movement destroying public order It is said that in a democratic set up there is no scope for agitational approach and that if a law is bad the only course is to get it modified by democratic process and that any instigation to break the law is in itself a disturbance of the public order Unless there is a proximate connection between the instigation and the public order the restriction in our view is neither reasonable nor is it in the interest of public order He asks us to read the section as follows Whoever by word either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise instigates expressly or by implication any class of persons not to pay or to defer payment of any liability and whoever does any act with intent or knowing it to be likely that any words signs or visible representations containing such instigation shall thereby be communicated directly or indirectly to any class of persons in any manner whatsoever shall be punishable with imprisonment which may extend to six months or with fine extending to Rs This Court having regard to the history of the legislation the declared object thereof and the wording of the statute came to the conclusion that the competitions which were Sought to be controlled and regulated by the Act were only those competitions in which success did not depend to any substantial degree on skill That conclusion was sufficient to reject the contention raised in that case but even on the assumption that The foregoing discussion yields the following results Public order is synonymous with public safety and tranquillity it is the absence of disorder involving breaches of local significance in contradistinction to national upheavals such as revolution civil strife war affecting the security of the <ORG> there must be proximate and reasonable nexus between the speech and the public order as it now stands does not establish in most of the cases comprehended by it any such nexus there is a conflict of decision on the question of severability in the context of an offending provision the language whereof is wide enough to cover restrictions both within and without the limits of constitutionally permissible legislation one view is that it cannot be split up if there is possibility of its being applied for purposes not sanctioned by the Constitution and the other view is that such a provision is valid if it is severable in its application to an object which is clearly demarcated from other object or objects falling outside the limits of constitutionally permissible legislation and the provisions of the section are so inextricably mixed up that it is not possible to apply the doctrine of severability so as to enable us to affirm the validity of a part of it and reject the rest The learned Advocate General made an impassioned appeal to persuade us to express our view that though the present section is void on the ground that it is an unreasonable restriction on the fundamental right in the interests of public order the <ORG> could legitimately re draft it in a way that it would conform to the provisions of Art
