It appears that on the two brothers plaintiffs served a notice on the appellant requiring him to vacate the shop After the decision of the learned <NAME> the matter was taken up in appeal by the tenant The other appellant before the lower appellate Court i <NAME> prosecuted the appeal which was heard and decided by the Civil Judge This contention has little substance In these circumstances <NAME> who obtained the permission will be deemed to have acted as agent on behalf of the other plaintiff even though we exclude the theory that they were members of the joint Hindu family This principle is contained in Section Act which runs as follows A notice given under Section Clause is waived with the express or implied consent of a person to whom it is given by any act on the part of the person giving it showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting Learned counsel for the appellant has argued that in view of the compromise arrived at between the tenant and one of the lessors namely <NAME> there was a waiver of the notice as contemplated by Section Act In such an event under Section Act a notice for determination of the lease already given by the landlord to the tenant will be deemed to have been waived I do not therefore think that any question of waiver arises in this case There is yet another reason why the plea of waiver is not open to the appellant Since the tenancy of the appellant was determined by notice by both the owners of the shop it came to an end There is no substance in the appeal which is dismissed with costs
