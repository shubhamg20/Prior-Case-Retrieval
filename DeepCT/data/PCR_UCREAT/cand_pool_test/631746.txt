has brought two applications in the present suit which was filed by him with leave under Clause of the Letters Patent for a declaration that certain alleged meetings of the defendant company held at different dates mentioned in the plaint and certain resolutions passed at the said meetings are illegal ultra vires and not according to law and not binding on the plaintiff and or the defendant Company For the purposes of these two applications it is not necessary for me to state here in detail the facts of this case because it will suffice if I only indicate that the plaintiff main grievance in the suit as originally filed was that the alleged meetings were held without any notice to him Of the two applications now brought By the plaintiff one is for fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent in respect of the amendments sought for in the plaint and the other application is for leave to amend the plaint in the manner indicated in red ink in the Annexure A The proposed amendment sought to be made is to the effect that the defendant No and defendant No were at all material times minors being under the age of years and as such they were never shareholders or directors of the defendant <ORG> and further that the board meetings or proceedings wherein defendant No and defendant No took part and voted are null and void and of no effect and also the resolutions passed at the said meetings were and are null and void and of no effect There cannot be any question that the proposed amendment introduces a substantially different cause of action The applications are opposed on the ground that no leave under Clause of the Letters Patent can be given at the time of this proposed amendment nor can leave be given to amend the plaint because the amendment proposed is a new cause of action and further it is inconsistent with the cause of action originally pleaded in the plaint The question for determination is a question of considerable importance because I have to consider whether the proposed amendment introducing a new cause of action should be disallowed for the reason that this being a suit instituted with leave to sue under Clause of the Letters Patent no further amendment can be ordered Clause of the Letters Patent provides <ORG> in exercise of its Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction shall be empowered to receive try and determine suits of every description If the cause of action shall have arisen either wholly or in case the leave of the <ORG> shall have been first obtained in part within the local limits of the Ordinary Original Jurisdiction of the said High <ORG> It has been well established in <NAME> <NAME> ILR Bom that the grant of leave under Clause of the Letters Patent is a judicial act which must be held to relate only to the cause of action disclosed in the plaint as presented to the court at the time of the grant It has further been held that such leave which affords the very foundation of the jurisdiction is not available to confer jurisdiction in respect of a different cause of action which was not judicially considered at the time it was granted and that in respect of such a different cause of action leave under Clause cannot be granted after the institution of the suit and that therefore the court cannot try such a different cause of action except in another suit duly instituted and further that in suit for which leave to sue under Clause of the Letters Patent is necessary the <ORG> cannot allow an amendment which substantially alters the original cause of action The learned Judge followed ILR Bom and in the course of his judgment observed that if an amendment which would alter the cause of action was made it necessarily followed that fresh leave should be obtained in respect of the altered cause of action The learned Judge referred both to ILR Bom and AIR Bom and other decisions on the point and observed as follows the grant of leave is a condition precedent to the court having jurisdiction to receive such a suit An amendment to a plaint raising a new cause of action upon which a claim is made is not a fresh suit but is an additional claim made in an existing suit The court leave is previously required in respect of a cause of action before the court can have jurisdiction to receive the suit in which it is alleged In my opinion the court has no jurisdiction to receive try and determine the claims upon the causes of action in the amendment to the plaint since leave was not previously obtained in respect of those causes of action before the suit in which those claims are made was instituted in this court AIR Bom and proceeded to observe that leave Clause was not sought in the case with which he <NAME> was dealing with respect to the cause of action in the amendment either at the time the application was made to amend or when leave was given for the amendment or when the plaint with the amendment was presented to the court and stated that this admission and grant of leave to amend the plaint could not confer upon the court jurisdiction which it did not possess Eventually however he said that the court had no jurisdiction to receive try and determine the claims upon the causes of action in the amendment to the plaint since leave was not previously obtained in respect of those causes of action before the suit in which those claims are made was instituted in this court In <NAME> State of Bihar Justice <NAME> after having considered all the above authorities came to the conclusion that Where by amendment of a plaint the cause of action is altered or a new cause of action added it is not a new suit but the old suit in a new form In such a case no amendment can be ordered if it requires leave to be granted under Clause of the Letters Patent at the time of the amendment In <NAME> <NAME> Cal LJ at Mr Justice <NAME> following <NAME> in AIR Bom <NAME> in AIR Cal and <NAME> in came to the simple conclusion at as follows Once the cause of action is altered or added to it cannot in my opinion be said that the reception of the suit continues to be proper without grant of fresh leave Mr <NAME> counsel for the applicant argues that all the above decisions were mere obiter dicta because the question came up at the time of hearing of the suit and in none of those cases any application was brought before the court for obtaining leave to sue under Clause and also for leave to amend the plaint as has been done in this case Shortly stated Mr <NAME> argument is that if the proposed amendment is otherwise permissible in law even it Be a new cause of action fresh leave under Clause of the Letters Patent can be granted at the time when the application for amendment is brought He further argues that the Rules of the Original Side do not provide anywhere that no amendment can be made in suits tiled with leave under Clause of the Letters Patent nor is there any provision anywhere in law that no leave under Clause can be granted at the time of the amendment which could have been provided in the Original Side rules if it was thought necessary He submits that in this Madras case the present question came up before the court in an application for leave to sue under Clause of the Letters Patent along with an appeal from the Master on an application for amendment of the plaint and the learned Judge in this case held that where the court on an application of the plaintiff considers that the plaint has to be amended so as to include a cause of action which was not originally in the plaint on the ground that such an amendment is necessary it does not prevent the court from granting such an amendment merely for the reason that it was a suit instituted after obtaining previous leave to sue under Clause of the Letters Patent Reading the learned Judge judgment I find that he agrees with the view expressed in ILR Bom by <NAME> He agrees that grant of leave under Clause Letters Patent being a judicial act must relate to the cause of action contained in the plaint as presented to the court at the time of the grant and that such leave affords the very foundation of the jurisdiction and would not he available to confer jurisdiction in respect of a substantially different cause of action which was not and coud not have been judicially considered at the time it was granted but he observes that it does not necessarily follow that in respect of such a different cause of action leave under Clause cannot be granted after the institution of the suit and that therefore the <ORG> cannot try such a different cause of action except in another suit duly instituted The question for determination is as to whether amendment seeking to introduce a different cause of action is permissible in law As I have understood the judgment of <NAME> it seems to me that the ratio of his judgment is to be found in the following passages If the <ORG> finds that a cause of action is not inconsistent and to avoid multiplicity of suits or for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy raised in the suit between the parties or for other reasons an amendment is necessary though based on a different cause of action the <ORG> has ample power to order an amendment of the plaint but for the decisions of <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> What all that is required to be complied with to satisfy the provisions of Clause is that in cases where leave is required <ORG> has no power to receive a plaint before such leave is granted But the learned Judge says there is nothing to show that a plaint after obtaining leave to amend would not include an amended plaint If an amended plaint after obtaining leave to amend is to be received and the cause of action arising therein is to be tried and determined which cannot be done since previous leave under Clause is required which alone confers jurisdiction there is no reason why such leave to present an amended plaint should not be granted under Clause on fresh application stating the cause of action on which the amendment has been applied for and the reasons for such grant <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> or other learned Judges that they did by implication hold a view that such leave under Clause could be applied for at the time of the amendment but it must be remembered that the question was only raised at the hearing of those suits before the learned Judges It never came before them directly for their consideration as to whether leave under Clause Letters Patent could be granted if applied for at the time of amendment seeking to introduce a new cause of action But with due respect to the learned Judge upon careful consideration I have come to a different conclusion In my opinion even if from the point of view of avoiding multiplicity of suits or for the put pose of determining the real question in controversy raised in the suit between the parties or for reasons of expediency or any other reasons an amendment is found or becomes necessary in such suit it cannot be allowed by the <ORG> if the amendment sought is based on a different cause of action It has been held that such leave is only confined or referable to the cause of action stated in the plaint when filed and to no other I am further of the opinion that if in a suit which was originally filed with leave under Clause Letters Patent the <ORG> were to grant a fresh leave to sue in respect of a different cause of action sought to be brought in by way of amendment at the time of the application made on that behalf such a grant would not be in accordance with law as it must necessarily be after the filing of the Suit in direct violation of the clear and unambiguous language of Clause of the Letters Patent The language of Clause is mandatory and in my view such a grant of leave to sue subsequent to the suit would not confer any jurisdiction to the <ORG> to receive try and determine the new cause of action But that again does not necessarily mean that the original plaint in a suit properly filed with leave under Clause would include the amended plaint The original plaint in such suits cannot include the amended plaint is clear from the fact that firstly the cause of action originally pleaded in the plaint was judicially considered by the <ORG> at the time of the grant of leave to sue before the suit was filed thus assuming jurisdiction to receive try and determine the suit as it then stood secondly the <ORG> jurisdiction being strictly confined to the original cause of action judicially considered by the <ORG> at the time of the grant prior to the filing of the suit and to no other the plaint originally filed cannot possibly include the amended plaint because the cause of action in the amended plaint was not judicially considered by the <ORG> before the filing of the suit thirdly the <ORG> having no power to grant leave under Clause Letters Patent after filing of the suit the original plaint cannot include the cause of action included in the amended plaint as it would enlarge the jurisdiction of the <ORG> As I have stated before in such a case leave to amend the plaint cannot be given by the <ORG> to include a different cause of action In the light of what is stated before I hold that in a suit which is filed with leave under Clause of the Letters Patent only formal amendments or other reasonable amendments can be allowed provided the amendment sought does not affect the jurisdiction assumed by the <ORG> originally by grant of leave to sue under Clause prior to the filing of the suit in any way either by adding to or altering the original cause of action as pleaded in the plaint However expedient it may be for the purpose of determining the question in controversy in the suit or for avoiding multiplicity of suits or for other good reasons no amendment seeking to alter the original cause of action or seeking to add a new cause of action can be allowed by court in a suit filed with leave under Clause for the simple reason that the question involved is not one of procedure but of jurisdiction As regards the application for leave to amend the plaint is concerned in my opinion the proposed amendment is clearly of a substantially different character from the one originally pleaded Even if my finding be not correct the same result will follow for the amendment proposed is in any event a new cause of action and not of a formal nature and as such in view of my opinion as expressed before leave for such amendment cannot be given nor can fresh leave under Clause Letters Patent be granted for amendment of the plaint in this suit
