DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> <NAME> CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC SC RF SC SC SC SC SC SC RF SC ACT Kerala <ORG> Act Rules framed by <ORG> delegating power to Vice chancellor to hold inquiries on malpractices during examinations rules not followed if inquiry invalid The second respondent submitted a report holding the appellant guilty of the malpractice and on the basis of this report a show cause notice was issued to the appellant by the Vice Chancellor After the appellant had submitted his explanation in response to the notice and not being satisfied with his explanation the Vice chancellor passed an order debarring the appellant from appearing in any examination for a year The appellant challenged the Vice Chancellor order by a writ petition under Article contending inter alia that i the rules framed by the <ORG> delegating its powers to the Vice Chancellor required that for conducting the inquiry should have appointed an officer designated by the principal of the college in which the appellant appeared for his examination this was not done in the present case and hence there was no proper inquiry and ii the impugned order was invalid inasmuch as no copy of the report made by the second respondent was made available to the appellant before he was called upon to submit his explanation in response to the show cause notice i The rules made by the <ORG> of the <ORG> under which the inquiry was ordered were not statutory rules but merely rules framed for guidance The rule under which the Vice Chancellor was required to request the principal of the concerned college to appoint an Inquiry Officer merely laid down a convenient procedure ii There was no breach of the principles of natural justice in the appellant not being furnished with a copy of the report of the second respondent before he was called upon to give his explanation of the Constitution particularly as they stood before the amendment of that Article that every disciplinary proceeding must consist of two inquiries one before issuing the show cause notice to be followed by another inquiry thereafter Even if a show cause notice is provided by law from that it does not follow that a copy of the report on the basis of which the show cause notice is issued should be made available to the per on proceeded against or that another inquiry should be held thereafter Accordingly a committee consisting of the Chairman of <ORG> who is the Dean of <ORG> Chairman of the Mathematics Section of <ORG> the Dean of <ORG> who is the Convener of <ORG> and the Registrar of the <ORG> was constituted to go into the matter He appointed the second respondent a retired Principal of the <ORG> College Trivandrum as Inquiry Officer for conducting the inquiry On the basis of that report a show cause notice was issued to the appellant by the Vice Chancellor The appellant submitted his explanation in response to that notice A Single Judge of the <ORG><ORG> who heard the matter at the first instance allowed the petition and set aside that order but his decision was reversed in appeal by <ORG> of that High <ORG> the formal inquiry required under the rules should have been conducted by an officer designated by the Principal of the College in which the appellant appeared for his examination i <ORG> and hence there was no proper inquiry and the impugned order was invalid inasmuch as no copy of the report made by the second respondent was made available to the appellant before he was called upon to submit his explanation in response to the show cause notice issued to him by the Vice Chancellor Cl xxvii of Chapter VII of the st Statutes says The <ORG> shall in addition to the powers and duties conferred and imposed on it by the Act and subject to the provisions thereof have and exercise the following powers and functions xxvii subject to the provisions in the laws to take cognizance of any misconduct by any student in a college or institution or in a hostel or approved lodging or by any student who seeks admission to a niversity course of study or by any candidate for any University Examination brought to the notice of the <ORG> by the head of the institution or by a member of any Authority of the University or by the Registrar of the University or by a Chairman of a Board of Examiners or by a Chief Superintendent at any centre of examination and to punish such misconduct by exclusion from any University examination or from any University course in a college or in the University or from any Convocation for the purpose of conferring degrees either permanently or for a specified period or by the cancellation of the Uni versity examination for which he appeared or by the deprivation of any University scholarship held by him or by cancellation of any University prize or medal awarded to him or by such other penalty as it deems fit That rule merely laid down a convenient procedure The only other contention that was taken before <ORG> and repeated in this Court was that inasmuch as the Vice Chancellor did not make available to the appellant a copy of the report submitted by the second respondent before he was called upon to make his representations against the provisional decision taken by him there was breach of the principles of natural justice No rule either statutory or otherwise was brought to our notice which required the Vice Chancellor to make available to the appellant a copy of the report submitted by the Inquiry Officer The question whether the requirements of natural justice have been met by the procedure adopted in a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of the case in point the constitution of the <ORG> and the rules under which it functions In <NAME> Duke of <NAME> and others <NAME> <NAME> observed There are in my view no words which are of universal application to every kind of inquiry and every kind of domestic tribunal Accordingly I do not derive much assistance from the definitions of natural justice which have been from time to time used but whatever standard is adopted one essential is that the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case In <ORG> Alridge Viscount <NAME> observed My Lords when the duty of deciding an appeal is imposed those whose duty it is to decide it must act judicially They must deal with the question referred to them without bias and they must give to each of the parties the opportunity of adequately presenting the case made In the case of a <ORG> of law tradition in this country has prescribed certain principles to which in the main the procedure must conform But what that procedure is to be in detail must depend on the nature of the tribunal In modem times it has become increasingly common for <ORG> to give an appeal in matters which really pertain to administration rather than to the exercise of the judicial functions of an ordinary <ORG> to authorities whose functions are administrative and not in the ordinary sense judicial I agree with the view expressed in an analogous case by my noble and learned friend <NAME> The <ORG> had no power to administer an oath and need not examine witnesses he thought obtain information in any way it thought best always giving a fair opportunity to those who were parties in the controversy to correct or contradict any relevant statement prejudicial to their view Their Lordships are of opinion that in making such an inquiry there is apart from special circumstances a duty of giving to any person against whom the complaint is made a fair opportunity to make any relevant statement which he may desire to bring forward and a fair opportunity to correct or controvert any relevant statement brought forward to his prejudice <ORG> Lord <NAME> observed What then are the requirements of natural justice in a case of this kind First I think that the person accused should know the nature of the accusation made secondly that he should be given an opportunity to state his case and thirdly of course that the tribunal should act in good faith The decision of <ORG> in <ORG> appears to go much further than what was laid down in the aforementioned cases Suffice it to say that in the case before us there was a fair inquiry against the appellant the officer appointed to inquire was an impartial person he cannot be said to have been biassed against the appellant the charge against the appellant was made known to him before the commencement of the inquiry the witnesses who gave evidence against him were examined in his presence and he was allowed to cross examine them and lastly he was given every opportunity to present his case before the Inquiry Officer Hence we see no merit in the contention that there was any breach of the principles of natural justice There is no rule requiring the Vice Chancellor to provide the appellant with a copy of the report of the Inquiry Officer before he was called upon to make his re presentation against the provisional decision taken by him His present grievance appears to be an after thought and we see no substance in it Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the appellant in support of his contention that the failure of the Vice Chancellor to make available to the appellant a copy of the report submitted by the Inquiry Officer is an infringement of the principles of natural justice placed strong reliance on the decision of the Judicial All During the pendency of that proceeding it came to light that the report made by the Board which held the preliminary inquiry a report which was highly pre judicial to <NAME> had been placed in the hands of the officer who held the formal inquiry but neither the copy of that report nor its substance had been made available to <NAME> Therein <ORG> held that <ORG> was not right in declining an opportunity being given to Dr <NAME> to show that the conclusion of <ORG> that he was guilty of infamous conduct was not correct Enquiries held by domestic <ORG> in such cases must no doubt be fair and students against whom charges are framed must be given adequate opportunities to defend themselves and in holding such enquiries the <ORG> must scrupulously follow rules of natural justice but it would we think not be reasonable to import into these enquiries all considerations which govern criminal trials in ordinary courts of law The enquiry has been fair and the respondent has bad an opportunity of making his defence of the Constitution particularly as they stood before the amendment of that article that every disciplinary proceeding must consist of two inquiries one before issuing the show cause notice to be followed by another inquiry thereafter Even if a show cause notice is provided by law from that it does not follow that a copy of the report on the basis of which the show cause notice is issued should be made available to the person proceeded against or that another inquiry should be held thereafter
