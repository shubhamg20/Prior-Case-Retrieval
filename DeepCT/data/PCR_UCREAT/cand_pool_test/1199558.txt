As a result of such negligence the gold was not returned to the appellant and so he filed the suit against the <ORG> claiming the value of the gold In the appeal to <ORG> HELD The power to arrest a person to search him to seize property found with him are powers conferred on specified officers by statute and are powers which could be properly characterised as sovereign powers Therefore though the negligent act was committed by the employees of the respondent <ORG> during the course of their employment the claim against the <ORG> could not be sustained because the employment in question was of the category which could claim the special characteristic of sovereign power The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The short question of law which arises in this appeal is whether the respondent the State of Uttar Pradesh is liable to compensate the appellant <NAME> for the loss caused to it by the negligence of the police officers employed by the respondent This question arises in this way On the st September he was released on bail and some time thereafter the silver seized from him was returned to him <NAME> then made repeated demands for the return of the gold which had been seized from him and since he could not recover the gold from the police officers he filed the present suit against the respondent in which he claimed a decree that the gold seized from him should either be returned to him or in the alternative its value should be ordered to be paid to him On these pleadings two substantial questions arose between the parties one was whether the police officers in question were guilty of negligence in the matter of taking care of the gold which had been seized from <NAME> and the second was whether the respondent was liable to compensate the appellant for the loss caused to it by the negligence of the public servants employed by the respondent <ORG> found in favour of the appellant on both these issues and since the gold in question could not be ordered to be returned to the appellant a decree was passed in its favour for Rs The respondent challenged the correctness of this decree by an appeal before <ORG> and it was urged on its behalf that <ORG> was in error in regard to both the findings recorded by it in favour of the appellant The only question which calls for our decision on this part of the case is whether the loss of gold can be legitimately attributed to the negligence of the police officers in charge of the police station where the gold and silver had been kept in custody He knew that <NAME> had been kept in the lock up and his articles were kept in the Malkhana but he added that in his presence these articles were neither weighed nor kept in the Malkhana Section I iv of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that any police officer may without an order from a Magistrate and without a warrant arrest any person in whose possession anything is found which may reasonably be suspected to be stolen property and who may reasonably be suspected of having committed an offence with reference to such thing Section confers powers on police officers to seize property suspected to be stolen It provides inter alia that any police officer may seize property which may be suspected to have been stolen and so gold and silver in the possession of <NAME> were seized in exercise of the powers conferred on the police officers under of the Code Section provides for the procedure in that behalf It lays down inter alia that the seizure by any police officer of property taken under shall be forthwith reported to a Magistrate who shall make such order as he thinks fit respecting the disposal of such property or the delivery of such property to the person entitled to the possession thereof or if such person cannot be ascertained respecting the custody and production of such property That takes us to the Police Regulations Regulation provides a detailed procedure for dealing with the disposal of movable property of which the police takes possession It is in the light of the provisions contained in Regulation that we have to appreciate the oral evidence to which we have already referred Unfortunately in dealing with Regulations and <ORG> has erroneously assumed that there was no obligation on the police officers to deposit <NAME> property in the <ORG> A list of articles seized does not appear to have been made and there is no evidence that they were weighed either Therefore we are satisfied that <ORG> was right in coming to the conclusion that the loss suffered by the appellant by the fact that the gold seized from <NAME> has not been returned to it is based on the negligence of the police officers employed by the respondent and that raises the question of law which we have set out at the commencement of our judgment A claim was then made by the respondents for damages against the <ORG> of Rajasthan and the said claim was allowed by this Court It must be conceded that there are certain observations made in the <NAME> case which support Mr <NAME> argument and make it prima facie attractive This article reads thus The Government of India may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the Government of a State may sue or be sued by the name of the State and may subject to any provisions which may be made by Act of Parliament or of the Legislature of such State enacted by virtue of powers conferred by this Constitution sue or be sued in relation to their respective affairs in the like cases as the Dominion of India and the corresponding Provinces or the corresponding Indian States might have sued or been sued if this Constitution had not been enacted The first part deals with the question about the form and the causetitle for a suit intended to be filed by or against <ORG> or <ORG> Since no such law has been passed by the respondent in the present case the question as to whether the respondent is liable to be sued for damages at the instance of the appellant has to be determined by reference to another question and that is whether such a suit would have been competent against the corresponding Province It is unnecessary to trace the pedigree of this provision beyond of the Act of because the relevant decisions bearing on this point to which we will presently refer are ultimately found to be based on the effect of the provisions contained in the said section The accident which gave rise to the action took place on the highway and it was caused by the negligence of the servants of the <ORG> who had been employed in the <ORG> dockyard at Kidderpore It is this injury caused by the negligence of the servants of the <ORG> employed in the <ORG> dockyard that gave rise to the action It was then observed by the learned Chief Justice that in determining the question whether <ORG> would under the circumstances have been liable to an action the general principles applicable to Sovereigns and <ORG>s and the reasoning deduced from the maxim of the English Law that the King can do no wrong would have no force because he concurred entirely in the opinion expressed by Chief Justice <NAME> in the earlier case of <ORG> <ORG> that the fact of the Company having been invested with powers usually called sovereign powers did not constitute them sovereign It then appears to have been urged before the <ORG> in that case that the Secretary of <ORG> in Council must be considered as the <ORG> or as a public officer employed by the <ORG> and the question of his liability determined on that footing It is in respect of this aspect of the matter that the Chief Justice enunciated a principle which has been consistently followed in all subsequent decisions Said the learned Chief Justice there is a great and clear distinction between acts done in the exercise of what are usually termed sovereign powers and acts done in the conduct of undertakings which might be carried on by private individuals without having such powers delegated to them He observed that where an act is done or a contract is entered into in the exercise of powers usually called sovereign powers by which we mean powers which cannot be lawfully exercised except by sovereign or private individual delegated by a sovereign to exercise them no action will lie If a tortious act is committed by a public servant and it gives rise to a claim for damages the question to ask is was the tortious act committed by the public servant in discharge of statutory functions which are referable to and ultimately based on the delegation of the sovereign powers of the <ORG> to such public servant If the answer is in the affirmative the action for damages for loss caused by such tortious act will not lie On the other hand if the tortious act has been committed by a public servant in discharge of duties assigned to him not by virtue of the delegation of any sovereign power an action for damages would lie The act of the public servant committed by him during the course of his employment is in this category of cases an act of a servant who might have been employed by a private individual for the same Appendix A In that connection we will refer to a few representative decisions In <NAME> Secretary of <ORG> for India this point arose for the decision of <ORG> In that case a suit had been instituted against the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> to recover damages on account of the negligence of a chief constable with respect to goods seized and the plaintiffs claim was resisted by the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> on the ground that no action lay <ORG> held that the plaintiff had in law no cause of action against the Secretary of <ORG> for India in <ORG> in respect of acts done by <ORG> in the exercise of its sovereign powers This conclusion was based on the finding that the provision and maintenance of roads especially a military road is one of the functions of Government carried on in the exercise of its sovereign powers and is not an undertaking which might have been carried on by private persons The Court then examined the question as to whether in circumstances like those which led to the claim for damages in the case before it a private employer could have been made liable and this question was answered in the negative on the ground that no liability attached to the Secretary of <ORG> on account of the criminal act of the man in charge of the Malkhana the said act was a felonious act unauthorised by his employer We would like to add that some of the reasons given by <ORG> in support of its conclusion may be open to doubt but in substance the decision can be justified on the basis that the act which gave rise to the claim for damages had been done by a public servant who was authorised by a statute to exercise his powers and the discharge of the said function can be referred to the delegation of the sovereign power of the <ORG> and as such the criminal act which gave rise to the action could not validity sustain a claim for damages against the <ORG> Reverting then to the decision of this Court in the <NAME> case it would be recalled that the negligent act which gave rise to the claim for damages against the <ORG> of Rajasthan in that case was committed by the employee of the <ORG> of Rajasthan while he was driving the jeep car from the repair shop to the Collector residence and the question which arose for decision was did the negligent act committed by the <ORG> employee during the journey of the jeep car from the workshop to the Collector residence for the Collector use give rise to a valid claim for damages against the <ORG> of Rajasthan or not With respect we may point out that this aspect of the matter has not been clearly or emphatically brought out in discussing the point of law which was decided by this Court in that case be borne in mind that when the <ORG> pleads immunity against claims for damages resulting from injury caused by negligent acts of its servants the area of employment referable to sovereign powers must be strictly determined Before such a plea is upheld the <ORG> must always find that the impugned act was committed in the course of an undertaking or employment which is referable to the exercise of sovereign power or to the exercise of delegated sovereign power and in the <NAME> case this <ORG> took the view that the negligent act in driving the jeep car from the workshop to the Collector bungalow for the Collector use could not claim such a status It is not difficult to realize the significance and importance of making such a distinction particularly at the present time when in the pursuit of their welfare ideal the Governments of the <ORG>s as well as the Government of India naturally and legitimately enter into many commercial and other undertakings and activities which have no relation with the traditional concept of Governmental activities in which the exercise of sovereign power is involved citizens who have a cause of action for damages should not be precluded from making their claim against the <ORG> Now the power to arrest a person to search him and to seize property found with him are powers conferred on the specified officers by statute and in the last analysis they are powers which can be properly characterised as sovereign powers and so there is no difficulty in holding that the act which gave rise to the present claim for damages has been committed by the employee of the Supp Section provides for the liability of the <ORG> in tort in six classes of cases covered by its clauses I to The result is the appeal fails but in the circumstances of this case we direct that the parties should bear their own costs throughout
