These appeals have been preferred from the judgment and order of <ORG> dated in Writ Petitions Civil No The appellants challenge the acquisition of their agricultural lands by the State of Uttar Pradesh for the construction of the district jail of Shahjahanpur <ORG> explained that this was done in view of the pressing urgency in the matter of construction of the jails Being aggrieved by the aforesaid notifications the appellants moved a writ petition before <ORG> under Article of the Constitution of India Committee was formed matter was discussed at a leisurely pace at various levels and there is no material fact to justify the abridgement of the appellants right of raising an objection to acquisition and of a hearing under Section A of the Act Admittedly the Land Acquisition Act a pre Constitutional legislation of colonial vintage is a drastic law being expropriatory in nature as it confers on the <ORG> a power which affects person property right This Court is considering these questions especially in the context of some recent trends in land acquisition This Court is of the opinion that the concept of public purpose in land acquisition has to be viewed from an angle which is consistent with the concept of a welfare State The concept of public purpose cannot remain static for all time to come The said definition having suffered several amendments has assumed the character of an inclusive one It must be accepted that in construing public purpose a broad and overall view has to be taken and the focus must be on ensuring maximum benefit to the largest number of people Any attempt by the <ORG> to acquire land by promoting a public purpose to benefit a particular group of people or to serve any particular interest at the cost of the interest of a large section of people especially of the common people defeats the very concept of public purpose Even though the concept of public purpose was introduced by pre Constitutional legislation its application must be consistent with the constitutional ethos and especially the chapter under Fundamental Rights and also the Directive Principles In construing the concept of public purpose the mandate of Article of the Constitution that any pre constitutional law cannot in any way take away or abridge rights conferred under Part III must be kept in mind The meaning of public purpose in acquisition of land must be judged on the touchstone of this expanded view of Part III rights The open ended nature of our Constitution needs a harmonious reconciliation between various competing principles and the overhanging shadows of socio economic reality in this country Therefore the concept of public purpose on this broad horizon must also be read into the provisions of emergency power under Section with the consequential dispensation of right of hearing under Section A of the said Act The <ORG> must examine these questions very carefully when little Indians lose their small property in the name of mindless acquisition at the instance of the <ORG> The judiciary in its sphere shares the revolutionary purpose of the constitutional order and when called upon to decode social legislation must be animated by a goal oriented approach This is part of the dynamics of statutory interpretation in the developing countries so that courts are not converted into rescue shelters for those who seek to defeat agrarian justice by cute transactions of many manifestations now so familiar in the country and illustrated by the several cases under appeal This caveat has become necessary because the judiciary is not a mere umpire as some assume but an activist catalyst in the constitutional scheme However the judges found that there was no such provision in the Act The Statement of Objects and Reasons for the said Amendment is as follows The Land Acquisition Act I of does not provide that persons having an interest in land which it is proposed to acquire shall have the right of objecting to such acquisition nor is Government bound to enquire into and consider any objections that may reach them The object of this Bill is to provide that a Local Government shall not declare under section of the Act that any land is needed for a public purpose unless time has been allowed after the notification under section for persons interested in the land to put in objections and for such objections to be considered by <ORG> AIR SC speaking through Justice <NAME> as His Lordship then was held The right to file objections under Section A is a substantial right when a person property is being threatened with acquisition and we cannot accept that that right can be taken away as if by a side wind In para of the report this Court held that Section A embodies a very just and wholesome principle of giving proper and reasonable opportunity to a land loser of persuading the authorities that his property should not be acquired This Court held that the same being the legal position the procedures which have been laid down for depriving a person of the said right must be strictly complied with Whereas sub section of Section deals with cases of urgency sub section of the said section covers cases of sudden change in the channel of any navigable river or other unforeseen emergency In our opinion therefore the contention of learned counsel for the respondent authorities is not well founded and cannot be upheld that once a case is covered by sub sections or of Section of the Act sub section of Section would necessarily apply and there is no question of holding inquiry or hearing objections under Section A of the Act A meeting for selection of the suitable site for construction was held on th June and the proposal for such acquisition and construction was sent to the Director Land Acquisition on nd of July This slow pace at which the government machinery had functioned in processing the acquisition clearly evinces that there was no urgency for acquiring the land so as to warrant invoking Section of the Act In paragraph of the writ petition it has been clearly stated that there was a time gap of more than months between Section and Section notifications which demonstrates that there was no urgency in the <ORG> action which could deny the petitioners their right under Section A
