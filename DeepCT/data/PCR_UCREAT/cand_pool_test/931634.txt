<ORG> instance <ORG> was of opinion that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to try the suits and that under the Estates Land Act the plaintiff ought to have brought the suits in <ORG> Under Section of the Civil Procedure Code Clause a second appeal is prohibited from orders so passed in appeal Hence the defendants have come before us by way of Civil revision petitions under Section of the new Civil Procedure Code which corresponds to the old Section Under Section <ORG> has power to interfere if <ORG> has exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law or has failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested or has acted illegally or with material irregularity in the exercise of its jurisdiction In the case of <NAME> <NAME> A A two learned Judges held that they could interfere under Section with an erroneous decision of the District Judge that a Barrister could be sued for the return of his fees if he did not appear for his client whereas the third learned Judge <NAME> held that Section did not empower <ORG> to interfere with the lower Court said erroneous decision as the lower Court had jurisdiction over the suit and could not be said to have acted illegally or with material irregularity simply because it determined a legal question erroneously In the revision petitions before us the Subordinate Judge could not be said to have had no jurisdiction to hear appeals against the <NAME> orders returning the plaints for presentation to the proper <ORG> The boldest attempt made to minimise the effect of <ORG> decision was made in Badami kuar Dinu Rai A A where <NAME> went so far as to say that the words acted illegally in Section had the very same meaning as the words in Section which empowered <ORG> to entertain a second appeal where the <ORG> below had in the exercise of its jurisdiction come to a decision which is contrary to some specified law or usage having the force of law In <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> held that when a <ORG> of first instance ordered a plaint to be returned for presentation to the proper <ORG> and the <ORG> of Appeal set aside such order <ORG> had no jurisdiction to interfere with such appellate order under Section of the Civil Procedure Code In that case also it was argued by the petitioner <NAME> Mr It seems also to have been argued that if <ORG> can interfere in revision where a <ORG> against whose decision there is no appeal at all acts without jurisdiction <ORG> can also interfere where an Appellate court against whose appellate decision there is no second appeal erroneously asks the <ORG> of first instance to act without jurisdiction or not to act when the first <ORG> really has jurisdiction Civil Revision Petition No of does not lie by reason that the appeal did lie to <ORG> and that though the <NAME> who passed the order appealed against acted in the exercise of his jurisdiction with material irregularity yet the order passed by the District Judge on appeal cannot be revised by this <ORG> under Section of the Civil Procedure Code though in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction he the District Judge failed to set aside the order appealed against which was erroneous There is no illegality or irregularity so far as it can see in the exercise of his jurisdiction by the District Judge I doubt the correctness of those decisions in which it has been held that the words acted illegally in Section would include erroneous decisions of law and not merely decisions in which by reason of erroneous procedure such as shutting out of evidence or arguments the party applying in revision was prejudiced in the trial of the case and I also doubt the correctness of those decisions which held that because the question of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> of first instance was involved in the erroneous decision of the Appellate <ORG> <ORG> can interfere in revision with the erroneous decision of the Appellate <ORG> on the footing that the Appellate <ORG> itself acted without jurisdiction by pronouncing an erroneous decision on the question of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> of first instance As I am given to understand that owing to the passing of the Estates Land Act and to the conflicting views taken as to the jurisdiction of <ORG> over ejectment suits by landlords numerous similar Civil revision petitions have either been filed or are likely to be filed in <ORG> and having in view the conflict of decisions on the exact scope of the provisions of Section of the Civil Procedure Code I consider it desirable to refer the following questions for the decision of a Full Bench What is the exact scope of the meaning of the words acted illegally in Section of the Civil Procedure Code Has <ORG> power to interfere in any class of cases and if so which class where a question of law is wrongly decided by the <ORG> whose decision is attacked in revision Has <ORG> jurisdiction to interfere under Section where <ORG> erroneously decides in the exercise of its admitted jurisdiction as <ORG> that the Court of first instance was or was not competent i had or had not jurisdiction to entertain a suit <NAME> I agree No question of jurisdiction arose in <NAME> <NAME> I A or as it seems to me was considered by their Lordships That decision was considered by <ORG> of five Judges in <NAME> <NAME> where it was held by the majority that a Small Cause <ORG> Judge who assumed jurisdiction owing to an error of law as applied to the facts found by him acted without jurisdiction within the first part of the section <NAME> <NAME> with whom <NAME> <NAME> concurred preferred to treat the third part of the section as applicable and held that it applied in cases where the lower <ORG> assumed or declined jurisdiction in consequence of some error of law or of some material irregularity in its proceedings and in no others In this case too <NAME> <NAME> appears to have considered that all erroneous decisions as to jurisdiction would be covered by the earlier provisions of the section but if this be not so there is nothing to show that he would have regarded the third as inapplicable In <NAME> <NAME> it was held that the lower Appellate <ORG> acted illegally in the exercise of its jurisdiction in affirming the decree of the <ORG> of first instance dismissing the suit for want of jurisdiction owing to an error of law Cases of jurisdiction of course can only come under this part of the section if they do not come under the first or second parts and the contention has been raised before us that a Subordinate Appellate <ORG> acts without jurisdiction within the meaning of the section in deciding under an error of law that the <ORG> of first instance has jurisdiction and directing the latter to re take the case on its file and dispose of it according to law Similarly it may I think be said that an Appellate <ORG> has no jurisdiction to remit for trial to a lower <ORG> cases over which the latter has no jurisdiction and that if it does so under an error of law it acts without jurisdiction within the meaning of the section In either view I answer the second question in the affirmative These petitions arose out of three suits instituted by a land holder to eject the tenant in each case in <ORG> of Tanuku The question of the proper <ORG> empowered to try the suits depended on the construction of Section of the Estates Land Act The District Munsif held that he had no power to entertain the suits and returned the plaints for presentation to the proper <ORG> An appeal was presented against his order the Subordinate Judge who heard the appeal put a different interpretation on Section of the Estates Land Act and was of opinion that the plaints were rightly presented to the District Munsifs <ORG> He passed the following order The Lower <ORG> order is therefore set aside with a direction to the District Munsif to take back the plaint restore the suit to its file and dispose of the same according to law The learned Judges holding that there was a conflict of judicial opinion on the question whether the Subordinate Judge could be held in passing his order to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in him or to have acted illegally in the exercise of his jurisdiction and that there was a great diversity in the opinions of the Judges as to the right interpretation to be put on the words acted illegally in Section of the Civil Procedure Code referred the following questions for the decision of a Full Bench What is the exact scope of the meaning of the words acted illegally in Section of the Civil Procedure Code Has <ORG> power to interfere in any class of cases and if so which class where a question of law is wrongly decided by the <ORG> whose decision is attacked in revision Has <ORG> jurisdiction to interfere under Section when <ORG> erroneously decides in the exercise of its admitted jurisdiction as <ORG> that the <ORG> of first instance was or was not competent i had or had not jurisdiction to entertain a suit The second question alone arose for decision in the petitions before the learned Judges who made the reference We considered it desirable in the circumstances to give our answer only to the second question referred for our opinion on this case and to abstain from dealing with the wider point raised in the first question So far as the second question is concerned <NAME> in a similar case Civil Revision Petition No of held that there was no illegality or irregularity in the exercise of is jurisdiction by <ORG> in setting aside an order returning the plaint for presentation to the proper <ORG> and remanding the suit to the <ORG> of first instance for adjudication according to law It was apparently not urged before the learned Judge that there was an exercise of jurisdiction not vested in the Appellate <ORG> at any rate he pronounced no opinion on that question <NAME> also considered only the question whether there was an illegal exercise of jurisdiction He said it may seem anomalous that where a <ORG> acts without jurisdiction it may be set right under Section but where it directs another <ORG> to do so its order is not open to revision under that section Section or the corresponding section in the present Procedure Code would have no application for instance to the present case In <NAME> Fateh Ali it was held that where <ORG> disagreeing with the opinion of the <ORG> of first instance that it had no power to try the suit directs it to do so the High <ORG> could interfere under its revisional powers but the ground of interference was that the <ORG> acted illegally in holding that the <ORG> of first instance had jurisdiction In Vishvanath Govind Deshmane Rambhat where the <ORG> of Appeal agreed with the first <ORG> that the latter had no jurisdiction the Bombay High <ORG> held that the High <ORG> had power to interfere under Section Act XIV of It is not explained whether the District <ORG> in holding that the Subordinate Judge had no jurisdiction failed to exercise a jurisdiction vested in it District <ORG> or acted illegally in the exercise of its jurisdiction In <NAME> <NAME> it was held that if <ORG> fails to set aside an order of a <NAME> who acted with material irregularity in the exercise of his jurisdiction the High <ORG> had power under Section to set aside the Appellate <ORG> order but it was not explained whether the reason was that the Appellate <ORG> must be held in confirming the first <ORG> order to have committed the same material irregularity as the first <ORG> or that the Appellate <ORG> must be taken to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction vested in it by not setting aside the first <ORG> order Apparently the attempt to induce the High <ORG> to interfere was based in the arguments at the Bar in those cases on the ground that there was an illegal exercise of jurisdiction by the Appellate <ORG> It is not denied that if a <ORG> by an error of law in deciding whether it had jurisdiction exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it or failed to exercise a jurisdiction vested in it the High <ORG> has power to interfere under Section of the Civil Procedure Code and that its right of interference cannot be objected to on the ground that the <ORG> has jurisdiction to decide whether it has jurisdiction over the cause or not and that an erroneous decision on the question is a mere error of law which the High <ORG> cannot rectify according to the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> I A Section Clause Section of the old Code provides Subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed <ORG> shall have power a to determine a case finally to remand a case to frame issues and refer them for trial to take additional evidence or to require such evidence to be taken Clause says Subject as aforesaid the Appellate <ORG> shall have the same powers and shall perform as nearly as may be the same duties as are conferred and imposed by this Code on <ORG>s of original jurisdiction in respect of suits instituted therein Section extends the provisions of the Code relating to appeals a from appellate decrees and from orders made under this Code or under any special or local law in which a different procedure is not provided In the case of second appeals no doubt the High <ORG> does not possess plenary powers of dealing with the case and it cannot be said in such cases that the cause is re heard in full but this does not affect the general principles regulating the functions of <ORG> or the powers and du ties of a <ORG> of first appeal See <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> No doubt there are express provisions restricting the powers even of a <ORG> of first appeal such as in the matter of the right to admit additional evidence bat such restrictive provisions are mere rules of procedure similar to provisions relating to procedure in the <ORG> of first instance Later on he says When an appeal is preferred the <ORG> of Appeal is really seized of the whole suit though the relief given by it will be limited to the portion of the decree appealed against or objected to under Section Civil Procedure Code Order LVIII Rule of the Judicature Act lays down that the <ORG> of Appeal has the same power of drawing inferences etc as the High <ORG> and Victoria Chapter Section enacts that for all purposes incidental to hearing and determination of any appeal within its jurisdiction and the management execution and enforcement of any judgment or order made on such appeal and for the purposes of any other authority expressly given to the <ORG> of Appeal it shall have all the powers authority and jurisdiction vested in the High <ORG> of Chancery Order XLI Rule enacts that the Appellate <ORG> should pass the order which the first <ORG> should have passed and has full power to pass such other order as may be necessary to do justice between the parties before it <NAME> the learned author of the article on Appeal and Error in the Cyclopedia of American Law and Procedure Volume II observes at page that in its original and technical sense an appeal was a proceeding introduced into equity practice from the civil law by which the whole cause was removed from a lower to <ORG> and there tried de novo upon evidence newly introduced being subjected to a new and final determination as if it had not been tried before and without any reference to the conclusion of the inferior <ORG> When therefore a suit has been disposed of by the first <ORG> and an appeal is preferred the <ORG> of Appeal is seized of the cause and has the powers and duties of the first <ORG> For instance if there is an appeal against an order appointing or refusing to appoint a Receiver the suit in which the question arises remains in the hands of the first <ORG> and only the proceedings relating to the appointment of the Receiver are removed to the Appellate <ORG> and the powers possessed by the Appellate <ORG> similar as they are to those of the first <ORG> would relate only to the proceedings removed to it The former provision gives the Appellate <ORG> where the decision of the first <ORG> on a preliminary point is reversed power if it thinks fit to remand the case while the latter provision invests it with plenary powers to deal with the appeal in any other manner if it thinks fit to do so When the <ORG> of first instance holding that it had no jurisdiction to try a suit returns the plaint for presentation to another <ORG> its order terminates the proceedings in the suit before it If there were no provision in the Code for the return of the plaint and the <ORG> dismissed the suit on the ground of want of jurisdiction the appeal against the dismissal would be dealt with under Order XLI Rule In consequence of the concession made in plaintiff favour allowing the return of the plaint to him it was found necessary to provide specially for an appeal against the order If the Appellate <ORG> decides that the first <ORG> has jurisdiction to try the suit then it directs the latter <ORG> to proceed with the trial of the suit Having regard to Section making the provisions relating to appeals from decrees applicable to appeals from orders and to the fact that under Section it has the power both to determine a cause finally and to remand a case it is by no means clear to me that when the Appellate <ORG> comes to the conclusion that an order of the first <ORG> returning a plaint is wrong it cannot determine the case finally itself But however that may be I have no doubt that the Appellate <ORG> is seized of the cause whatever may be the mode prescribed for its disposal of the cause There is no provision in the Code laying down what the Appellate <ORG> should do when it reverses any particular order of the first <ORG> against which an appeal lies What is its duty in such a case It appears to me the answer must depend on what duty will lie upon it as a <ORG> having cognizance of the cause when the particular order of the first <ORG> has been reversed If the order of the first <ORG> put an end to the proceedings before that <ORG> then I think that Section gives the Appellate <ORG> plenary powers in dealing with the appeal If the order is of an interlocutory character and the cause itself is still in the hands of the first <ORG> the Appellate <ORG> will have power to pass such orders as would naturally follow from the reversal of the order appealed against This shows that it has power to deal with the cause generally and that its authority is not confined to the decision of the correctness or otherwise of the adjudication on the preliminary point How could he do so without taking cognizance of the suit itself It was argued for the respondent that the authority to reverse the decision on the question of jurisdiction must be taken to give power impliedly to direct the first <ORG> to do what follows on the reversal But would not the <ORG> have made specific provision giving the Appellate <ORG> any farther powers if the appeal itself was intended in the contemplation of the legislature to do no more than to enable the Appellate <ORG> to deal with the particular question decided by the <NAME> In my opinion the <ORG> considered it unnecessary to make any provision of the kind because of the general powers of <ORG> which are embodied in Section of the Code He did so on account of an error in the decision of the question of law on which the jurisdiction of the first <ORG> and his own jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case depended Section was clearly intended to enable the High <ORG> to exercise its powers of revision where any question of jurisdiction either of the first <ORG> or the Appellate <ORG> was concerned and if we bear in mind the nature of the powers and functions of a <ORG> of appeal there would be no difficulty in giving effect to the object of the section It appears to me to be quite possible that what their Lordships meant to lay down was that the object of the amended section was to confer a discretionary power on <ORG> to correct manifest injustice brought about by palpable errors and that <ORG> should not interfere on the mere ground of an error of law in the decision of the lower <ORG>s The powers conferred on <ORG> under Section are similar to those possessed by <ORG>s in England to prevent injustice by the writs of certiorari prohibition and mandamus I do not propose to review the decisions which have attempted to place a meaning or no meaning on the expression acting illegally as I am prepared to hold that this <ORG> has power to interfere under the first part of Section But it may be taken to be well established that the decision of <ORG> will not justify the refusal to give any effect to the words acting illegally and that it would not be right to confine the right to interference to cases of irregularity in procedure where the first part of the section would not be applicable In the order of reference to the Full Bench I have set out my reasons for doubting the correctness of the decisions which have shown an inclination to hold a that the words acted illegally in the old Section new Section Clause might include cases of mere erroneous decisions on questions of law and that if the erroneous decision of law related to the question of the jurisdiction of a <ORG> other than that of the <ORG> which gave the erroneous decision it might be even brought under Clauses a and of Section which use the words to have exercised a jurisdiction not vested in it by law and to have failed to exercise a jurisdiction so vested I am perfectly clear that Clauses a and of Section can only apply to the jurisdiction of the <ORG> whose order or decree is sought to be revised to pass such order or decree and not to its decision on the jurisdiction of some other <ORG> I entirely agree with the observations of <NAME> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> on this point and of Mr Justice <NAME> in the case quoted in my order of reference The argument that as every <ORG> has jurisdiction to decide as a preliminary question its own jurisdiction before going into the other questions in the case Clauses a and of Section would become unmeaning and useless does not in the least impress me as creating any difficulty for the revising <ORG> doss not and need not deal with the preliminary opinion of the revised <ORG> giving itself jurisdiction but with the decree or order of the revised <ORG> which was passed after it erroneously gave itself jurisdiction and which decree or order was really passed without jurisdiction though the revised <ORG> might have erroneously thought that it had jurisdiction Whether the revised <ORG> considered at all the question whether it had jurisdiction or ignored the point altogether the revising <ORG> can come to its own conclusion and set aside the decree or order passed without jurisdiction I also feel great difficulty in following the argument that where <ORG> deals with an appeal from an order of the <ORG> returning a plaint to be presented to the proper <ORG> and comas to an erroneous decision it <ORG> wrongly gives itself or with holds from itself jurisdiction over the trial of the suit simply because its order decides that the <ORG> has or has not jurisdiction to try the suit the Court delivered the following Judgment The suit is brought by the plaintiff a landholder as defined in the Madras Estates Land Act to eject the defendant who is alleged in the plaint to be a tenant of old waste let into possession before the Act came into force The question is whether <ORG> have jurisdiction to entertain such suits It is rightly conceded they have no jurisdiction if such suits could be brought before the Collector
