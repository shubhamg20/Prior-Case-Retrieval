that gratifica tion as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in the said section It may here be mentioned that the legislature has chosen to use the words shall presume and not may presume the former a presumption of law and latter of fact Shall presume has been defined in the Evidence Act as follows Whenever it is directed by this Act that the <ORG> shall presume a fact it shall regard such fact as proved unless and until it is disproved Although this proposal was made on June it is not clear as to what final orders were passed in these proceedings and when At least there is nothing to indicate that any intimation was given to the complainant in regard to this matter Counsel for the respondent contended that there was no occasion for the respondent to say anything about the penalty proceedings because as far as he was concerned the recommendation had already been made by him but the real question is whether the complainant was told as to what had happened or had any knowledge of this He states that he had none and there is nothing to indicate that he bad ant on the road he told him that he was in financial difficulties and the complainant offered him a loan of Rs Notice was issued to the com plainant and he filed his return on August The notice must have been issued to the complainant under a of the Income tax Act by the respondent himself as he was at that time the Income tax Officer The complaint replied that he had no money to spare as he had purchased a house and he also asked him if the respondent had finished the assessment Even according to the findings of <ORG> the complainant was needing the favours of the respondent who on his own showing was himself in dire need of a thousand rupees as he had succeeded in collecting only a thousand rupees by November and needed twice that amount for his son premi um or security as he chooses to call it It is true that when soon after the money was paid and the Inspector and the Magistrate arrived at the house of the respondent and asked him about this money he stated that he had taken it as a loan but in the context it assumes a different complexion I asked him again to produce the currency notes The evidence and the circumstances lead to the conclusion that the transaction was not one of loan but illegal grati fication
