The respondents were the owners of a steamship called El Madina That was requisitioned by the <ORG> during the last world war and was lost by enemy action on March represents the deductions which had been allowed year after year on account of depreciation As the total compensation received exceeded the cost price the respondents have recouped themselves all the amounts deducted for depreciation The provision of law under which the charge is sought to be imposed is section vii of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act and that is omitting what is not relevant as follows Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely vii in respect of any such building machinery or plant which has been sold or discarded or demolished or destroyed the amount by which the written down value thereof exceeds the amount for which the building machinery or plant as the case may be is actually sold or its scrap value Provided further that where any insurance salvage or compensation moneys are received in respect of any such building machinery or plant as aforesaid and the amount of such moneys exceeds the difference between the written down value and the scrap value no amount shall be allowable under this clause and so much of the excess as does not exceed the difference between the original cost and the written down value less the scrap value shall be deemed to be profits of the previous year in which such moneys were received It is not disputed by the respondents that the sum of Rs would be profits liable to be taxed under this proviso if it applies Equally it is not disputed by the appellant that apart from this proviso the amount in question could only be regarded as capital receipt not liable to be taxed Before the income tax authorities the respondents sought to avoid the application of this proviso on the ground that on representations made by them with reference to this very matter <ORG> had directed that for the purpose of rule Schedule II of the Excess Profits Tax Act the amount payable as compensation both the initial advance as well as any further payment that may be made should be taken into account as though it had actually been received within thirty days of the date of the loss of the ship and that in consequence the amount should be deemed to have been received on April If that contention is correct the amounts would have been received not in the year of account which was July to June but in the year previous there to and they could not therefore be included in the income of the company for the year of assessment This contention however was rejected by all the income tax authorities Dealing with it <ORG> observed in its Order dated July that the concession which <ORG> had intended to give was limited to excess profits tax and could not in any event be relied on for the purpose of cutting down the operation of the statutory provision enacted in the relevant proviso ins vii and that the material date was when the compensation was in fact received and that was in the year of account and not when it became due and payable in the year previous thereto The respondent then filed an application before the <ORG> under section of the Act requiring certain questions to be referred to the court and one of them was as follows Whether in view of the fact that the fourth proviso to section vii of the Indian Income tax Act did not apply to the assessment for the assessment year and under the law in force as applicable to that assessment year the sum of Rs which accrued in the previous year relevant to that assessment year was not taxable at all and the fact that having regard to the assessee method of accounting the said sum should not be assessed in any other year the assessment in respect of the said sum in the subsequent assessment year was valid in law was properly included in the assessee company total income computed for the assessment year The reference came up for hearing before a Bench of <ORG> consisting of Chagla and <NAME> and then the respondents raised the contention that the proviso to section vii under which the charge was made could not be taken into account in making the present assessment as the same had been introduced by the Income tax Amendment Act VII of which came into force on May whereas the liability of the company to be taxed fell to be determined as on April when the Finance Act came into force The appellant raised a preliminary objection to this question being raised for the first time before the court on the ground that it did not arise out of the order of the <ORG> having been neither raised before it nor dealt with by it and that further it had not been referred to the court framed and that therefore the assessee could raise it The main contention urged before us by the appellant is that it was not open to <ORG> in the present reference to go into the question as to the applicability of the proviso to section vii as it was neither raised before the <ORG> nor considered by it and could not therefore be said to be a question arising out of the order of the <ORG> which alone could be referred for the decision of the court under section The court had no jurisdiction it is argued to allow a question to be raised before it which could not be referred to it under the section The contention of the respondents is that all questions of law which arise on the findings given by the <ORG> in its order can properly be said to arise out of its order and that in making a reference under section the <ORG> is not limited to those questions only which were raised before it and dealt with in its order nor even to those question which were raised in the application for reference under section We may now refer to the provisions of law bearing on the question Section of the Act confers on the assessee and the Commissioner a right to apply to the <ORG> in the prescribed form to refer any question of law arising out of its order for the decision of <ORG> If the <ORG> is satisfied that a question of law arises then it has to draw up a statement of the case and refer it to the decision of <ORG> But if it considers that no question of law arises on its order and dismisses the case may be has a right to move the court under section and if the court is not satisfied about the correctness of the decision of the <ORG> it can require it to state the case and refer it to its decision Under section <ORG> can for the purpose of disposing of the reference which comes to it under section and call for additional statement from the <ORG> Under section <ORG> is to decide the question of law raised in the case and send a copy of its judgment to the <ORG> and the latter is to pass appropriate orders for giving effect to it Section of the Act confers on <ORG> power to make rules for carrying out the purpose of the Act and under sub section the rules made thereunder shall on publication in <ORG> have effect as if enacted under the Ac Rule A framed under this section provides that An application under sub section of section requiring the <ORG> to refer to <ORG> any question of law shall be in the following form that the facts which are admitted and or found by the <ORG> and which are necessary for drawing up a statement of the case are stated in the enclosure for ready reference that the applicant therefore requires under sub section of section of the aforesaid Act that a statement of the case be drawn up and the question of law numbered out of the question of law referred to in paragraph above be referred to <ORG> On these provisions the question that arises for decision is whether in a reference under section <ORG> can consider a question which had not been raised before the <ORG> and or dealt with by it in its order even though it be one of law On the answer to be given to it there has been a difference of opinion among <ORG>s and that turns on the meaning to be given to the words any question of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> There is no pronouncement of this court which concludes this question though there are decisions which afford guidance in the determination thereof The Commissioner being dissatisfied with the order applied for a reference under section The <ORG> was of the opinion that the order in question could be made in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction and referred the question of its legality to the court under section <ORG> declined to answer it on the ground that as the order was not one passed in an appeal the reference under section was incomepetent as under that provision the power of the <ORG> to refer was limited to questions of law arising out of an order passed in an appeal In affirming this decision this court observed at page The jurisdiction of the <ORG> and of <ORG> is conditional on there being an order by the Appellate <ORG> which may be said to be one under section and a question of law arising out of such an order This is an authority for the position that the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to make and of <ORG> to hear a reference must be strictly sought within the four corners of section the question referred by the <ORG> under section was whether certain amounts received by the assessee from the Government by cheques drawn on <ORG> at Bombay were income received in British India within section a of the Act <ORG> had held that as the cheques were received in the State of Aundh in unconditional discharge of the claim the receipt was not in British India An objection was put forward to this contention being raised on the ground that it was not argued before the <ORG> or decided by it and that therefore it did not arise out of its order as required by section But this court held that as the question as framed and referred was of sufficient amplitude to cover the new point urged and as no contention was raised that the questionhad not been properly referred under it could be decided under and that in that view it was not necessary to express any opinion on the larger question as to the scope meaning and import of the words any question of law arising out of the <ORG> order on the interpretation of which there exists a wide divergence of judicial opinion There was accordingly no decision on the point now under consideration Here again there was no decision on the meaning of the words On this reference <ORG> resettled the question so as to raise the contention as to whether the assessee was entitled to any concession under the Merged States Taxation Concessions Order as regards the income of Rs and holding that she was not answered the reference against her without deciding the question as to where the income accrued Against this judgment the assessee appealed to this court and contended that <ORG> was in error in not deciding the question which was actually referred This court accepted this contention and remanded the case to <ORG> for hearing on that point So far this decision does not bear on the present controversy But a further point was discussed and considered by this Court and that was that it was not open to the court to raise the question about the applicability of the Merged States Taxation Concessions Order as that was not a question which was raised before or considered by the <ORG> or referred under In agreeing with this contention this Court observed Section of the Income tax Act which confers jurisdiction upon <ORG> only permits a reference of a question of law arrising out of the order of the <ORG> It does not confer jurisdiction on <ORG> to decide a different question of law not arising out of such order It is possible that the same question of law may involve different approaches for its solution and <ORG> may amplify the question to take all the approaches These observations bear on the question now under consideration but the actual decision was one remanding the case with a direction to <ORG> to decide the question that was referred to it The Government of India purchased these articles and paid the price by cheques on the Bombay branch of <ORG> <ORG> remanded the case to the <ORG> under section for a supplemental statement observing that it would be necessary for the appellate <ORG> to find inter alia whether the cheques were sent to the assessee firm by post or by hand and what directions if any had the assessee firm given to the <ORG> in the matter This Court held following that decision that the jurisdiction to call for supplemental statement was confined a to the facts on record and or found by the <ORG> and to the question which would arise from the <ORG> order and that further it could be exercised with reference to a new question if it was an integral or even incidental part of the question which had been referred This decision also proceeds on the view that a question which is unconnected with the question already referred cannot be agitated for the first time in the reference There being thus no direct decision of this court on the precise meaning of the words and question of law arising out of the order of the <ORG> we must examine the decision of <ORG> on the question and as already stated they are in a state of conflict The assessee then moved the court under section for an order requiring the <ORG> to refer that question <NAME> for the petitioner contends that a question though not raised before <ORG> can well be said to arise out of its order if on the facts of the case appearing from the order the question fairly arises Adverting to the contention that <ORG> had in <ORG> <NAME> allowed a question of law arising on the facts found to be raised for the first time before it the learned judge observed The case furnishes no useful analogy as the scope of the remedy under section of the Indian Income tax Act has to be determined with reference to the language of the statute There discussing the question with reference to the language of section and and rule A the court observed as follows The provisions of section and section do not confer upon <ORG> a general jurisdiction to correct or to decide a question of law that may possibly arise out of the income tax assessment The section on the contrary confers a special and limited jurisdiction upon <ORG> to decide any specific question of law which has been raised between the assessee and the <ORG> before <ORG> and upon which question the parties are at issue It was accordingly held that only a question of law which had been actually raised before the <ORG> or actually dealt with by it that could be referred under section The <ORG> dismissed the application on the ground that the question sought to be raised had not been mentioned at the hearing of the appeal and had not been dealt with by the <ORG> and was therefore not one which arose out of its order The question having been brought up before the court under section <NAME> held that under section it was only a question that arose out of the <ORG> order that could be referred and that that must be some question which was actually raised before the <ORG> and dealt with by it and that under the words no question of law arises could only mean that the question of which reference had been asked for by the The learned judge then went on to observe The Indian Income tax Act has not charged <ORG> with the duty of setting right in all respects all assessments that might come to its notice its jurisdiction is not either appellate or revisional nor has it a general power of superintendence under section Its sole duty is to serve as the appointed machinery for resolving any conflict which may arise between an assessee or the Commissioner on the one hand and the <ORG> on the other regarding some specific question or questions of law If on an application under section <ORG> finds that the question which the applicant required the <ORG> to refer was not a question that arose out of the <ORG> appellate order it ought in my view to refuse to require the <ORG> to refer any such question Therein <NAME> <NAME> as he then was held on an examination of the section and on a review of the authorities that under section it is only question which had been raised before and dealt with by the <ORG> that could be referred to <ORG> that the power of <ORG> under section to direct a reference is limited to questions which could be referred under section and which the applicant required it to refer that the <ORG> has no power to raise a question suo motu and likewise <ORG> cannot raise any question which had not been referred to it either under section or section but when once a question is properly raised and referred to <ORG> <ORG> is bound to answer that question In this view it was held that a reference to <ORG> on a question which was not raised before or considered by the <ORG> was not competent <NAME> <NAME> while generally agreeing with this view considered that there might be cases in which strict adherence to this view might work injustice as for example when a point raised before the <ORG> had not been dealt with by it owing to mistake or The learned Judge added that in the former case the point might be deemed to have been decided against the assessee in the order thereby attracting We must now consider the decisions which have taken a somewhat different view This is not a decision on the question as to whether question not raised before or decided by the commissioner could be held to be questions arising out of his order An objection was raised before the court that the question as to the application of section iv had not been argued before the <ORG> and therefore it could not be referred Repelling this contention <ORG> as he then was observed that the specific question had been put forward as a ground of appeal and that was quoted by the <ORG> in its judgment but not dealt with by it and that in the circumstances the proper order to pass was to refer the case back to the tribunal and invite it to express its opinion on this aspect of the contention and raise a proper question of law on that point also This judgment again proceeds on the view that it is only a question raised before and dealt with by the <ORG> The reference was heard by <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> Before them an objection was raised that the <ORG> could not refer this question under section as the same had not been raised before it This court merely exercises an advisory jurisdiction Its judgments are in the nature of advice given on the questions submitted to it by the <ORG> Its advice must be confined to question referred by the <ORG> to this court and those questions must be questions of law which must arise out of the order made by the <ORG> Now looking at the plain language of the section apart from any authority I should have stated that a question of law arose out of the order of the <ORG> if such a question was apparent on the order itself or it could be raised on the facts found by the <ORG> and which were stated in the order I see no reason to confine the jurisdiction of this court to such questions of law as have been argued before the <ORG> or are dealt with by the <ORG> The section does not say so and there is no reason why we should construe the expression arising out of such order in a manner unwarranted by the ordinary grammatical construction of that expression This court has no jurisdiction to decide questions which have not been referred by the <ORG> If the <ORG> does not refer a question of law under section which arises out of the order then the only jurisdiction of the court is to require the <ORG> to refer the same Under section It is true that the court has jurisdiction to resettle questions of law so as to bring out the real issue between the parties but it is not open to the court to raise new questions which have not been referred to it by the <ORG> An assessee may raise a question and argue it before the <ORG> but if the <ORG> thought fit to ignore that argument and not to refer to that point of law in its order then the court would have no jurisdiction to call upon the <ORG> to refer that question of law to <ORG> It is true that the Income tax Act is a very technical statute but I see no reason why when the plain grammatical construction of the section does not make it necessary to come to that conclusion it is necessary to do so and arrive at such an anomalous result When the case came back on the further statement under section criticising certain remarks therein that the court had no power to direct the <ORG> to refer a question not argued before it the court observed that they were made under a misconception and quoted the observations of <NAME> in Madanlal Dharnidharkav It will be seen from the foregoing review of the decisions that all <ORG>s are agreed that section creates a special jurisdiction that the power of the <ORG> to make a reference and the right of the litigant to require it must be sought within the four corners of section that the jurisdiction of <ORG> to hear references is limited to questions which are properly referred to it under section and that such jurisdiction is purely advisory and extends only to deciding questions referred to it The narrow ground over which <ORG> differ is as regards the question whether it is competent to the <ORG> to refer or <ORG> to decide a decided by it where it arises on the facts found by it where it arises on the facts found by it Now the argument in support of the latter view is that on the plain grammatical construction of any question of law that could be raised on the findings of fact given by the <ORG> would be questions that arise out of the order and that to hold that they meant that the question must have been raised before the <ORG> and decided by it would be to read into the section words which are not there that the court was not limited to particular questions raised by the commissioners in the form of questions on the case and that if the point of law was apparent on the case as stated and there were no further facts to be found the court could give effect to it He also maintained that the position under the Indian law was the same as under the British Statute because under section of the Act the <ORG> has to refer not only questions of law arising out of its order but also a statement of the case that under section the court can likewise require the <ORG> to state the case and refer it and that under the court has to decide the question of law raised by the case Under the British statute when once a decision is given by the Commissioners it is sufficient that the assessee should express his dissatisfaction with it and ask that the matter be referred to the decision of <ORG> It is then for the Commissioners to draw up a statement of the case and refer it for the decision of the court The British statute does not cast as does of the Act a duty on the assessee to put in an application stating the questions of law which he desires the Commissioners to refer to the court and requiring them to refer the questions which arise out of that order <NAME> this Court has decided that the requirements of are matters affecting the jurisdiction to make a reference under that section The attempt of the respondents to equate the position under of the Act with that under the British statute on the ground that the <ORG> has to draw up a statement of the case and refer it and that the court is to decide questions of law raised by it must break down when the real purpose of a statement in a reference is kept in view There is nothing in it which calls for a decision by the court It is the question of law referred under that calls for decision under and it is that that constitutes the pivotal point on which the jurisdiction of the court hinges The statement of the case is material only as furnishing the facts for the purpose of enabling the court to decide the question referred But the main contention still remains that the language of section is wide enough to admit of questions of law which arise on the facts found by the <ORG> and that there is no justification for cutting down its amplitude by importing in effect words into it which are not there There is considerable force in this argument But then there are certain features which distinguish the jurisdiction under section and they have to be taken into consideration in ascertaining the true import of the words any question of law arising out of such order <ORG> hearing a reference under that section does not exercise any appellate or revisional or supervisory jurisdiction over the <ORG> It acts purely in an advisory capacity on a reference which properly comes before it under section and It gives the <ORG>s advice but ultimately it is for them to give effect to that advice It is of the essence of such a jurisdiction that the court can decide only questions which are referred to it and not any other question If the true scope of the jurisdiction of <ORG> is to give advice when it is sought by the <ORG> it stands to reason that the <ORG> should have had an occasion to consider the question so that it may decide whether it should refer it for the decision of the court How can it be said that the <ORG> should seek for advice on a question which it was not called upon to consider and in respect of which it had no opportunity of deciding whether the decision of the court should be sought It was argued for the respondents that in view of the fact that the court could compel the <ORG> to refer a question of law under section for its decision not much significance could be attached to the advisory character of its jurisdiction It is not conceivable it was said that any authority should have a right to compel another authority to take its advice We see no force in this contention Section confers on the court a power to direct a reference only where the <ORG> was under a duty to refer under section and it is therefore subject to the same laminations as section Moreover the power of the court to issue direction to the <ORG> under section is as has often been pointed out in the nature of a mandamus and it is well settled that no mandamus will be issued unless the applicant had made a distinct demand on the appropriate authorities for the very reliefs which he seeks to enforce by mandamus and that had been refused Thus the power of the court to direct a reference under is subject to two limitations the question must be one which the <ORG> was bound to refer under and the applicant must have required the <ORG> to refer it is the form prescribed under Rule A for an application under and that shows that the applicant must set out the questions which he desires the <ORG> to refer and that further those questions must arise out of the order of the <ORG> It is therefore clear that under the court cannot direct the <ORG> to refer a question unless it is one which arises out of the order of the <ORG> and was specified by the applicant in his application under Now if we are to hold that the court can allow a new question to be raised on the reference that would in effect give the applicant a right which is denied to him under and and enlarge the jurisdiction of the court so as to assimilate it to that of an ordinary civil court of appeal It is again to be noted that whereas section as it stood prior to the amendment of conferred on the Commissioner a power to refer a question of law to the court suo motu that power has been taken away under the present section and it has accordingly been held that under section as it now stands there is no power in the <ORG> to refer a question of law suo motu for the decision of the court If as contended for by the respondents the court is to be held to have power to entertain in a reference any question of law which arises on the facts found by the <ORG> its jurisdiction under section must be held to be wider than under section and The correct view to take in our opinion is that the right of the litigant to ask for a reference the power of the <ORG> to make one and the jurisdiction of the court to decide it are all co extensive and therefore a question of law which the applicant cannot require the <ORG> to refer and one which the <ORG> is not competent to refer to the court cannot be entertained by the court under In such a case it was said the applicant would be deprived for no fault of his of a valuable right which the <ORG> has intended to give him This is only an application of the principle well known to law that a relief asked for and not granted should be deemed to have been refused There was also some argument as to the position under section when the <ORG> decides an appeal on a question of law not raised before it That would undoubtedly be a question arising out of the order and not the less so because it was not argued before it and this conclusion does not militate against the construction which we have put on the language of section When a question of law is neither raised before the <ORG> nor considered by it it will not be a question arising out of its order notwithstanding that it may arise on the findings given by it Stating the position compendiously it is only a question that has been raised before or decided by the <ORG> that could be held to arise out of its order was assessable to tax as income received during the year of account That having been decided against the respondents the <ORG> referred on their application under section the question whether the sum of Rs was properly included in the assessee company total income for the assessment year and that was the very question which was argued and decided by <ORG> Thus it cannot be said that the respondents had raised any new question before the court But the appellant contends that while before the income tax authorities the respondents disputed their liability on the ground that the amount ion question had been received in the year previous to the year of account th the scope of the question and <ORG> rightly entertained it It is argued for the appellant that this view would have the effect of doing away with limitations which the <ORG> has advisedly imposed on the right of a litigant to require references under section as the question might be framed in such general manner as to admit of new questions not argued being raised It is no doubt true that sometimes the questions are framed in such general terms that construed literally they might take in questions which were never in issue In such cases the true scope of the reference will have to be ascertained and limited by what appears on the statement of the case Where however the question is sufficiently specific we are unable to see any ground for holding that only those contention can be argued in support of it which had been raised before the <ORG> Though the point argued before the income tax authorities was that the income was received not in the year of account but in the previous year the question as framed is sufficient to cover the question which was actually argued before the court namely that in fact the assessment is not proper by reason of the proviso being inapplicable Indeed the very order of reference shows that the <ORG> was conscious that this point also might bear on the controversy so that it cannot be said to be foreign to the scope of the question as framed In the result we are of opinion that the question of the applicability of the proviso is really implicit as was held by <NAME> in the question which was referred and therefore it was one which the court had to answer On the merits the appellant had very little to say He sought to contend that the proviso though it came into force on May was really intended to operate from April and he referred us to certain other enactments as supporting that inference But we are construing the proviso In terms it is not retrospective and we cannot import into its construction matters which are ad extra legis and thereby alter its true effect having been allowed as deduction in the previous years may now be treated as profits received during the year of assessment and thereby subjected to tax But this is a point entirely new and not covered by the question and on the view taken by us as to the scope of a reference under section it must be disallowed In the result this appeal is dismissed with costs <ORG> Bombay Bench A referred the following question to <ORG> at Bombay under section of the Indian Income tax Act Whether the sum of Rs was properly included in the assessee company total income computed for the assessment year The question comprehends two component parts whether the amount of Rs was properly included in the assessees income and whether the amount was properly included in the taxable income of the assessees for the assessment year The amount sought to be taxed was part of compensation received by the assessees from <ORG> for loss in by enemy action of their ship El Madina The assessees maintained before the taxing authorities and the <ORG> that the compensation accrued to them on April This plea was rejected but rejection of that plea was not sufficient to make the amount taxable It had still to be decided whether the amount which was received in the months of July and December was taxable as income It is common ground that before the amendment by Act of of section subsection clause vii by the inclusion of the fourth proviso compensation received for loss of a capital asset like a ship was not taxable as income under the Indian Income tax Act The tribunal observed that the compensation accrued when it was ascertained and was received by the assessees in the year of account and the amount was therefore rightly brought to tax in the year of assessment But proviso IV to sub cl came into force on May It was not in force on April the day on which the liability to pay tax for the year of assessment crystallized The tribunal erroneously assumed that the amending Act was in force at the date of commencement of the year of assessment and the assessees did not attempt to remove that misapprehension The question whether the statutory pro vision relied upon to tax the assessees was applicable to the amount sought to be assessed as income was as much a question arising out of the order of the tribunal as the question whether the interpretation placed by the tribunal upon that proviso was correct may be The assessees had maintained that they were not liable to be taxed under section sub section clause vii proviso vi because the amount sought to be taxed was received before the year of account relevant for the assessment year A question of law whether the amount was properly included in the taxable income for the year of assessment clearly arose and that question was referred by the <ORG> to <ORG> This would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal but counsel for the revenue submits that as it was never urged before the <ORG> by the assessees that the amending Act of which made the compensation received by the assessees taxable as income was brought into operation after the commencement of the year of assessment and the <ORG> never directed its attention to that plea it had no jurisdiction to refer that question to <ORG> and <ORG> was not competent to answer that question even if on the facts found the question clearly arose out of the order of the <ORG> Counsel urges that the question arising out of the order of the <ORG> is only that specific question which has been raised and argued before the <ORG> and on which the <ORG> has given its decision We have heard elaborate arguments on the true meaning of the expression any question of law arising out of such order and the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by <ORG> under section of the Income tax Act There is wide divergence of opinion on the true import of this clause Before I refer to the authorities it would be useful to set out the scheme of the Income tax Act relating to reference of questions to <ORG> under section and the nature of the jurisdiction which <ORG> exercises I Within sixty days of the date upon which he is served with notice of an order under sub section of section the assessees or the Commissioner may by application in the prescribed form require <ORG> to refer to <ORG> any question of law arising out of such order and <ORG> shall draw up a statement of the case and refer it to the <ORG> If on any application being made under sub section <ORG> refuses to state the case on the ground that no question of law arises the assessee or the Commissioner as the case may be may apply to <ORG> and <ORG> may if it is not satisfied of the correctness of the decision of <ORG> require <ORG> to state the case and to refer it and on receipt of any such requisition <ORG> shall state the case and refer it accordingly If <ORG> is not satisfied that the statements in a case referred under this section are sufficient to enable it to determine the question raised thereby the court may refer the case back to <ORG> to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the court may direct in that behalf <ORG> upon the hearing of any such case shall decide the questions of law raised thereby and shall deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such decision is founded and shall send a copy of such judgment to <ORG> which shall pass such orders as are necessary to dispose of the case conformably to such judgment <ORG> indisputably exercises a special advisory jurisdiction to record its opinion on questions submitted by the <ORG> it does not act as a court of appeal or revision on questions of law or fact After the disposal of the appeal by the <ORG> under section of the Income tax Act the revenue or the taxpayer may call upon the <ORG> to state a case on the questions of law arising out of the order If the <ORG> refuses to state a case the party aggrieved may move <ORG> to call upon the <ORG> to state a case and <ORG> may so direct if it is not satisfied as to the correctness of the decision of the <ORG> refusing to state a case The question must be one of law and not of fact and not merely academic it must be a concrete problem bearing directly on the rights and obligations of the revenue or of the assessments If the tribunal is not called upon to refer a question <ORG> cannot arrogate to itself the power to call upon the tribunal to refer questions which arise out of the findings recorded by the tribunal but which the tribunal was not called upon to refer But there is in my judgment no warrant for the view that the question which the tribunal may refer or which <ORG> on the refusal of the tribunal may call upon the tribunal to refer must be a question which was raised and argued before the tribunal at the hearing under The statute does not specifically impose such a restriction nor is it implied To import in the meaning of the expression any question of law arising out of such order the concept that the question must have been argued before and dealt with by the tribunal in its judgment deciding the appeal is to impose a fetter upon the jurisdiction of <ORG> not warranted by the plain intendment of the statute The source of the question must be the order of the tribunal but of the question it is not predicated that the tribunal must have been asked to decide it at the hearing of the appeal It may very well happen and frequently cases arise in which the question of law arises for the first time out of the order of the tribunal The tribunal may wrongly apply the law may call in aid a statutory provision which has no application may even misconceive the question to be decided or ignore a statutory provision which expressly applies to the facts found It would indeed be perpetrating gross injustice in such cases to restrict the assessee or the Commissioner to the questions which have been raised and argued before the tribunal and to refuse to take cognisance of questions which arise out of the order of the tribunal but which were not argued because they could not in the absence of any indication as to what the tribunal was going to decide be argued A concrete question of law having a direct bearing on the rights and obligations of the parties which may be founded on the decision of the <ORG> is one which in my judgment arises out of the order of the <ORG> even if it is not raised or argued before the <ORG> at the hearing of the appeal It is the duty of the <ORG> to draw up a statement to the case and to frame questions that duty can only be performed adequately if specific questions relating directly to the dispute between the parties are raised But in dealing with the question <ORG> may not only entertain those aspects of the case which were argued before the <ORG> but all such aspects as have fairly a direct bearing on the dispute The jurisdiction of <ORG> is by statute not expressly circumscribed to recording its opinion on arguments advanced before the tribunal and the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by <ORG> does not demand that such a limitation should be implied The court has jurisdiction to decide questions which arise out of the order of the tribunal not merely those which were raised and argued before the tribunal On the meaning of the expression question of law arising out of such order judicial opinion in <ORG> is divided and this court has not expressed any authoritative opinion therein No useful purpose will be served by entering upon an analysis of the decisions of <ORG>s and there are many on this question The decisions fall into two broad divisions On the one hand it is ruled that a question of law can be said to arise out of an order of <ORG> within the meaning of section of the Indian Income tax Act only if such order discloses that the question was raised before the <ORG> A question not raised before the <ORG> cannot be said to arise out of its order even if on the facts of the case appearing from the order the question fairly arises I see no reason to confine the jurisdiction of this court to such questions of law as have been argued before the <ORG> or are dealt with by the <ORG> The section does not say so and there is no reason why we should construe the expression arising out of such order in a manner unwarranted by the ordinary grammatical construction of that expression For the reasons already set out in my view the interpretation placed by <NAME> on the expression arising out of such order is the correct one
