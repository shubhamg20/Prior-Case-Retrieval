This appeal is brought by the Governor General in Council from a decree made by <ORG> in its original jurisdiction on March In proceedings commenced in that Court against the respondent the Province of Madras the appellant claimed that the Madras Act IX of known as the Madras General Sales Tax Act of and hereafter referred to as the Madras Act in so far as it purports to levy a tax on first sales in Madras of goods manufactured or produced in India is except in respect of certain excepted goods ultra vires and beyond the competence of the <ORG> of the respondent <ORG> dismissed the appellant suit following its previous decision in an appeal from <ORG> in a suit in which the present respondents were appellants and a firm called <ORG> were respondents and the validity of the same provisions of the same Act was in issue This case will be referred to as the <ORG> case prov Section of the Constitution Act provides as follows Notwithstanding anything in the two next succeeding subsections <ORG> has and a Provincial Legislature has not power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule to this Act hereinafter called the Federal Legislative List Notwithstanding anything in the next succeeding subsections <ORG> and subject to the preceding subsection <ORG> also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the said Schedule hereinafter called the Concurrent Legislative List Subject to the two preceding subsections <ORG> has and <ORG> has not power to make laws for a Province or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the said Schedule hereinafter called the Provincial Legislative List <ORG> has power to make laws with respect to matters enumerated in the Provincial Legislative List except for a Province or any part thereof Duties of excise on Tobacco and other goods manufactured or produced in India except there follow certain exceptions It is upon these two entries respectively that the parties rely the respondent contending that Entry No of the Provincial Legislative List authorises and justifies the impugned provisions of the Madras Act the appellant contending that so far as those provisions purport to impose a tax on first sales they in effect impose a duty of excise and are therefore an encroachment upon the power given exclusively to <ORG> by Entry No of the Federal Legislative List For in a Federal constitution in which there is a division of legislative powers between <ORG> it appears to be inevitable that controversy should arise whether one or other <ORG> is not exceeding its own and encroaching on the others constitutional legislative power and in such a controversy it is a principle which their Lordships do not hesitate to apply in the present case that it is not the name of the tax but its real nature its pith and substance as it has sometimes been said which must determine into what category it falls The Madras Act which received the assent of the Governor of Madras on June is entitled An Act to provide for the levy of a general tax on the sale of goods in the Province of Madras Section contains a number of definitions of which it is necessary to refer only to the following dealer means any person who carries on the business of buying or selling goods sale with all its grammatical variations and cognate expressions means every transfer of the property in goods by one person to another in the course of trade or business for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration but does not include a mortgage hypothecation charge or pledge i Turnover means the aggregate amount for which goods are either bought or sold by a dealer whether for cash or for deferred payment or other valuable consideration provided that the proceeds of the sale by a person of agricultural or horticultural produce grown by himself or grown on any land in which he has an interest whether as owner usufructuary mortgagee tenant or otherwise shall be excluded from his turnover Subject to the provisions of this Act every dealer shall pay in each year a tax in accordance with the scale specified below a If his turnover does not exceed rupees rupees per month Provided further that in respect of the same transaction of sale the buyer and the sellers shall not both be taxed but only one of them as shall be determined by the rules made in this behalf under sub section shall be taxed thereon and that when the amount for which any goods were bought by a dealer has been included in his turnover the amount for which the same goods were sold by him shall not be included in his turnover for the purposes of this Act The turnover for all the purposes of this Act shall be determined in accordance with and the tax shall be assessed levied and collected in such manner and in such instalment as may be prescribed by the Rules made by the Provincial Government in this behalf Subject to any rules made under Sub section the assessing authority may fix the turnover of any dealer in any year at the amount of his turnover in the previous year Sections and provide for exemption from the tax imposed by Section of certain classes of goods and Section for taxation of the sale of hides and skins whether tanned or untanned only at such single point in the series of sales by successive dealers as might be prescribed Section provides for a rebate of one half of the tax levied on sales of certain goods for delivery outside the Province Section for the licensing and exemption of agents Section provides that <ORG> may make rules to carry out the purposes of the Act It is necessary then to consider the contention which in the <NAME> case found favour with <ORG> that the Madras Act so far as it imposes a tax on first sales of goods manufactured or produced in India is ultra vires <ORG> This contention is thus clearly stated in the appellant formal reasons on the present appeal a tax on the manufacturer or producer of goods on the first sale thereof is a duty of excise under the provisions of the Constitution Act the appellant has and the respondent has not power to impose a duty of excise the provisions of Entry No in the Provincial Legislative List must be construed subject to the provisions of Entry No in the Federal Legislative List But it appears to them that it is right first to consider whether a fair reconciliation cannot be effected by giving to the language of <ORG> a meaning which if less wide than it might in another context bear is yet one that can properly be given to it and equally giving to the language of the <ORG> Legislative List a meaning which it can properly bear For if his contention is upheld the plain words Taxes on the sale of goods must be read as if the words other than the first sale of goods manufactured or produced in India were added by way of qualification The validity of the appellant first reason must therefore be examined in order to see whether the Lists can be reconciled not by doing violence to the language of the <ORG> List but by giving some other than the meaning and effect for which the appellant contends to the relevant words of the Federal List Their Lordships would first observe concurring herein in the cogent reasoning of <ORG> in the <NAME> case that little assistance is to be derived from the consideration of other <ORG> Constitutions and of their judicial interpretations Here there is no question of direct and indirect taxation nor of the definition of specific and residuary powers The appellant fundamental contention is that the power to impose a duty of excise which is given to <ORG> alone by Entry No of the Federal List entitles that <ORG> and no other to impose a tax on first sales of goods manufactured or produced in India No other meaning it is contended can fairly be given to the words duty of excise than one which includes a tax on the first sales of such goods The term duty of excise is a somewhat flexible one it may no doubt cover a tax on first and perhaps on other sales it may in a proper context have an even wider meaning That this is so is clearly exemplified in those excepted cases in which the <ORG> not the <ORG> <ORG> has power to impose a duty of excise In such cases there appears to be no reason why the <ORG> <ORG> should not impose a duty of excise in respect of the commodity manufactured and then a tax on first or other sales of the same commodity It appears then to their Lordships that the competing Entries No of the Federal List and No of the Provincial List may fairly be reconciled without adopting the contention of the appellant and that the validity of the Madras Act cannot successfully be challenged
