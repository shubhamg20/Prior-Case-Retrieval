The respondent had joined the service of the appellant <ORG> at Gwalior on as Apprentice and was regularly appointed as Clerk cum Cashier with effect from He claimed that on account of very serious eye ailment he had been taking leave often and on and he had such ailment even in the year and after obtaining a fitness certificate from a doctor he submitted his joining report to the Branch Manager on which was not accepted by him and therefore he submitted an application to the higher authorities of the <ORG> In answer to the writ petition filed the appellants justified their action by stating that the respondent after proceeding on leave for three days commencing on did not report for duty although communications dated September December and April were sent to him and he was called upon to resume his duty <ORG> took the view that the respondent had put in years of service and his services could not have been dispensed with except after inquiry consistent with the principles of natural justice and the appellants action in terminating the services of the respondent is based on a mis conduct in respect of which no inquiry has been held though it was imperative for the appellants to have served a charge sheet to him with an opportunity to file his reply to appoint an Inquiry Officer to permit the respondent to adduce evidence in support of the allegations of mis conduct and to give opportunity to him to refute such evidence <ORG> therefore declared that the order striking out the name of the respondent from the rolls of the <ORG> is a nullity due to the patent violation of the principles of natural justice and the appellants order also suffered from many defects such as non application of mind to the matter As regards wages <ORG> directed that appropriate application could be made to the appellants under the Industrial Disputes Act The learned counsel for the respondent while supporting the view taken by <ORG> submitted that a workman should know the nature of the complaint or the accusation against him and should have opportunity to put forth his case in the absence of which there cannot be any fair or just decision on the matter Even Syndicate <ORG> case supra he submitted was decided on the facts of that case and there is no similarity between two matters and hence he submitted that this appeal deserved to be dismissed A reading of clause XVI of IV Bipartite Settlement will make it clear that in the event an employee absents himself from duty for or more consecutive days beyond the period of leave originally sanctioned or subsequently extended the Management may at any time thereafter give a notice to the employee at the last known address calling upon him to report for duty within days of notice stating inter alia the grounds for the Management coming to the conclusion that the employee has no intention of joining duty and furnishing necessary evidence wherever relevant and unless the employee reports for duty within days of the notice or gives an explanation for his absence satisfying the Management that he has not taken up another employment or avocation and he has no intention of not joining the duty the employee will be deemed to have voluntarily retired from the banks service on the expiry of the time fixed in the said notice In the event of the employee giving a satisfactory reply he will be permitted to report for duty thereafter within days from the expiry of the aforesaid notice without prejudice to the banks right to take any action under the law or rules of service Under this Rule the employee is given an opportunity to rejoin duty within a stipulated time or explain his position to the satisfaction of the Management that he has no intention of not joining duty and a presumption will be drawn that the employee does not require the job any more and will stand retired from service Thus there is no punishment for mis conduct but only to notice the realities of the situation resulting from long absence of an employee from work with no satisfactory explanation thereto If the respondent had submitted an explanation regarding his unauthorised absence or placed any material before the court that he did report for duty but was not allowed to join duty inquiry may have been necessitated but not otherwise In this case the employee respondent had defaulted in not offering any explanation regarding his unauthorised absence from duty nor did he place any material to show that he reported for duty within days of notice as required by clause XVI of IV Bipartite Settlement Thus we think that the contention put forward on behalf of the respondent that he was suffering from serious eye ailment at the relevant time is difficult of acceptance In the writ petition filed before <ORG> the respondent had stated that in the year he had a serious eye ailment and he had been taking leave from the bank often and on and he had taken leave from to to attend some urgent work which was duly sanctioned but he was struck by eye ailment and therefore he could not join his duty as is clear from the medical certificate issued to him In reply thereto the stand taken by the appellants is that the record of the respondent does not disclose that he had proceeded on leave on medical advice for an eye ailment at any time There is dispute as to when he made available this material We do not also find any material on record to show that he had reported for duty within the period indicated in the notice issued in terms of clause XVI of IV Bipartite Settlement In the circumstances we find <ORG> had proceeded on an erroneous basis of non compliance with the principles of natural justice whereas the true content of the principles of natural justice should have been borne in mind particularly when there was an agreement between the parties as to the manner in which the situation should be dealt with and the consequence that would ensue thereof In the circumstances we allow this appeal set aside the order made by <ORG> and dismiss the writ petition filed by the respondent However in the circumstances of the case the parties are directed to bear their respective costs
