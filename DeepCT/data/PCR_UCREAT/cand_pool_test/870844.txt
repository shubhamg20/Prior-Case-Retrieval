Short facts leading to this petition are as under The petitioner is a subsidiary company of <ORG> It is further submitted by the petitioner that applications were also presented before the Collector <NAME> for permission to acquire land situated in village Panjra for construction of office buildings and residential quarters for officers staff and other workers This land was needed by the company for construction of the residential quarters etc The petitioner submitted objections on to the notice dt Therefore the entire legislative field in relation to regulation and development of mines and minerals stood transferred to <ORG> and <ORG> lost the legislative competence to make any legislation on that subject and therefore provisions of the Adhiniyam or the Municipalities Act have no application to the construction work which was carried out by the petitioner It is also submitted that the petitioner company is a Government company wholly owned financed and controlled by the Government of India and therefore under the provisions of Section of the Adhiniyam it is exempted from applying for the permission to carry on any construction of building work etc As such the directions were issued under Section of the Adhiniyam As such according to the respondents when the Development Act and the Coal Act are not the enactments concerning local Government Act i Adhiniyam or the Municipalities Act which have been enacted by <ORG> in exercise of the legislative powers conferred by Entry of List II Schedule VII of the Constitution of India for which <ORG> is alone competent to make law for <ORG> or local Government therefore according to the respondents the buildings or other building structures may form part of the mines but that does not mean that construction of such buildings or structures is not regulated by the provisions of building regulations enacted under the Adhiniyam or Municipalities Act It is also submitted that petitioner company is not <ORG> and therefore provision of Section of the Adhiniyam has no application at all After hearing the rival contentions of the parties at length we have reached the conclusion that this petition has no substance and it must be dismissed In order to appreciate the submissions of the petitioner company regarding the applicability of the doctrine of occupied fields it is necessary to examine the scheme of the relevant enactments legislated by the <ORG> and <ORG> Entry No of List I relates to Regulation of mines and minerals development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Therefore it is clear that under Section of the Development Act the legislative field covered by Entry of List II will pass on to <ORG> by virtue of Entry of List I But in order to judge whether on that count <ORG> loses its competence to pass the State laws in the instant case the Adhiniyam it is necessary to find out the object and purpose of the Adhiniyam and the relevant provisions thereof under which the <ORG> has been given the power to regulate the building construction work within the territorial jurisdiction of the <ORG> Provision of Section of the Adhiniyam which provides for the constitution of the special area lays down by Sub section of Section that Notwithstanding anything contained in the Madhya Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act the Municipalities Act or the <ORG> Act <ORG> <ORG> Notified Area or the <ORG> as the case may be shall in relation to the special area and as from the date <ORG> undertakes to function under Clause iv or Clause of Section cease to exercise powers and perform the functions and duties which <ORG> is competent to exercise and perform under the Adhiniyam Further Section defines the functions of <ORG> one of which as prescribed by Clause is to provide the municipal service as specified under Sections and of the Municipalities Act Similarly Section of the Adhiniyam which provides powers of <ORG> shows that those powers are conferred for the purpose of municipal administration Therefore it is crystal clear that the functions powers and duties of <ORG> and <ORG> do not become an occupied field by using of the declaration contained in Section of the Development Act and hence the competence of <ORG> to enact laws for the Municipal administration will remain unaffected by that declaration is derived by the <ORG> from the provisions of the Adhiniyam and therefore the <ORG> has power in order to discharge its municipal functions effectively to control and regulate the construction of houses and colonies etc permission will not be required after the formation of the <ORG> but the submissions as have been made by the petitioner are misconceived Therefore the third submission as made by the petitioner is also repelled being devoid of any substance and based on disputed questions of fact which cannot be decided in writ jurisdiction
