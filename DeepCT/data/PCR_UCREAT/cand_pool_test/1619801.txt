In the <ORG> of <NAME> there was no statutory rule or regulation prescribing the procedure for selection of books for general reading to be kept in school and college libraries except the <ORG> Government periodical administrative instructions in the form of resolutions constituting committees namely <ORG><ORG><ORG> a Distribution <ORG><ORG><ORG> and a Purchase <ORG> to which Government officials as well as non<ORG>officials were appointed as members The Purchase <ORG> restricted the list for the years and to books out of books submitted for selection but as further funds became available the Government decided to select more books and accordingly a committee constituted under the Chairmanship of Director of Public Instruction Schools <NAME> selected a supplementary list of books out of the said books which had been submitted for selection Due to Paucity of time and delay in the normal process of selection of books the <ORG> Government took a decision or April to utilise the grant made by <ORG> by purchasing books out of the books selected for the years and and the said supplementary list of books Thereupon the appellants who were publishers filed a Writ Petition under Article of the Constitution against the <ORG> of <NAME> and the Director of Public Instruction <NAME> to quash the list of books selected for the years and and the <ORG> Government said decision with respect to purchasing books out of the cyclone and flood relief grant made by <ORG> inter alia on the ground of bias on the part of some of the members of <ORG><ORG><ORG> whose books were submitted for selection The principle applies not only to judicial proceedings but also to quasi<ORG> judicial and administrative proceedings A person who has written a book which is submitted for selection either by himself or by his publishers is interested in the matter of selection and therefore an author<ORG>member should not be a member of any such committee or sub<ORG>committee for several considerations namely a Authors stand to benefit financially in several ways by getting either royalty from the publishers or by direct sales Though an author<ORG>member may be only one of the members of <ORG><ORG><ORG>s and that the ultimate decision of selection may rest with the <ORG> Government which may reject any book out of the list of the approved books normally the <ORG> would be guided by the list of books approved by the Assessment <ORG> The author<ORG>member can certainly influence the minds of the other members against selecting books by other authors in preference to his own Books by some of the other members may also have been submitted for selection and there can be between them a quid pro quo or in other words you see that my book is selected and in return I will do the same for you In either case when a book of an author<ORG>member comes up for consideration the other members would feel themselves embrassed in frankly discussing its merits Such author<ORG>member may also be a person holding a high official position whom the other members may not want to displease and Though it may be that the other members may not be influenced by the fact that the book which they are considering for approval was written by one of their members whether they were so influenced or not would however be a matter impossible to determine An adjudicator who is subject to disqualification on the ground of bias or interest in the matter which he has to decide may be required to adjudicate if there is no other person who is competent or authorized to adjudicate or if a quorum cannot be formed without him or if no other competent tribunal can be constituted there was nothing to prevent those whose books were submitted for selection from pointing out this fact to the <ORG> Government so that it could amend its resolution by appointing a substitute or substitutes as the case may be There was equally nothing to prevent such non<ORG>official author<ORG>members from resigning from the committee on the ground of their interest in the matter Since several books would come up for consideration before the committee one or more of them by one of the member and the other or others by some of the other members mere non<ORG>participation in the discussion by the member concerned or even his withdrawing from the deliberations of the committee while his or her book or books are being considered is not sufficient because the evil of quid pro quo cannot be eliminated by such a resolution It would therefore be unfair to prohibit publishers from submitting books for selection merely because they had at one time published a book written by any one of the members of the committee or sub<ORG>committee concerned with the selection of books This question has come up for our consideration in this Appeal by Special Leave from the judgment and order of <ORG> dismissing with no order as to costs the petition under Article of the Constitution filed by the Appellants There does not exist any statutory rule or regulation in the State of <NAME> prescribing the method for selection of books for general reading to be kept in school and college libraries Accordingly <ORG> restricted the list of books out of books submitted for selection but as further funds became available the Government decided to select more books and accordingly constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Director of Public Instruction Schools <NAME> For this reason <ORG> felt that it was not feasible to adopt for selection of books the procedure usually followed as it took a considerable time and therefore took a decision on April to utilize the grant made by <ORG> in purchasing books out of the books selected for the years and and the said supplementary list of books There is some controversy with respect to who convened the said meeting who were present at that meeting and what transpired in that meeting but we find it unnecessary to go into this controversy Thereupon the Appellants who are publishers filed a petition under Article of the Constitution against the State of orissa and the Director of Public Instruction Orissa to quash the lists of books selected for the years and and <ORG> said decision with respect to purchasing books out of the cyclone and flood relief grant made by <ORG> inter alia on the ground of bias on the part of some of the members of <ORG> Committee whose books were submitted for selection <ORG> by a common judgment delivered on August dismissed both these writ petitions and made no order as to the costs thereof For the year it had submitted twenty four books out of which one was selected For the year it had submitted twenty nine books out of which six were selected The final decision approving the selection of books was that of <ORG> for it had the right to reject any book recommended by the Assessment Sub<ORG>Committee and therefore the fact that some members of the Assessment Sub<ORG>Committee had also submitted their books for approval did not matter for the role played by an individual member of the Assessment Sub<ORG>Committee was insignificant and did not and could not influence the decision either of that Sub<ORG> Committee or of <ORG> There were no statutory rules or regulations with respect to selection of books and the selection was done each year as an administrative measure There is however some controversy as regards the fact whether any publishers were present at the meeting of that committee This principle applies not only to judicial proceedings but also to quasi judicial and administrative proceedings The position in law has been succinctly stated in Halsbury Laws of England Fourth Edition Volume I Para as follows Disqualification for financial interest There is a presumption that any direct financial interest however small in the matter in dispute disqualifies a person from adjudicating The Appellants have filed statements showing the financial benefit which accrued to those members of <ORG> Committee whose books were selected It was contended in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the Respondents that the amount of royalty received by these member authors was not much A similar argument was rejected by this Court in <NAME> case <ORG> would normally be guided by the list approved by <ORG> Committee Further to say that such author member is only one of the members of <ORG> Committee is to overlook the fact that the author member can subtly influence the minds of the other members against selecting books by other authors in preference to his own It can also be that books by some of the other members may also have been submitted for selection and there can be between them a quid pro quo or in other words you see that my book is selected and in return I will do the same for you In either case when a book of an author member comes up for consideration the other members would feel themselves embarrassed in frankly discussing its merits Such author member may also be a person holding a high official position whom the other members may not want to displease It can be that the other members may not be influenced by the fact that the book which they are considering for approval was written by one of their members All these considerations require that an author member should not be a member of any such committee or sub committee There is however an exception to the above rule that no men shall be a judge in his own cause namely the doctrine of necessity An adjudicator who is subject to disqualification on the ground of bias or interest in the matter which he has to decide may be required to adjudicate if there is no other person who is competent or authorized to adjudicate or if a quorum cannot be formed without him or if no other competent tribunal can be constituted There was however nothing to prevent those whose books were submitted for selection from pointing out this fact to <ORG> so that it could amend its Resolution by appointing a substitute or substitutes as the case may be There was equally nothing to prevent such non official author members from resigning from the committee on the ground of their interest in the matter It was however submitted on behalf of the Respondents that it was not necessary for this Court to lay down any guide lines inasmuch as after the Special Leave to Appeal was granted in this case the State Government had issued a fresh Government Resolution dated November whereby it constituted a new <ORG> and Assessment Committee consisting of Government officials and non official members clause of which Resolution satisfied the principles of fair play and natural justice by eliminating the possibility of any author member of the committee influencing author members in selecting his book Several books would come up for consideration before the committee one or more of them by one of the members and the other or others by some of the other members It was suggested on behalf of the Appellants that in laying down the guide lines we should provide that if a publisher has published a book written by one of the members of the committee or sub committee concerned with the selection of books such publisher should not be permitted to submit any book for selection even though no book by that author member had been submitted for selection It would therefore be unfair to prohibit publishers from submitting books for selection merely because they had at one time published a book written by one of the members of the committee or sub committee concerned with the selection of books The number of publishers is large but good publishers are few and such publishers will therefore be publishing the majority of books If he is a <ORG> official he should intimate to the <ORG> or the authority appointing him on that committee the fact that a book written or edited by him has been submitted for approval or selection and the <ORG> or the concerned authority should substitute in place of such member another person whether official or non official none of whose books has been submitted for approval or selection For the reasons mentioned above we allow this Appeal and direct the State of Orissa to amend suitably the Government Resolution dated November or to issue a fresh notification in supersession of that notification incorporating the guide lines laid down by us above as expeditiously as possible and in any event before the next selection of books is made without affecting any selection already made
