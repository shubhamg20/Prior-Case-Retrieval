Four of these appeals which arise out of SLP No of were filed against the judgment of <ORG> dated in four writ petitions namely No of and three other connected writ petitions The sixth Civil appeal which arises out of SLP No of was filed by <ORG> against the order dated in Writ Petition No of The said writ petition was filed by <ORG> <ORG> hereinafter called the respondent company for implementation of the directions given by the appellate authority under the Water Prevention of Pollution Act hereinafter called the Water Act in favour of the company In January the respondent company was incorporated as a public limited company with the object of setting up an industry for production of Castor oil derivatives such as Hydrogenated Castor Oil Hydroxy Stearic Acid Dehydrated Castor Oil Methylated HSA Co Fatty Acids with by products like Glycerine Spent Bleaching Earth and Carbon and Spent Nickel Catalyst In regard to grant of NOC by <ORG> the said Board by letter dated rejected the application dated for consent stating The unit is a polluting industry and falls under the red category of polluting industry under section No of the classification of industries adopted by <ORG> <ORG> and opined that it would not be desirable to locate such industry in the catchment area of Himayatsagar in view of the GOMs No dated Before the above order dated was passed by the appellate authority some of these public interest cases had already been filed After the order of the appellate authority a direction was sought in the public interest case No of that the order dated passed by the appellate authority was arbitrary and contrary to interim orders passed by <ORG> in and of <ORG> of <ORG> in its judgment dated held that the writ petitioners who filed the public interest cases could not be said to be having no locus standi to file the writ petitions In these appeals we have heard the preliminary submission of <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General for the A Pollution Control <ORG> <NAME> learned senior counsel for the respondent company and <NAME> for the appellant in the appeal arising out of SLP No of and others We are just now not going into all these aspects but are confining ourselves to the issues on the technological side Further where urgent decisions are required there are often no easy options for preserving the status quo pending the resolution of the dispute <NAME> advocates the constitution of a unified tribunal with a simple procedure which looks to the need of customers which takes the form of a <ORG> or an expert panel the allocation of a procedure adopted to the needs of each case which would operate at two levels first tier by a single Judge or technical person and a review by a panel of experts presided over by a High <ORG> Judge and not limited to Wednesbury grounds In regard to the different goals of Science and the law in the ascertainment of truth <ORG> observed in <NAME> vs <ORG> Ct as follows there are important differences between the quest for truth in the Court room and the quest for truth in the laboratory The relevant observations in the <NAME> Case in this behalf read as follows In view of the above mentioned constitutional and statutory provisions we have no hesitation in holding that the Precautionary Principle and the Polluter Pays Principle are part of the environmental law of the country The <NAME> judgment has referred to these principles briefly but in our view it is necessary to explain their meaning in more detail so that Courts and tribunals or environmental authorioties can properly apply the said principles in the matters which come before them Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage lack of full scientific certainity shall not be used as a reason for proposing cost effective measures to prevent environmental degradation says There is nothing to prevent decision makers from assessing the record and concluding there is inadequate information on which to reach a determination The precautionary principle suggests that where there is an identifiable risk of serious or irreversible harm including for example extinction of species widespread toxic pollution in major threats to essential ecological processes it may be appropriate to place the burden of proof on the person or entity proposing the activity that is potentially harmful to the environment This will lead to the question as to what is the non negligible risk Again under the National Environmental <ORG> Act which has power to award compensation for death or injury to any person other than workmen the said <ORG> under section no doubt consists of a Chairman who could be a Judge or retired Judge of the <ORG> or <ORG> and a Technical Member But section read with section or permits a Secretary to Government or Additional Secretary who has been a Vice Chairman for years to be appointed as Chairman It includes the need for the <ORG> to take the necessary legislative administrative and other actions to implement the duty of prevention of environmental harm as noted in Article of the draft approved by <ORG> of <ORG> in It appears to us from what has been stated earlier that things are not quite satisfactory and there is an urgent need to make appropriate amendments so as to ensure that at all times the appellate authorities or tribunals consist of <ORG> and also <ORG> personnel well versed in environmental laws As long back as <NAME> CJ in <NAME> vs <ORG> and Shriram Foods Fertilizers Case SCC at page observed We would also suggest to <ORG> that since cases involving issues of environmental pollution ecological destructions and conflicts over national resources are increasingly coming up for adjudication and these cases involve assessment and evolution of scientific and technical data it might be desirable to set up <ORG> on the regional basis with one professional Judge and two experts drawn from <ORG> keeping in view the nature of the case and the expertise required for its adjudication As stated earlier <ORG> should in our opinion bring about appropriate amendments in the environmental statutes Rules and notification to ensure that in all environmental Courts <ORG> and appellate authorities there is always a Judge of the rank of a <ORG> Judge or a <ORG> Judge sitting or retired and Scientist or group of Scientists of high ranking and experience so as to help a proper and fair adjudication of disputes relating to There is also an immediate need that in all the States and Union Territories the appellate authorities under section of the Water Prevention of Pollution Act and section of the Air Prevention of Pollution Act or other rules there is always a Judge of the <ORG> sitting or retired and a Scientist or group of Scientists of high ranking and experience to help in the adjudication of disputes relating to environment and pollution There is also need for amending the notifications issued under Rule of the Hazardous Wastes Management Handling Rules pl Technical Members not exceeding three who have professional knowledge or practical experience in the areas pertaining to conservation environmental management land or planning and development Appeals to this appellate authority are to be preferred by persons aggrieved by an order granting environmental clearance in the areas in which any industries operations or processes etc As stated above and we reiterate that there is need to see that in the appellate authority under the Water Prevention of Pollution Act the Air Prevention of Pollution Act and the appellate authority under Rule of the Hazardous Wastes Management Handling Rules under the notification issued under section of the Environment Protection Act for National Capital Territory and under section of the National Environment Tribunal Act and other appellate bodies there are invariably Judicial and Technical Members included rm Principle states Man has the fundamental right to freedom equality and adequate conditions of life in an environment of quality that permits a life of dignity and well being and he bears a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations The monitoring of a case as it progresses before the professional body and the consideration of objections raised by affected parties to the opinion given by these professional technical bodies have again been creating complex problems In fact both are to be traced to Article which deals with fundamental right to life and liberty With a view to ensure that there is neither danger to environment nor to ecology and at the same time ensuring sustainable development this <ORG> in our view can refer scientific and technical aspects for investigation and opinion to expert bodies such as <ORG> under the National Environmental Appellate Authority Act The said authority comprises of a retired Judge of the Supreme <ORG> and Members having technical expertise in environmental matters whose investigation analysis of facts and opinion on objections raised by parties could give adequate help to this <ORG> or the High <ORG>s and also the needed reassurance Such a procedure in our view can be adopted in matters arising in this <ORG> under Article or under Article or arising before the High <ORG>s under Article of the Constitution of India There was some argument that some of the draft issues could not be referred to the <ORG> while some others required modification After hearing arguments parties on both sides agreed for reference of the following issues to <ORG> under the National Environmental Appellate Authority Act The <ORG> shall also have all powers for obtaining data or technical advice as it may deem necessary from any source It shall give an opportunity to the parties or their counsel to file objections and lead such oral evidence or produce such documentary evidence as they may deem fit and shall also give a hearing to the appellant or its counsel to make submissions We have not thought it fit to go into this question and we have informed counsel that this issue could also be left to the said <ORG> to decide because we do not know whether any such trial runs would affect the environment or cause pollution We therefore refer the above issues to the above said Appellate <ORG> for its opinion and request the <ORG> to give its opinion as far as possible within the period above mentioned We further direct the <ORG> Pollution Control Board to communicate a copy of this judgment to all <ORG> and other authorities dealing with environment pollution ecology and forest and wildlife
