Two ancillary questions have also been raised by Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants namely i as to whether two strangers acquiring property jointly would come within the definition of person as contained in Section i of the Act and ii whether clause i of Section would be applicable in a case where the building did not exist on the appointed date In the said area as it appears from a letter dated issued from <ORG> Dev So far as the submission of Mr <NAME> to the effect that as on the appointed day no construction had been made on the land in question and only a building plan therefor has been sanctioned the exception contained in Section of the Act would not be applicable is concerned we may notice that clause i of Section excludes the land on which construction of a building is not permissible under the building regulations in force in the area in which such land is situated from the definition of vacant land By reason of the provisions contained in Section of the Act the <ORG> has defined the term vacant land For the purpose of determination of the ceiling limit as stated in sub section of Section of the Act a person must not only hold a vacant land but also must hold any other land on which there is a building with a dwelling unit therein which clearly goes to show that such other land on which there is a building for the purpose of sub section of Section must be a land other than a vacant land It is well settled that in construction of a statute an effort should be made to give effect to all the provisions contained therein In view of our discussions aforementioned it must be held that that the respondents having independent title to the property in question are entitled to the two separate units under the said Act despite the fact that no construction had been raised on appointed day they are entitled to the benefit under sub clause i of clause of sub section of the Act and for the purpose of determination of ceiling limit the area of the flats belonging to the respondents in Bombay would not be taken into consideration I thus agree with the conclusion arrived by <ORG>
