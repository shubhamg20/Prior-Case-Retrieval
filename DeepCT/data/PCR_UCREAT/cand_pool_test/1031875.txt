A list of employees who came to be regularised pursuant to orders made by this Court from time to time since after is appended as Annexure A We would therefore direct that Clause should be understood as taking into its fold a periodical year to year revision of the cadre strength and besides the estimated vacancies the additional vacancies on account of the increase in the cadre strength should become available for regularisation This would show that there are workmen on the work charged establishment who had joined between and who we believe if continuing in service would certainly be required by the departments concerned and could be considered for regularisation under the Scheme by an increase in the cadre strength Our emphasis is that while the <ORG> has to keep in view that financial constraints and the need for allocation of finances for development of projects it should also show concern for those who are working in different departments of the <ORG> so that at the end when they are relieved from service on their attaining the age of superannuation they may have something to fall back on That takes us to the question regarding the regularisation of muster roll employees
