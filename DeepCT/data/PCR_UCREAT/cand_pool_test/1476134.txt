For the purpose of agricultural income one had to look not merely to the definition in the Income tax Act but also to the rules made thereunder IX of hereinafter called the Amendment Act enacted by <ORG> is null and void and that the State power to tax income from tea to agricultural income tax is limited to taking of the income computed for the purpose of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Income tax Act as if it were income derived from business and for the issue of appropriate orders to the respondents viz The petitioner filed appeals against the three assessment orders dated August for assessment years and and dated October for assessment year before the Deputy Commissioner of Agricultural Income tax <NAME> Sub section of provides that this Act would be deemed to have come into force with effect on and from April The petitioner challenged the validity of the Amendment Act stating that it was not within the competence of <ORG> and that its provisions contravened the provisions of Arts The relevant portion of the definition of agricultural income in the Income tax Act reads agricultural income means a any rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes and is either assessed to land revenue in the taxable territories or subject to a local rate assessed and collected by officers of the Government as such any income derived from such land by i agriculture or ii the performance by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind of any process ordinarily employed by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind to render the produce raised or received by him fit to be taken to market or iii the sale by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind of the produce raised or received by him in respect of which no process has been performed other than a process of the nature described in sub clause ii The income derived from the sale of tea grown and manufactured by the seller is not solely derived from agriculture The income is partly derived from land by agriculture and partly from business Section of the Income tax Act provides for the making of rules for such determination The relevant portion of of the Income tax Act empowering <ORG> to make rules reads Without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such rules may a prescribe the manner in which and the procedure by which the income profits and gains shall be arrived at in the case of i incomes derived in part from agriculture and in part from business In cases coming under clause a of sub section where the income profits and gains liable to tax cannot be definitely ascertained or can be ascertained only with an amount of trouble and expense to the assessee which in the opinion of <ORG> is unreasonable the rules made under that sub section may a prescribe methods by which an estimate of such income profits and gains may be made and in cases coming under sub clause of clause a of sub section prescribe the proportion of the income which shall be deemed to be income profits and gains liable to tax and an assessment based on such estimate or proportion shall be deemed to be duly made in accordance with the provisions of this Act Rules made under this section shall be published in the official <ORG> and shall thereupon have effect as if enacted in this Act Rules made under the above quoted section provide for the determination of income for the purposes of income tax when the entire income is partially agricultural income and partially income chargeable to income tax under the head business Rule deals with the case of tea grown and manufactured by the seller and reads Income derived from the sale of tea grown and manufactured by the seller in the taxable territories shall be computed as if it were income derived from business and per cent of such income shall be deemed to be income profits and gains liable to tax Provided that in computing such income an allowance shall be made in respect of the cost of planting bushes in replacement of bushes that have died or become permanently useless in an area already planted unless such area has previously been abandoned The result of rule is that the income derived from the sale of tea grown and manufactured by the seller is to be computed in the first instance as if it was income derived from business Consequently the income would be computed in accordance with the provisions of of the Income tax Act It follows therefore that the power of <ORG> to make a law in respect of taxes on agricultural income arising from tea plantations will be limited to legislating with respect to the agricultural income so determined <ORG> is free in the exercise of its plenary legislative power to allow further deductions from such computed agricultural income as it considers fit but it cannot add to the amount of the agricultural income so computed by providing that certain items of expenditure deducted in the computation of the income from a business under the provisions of the Income tax Act be not deducted and be considered to be a part of the taxable agricultural income In this Act unless there is anything re pugnant in the subject or context a Agricultural income means any rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes any income derived from such land in the State by i agriculture or ii the performance by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind of any process ordinarily employed by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind to render the produce raised or received by him fit to be taken to market or iii the sale by a cultivator or receiver of rent in kind of the produce raised or received by him in respect of which no process has been performed other than a process of the nature described in sub clause ii Explanation Agricultural income derived from such land by the cultivation of tea means that portion of the income derived from the cultivation manufacture and sale of tea as is defined to be agricultural income for the pur poses of the enactments relating to Indian Income tax This definition practically conforms to the definition of agricultural income in sub cls of cl a of of the Agricultural Incometax Act which provides a special definition for agricultural income for tea plantations such income being that portion of the income derived from land by the cultivation manufacture and sale of tea as is defined to be agricultural income for the purposes of the enactments relating to Indian Income tax Though wide in terms Explanation to should therefore be construed not to apply to the computation of agricultural income derived from land by the cultivation of tea It is true as urged for the respondents that <ORG> has full freedom to enact such provisions as it considers fit in respect of tax on agricultural income and that such power includes the power to enact for matters subsidiary and incidental to the taxation of agricultural income We also agree that <ORG> is free to provide the method of computation of the taxable agricultural income and is free to allow any particular deductions from the gross income as it considers fit It is not disputed for the respondent that the power of <ORG> to enact a law in respect of agricultural income relates only to such agricultural income as is defined in Art It is however urged that for the purpose of this definition one has to look to the definition of agricultural income in the Income tax Act and not to the rules made thereunder Rule of the Income tax Rules has been made under the powers conferred by of the Income tax Act and has effect as if enacted in that Act It has been further submitted for the respondents that cl xv of sub of of the Income tax Act is a general provision and should give way to the special provision of the Agricultural Income tax Act with respect to the deductions from the gross income for the purpose of computing the agricultural income We therefore allow these petitions to this extent that we declare that Explanation to of the Agricultural Income tax Act added by the Amendment Act does not cover the expenses incurred in the upkeep or maintenance of immature tea plants from which no income has been derived during an accounting year and that the agricultural income derived from tea plantations will be computed in accordance with the provisions of the Income tax Act and the Income tax Rules We direct the respondents to pay the costs of petitioner No on eset
