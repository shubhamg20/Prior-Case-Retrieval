According to the assessee it was in a position to offer services to licence on and from October The Income tax Officer rejected the assessee claim on the ground that it had not started or commenced its business in the year of account according to the Income tax Officer the assessee company commenced business only from May the day on which it gave on leave and licence part of the said building Thereafter the matter was carried in further appeal to the <ORG> and the <ORG> upheld the orders of the revenue authorities and dismissed the appeal field up by the assessee company Thereafter at the instance of the assessee the question set out hereinabove has been referred to us for our opinion In order to appreciate the contentions both of the assessee company and of the revenue authorities it is necessary to refer to some of the objects of the company as set out in the memorandum of association Thus from these different parts of the objects clause in the memorandum of association of the assessee company it clearly emerges that the main object of the company was to acquire immovable properties and to give residential or in the alternative business accommodations either for office purposes or in the alternative business accommodation either for office purposes or for storage purposes with all appurtenant amenities including the amenities of storage watch and ward facilities canteens refreshments rooms etc From the materials on record it clearly emerges that a residential bungalow or a part of a residential bungalow together with the lands appurtenant to the said portion was purchased by the assessee company and whatever building repairs rewiring installation of lift etc was carried on was done by the assessee company for the purpose of converting residential accommodation to business and storage accommodation and to render these premises more serviceable to its prospective licensees or lessees Even as it stood on the date of the purchase by the assessee company the building was capable of being used for residential accommodation and one of the objects of the company was to let out residential accomodation together with all appurtenant facilities etc The question that we have to ask ourselves is at what could the assessee be said to have completed its preparations for rendering these services available that being the main object with which it was incorporated and thus be in a position to commence business in connection with cement factory Loosely it may be said that the business of the assessee was manufacture and sale of cement But in determining question arising under fiscal legislation loose use of expression often tends to confound the real issue To determine what was the business of the assessee we must consider what are the activities which constituted such business without being misguided by loose expression of vague and indefinite import Applying the same test to the present assessee company loosely it may be said that the business of the assessee company in the case before us was to let out residential or office accommodation together with all appurtenant services making the garden facilities available and making the kitchen and canteen facilities available was also part of its business and once the kitchen facilities garden facilities and others were available and were made available it can be said that the business activities of the company were started Hence in each such case what is required to be done is to determine what was the business of the assessee and in particular what are the activities which constituted such business When a business is established and is ready to commence business then it can be said of that business that it is set up but before it is ready to commence business it is not set up There may however be an interval between the setting up of the business and the commencement of the business and all expenses incurred during that interval would be a permissible deduction In Commissioner of Wealth tax <ORG> the question before <ORG> was in the context of section xxi of the Wealth tax Act which provided that it a new and separate unit is set up after the commencement of the Act by a company established with the object of carrying on an industrial undertaking in India that portion of the net wealth of the company which is employed by it in such unit would be excludible in computing the net wealth of the company There the question which arose for decision before <ORG> was whether the factory of the assessee could be said to have been set up after the commencement of the Act so as to entitle the assessee to exclusion of that portion of the net wealth which was employed in the factory and thus the observation of the supreme court regarding the setting up of a concern or a unit have to be read in the context of the Wealth tax Act and not in the context of the Income tax Act The business must be put into such a shape that it can start functioning as a business or a manufacturing organization It must be pointed out as is clear from <ORG> Ltd that the main question before <ORG> was whether on the finding of the <ORG> that the business of the assessee had been set up in the previous year was unreasonable or contrary to evidence or based on so evidence at all Therefore the main question which was considered by <ORG> in that case was the question of appreciation of evidence on record and to find out whether there was evidence to support the conclusion that the business of the assessee had been set up in the previous year or whether the finding of the <ORG> that it had been set up in the previous year was unreasonable or contrary to evidence in these terms That decision raised the question as to when a certain business carried on by the assessee could be said to have been set up whether it was set up prior to st March or subsequent to that date and the Division Bench proceeded to observe We fail to see how a decision given on one set of facts can bind us to reach a similar decision on a totally different set of facts There is nothing in this decision which would deflect us from the view of which we are otherwise inclined to take at page of the report it is observed It is necessary in order to determine this question to consider what constituted the business of the assessee Loosely it may be said that the business of the assessee was manufacture and sale of cement But in determining questions arising under fiscal legislation loose use of expression often tends to confound the real issue To determine what was the business of the assessee we must consider what are the activities which constituted such business without being misguided by loose expressions of vague and indefinite import The activities which constituted the business of the assessee were divisible into three categories The first category considered of the activity of extraction of limestone by quarrying leased area of land This activity was necessary for the purpose of acquiring raw material to be utilised in manufacture of cement The second category comprised the activity of manufacture of cement by user of the plant and machinery set up for the purpose and The third category consisted of the activity of selling manufactured cement These three activities combined together constituted the business of the assessee Each one of these activities was as much essential for the purpose of carrying on the business of the assessee as the others Why then can it not be said that the assessee commenced its business when it started the first of these activities The activity of quarrying the leased area of land and extracting limestone from it was as much an activity in the course of carrying on the business as the other two activities of manufacture of cement and sale of manufactured cement This activity came first in point of time and laid the foundation for the second activity when completed laid the foundations for the third activity It may be that the whole business was not set up when the activity of quarrying the leased area of land and extracting limestone was started But as pointed out above business is nothing more than a continuous course of activities and all the activities which go to make up the business need not be started simultaneously in order that the business may commence The business would commence when the activity which is first in point of time and which must necessarily precede the other activities is started Take for example a case where an assessee engages in the business of a trader which consists of purchasing and selling goods The assessee must necessarily purchase goods in order to be able to sell them and purchase of goods must therefore necessarily precede their sale Can it be said in such a case that when the assessee purchase goods for the purpose of sale he does not commence his business Is it necessary that he must start the activity of selling goods before he can said to have commenced his business We have to consider the question as to when an assessee can be said to have commenced business from a commonsense point of view We have to ask ourselves the question as to when a business would regard a business as being commenced Would he not consider a business as having commenced when an essential activity of that business is started The argument of the revenue seeks to confound the commencement of a business with the establishment of the business as a whole and carrying on of all the activities of the business Applying the same reasoning to the facts of the case before us the business activities of the assessee company can also be said to fall into three broad categories The first business activity is to acquire either by purchase or by any other manner immovable property so that the property can be ultimately given out either on leave and licence basis or on lease to others together with the appurtenant services The second category of the business activity is to put these buildings accomodation and lands and gardens into proper shape and set up the appurtenant services so that ultimately the property can be given out on leave and licence basis and the third business activity is actually to give out on lease or on leave and licence basis were acquired by purchases or otherwise lift was installed and ultimately with effect from May a portion of the accomodation was actually given out on licence basis at the fee of Rs We are unable to see how the principles laid down in <ORG> case cannot be said to have any bearing on the facts of the present case Under these circumstances it is clear that any rate from October the assessee can be said to have commenced its business activity of the second category and therefore the assessee company had commenced business and all expenses incurred by the assessee company between October and March namely the amount of Rs We therefore answer the question referred to us in the affirmative and in favour of the assessee The Commissioner will pay the costs of this reference to the assessee
