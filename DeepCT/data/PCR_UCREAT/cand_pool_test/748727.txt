HEADNOTE <ORG> was a private limited company Carrying On business as printers and publishers of certain newspapers Held i The second proviso to vii of the Act would only apply to the sale of such machinery which was used for the purpose of business during the accounting year In order to bring the sale proceeds to charge under the second proviso the following conditions shall be fulfilled During the entire previous year or a part of it the business shall have been carried on by the assessee the machinery shall have been used in the business and the machinery shall have been sold when the business was being carried on and not for the purpose of closing it down or winding it up On the facts of this case it was held that the sale of the machinery in the instant case having taken place after the business was closed and during the winding up proceedings therefore it would fall outside the scope of the said proviso and thus the first item i the sum of Rs May The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SUBBA RAO This appeal by special leave is preferred against the order of <ORG> in a reference made to it by <ORG> under of the Income tax Act hereinafter called the Act <ORG> hereinafter called <ORG> was a private limited company carrying on business as printers and publishers of certain newspapers namely <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> at Madras <ORG> and <ORG> at Calcutta and <ORG> and Morning Standard at Bombay The present appeal is preferred against the said judgment of <ORG> The argument in the appeal proceeded on the basis of the following facts During the accounting year <ORG> did not do the business of printing and publishing newspapers from September and thereafter the assessee company alone was carrying on the said business On those facts learned counsel for the <ORG> raised before us the following two contentions The first item of Rs Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely iv in respect of insurance against risk of damage or destruction of buildings machinery plant furniture stocks or stores used for the purposes of the business profession or vocation the amount of any premium paid in respect of current repairs to such buildings machinery plant or furniture the amount paid on account thereof vii in respect of any such building machinery or plant which has been sold or discarded or demolished or destroyed the amount by which the written down value thereof exceeds the amount for which the building machinery or plant as the case may be is actually sold or its scrap value Provided further that where the amount for which any such building machinery or plant is sold whether during the continuance of the business or after the cessation thereof exceeds the written down value so much of the excess as does not exceed the difference between the original cost and the written down value shall be deemed to be profits of the previous year in which the sale took place We are concerned with the second proviso to vii of the Act The substantive clause grants a balancing allowance in respect of building machinery or plant which has been sold or discarded or demolished or destroyed Under the proviso if the sale price exceeds the written down value but does not exceed the original cost price the difference between the original cost and the written down value shall be deemed to be profits of the year previous to that in which the sale takes place that is to say the difference between the price fetched at the sale and the written down value is deemed to be the escaped profits for which the assessee is made liable to tax As the sale price is higher than the written down value the difference represents the excess depreciation mistakenly granted to the assessee If the machinery is sold for Rs If it had not been allowed that amount would have swelled the profits to that extent The second proviso therefore in substance brings to charge an escaped profit or gain of the business carried on by the assessee Under of the Act income tax shall be charged for any year in accordance with and subject to the provi sions of the Act in respect of the total income of the previous year of every assessee under one of the heads of taxable income is profits and gains of business profession or vocationl under the tax under that head is payable in respect of profit or gains of any business carried on by the assessee during the accounting year If the profit or gains were not earned when the business was being carried on by the assessee during the accounting year they would fall outside the provision of For instance if the machinery sold after the business was closed or when the business was under liquidation it would not be appropriate to hold that the profit or gains earned by the sale were in respect of the business that was being carried on by the assessee The result is that the second proviso will only apply to the sale of such machinery which was used for the purpose of the business during the accounting year shall be fulfilled During the entire previous year or a part of it the business shall have been carried on by the assessee the machinery shall have been used in the business and the machinery shall have been sold when the business was being carried on and not for the purpose of closing it down or winding it up If these were the conditions for the applicability of the said proviso the sale of the machinery in the instant case having taken place after the business was closed and during the winding up proceedings it would fall outside the scope of the said proviso and therefore the first item is not assessable to tax This point directly arose for consideration in <ORG> Commissioner of <ORG> Bihar There the assessee company carried on the business of growing sugarcane and manufacturing and selling sugar This Court rejected the contention of the <ORG> that the said excess was taxable on two grounds namely the sale of the machinery and plant was not an operation in furtherance of the business carried on by the company but was a realisation of its assets in the process of gradual winding up of its business which eventually It is said that the con dition that the sale of the machinery at a loss should have been before the closing of the business is impliedly laid down by of the Act which applies equally to cl vii as well as to the second proviso thereto and that if the condition need not be fulfilled in the case falling under the substantive part of cl vii of of the Act it will be incongruous to apply it to a case falling under the second proviso before it was amended wherein it was stated that mere realisation of assets is not trading and that there was distinction between sales forming part of the trading activities and those where the realisation was not an act of trading the learned Judge observed that the said distinction was a sound one It is conceded that it does not represent profits and gains of business but it falls under the heading capital gains Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely Section Where an assessee sustains a loss such as is referred to in sub section A and the loss cannot be wholly set off in accordance with the provisions of that sub section the portion not so set off shall be carried forward to the following year and set off against capital gains for that year and if it cannot be so set off the amount thereof not so set off shall be carried forward to the following year and so on so however that no such loss shall be carried forward for more than eight years Provided that where the loss sustained by an assessee not being a company in any previous year does not exceed five thousand rupees it shall not be carried forward Under as we have already pointed out the necessary condition for the application of the section is that the assessee should have carried on the business for some part of the accounting year Section indicates the manner of assessment of the income profits and gains of any business profession or vocation It only says that if there is a succession to a person carrying on business during an accounting year the person succeeded and the person succeeding can each of them be assessed in respect of his actual share The proviso deals with a case where the person succeeded cannot be found in that event the assessment of the profits of the year in which the succession took place upto the date of the succession and for the year preceding that year shall be made on the person succeeding him Under that section the tax shall be payable by the assessee under the head capital gains in respect of any profits or gains arising from the sale of a capital asset effected during the Prescribed period He asks that if deals with only profits and gains of the business why should the <ORG> use the word income therein As we have indicated the expression income profits and gains is a compendious term to connote the income from the various sources mentioned in therefore the use of such an expression does not efface the distinction between the different heads but only describes the income from the business In the result we agree with <ORG> in regard to the answer it has given in respect of the second question In this view no other question arises for our consideration
