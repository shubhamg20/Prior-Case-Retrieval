The learned Subordinate Judge observes that it was virtually admitted and was proved that no notice to quit was ever served on defendant No who was all along ignored though his brothers were treated as tenants and that he was subsequently added as a defendant in the suit The facts of that case are that the plaintiff gomosta had sent to each of the defendants by registered letters addressed to them at their addresses duplicates of the notices signed by all the plaintiffs The <NAME> however held upon the evidence that there was no proof of service of notice to quit on any of the defendants other than defendants Nos and Their Lordships of <ORG> examined the evidence on the point on the record and in their Lordships view the evidence of delivery of notice to quit on all the principal defendants was adequately proved and constituted good service on them within the meaning of Section Transfer of Property Act The personal tender or delivery may take place anywhere the vicarious tender or delivery must take place at the residence of the person intended to be bound by the notice The procedure in the case of joint tenants is that each is intended to be bound and it has long ago been decided that service of a notice to quit upon one joint tenant is prima facie evidence that it has reached the other joint tenants Reading the section as it stands without any help of the comments upon it by decided cases it is manifest that it was the intention of the legislature that the notice must be served on the person who is intended to be bound by it The section does not make any exception or lay down any special or peculiar procedure in the case of joint tenants one of the oases referred to by <ORG> an oral notice to quit was given by the landlord to one of the two brothers who were joint tenants The suit in ejectment was resisted by the defendants on the ground that the time allowed by law was not observed and that parol notice on one was not binding on the other That case is therefore no authority for the view that if no notice is addressed to one of the joint tenants the mere service of notice upon the other joint tenant is a sufficient notice according to law In the present case the learned Subordinate Judge has come to a finding of fact on evidence that there was no service or tender of notice to defendant No nor was any notice addressed to him
