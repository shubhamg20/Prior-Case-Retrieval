I shall proceed on the basis assumed in the order of reference that the question that has arisen relates to execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree within the meaning of Section and that all that we are asked is whether such a question arose between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed or their representatives In this Court therefore the conflict of opinion on the point is such that one could not say that there is a clear preponderance of authority in support of one view rather than the other has ruled contrary to the view of the law as laid down by the Calcutta and Allahabad <ORG>es Nor can there be any doubt that the word representative was intended to have a wider meaning than legal representative I think some light can be obtained on this question if we find out in what matters the purchaser of the interest of the judgment debtor in property sold in execution can apply to the executing <ORG> for redress or can be proceeded against in that <ORG> If such a person is in possession of the property the <ORG> executing the decree cannot dispossess him and his right to establish his title by a separate suit is expressly recognised By Rule an application to set aside a sale by depositing the purchase money may be made by any person owning the property or holding an interest in the property under a title acquired before sale and such an application would clearly be one between the judgment debtor or a person who has acquired his interest on the one hand and the decree holder and the purchaser under the decree on the other By Rule an application to set aside the sale on the ground of irregularity may be made by the decree holder or any person entitled to rateable distribution or a person whose interests are affected by the sale and to such an application the purchaser would clearly be a necessary party and questions arising under the application may have to be determined between him and the decree holder or the judgment debtor as the case may be The purchaser may himself apply to have the sale set aside on the ground that the judgment debtor had no saleable interest and only on questions raised under Rules or being decided in favour of the purchaser that the sale will be confirmed If the holder of a decree for possession of immoveable property or the purchaser of any such property sold in execution of a decree is obstructed in obtaining possession that is a matter to be investigated by the executing <ORG> If the resistance or obstruction is by the judgment debtor or by a transferee from him after the institution of the suit in which the decree was passed in that case the question is to be decided finally in execution On the other hand if the obstructor is a bonafide claimant claiming under a title independent of the judgment debtor then as already mentioned he would have a right to sue in spite of the decision in execution I may here also refer to Section which says that Save as otherwise provided by this code or by any law for the time being in force where any proceeding may be taken or application made by or against any person then the proceeding may be taken or the application may be made by or against any person claiming under him It seems to me that the purchaser of property in execution of a decree may well be said to claim under the decree holder for the purposes of proceedings under Section in which his rights are affected I do not see how the case of a purchaser in execution of a decree can well be distinguished on principle On the other hand where the interest of the purchaser of property either in execution of the same decree or of another decree is affected by any question raised in execution by the holder of the decree under execution the purchaser is entitled to defend his interest as a person claiming under the judgment debtor As has been pointed out time after time by <ORG> as well as by <ORG> Section corresponding to the old Section should be interpreted in as liberal a spirit as the language would reasonably admit of It is a well known principle that a purchaser in a <ORG> sale represents the judgment debtor to the extent of the right title and interest as he had in the property purchased at the date of sale and represents the execution creditor in so far as he had a right to bring such right title and interest to sale in satisfaction of the decree Their Lordships in laying down the law in these terms observed that as the respondent was not represented before them they had examined the rulings of <ORG> for themselves and they also mention that Mr <NAME> who appeared for the appellant admitted before them that it was the common practice to make the auction purchaser a party to an application for setting aside an execution sale in that case the appellant wanted by a suit to have the judicial sale of the Zamindari set aside on the ground of fraud on the part of the decree holder and it was held that the question was determinable by virtue of Section only by an order of the <ORG> executing the decree and not by a separate suit No doubt their Lordships do not say that the auction purchaser would be a representative of either the judgment debtor or the decree holder within the meaning of Section but they clearly intended to lay down that as a party most interested in the result he would be entitled to be heard in any application under Section and that if the question was one of the character described therein i relating to the execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree then it must be determined by a proceeding under that section in which the auction purchaser must be joined The law therefore in my opinion is that a person who has bought the property of the defendant in a suit since the institution of that suit whether at a court auction held in execution of a money decree passed in another suit or by private purchase is entitled and bound to have any question relating to the execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree decided under Section by the court executing the decree when his interest is affected either by the decree itself or by the sale held in execution of that decree and the same rule applies to a purchaser of the property under such sale whether he is the decree holder himself or a stranger Whether the purchaser in the one case or the auction purchaser in the other is to be regarded as the representative of the judgment debtor or the decree holder depends upon the nature of the question raised and who the contesting party is In fact there was in that case as I understand it no attempt to decide whether he had one and if the judgment in <NAME> <NAME> I Bom The Committee regarded it as sufficient to attract the application of Section that a question relating to execution had arisen between the parties to the decree without reference to the purchaser inclusion in the proceedings It is therefore unnecessary to answer the third question referred directly or otherwise than by saying that the inclusion of the auction purchaser as a party to proceedings relating to an auction sale does not make Section inapplicable to them It is not suggested that they can be regarded as the representatives of the holder of the decree under execution in the present proceedings since he had no connection with the <ORG> sale and private sale under which they claim It does not seem to me that any detailed discussion of the numerous decisions enumerated in the judgment just delivered is called for since the conflict between them is for the most part beyond reconciliation On two points however there is a distinct preponderance of authority in this <ORG> and I therefore take it as settled law that the representative mentioned in Section is not to be identified with a legal representative as defined in Section and that a purchaser at <ORG> auction represents some one i either the judgment debtor or the decree holder As regards money decrees it seems to me very difficult if not impossible to imagine a case in which the purchaser can become the representative of the decree holder the question arose regarding a purchaser from the decree holder purchaser at the <ORG> sale and in that case and <NAME> <NAME> the <ORG> sale was held under the decree in the execution of which the application of Section was proposed When it does it seems to me that his character as decree holder in one execution can have no effect on his position in another and that there is nothing in authority or on principle to debar us from treating him like any other stranger to the latter no reason appearing for according him any other rights than a stranger purchaser from the judgment debtor whether by execution or private sale would acquire I would answer the second question referred accordingly He obtained a preliminary decree on the th of September The present appeals are by the representatives of the purchaser under the money decree against the order of <ORG> directing possession to be given to the purchasers under the mortgage decree It was under these circumstances the three questions have been referred for the opinion of <ORG> Upon one question there was no contest It was conceded by the counsel for the respondent that where the equity of redemption is purchased under a money decree in matters relating to execution of a mortgage decree the auction purchaser under the money decree will be the representative of the judgment debtor in the mortgage decree Although the point was not expressly decided by the Board I respectfully concur with the view taken in Calcutta that that decision is authority for the proposition enunciated On principle it seems to me that this latter view is wrong But he argued with much ingenuity that the suit was not barred by the provisions of Section because the question concerned the auction purchasers as much as anybody the italics are mine and therefore as he contended it could not properly be described as a question arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed This statement shows that what the courts have to see is whether the issues arising for decision relate a to execution to deciding rival rights of the decree holder and of the judgment debtor in the subject matter If we turn to the language of Section which corresponds to Section of the Code of the same result would appear to follow The section lays down only two conditions which have been insisted on by <ORG> there are observations of Sir <NAME> which may be regarded as enunciating the same principle I would therefore answer all the questions referred to us by saying that if the points for decision in an application before the executing <ORG> relate to the rival rights of the decree holder and of the judgment debtor and also relate to execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree it should be dealt with in execution and not by separate suit
