The facts which give rise to this reference can be shortly stated as under The respondent assessee was a registered partnership firm consisting of two partners at the relevant time He therefore issued a show cause notice contemplated by section of the Act for the purpose of giving an opportunity to the assessee of being heard on the question why the revisional powers contemplated by section of the Act should not be exercised it claimed two deductions one was of the sum of Rs The assessment order passed by the Income tax Officer under section of the Act is found at annexure A and on its perusal it does not show that the Income tax Officer had given any treatment to both these deductions It transpires from the record the originally Dr <NAME> was believed to be the benamidar of the above referred firm of <ORG> The final deed transferring the banakhat rights in favour of <ORG> was dated st October was paid to <ORG> It was for this reason that the assessee had claimed the deduction of this amount of Rs The Additional Commissioner of Income tax after knowing the contents of this affidavit checked up the record and ultimately came to the conclusion that revisional proceedings contemplated by section of the Act should be undertaken was concerned the same was claimed by the assessee on the ground that he had to pay this amount on account of the building structure which was standing on the land in question lakhs being profit paid to an intermediary <ORG> It appears <ORG> purported to have acquired banakhat right form one Dr <NAME> who has been described as benamidar of <ORG> in the document dated October and registered on October which was executed between four parties including your firm In view of these allegations the Commissioner proposed the action under section in the following terms I therefore intend to make an order under section cancelling the assessment order of the Income tax Officer with a direction to him to make a fresh assessment according to law after making full inquiry and giving necessary opportunity of being heard The above facts further show that the above referred show cause notice was issued by the Commissioner on certain factual data which he has in his possession at the relevant time We should therefore be given opportunity to do so on any date convenient to your honour to establish that the department has no prima facie case either to pass order as contemplated or set aside the assessment on unwarranted facts Ultimately the Commissioner passed his final order under section which is found at annexure In this order he also directed the Income tax Officer to give the assessee proper opportunity to prove its case including the cross examination of Dr <NAME> as desired by it After quoting the provisions of section the <ORG> finally disposal of the matter with the following observations In our reading of this provision the Commissioner of Income tax can pass an order only if he considers that any order passed by an Income tax Officer is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue It is thus evident from these observations of the <ORG> that the <ORG> allowed the appeal of the assessee only on the ground that the Commissioner has not come to any firm conclusions and had set aside the original assessment only on substantial doubts Being aggrieved by this decision of the <ORG> the revenue has preferred this reference in which the following question has been referred to us for our opinion Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was justified in law in setting aside the order of the Additional Commissioner of Income tax made under section on the ground that the Additional Commissioner of Income tax had not come to a firm conclusion that the order by the Income tax Officer was erroneous in so far as it was prejudicial to the interests of revenue <NAME> who appeared on behalf of the revenue has contended that the <ORG> was mistaken in taking a view that at the time of passing the final order under section in Commissioner is always expected to come to a firm conclusion with regard to the facts of the case According to <NAME> the nature of the conclusions which the Commissioner is expected to reach at the time of passing final order under section ultimately depends upon the order which he eventually passes under the said section and in cases where the matter is sent back to the Income tax Officer with direction for fresh assessment it would be in a given case sufficient if the Commissioner comes to some prima facie conclusions As against this the contention raised by <NAME> on behalf of the assessee was that it was the duty of the Commissioner to come to a firm and final conclusion about the controversial points before him and therefore merely because the Commissioner entertains some doubts about the controversial points it would not be proper to set aside a concluded assessment and to send the matter back with a direction for fresh assessment This facts will also be helpful in deciding whether the Commissioner was in any doubt as regards the controversial points raised before him at the time of making the final order We shall first refer to the contents of the affidavit filed by Dr <NAME> on March as found from the order passed by the Commissioner under section <NAME> and <NAME> and the document also stated that whenever they asked him to transfer the same back to whomsoever they desired he had to sign that about a month later when other instalment of Rs was to be paid two documents known as kutcha banakhat one between himself and <NAME> was signed and the other between himself and <ORG> as the benami of Shri <NAME> and <NAME> regarding <ORG> through he got knowledge of the same company on the last date of signing the final document in October and on reading the document he questioned the partners of <ORG> what is the necessity of forming so called <ORG> and they told him that according to kutcha banakhat he had to sign whatever document they asked to sign regarding lease on the same land and <ORG> as far as he knew consisted of the brothers wives and father in law and brother in law of the two partners viz Shri <NAME> and <NAME> that as confirmed that prior to the date on which the final lease deed was executed in October he did not know anything about <ORG> that he did not receive any single pie from <ORG> or their partners and only the loan of Rs It is also significant to note that the firm called <ORG> comprises nine partners including two lady partners seven and eight viz It is also seen from clause of the lease deed dated October that though <ORG> is mentioned as the party to the deed the condition of the banakhat provide that the assessee was to pay Rs Important facts which are very material for appreciating the controversial points raised by the parties in this reference are that the Income tax Officer at the time of carrying out original assessment did not care to probe further into the details as regards the constitution of the firm of <ORG> Had he done so he would have at once known that this firm came into existence only on the date on which the last document in favour of <ORG> was executed by the assessee and that it was constituted by very near relatives of the two partners of the assessee firm Now if in the light of these facts we consider the provisions of section we find that the order passed by the Commissioner setting aside the original assessment and directing the fresh assessment by the Income tax Officer is completely in conformity with the provisions of the section Sub section of section which is relevant for our purpose is in the following terms The Commissioner may call for and examine the record of any proceeding under this Act and if he considers that any order passed therein by the Income tax Officer is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue he may after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard and after making or causing to be made such inquiry as he deems necessary pass such order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the assessment and directing a fresh assessment Therefore unless these three conditions are satisfied namely that he should call for and examine the record of the proceedings in question he should consider that the order passed by the Income tax Officer is erroneous and that the order passed by the Income tax Officer is prejudicial to the interests of the revenue the Commissioner has no jurisdiction to initiate any revisional proceedings We respectfully agree with these observations We therefore conclude that the initiation of action taken by the Commissioner under section was quite proper Second step which is contemplated by section is to issue show cause notice There is no dispute about this step because it is an admitted position that the assessee has been given an opportunity of being heard and the final order which is passed by the Commissioner was passed only after hearing it Now after reading the relevant portion of sub section of section we do not find any justification for the view that in every case the Commissioner is expected to make an inquiry before passing the final order The concluding portion of this sub section of section shows that the Commissioner can pass various orders such as enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the assessment and directing a fresh assessment But here the Commissioner has not himself passed any final order as regards the assessment There is nothing in the section itself which would justify such a view because on the question of inquiry the section specifically says that that inquiry should be as deemed necessary by the Commissioner <ORG> ultimately held that in such a case the assessee would have full opportunity of showing to the Income tax Officer whether the income assessed in the assessment orders which were originally passed was correct or not and therefore the assessee could not be said to have been denied an opportunity of showing cause against the grounds and materials and the rules of natural justice were not violated In view of this we find that considering the facts of this case the Commissioner was not bound to make any inquiry before passing the final order and that in substance no prejudice is caused to the assessee by failure of the Commissioner to give it any opportunity to cross examine Dr <NAME> Next question is whether at the time of passing the final order the Commissioner was bound to record final conclusion Now even on this question we find that there is nothing in section to show that before passing the final order under that section the Commissioner must necessarily and in all cases record final conclusions about the points in controversy before him As already noted by us above we would have expected him to record final conclusions which he thought proper if he was to settle the assessment finally but since he has not settled the assessment finally but since he was not settled the assessment finally and has preferred to direct the Income tax Officer to make an order for fresh assessment it was proper that he did not express any final conclusions and recorded only prima facie conclusions at which he had arrived with reference to the facts of the case Here it should be noted that as the assessment was to be freshly made by the Income tax Officer the only proper course for the Commissioner was not to express any final opinion as regards the controversial points The facts of that case were that the only ground upon which action was taken by the Commissioner under section of the Act of was that the Income tax Officer did not apply his mind to the claim of the assessee as contained in part of the return Since in the opinion of <ORG> the Commissioner failed in finding that the erroneous order passed by the Income tax Officer was against the interest of the revenue <ORG> concluded that the order passed by the Commissioner in setting aside the original assessment was wrong
