DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH RAMASWAMY BENCH RAMASWAMY KULDIP SINGH RAMASWAMI II CITATION SCR SCC JT SCALE ACT Constitution of India Articles and Right of private employer to terminate service under certified standing order without holding any domestic enquiry Whether violative of principles of natural justice and fundamental rights Held Since termination of service results in deprivation of right to livelihood it is to be effected in accordance with just fair and reasonable procedure HEADNOTE The respondent company terminated the appellant services on the ground that since he had willingly absented from duty continuously for more than days from December without leave or prior information of intimation or previous permission of the management he had been deemed to have left the service of the company on his own and lost the lien and the appointment with effect from December It held that the appellant had failed to prove his case that the action of the respondent was in accordance with the Standing Orders and it was not a termination nor retrenchment under the Industrial Disputes Act and that the appellant in terms of Standing Orders lost his lien on his appointment and was not entitled to reinstatement But it is not correct to say that expiry of eight days absence from duty brings about automatic loss of lien on the post and nothing more need be done by the management to pass an order terminating the service and per force termination is automatic In the instant case admittedly the management did not conduct any domestic enquiry nor gave the appellant any opportunity to put forth his case <ORG> did not record any findings on the appellant plea that despite his reporting to duty on December and on all subsequent days and readiness to join duty he was prevented from reporting to duty nor he was permitted to sign the attendance register but held that the management had power under clause of the Certified Standing Orders to terminate the service of the appellant No decision must be taken which will affect the right of any person without first being informed of the case and be given him her an opportunity of putting forward his her case The procedure prescribed for depriving a person of livelihood must meet the challenge of Article of the Constitution and such law would be liable to be tested on the anvil of Article The procedure prescribed by a statute or statutory rule or rules or orders affecting the civil rights or result in civil consequences would have to answer the requirement of the Article Therefore the principles of natural justice are part of Article and the procedure prescribed by law must be right just fair and reasonable and not arbitrary fanciful or oppressive When it is interpreted that the colour and content of procedure established by law must be in conformity with the minimum fairness and processual justice it would relieve legislative callousness despising opportunity of being heard and fair opportunities of defence The order of termination of the service of an employee workman visits with civil consequences of jeopardising not only his her livelihood but also career and livelihood of dependents Therefore before taking any action putting an end to the tenure of an employee workman fair play requires that a reasonable opportunity to put forth his case is given and domestic enquiry conducted complying with the principles of natural justice These rules operate in the area not covered by law validly made or expressly excluded The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is against the award of <ORG> Haryana at Faridabad dated April which was published in <ORG> on August The workman not reporting for duty within calander days as mentioned above shall be deemed to have automatically abandoned the services and lost his lien on his appointment He has to give a satisfactory explanation to the Manager Management of his reasons for absence or inability to return to the duty on the expiry of the leave On completion of eight calander days absence from duty he shall be deemed to have abandoned the services and lost his lien on his appointment Section prescribes mandatory procedure to be followed before the retrenchment becomes valid and legal and violation thereof visits with invalida tion of the action with consequential results SCC the Constitution Bench considered the scope of the word retrenchment defined by oo and held in para at page that analysing the definition of retrenchment in Section oo we find that termination by the employer of the service of a workman would not otherwise have covered the cases excluded in Clauses a and namely voluntary retirement and retirement on reaching the stipulated age of retirement or on the grounds of continued ill health SCC took the same view Therefore we find force in the contention of Sri <NAME> the learned Senior counsel for the appellant that the definition retrenchment in oo is a comprehensive one intended to cover any action of the management to put an end to the employment of an employee for any reason whatsoever His contention that expiry of eight days absence from duty brings about automatic loss of lien on the post and nothing more need be done by the management to pass an order terminating the service and per force termination is automatic bears no substance This court lifted the veil and looked beyond the apparent tenor of the order and its effect These rules operate in the area not covered by law validly made or expressly excluded as held in Col It is settled law that certified standing orders have statutory force which do not expressly exclude the application of the principles of natural justice The cardinal point that has to be borne in mind in every case is whether the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case and the authority should act fairly justly reasonably and impartially <NAME> It is a fundamental rule of law that no decision must be taken which will affect the right of any person without first being informed of the case and be given him her an opportunity of putting forward his her case The person concerned must be informed of the case the evidence in support thereof supplied and must be given a fair opportunity to meet the case before an adverse decision is taken SCR another bench of seven judges held that the substantive and procedural laws and action taken under them will have to pass the test under Art The procedure prescribed must be just fair and reasonable even though there is no specific provision in a statute or rules made thereunder for showing cause against action proposed to be taken against an individual which affects the right of that individual The duty to give reasonable opportunity to be heard will be implied from the nature of the function to be performed by the authority which has the power to take punitive or damaging action The law must therefore be now taken to be well settled that procedure prescribed for depriving a person of livelihood must meet the challenge of Art and the procedure prescribed by a statute or statutory rule or rules or orders effecting the civil rights or result in civil consequences would have to answer the requirement of Art When it is interpreted that the colour and content of procedure established by law must be in conformity with the minimum fairness and processual justice it would relieve legislative callousness despising opportu nity of being heard and fair opportunities of defence and the procedure prescribed by law must be just fair and reasonable All matters relating to employment includes the right to continue in service till the employee reaches superannuation or until his service is duly terminated in accordance with just fair and reasonable procedure prescribed under the provisions of the constitution and the rules made under the provisions of the constitution and the rules made under proviso to Art They must be conformable to the rights guaranteed in Part III and IV of the Constitution guarantees right to life which includes right to livelihood the deprivation thereof must be in accordance with just and fair procedure prescribed by law conformable to Arts The power to terminate the service of an employee workman in accordance with just fair and reasonable procedure is an essential inbuilt of natural justice The order of termination of the service of an employee workman visits with civil consequences of jeopardising not only his her livelihood but also career and livelihood of dependents Therefore before taking any action putting an end to the tenure of an employee workman fair play requires that a reasonable opportunity to put forth his case is given and domestic enquiry conducted complying with the principles of natural justice The order terminating the service of the employees was set aside In this case admittedly no opportunity was given to the appellant and no enquiry was held It concluded that the management had power under Cl of the certified Standing Orders to terminate with the service of the appellant The management did not conduct any domestic enquiry nor given the appellant any opportunity to put forth his case The parties would bear their own costs
