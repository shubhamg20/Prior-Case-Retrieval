Whether reporters of local papers may be allowed to see the judgment Yes The Civil Revision No of is at the instance of a person who had filed a petition for impleadment and pending consideration for impleadment the impugned order had come to be passed The Civil Revision No of is at the instance of <ORG> against which the suit had been instituted by the first respondent After the death of <NAME> the suit was filed for a relief of permanent injunction restraining the defendants viz The plaintiff had sought for interim relief that the portions of the building which had been locked should be unlocked through an independent application and <ORG> has <NAME> I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document chandigarh passed the impugned order dated The impugned order records the fact of an application for impleadment filed at the instance of the petitioner in Civil Revision No of and while putting it up for filing reply to the application it proceeded to pass the order recording the further the fact that a Local Commissioner had been appointed who had inspected the building opened the doors with the keys and got counted the articles lying in the premises as pleaded in the petition The <ORG> observed that it was merely an interim direction and it would be subject to the final outcome of the said application The plaintiff herself has filed an application for amendment of the plaint seeking for declaration that the property was not wakf and that it was her absolute property obtained by her under Will said to have been executed by <NAME> on The suit was for declaration that the property did not belong to wakf and for other <NAME> I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document chandigarh reliefs When there was an order passed by the Executive Magistrate observing the status quo to be maintained allowing for sealing of several rooms where valuables had been kept posting guards to prevent a law and order situation and the pilferage of articles <ORG> would make common issues with the petitioner in its own civil revision petition to urge that the building had been granted in <ORG> through a gift deed dated executed by <NAME> which recites specifically that his own widow was only to be a mutwalli for the building and not as owner thereof with specific prohibition against bequest or gift by her I would have no difficulty in taking it as a fundamental precept that cannot be doubted If the <ORG> has in a petition brought under Article at the instance of a person complaining that there was a serious error in the order passed by the <ORG> which had no jurisdiction to pass the order that it did I would only test it on another parameter viz the power of the High <ORG> in its supervisory jurisdiction to appraise orders or give directions to all the <ORG>s and <ORG>s subordinate to it throughout its territory in relation to which it exercises its jurisdiction If it were to be taken as a civil revision filed against the order of the Wakf <ORG> under the Wakf Act I will apply the normal rules of standing for challenging the correctness of the order I will therefore find that the objection regarding the petitioner invoking jurisdiction cannot be countenanced and I would hold that the <ORG> power to exercise jurisdiction obtained on a literal alarm bell sounded by any person who may have a modicum of interest in the properties There is an additional ground also urged and which in my view correctly that right under Article A is not necessarily confined only to citizens and a right to property though not a fundamental right is still available for its exercise for any person to urge that such a right in the property cannot be expropriated <NAME> I attest to the accuracy and integrity of this document chandigarh otherwise than by procedure established by law It is a matter of record that the petitioner was subsequently also impleaded and therefore if there was ever an error in procedure in not seeking the sanction it must only be taken to be corrected by a post facto event of the impleadment of third party petitioner as a party to the petition As regards the nature of the order the learned counsel for the respondents states that she was actually in possession of <ORG> along with the deceased during all her life and the relief which she had sought for was only to ensure that all the rooms which had been locked were unlocked consistent with her right to possession in respect of the building The counsel for the plaintiff would also contend that the petitioner had himself filed a suit before the Court at Chandigarh in relation to the estate of <NAME> and the suit resulted in a compromise I will partially accept the contention raised on behalf of the counsel for the plaintiff since <ORG> itself is not staking claim to any of the movables as indeed it cannot for the document of gift on which it has placed reliance merely refers to <NAME> and not with reference to the movables jewelleries or heirlooms If there is a dispute amongst the brothers or brothers children of <NAME> or the other legal heirs of <NAME> in relation to the movables I would provisionally observe that it would be a matter that would fall outside the jurisdiction of <ORG> I do not find any such expression but I do not want to prejudge the issue and I will leave it for <ORG> to consider if ever there is any plea by <ORG> that it had title to the movables also The State shall be at liberty to undertake such investigation as it deems fit to ascertain the existence of movables and also restore them to the extent possible They shall be sealed and protected with such number of security guards as would be necessary and sufficient number of police posting to ensure that there is no further loss of property or any scuffle amongst the persons who claim the estate of <NAME> I clarify that any of the observations which I have made in these two civil revisions are only for the purpose of disposal of these petitions and will have no bearing to the ultimate disposal of the suit filed by the plaintiff before the <ORG>
