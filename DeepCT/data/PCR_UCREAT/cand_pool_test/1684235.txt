This appeal raises the question whether it was within the competence of <ORG> to order the reversion of the petitioner to his substantive rank of <ORG> upon charges which he has had no opportunity to hear or defend The petitioner in this case is one <NAME> who is holding the rank of a Tahsildar in a substantive permanent capacity Candidates appointed from Register A I or Register A II are to remain on probation for a period of months but the Governor is at liberty if he thinks fit to extend the period of probation of any candidate Rule These rules clearly provide for a probationary period that must be served before the person appointed to the service becomes a regular or permanent member thereof It is contended on behalf of the petitioner hat he was appointed to <ORG> in a substantive permanent capacity as the expression Extra Assistant Commissioner appearing in column of the above notification is not qualified by the words on probation or officiating and as certain other officers who were appointed to this service previously were gazetted as having been appointed on probation The learned Advocate General has stated at the bar that the practice of gazetted officers as on probation has been discontinued and that all officers who are appointed to the service are placed as probationers in the first instance and are later confirmed if their work in the probationary period is found to be satisfactory It seems to me therefore that in the present case the probationary condition is implied as a matter of law I am aware of no rule by which the petitioner conditions of service are regulated which would enable us to hold that the probationary period had ripened into a permanent appointment by efflux of time The question whether he was appointed to the service in a substantive provisional capacity or in some other capacity is a doubtful and disputed question of fact which cannot be determined in these proceedings The question now arises whether the Petitioner who was holding the higher post in an officiating capacity was entitled to the privileges conferred by Article of the Constitution No person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> or an all India service or a civil service of a state or holds a civil post under the <ORG> or a <ORG> shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him the language which the framers of the Constitution have chosen to employ is of such wide generality that it comprehends in its terms the whole class of Government servants including Government servants who are holding their posts temporarily pr on probation or in an officiating capacity or in accordance with the terms of their respective contracts If the <ORG> were to confine themselves to the literal and strict meaning of the constitutional terminology it would be impossible to order the removal of any Government servant without notice or hearing even after he has attained the age of superannuation or after he has completed years service or after the expiration of the probationary period or after the expiration of the term for which he was appointed under the terms of his contract The framers of the Constitution could not have contemplated such a situation and it seems to me therefore that if the words were given their usual or natural meaning the true Intention of the lawmakers would be completely defeated The <ORG> may look to the subject matter of the enactment and the purpose for which it was enacted it may examine the historical background and the attending conditions or circumstances at the time of the adoption of the law it may consider the policy which induced its enactment or which was designed to be promoted thereby it may examine the results which flow from one construction or another and accept a construction which produces convenient results discard one which produces Inconvenient results The <ORG> should endeavour to construe words to the sense in which they were understood at the time when the statute was enacted and should resolve any ambiguity in the language in favour of an equitable operation of law arid to avoid results which are manifestly absurd or ridiculous When a statute is capable of two constructions one of which is in harmony with the pre existing body of law and the other not that construction should be adopted which will preserve the existing law They accordingly declared in Section that subject to the provisions of Act and all the rules made thereunder every person in the civil service of the <ORG> holds office during His Majesty pleasure that no such person shall be dismissed by any authority subordinate to the authority by whom he was appointed that the Secretary of <ORG> in <ORG> shall be at liberty to make rules for regulating his conditions of service and A statutory rule provided that no member of a public service shall be dismissed or reduced without being given formal notice of any charge made against him and an opportunity of defending himself This state of affairs could not be tolerated for long and when the new Government of India Act was enacted in the year it was expressly declared in the body of the statute that no Government servant shall be dismissed or reduced in rank unless he has been afforded a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action which is proposed to be taken in regard to him This provision enables the <ORG> to intervene and to compel the performance when refused of the duty imposed by Article They appear to have intended that the rules regulating the conditions of service should be strictly adhered to that the expression member of a civil service appearing in Article should mean a permanent member of a civil service that the expression holds a civil post appearing in the same Article should mean holds in a substantive capacity that the expressions dismissal removal and reduction in rank should have the same meaning when used in Article as they have when used in the service rules that a Government servant should be removed or reduced in rank without charges or hearing if the rules so require and indeed that Article should confer no greater rights or privileges in the matter of re instatement than have been conferred by the corresponding provisions in the service rules They were anxious only to provide that the procedural guarantees secured by the rules in such essential matters as dismissal removal and reduction in rank should be converted into constitutional guarantees that persons aggrieved by the high handedness of their official superiors should foe at liberty to seek redress at the hands of Courts of law and that Courts of law should have power to require the performance of duties set out in Article In other words they appear to have intended that a <ORG> servant who has been dismissed removed or reduced in rank without charges or hearing should be entitled to re instatement or restoration only if he has a clear and specific legal right to re instatement or restoration under the rules by which his conditions of service are regulated and only if he is within the protection of a statute or statutory rule forbidding such removal of reduction It seems to me therefore that Article should Be read as if it were subject to the implied proviso that nothing contained in the said Article shall be deemed to limit or abridge the power of a competent authority to order the removal or reduction in rank of any <ORG> servant without notice or hearing if the rules by which his conditions of service are regulated authorise the competent authority so to do One set of rules specifies the circumstances in which a person may acquire a clear legal right to hold a permanent post provides that a <ORG> servant holding a permanent post in a substantive capacity shall not be transferred to a post carrying less pay than the pay of the said permanent post A third set of rules empowers the competent authority to impose certain punishments including the punishment of dismissal removal and reduction in rank rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules but declares that order of dismissal removal or reduction in rank shall be passed on a Government servant unless he has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and unless he has been afforded an opportunity of defending himself Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules On the other hand there are certain other rules which empower a competent authority to order the removal of a Government servant without notice or hearing In none of these cases can the order of removal be deemed to be unlawful for the rules themselves empower the appropriate authority to make an order of removal without affording the person concerned an opportunity of defending himself These rules are in the nature of special provisions they must be read as exceptions to the general provisions embodied in Rule of the Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules and to the constitutional provisions contained in Article for it is a well known rule of construction that where there is in the same statute a general prohibition of a thing and a special permissive recognition of the existence of the same thing under regulation the particular specified intent on the part of the <ORG> overrides the general Conversely a person who seeks the intervention of this <ORG> on the ground that he has been unlawfully removed or reduced in rank must establish to the satisfaction of the <ORG> a that prior to his removal Or reduction he had a clear and specific legal right to hold the office in question that is a right guaranteed him by a statute or a statutory rule that he is within the protection of a statute or a statutory ruling forbidding such removal or reduction that this case is not covered by a rule which empowers the competent authority to order the removal or reduction without notice or hearing and that he has a clear and indisputable right to re occupy the said office This rule enunciates the broad general proposition that although <ORG> have full power to transfer a <ORG> servant from a higher to a lower post or from a lower to a higher post or from a higher post in one grade to an equivalent post in the same grade it has no power to transfer a person who is holding a post in a substantive capacity to a post which is carrying less nay than the pay of the permanent post on which he holds a lien It appears to draw a distinction between an officer who is holding a permanent post in a substantive capacity and an officer who is holding a permanent post in an officiating or some other capacity An officer of the first category cannot be transferred from a higher to a lower post Without charges or hearing for he has a clear legal right to hold substantively the post to which he has been appointed substantively and he Is within the protection of a statutory rule which forbids his reduction in rank If therefore it is intended to demote any such officer without his consent it is essential that he should be afforded a reasonable opportunity of defending himself and this essential formality must be complied with whatever may be the reasons which actuate Government in contemplating this action He can no more be denied the opportunity of being heard when it is proposed to order his reduction on grounds of ill health than when it is proposed to order his reduction on grounds of misconduct or on any other grounds The protection afforded by Fundamental Rule is not available to a person who is employed on probation or to a person who is merely officiating in a permanent post his office he has no clear and specific right or title to hold the post in question and he is not within the protection of a statute or statutory rule forbidding his removal from the said post When a competent authority has a discretion as to the circumstances in which it will exercise its official function this discretion cannot be controlled by Courts of law It follows as a corollary that if a <ORG> servant holds his office in an officiating capacity and no statutory rule protects him against reduction the <ORG> will not be able to restore him to his place however unjustly or arbitrarily his reduction was ordered The Courts have no more right to examine the grounds on which a transfer has been ordered than to examine the reasons for transferring a person from one station to another I am not unaware of the authorities in which a contrary view has been taken but those authorities do not appear to take notice of which invests Government with a discretionary power to transfer a person who is holding office in an officiating capacity from a higher to a lower post whenever in the exercise of its judgment Government considers it necessary to do so No penaJty was imposed upon him for he was transferred by Government in exercise of the power conferred upon it by a statutory rule He Was only transferred from one post to another a transfer if it is authorised by the rules cannot be regarded as a penalty The parties will bear their own costs I agree with my Lord the Chief Justice for reasons given by him that respondent <NAME> was officiating in the cadre of Extra Assistant Commissioners while he was a permanent Tehsildar and that <ORG> had the power having regard to his conditions of service in officiating capacity to put him back to his permanent position I would rest my judgment upon these considerations alone I therefore agree that the appeal be allowed and the order of the learned Single Judge be set aside
