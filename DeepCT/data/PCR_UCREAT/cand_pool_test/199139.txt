There was an appeal to <ORG> and the learned District Judge took the view that the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act had no jurisdiction to deal with this matter Although that was the question that arose for our determination we also made it clear as to what was the nature and ambit of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> and in brief what we said was that the primary function of the <ORG> was to determine what the wages of the employee were and whether there had been a delay in payment of those wages or a deduction from those wages and in order to determine the wages it may be necessary to determine what the terms of the contract were under which the employee was employed and under which he was claiming his wages Therefore in order to determine what the contract was what the terms of the contract were what were the wages due under the contract it might become necessary for the <ORG> to determine whether in the first place there was an employment or not That was really a logical extension of the principle laid down in <NAME> case because in that case there was a suspension of an employee by <ORG> and the contention put forward was that in view of the suspension no claim could be made by the employee in respect of the period of suspension and what the Court held was that it was open to the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act to consider whether during the period of suspension the relationship of master and servant subsisted between the employer and the employee and if such relationship subsisted notwithstanding the suspension the employer was liable to pay to his employee wages for that period In that case certain employees of <ORG> who had migrated to Pakistan returned and purported to exercise the option given to them to be re employed by <ORG> and they claimed the wages of the period antecedent to the time when they exercised the option and the question that arose first before my brother Mr Justice <NAME> was whether the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act had jurisdiction to decide this question and the learned Judge at page with respect correctly enunciates the principles emerging from the authorities that we have considered Again it is well established that it is open to the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act in order to decide what sums are payable as wages to determine whether a person has been employed or not because the question of contract of employment can only arise if there was at the relevant time a subsisting contract of employment employer of the employee or in other words whether there was relationship of master and servant between the employer and the employee or again to use different language whether there was a subsisting contract of employment between the employer and the employee There was an appeal and <ORG> upheld the view taken by the learned Judge In that case there was no dispute as to employment The dispute was whether the employee was entitled to receive wages under a contract which he had set up or wages under a contract which was set up by the employer These two contracts were relied upon by the employee and the employer in respect of the same period for which wages were claimed by the employee and what the Court held was that when there is a dispute as to which is the contract that governs the relationship of the parties and if two rival contracts are in the field then the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act has no jurisdiction to decide which of the contracts should regulate the rights of the parties and the distinction that was drawn in that case was that whereas the <ORG> could determine what was the contract it could not determine which was the contract As the Advocate General has rightly pointed out in <NAME> case A also we enunciated the principle that was laid down in <NAME> case At page of Bom LR At of AIR of the judgment the ratio of <NAME> case is thus stated that the jurisdiction of the <ORG> really is to determine the terms of the contract in so far as they relate to the payment of wages and in so far as he has to decide the liability of the employer to pay wages under the terms of the contract Turning to the decision of <ORG> which has necessitated this Full Bench in the question that arose for the consideration of the learned Judges was an entirely different question In this connection <ORG> at page of Bom LR at of <ORG> gives expression to the same principle that has been enunciated both in <NAME> case and <NAME> case A and what Mr Justice <NAME> says is But it is said on behalf of the respondent that the <ORG> has the jurisdiction not only to make directions contemplated by Sub section of Section to refund to the employed person any amount unlawfully deducted but also to find out what the terms of the contract were so as to determine what the wages of the employed person were There is no difficulty in accepting that proposition This was also the view taken by a Division Bench of this Court consisting of Mr Justice <NAME> and Mr Justice <NAME> in Special Civil Appln It is clear that the claim of the employee was made on the basis that he continued to be in the employment of the railway authorities during the relevant period viz In our opinion that argument is based on a misapprehension If on the other hand he did not continue to be employed then the employment having come to an end there was a case of re employment as alleged by <ORG> It is also erroneous to suggest that there are two conflicting contracts in the field Therefore we cannot accept the contention of the Advocate General that his case falls within the principle of <NAME> case for the reason that no issue as to the termination of the services of the employee can arise on those pleadings Turning to the judgment of the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act the view taken by the <ORG> is that the employee should be deemed to have been suspended and having been deemed to have been suspended under the rules in the Railway Manual he was entitled to full salary as he was reinstated and as no obloquy attached to his conduct in respect of which he was charged he indeed having obtained an honourable discharge from the Magistrate The <ORG> may be right or wrong on the facts but his decision turned on this that on his construction of the rules and of the attendant circumstances he took the view that the employee was in the service of the Railway Authorities during the relevant period and he also determined the quantum of wages on a construction of the contract as full salary during the period When the matter went to the learned District Judge the view that he took was this and to quote from his judgment On these pleadings one of the issues that arise for consideration is Whether the respondent was discharged from service and re employed as the appellant contends or was suspended from service and was reinstated The Advocate General has drawn our attention to the relevant rules and has pointed out that even suspension from service does not automatically entitle the worker to wages unless he actually works and he has also drawn our attention to the fact that even if there is a case of reinstatement it is for <ORG> to determine whether he should get his full wages or not It may be that the learned District Judge to whom we are proposing to send the matter back may take the view that during the relevant period there was no employment and that the relationship of master and servant did not subsist between the employee and <ORG> and even if he takes the view that the employment continued he may take the view on a consideration of the relevant rules that the employee was not entitled to the wages because he did not do any work or that he was entitled not to full wages as claimed by him but to much less These are not questions which affect the jurisdiction of the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act Therefore in our view the learned District Judge was in error in holding that the <ORG> under the Payment of Wages Act had no jurisdiction to entertain the application Sled by the employee We will therefore set aside the order of the learned District Judge send the matter back to him and direct him to try the following issues Whether the employee continued to be in the employment of <ORG> during the relevant period viz th October to th October If he continued to be in employment what are the wages if any to which the employee is entitled under the terms of the contract subsisting between the employee and <ORG>
