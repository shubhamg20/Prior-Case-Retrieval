He was sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a term of years under section and to death under Section HELD To sustain a charge under of the Indian Penal Code the mere fact that the accused made a statement leading to the discovery of the stolen articles under of the Evidence Act by itself is not sufficient The circumstances relied upon by the prosecution in the instant case led to no other inference than that of guilt of the accused as murder and robbery are proved to have been integral parts of one and the same transaction and therefore the presumption arising under illustration a to of the Evidence Act is that not only the accused committed the murder of the deceased but also committed robbery of her gold ornaments which formed part of the same transaction The prosecution had led sufficient evidence to connect the accused with the commission of the crime As to the meaning of recent possession it was observed No fixed time limit can be laid down to determine whether possession is recent or otherwise and each case must be judged on its own facts There was no lapse of time between the date of his arrest and the recovery of the stolen property The test laid down in <NAME> case is unfortunately not fulfilled in the instant case The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SEN <NAME> <NAME> is under sentence of death and this appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> dated October There was also lying a towel which had been given by <NAME> to the appellant for his use and apparently the deceased has been strangulated with the towel Thereafter he took <NAME> to the house of <NAME> leading to the recovery of a silk saree which was seized under seizure memo Ex The very day he took <NAME> to the house of Chinnamma in Village Sollepura leading to the recovery of a silk saree which was seized under seizure memo Ex He also denied that he ever made the statement Ex The testimony of reveals that in consequence of the information given by the appellant he recovered the missing screw of the gold nose ring from one <NAME> in village Mattakur that of <NAME> that appellant had sold to him the silk saree for Rs and that of <NAME> discloses that the appellant had sold to him a gold rope chain and a pair of gold bangles The chain of circumstances set out above establishes the guilt of the appellant beyond all reasonable doubt There is no controversy that the statement made by the appellant Ex In the present case there was a suggestion during the trial that had prior knowledge from other sources that the incriminating articles were concealed at certain places and that statement Ex was prepared after the recoveries had been made and therefore there was no fact discovered within the meaning of of the Evidence Act We need not dilate on the question because there was no suggestion made to during his cross examination that he had known the places where the incriminating articles were kept In the facts of that case the <ORG> came to the conclusion that the police had already known that the diamonds were with the person named by the accused with the result that there was no fact discovered by the police as a result of the statement made by the accused Yallamma states that she is the sister of the appellant and that he had given to her the four silk sarees It was suggested that the police had not only planted as a sister of the appellant but also the four silk sarees in question but there is no basis for this assertion while stated that he had sold him a gold rope chain and a pair of gold bangles for Rs There is no reason why the testimony of these witnesses should not be relied upon particularly when <NAME> was not cross examined at all as regards her identification of the seized ornaments and clothes as belonging to the deceased There is no merit in the contention that the testimony of these witnesses as regards the identity of the seized articles to be stolen property cannot be relied upon for want of prior test identification There is no such legal requirement This is a case where murder and robbery are proved to have been integral parts of one and the same transaction and therefore the presumption arising under illustration a to of the Evidence Act is that not only the appellant committed the murder of the deceased but also committed robbery of her gold ornaments which form part of the same transaction The prosecution has led sufficient evidence to connect the appellant with the commission of the crime The sudden disappearance of the appellant from the house of on the morning of March when it was discovered that the deceased had been strangulated to death and relieved of her gold ornaments coupled with the circumstance that he was absconding for a period of over one year till he was apprehended by at village Hosahally on March taken with the circumstance that he made the statement Ex There was no lapse of time between the date of his arrest and the recovery of the stolen property Finally there remains the question of sentence it was cruel hand of destiny that the deceased Smt The test laid down in <NAME> case supra is unfortunately not fulfilled in the instant case
