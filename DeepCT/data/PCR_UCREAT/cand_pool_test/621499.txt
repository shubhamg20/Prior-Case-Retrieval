of the <ORG> Bench was right justified and with jurisdiction in going into and deciding the questions of exemption and limitation contrary to the view of the earlier <ORG> Bench On February the Income tax Officer issued a notice to the company intimating that he proposed to treat the company as a person in default under Section of the Act for not deducting at source tax payable on the aforesaid amount The company further contended that the proceedings were barred by limitation Aggrieved by this order the company filed an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commisioner who allowed the appeal holding that the journey of the children of the employee from the to India and back having been performed within months after or before the employee journey from the to India and back the amount of passage money so paid was exempt from tax and the company was justified in not deducting tax at source The <ORG> filed an appeal before <ORG> which set aside the order of the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and restored the order of the Income tax Officer on March Thereupon at the instance of the company two questions of law were referred to this court under Section of the Act Thereupon the <ORG> considered the matter once again and by the judgment dated March held that the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to invoke Section of the Act against the company since the assessment against the employee was completed and the same had become final and could not have been reopened that the non taxability of the disputed amount is supported by a circular of and the decision in ITR No The <ORG> further held that the proceedings against the company were barred by limitation under Section of the Act At the instance of the <ORG> the four questions referred to earlier have been referred to this court under Section of the Act Learned counsel representing the <ORG> contended that the liability of the employer under Section of the Act is independent of the liability of the employee to pay tax that the company is deemed to be a defaulter when it fails to make a valid deduction at source or pay over the amount deducted to the <ORG> though the default is to be followed by passing a specific order which may be appealable under Section of the Act and that the Income tax Officer is entitled to proceed under Section of the Act irrespective of the assessment being completed on the employee Section defines the expressions salary perquisite and profits in lieu of salary Section categorises incomes not included in the total income The provision with which we are concerned as it existed at the relevant time is Sub section i a which reads in the case of an individual who is not a citizen of India i subject to such conditions as the Central Government may prescribe passage moneys or the value of any free or concessional passage received by or due to such individual a from his employer for himself his spouse and children in connection with his proceeding on home leave out of India Chapter XIV of the Act deals with procedure for assessment Section requires among other things every person whose total income in respect of which he is assessable under the Act during the previous year exceeded the maximum amount which is not chargeable to income tax to furnish a return of his income in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed Subsection of Section states that any person responsible for paying any income chargeable under the head Salaries shall at the time of payment deduct income tax on the amount payable at the average rate of income tax computed on the basis of the rates in force for the financial year in which the payment is made on the estimated income of the assessee under this head for that financial year Section requires the person so deducting and paying to issue a certificate containing necessary particulars to the person on whose account such credit is given Section requires the person paying salary to furnish the prescribed return We may in this connection notice Section which states inter alia that if a person without reasonable cause or excuse fails to deduct or after deducting fails to pay the tax as required by or under the provisions of Chapter XVII he shall be punishable in the manner provided in Clauses i and ii Section states that when any tax interest penalty fine or any other sum is payable in consequence of any order passed under the Act the Income tax Officer shall serve upon the assessee a notice of demand in the prescribed form specifying the sum so payable Sub section of Section states that if the amount specified in any notice of demand under Section is not paid within the period limited under Sub section the assessee shall be liable to pay simple interest at fifteen per cent Section deals with liability on the part of the assessee in default or deemed to be in default in making payment of tax Sections to deal with modes of recovery Section states that if any person satisfies <ORG> that the amount of tax paid by him or on his behalf for any assessment year exceeds the amount with which he is properly chargeable under the Act for that year he shall be entitled to a refund of the excess It is for the employee to submit an annual return showing his total income for the purpose of taxation and the <ORG> has a duty to complete the assessment with statutory rights provided in the Act to the employee In other words the liability of the employer to make deduction at source and pay over the tax to the <ORG> is not independent of the liability of the employee to pay tax We do not think that either the ratio of or the observations in the judgment have any impact on the question we have considered in this case
