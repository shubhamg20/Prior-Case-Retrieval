Payment of taxes made under mistake of law Period of limitation when commence Jurisdiction of <ORG> HEADNOTE The appellants paid certain amounts to the government as excise duty and education cess for the years to in one case and from to in the other In writ petitions before <ORG> claiming refund the appellants contended that the payments in question were made by then under mistake of law that the mistake was discovered when <ORG> struck down the provisions as unconstitutional and that the petitions were therefore in time Even in cases where it is filed within three years the court has a discretion In the instant case having regard to the conduct of the appellants in not claiming the amounts in the earlier Writ petitions without any justification there is no justification in interfering with discretion exercised by <ORG> in dismissing the writ petitions The appellants did not pray for refund of the amounts paid by way of cess for the years to and they gave no reasons before <ORG> in these petitions why they did not make the prayer for refund of the amounts paid during the years in question If the appellants could have but did not without any legal justification claim refund of the amounts paid during the years in question in the earlier writ petitions there is no reason why they should be allowed to claim the amounts by filing writ petitions again In the second batch of appeals the reason why this Court did not go into the question of the validity of the Act was that relevant materials were not placed before the court by the appellant for successfully challenging its validity and they were therefor to blame themselves MATHEW The appellants filed writ petitions be fore <ORG> under Article of the Constitution for a declaration that the Mysore Elementary Education Act and the amendments to it by the Mysore Elementary Education Amendment Act XII of Providing for levy and collection of Education Cess on items on which Education Cess is being levied as prescribed in the schedules of the respective Acts were beyond the competence of <ORG> and for refund of the Educational Cess paid during to on shop rentals and tree tax in respect of toddy and duty of excise in respect of arrack and special liquor <ORG> dismissed the writ petitions by a common judgment and these appeals are directed against that judgment The contention of the appellants before <ORG> was that the payments of cess in question were made by them under a mistake of law that they discovered the mistake only on May when <ORG> by its judgment declared that the provisions of the Act and the amendments thereto were unconstitutional and that as they filed the writ petitions within three months of that decision the writ petitions were within time <ORG> found that there was delay in filling the petitions and it was mainly for that reason that <ORG> dismissed <ORG> have power for the purpose of enforcement of fundamental rights and statutory to give consequental relief by ordering repayment of money realised by the Government without the authority of law said that the special remedy provided in Article is not intended to supersede completely the modes of obtaining relief by an action in a civil court or to deny defence legitimately open in such actions and that among the several matters which <ORG> rightly take into consideration in the exercise of that discretion is the delay made by the aggrieved party in seeking this special remedy and the excuse there is for it He further said that if a person comes to the court for relief under Article on the allegation that he has been assessed to tax under a void legislation and having paid it under a mistake is entitled to get it back the court if it finds that the assessment was void being made under a void provision of law and the payment was made by mistake is still not bound to exercise its discretion directing repayment and that whether repayment should be ordered in the exercise of this discretion win depend in each case on its own facts and circumstances and that it is not easy nor is it desirable to lay a general rule On the question of the period of limitation within which the petition must be filed he observed that the period of limitation prescribed for recovery of money paid under a mistake of law is three years from the date when the mistake is known and that that period may ordinarily be taken to be a reasonable standard by which delay in seeking remedy under Article can be measured He further said that the court may consider the delay unreasonable even if it is less than the period of limitation prescribed for a civil action but where the delay is more than this period it will almost always be proper for the court to hold that it is unreasonable payment is made under a mistake of law as contrasted with a mistake of fact generally the mistake becomes known to the party only when a court makes a declaration as to the invalidity of the law If any writ petition is filed beyond three years after that date it will almost always be proper for the court to consider that it is unreasonable to entertain that petition though even in cases where it is filed within three years the court has a discretion having regard to the facts and circumstances of each case We are aware that the result of this view would be to enable a person to recover the amount paid as tax even after several years of the date of payment if some other party would successfully challenge the validity of the law under which the payment was made and if only a suit or writ petition is filed for refund by the person within three years from the date of declaration of the invalidity of the law Nor is there any provision under which the court deny refund of tax even if the person who paid it has collected it from his customers and has no subsisting liability or intention to refund it to them or for any reason it is impracticable to do so In the A it is generally held that in the absence of a statute to the contrary taxes voluntarily paid under a mistake of law with full knowledge of facts cannot be recovered back while taxes paid under a mistake of fact may ordinarily be recovered back see Corpus Juris Secundum vol Although of the Contract Act has been held to cover cases of payment of money under a mistake of law as the <ORG> stands in a peculiar position in respect of taxes paid to it there are perhaps practical reasons for the law according a different treatment both in the matter of the heads under which they could be recovered and the period of limitation for the recovery We are refering to this aspect only to alert the attention to the present state of law On March the petitioners filed a writ petition in <ORG> seeking a writ of mandamus restraining the Sales Tax Officer from recovering the amount from them on the ground that was ultra vires the powers of <ORG> and that the order of forfeiture was violative of Articles and of the Constitution On November the writ petition was dismissed by a learned Single Judge on the ground that the petitioners having defrauded other persons were not entitled to any relief The appeal filed against the said order by the petitioners was dismissed on July Before the appeal was dismissed the Collector of Bombay attached the petitioners properties and the petitioners paid the amount to the Collector of Bombay between August and August The petitioners thereupon filed a writ petition under Article of the Constitution on February claiming refund of the amount paid by them under of the Indian Contract Act on the ground that they paid the amount under a mistake of law and that they dis covered the mistake only when this <ORG> struck down A of the Bombay Sales Tax Act The petitioners also alleged that they paid the amount to the collector under coercion and they were entitled to recover the same It was in these circumstances that this <ORG> had to consider the question whether the petitioners were entitled to the relief claimed By a majority of the <ORG> it was decided that there was inordinate clay in filing the petition and there fore it should be dismissed that there is no question here of a mistake of law entitling the petitioner to invoke analogy of the Article in the Limitation Act <NAME> said that the payment made by the petitioners were made not under any mistake of law and therefore they cannot claim any relief on the ground of mistake <NAME> was of the view that after the decision of <ORG> the petitioners did not willingly pay the amount forfeited but that they made the payment after attachment of their properties and therefore the amounts were really paid under coercion and the period of limitation would normally run from the date of the payment We are not quite sure that if the maxim that everyone is presumed to know the law is applied there will be any case of payment under a mistake of law unless that presumption is rebutted in the first instance for the moment it is assumed that everyone is presumed to know the law it is clear that no one can make a mistake as to the law There is no presumption in this country that every person knows the law it would be contrary to common sense and reason if it were SO Be that as it may <ORG> deduced the conclusion from the decision in <NAME> supra case that the question whether a declaration by a court that a law is unconstitutional and therefore void would not always furnish the starting point of limitation for a suit for recovery of the amount paid under that law and that the question must be decided on the facts of each case The Court further said that the parties should seek relief under Article as expeditiously as possible If one thing is clear from the judgments rendered in <NAME> case supra by the Judges who formed the majority it is this they did not consider the payments made by the petitioners a payments made under a mistake of law Be that as it may in the earlier writ petitions the appellants did not pray for refund of the amounts paid by way of cess for the years to and they gave no reasons before <ORG> in these writ petitions why they did not make the prayer for refund of the amounts paid during the years in question If the appellants could have but did not without any legal justification claim refund of the amounts paid during the years in question in the earlier writ petitions we see no reason why the appellants should be allowed to claim the amounts by filing writ petitions again In the circumstances of this case having regard to the conduct of the appellants in not claiming these amounts in the earlier writ petitions without any justification we do not think we would be justified in interesting with the discretion exercised by <ORG> in dismissing the writ petitions which were filed only for the purpose of obtaining the refund and directing them resort to the remedy of suits We dismiss the appeals but make no order as to costs Civil Appeals Nos of The appellants filed writ petitions before <ORG> challenging the levy of health cess under the Mysore Health Cess Act hereinafter referred to as the Act for the reason that the Act is outside the legislative competence of <ORG> as well as on the ground that levy of health cess under the Act on shop rentals and tree tax items in respect of toddy and arrack is ultra wires sub section of of the Act and and read with the schedule to the Elementary Education Act Before <ORG> a Preliminary objection raised by the learned Advocate General on behalf of the State of Mysore that since the writ petitions were filed more than three years after the payments were made the court should not entertain them These appeals are directed against that order Within two months of the disposal of appeals by this <ORG> the appellants filed writ petitions before <ORG> challenging the validity of the Act and praying for refund of health cess collected under the Act for the period from to The High <ORG> held that there was inordinate delay in filing the writ petitions and dismissed them on that ground without entering into the merits of the petitions The appellants contended that <ORG> went wrong in domissing the writ petitions on the ground that there was inordinate delay in filing them Merely because this <ORG> has said that the appellants can challenge the validity of Act it they are so advised by a suit it would not follow that they can challenge its validity in writ petition without encountering legitimate pleas available to the respondent If there was inordinate delay is filing the writ petitions there was nothing in the judgment of <ORG> which prevented <ORG> in dismissing them on that ground The reason why this <ORG> did not go into the question of the validity of the Act was that relevant materials were not placed before the <ORG> by the appellants <NAME> without regard to the question of delay in filing the petitions We dismiss the appeals but make no order as to costs
