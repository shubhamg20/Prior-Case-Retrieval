The appeal is sought to be filed by the owner of a motor vehicle and by the Insurance company with regard to a case of a fatal motor accident which gave rise to a justifiable claim for compensation which went into the question but also the learned Judge Venkatadri who heard the civil miscellaneous appeal both came to the unambiguous conclusion on the merits that this was a case of a motor accident that ended fatally under such circumstances as to justify and fully justify the claim for compensation There are authorities of High Courts into which we need not proceed here since this proposition is not really relevant for out purpose that the word representative in A does not mean a legal representative of the kind contemplated in the Civil Procedure Code but must have reference to the earlier words in the same section for the benefit of the wife husband parent and child There is much to be said for the view that if this Central Act of is to govern the claim a married sister of the victim who died a bachelor without leaving behind a wife child or parents cannot bring forward a claim of this sort for her own benefit But that observation was made in the context of a situation when it had to be considered whether it was necessary or not necessary to establish in support of a claim for compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act that the accident was the result of negligence on the part of the owner or driver of the vehicle In the present case we have already affirmed that on the merits both <ORG> and the learned Judge found that this was an accident which could give rise to a claim for compensation under the law The only point was whether the claim could be advanced by the married sister of the deceased who died a bachelor We can find nothing in the record or in the provisions of the Act to justify this view
