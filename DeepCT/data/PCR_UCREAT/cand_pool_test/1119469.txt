DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> <NAME> JUDGMENT WITH CIVIL APPEALS NOS AND OF SINHA Interpretation of Section a iv of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act hereinafter called and referred to for the sake of brevity as the said Act falls for consideration in these appeals which arise out of a judgment and order of <ORG> dated passed in No of filed by the appellant of Civil Appeal No of The legality or validity of the directions contained in the said two letters dated and were the subject matter of the writ petition filed by <ORG> and <ORG> marked as Civil Writ Petition No of It appears that a proposal was mooted in the said proceeding as to whether the dispute between the parties could be amicably resolved and pursuant thereto or in furtherance thereof by an order dated the Trust was given an opportunity by <ORG> to obtain and file affidavits of the parties in whose favour licences had been granted for construction and running of the schools Thereafter affidavits were filed by the concerned fourth parties stating that they would abide by the conditions of the licence issued in favour of <ORG> as also the rules and regulations and instructions issued by the First and Second Respondents Mr <NAME> the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of appellant in Civil Appeal No of would submit that the said Act the Rules framed thereunder or the conditions of licence do not provide for imposition of any embargo on transfer of the lands in question to third parties by <ORG> and as such the impugned judgment is not sustainable By reason of the provision contained in Section of the Act it was submitted the licensee was merely obligated to construct or get constructed schools hospitals community centers etc and thus in terms thereof no prohibition has been imposed as regard transfer thereof to an institution or an individual so as enable them to undertake construction of schools hospitals and community centers at their own cost Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant in Civil Appeal No submitted that in the facts and circumstances of this case <ORG> should not have made adverse comments as regard the functioning of the <ORG> The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants in Civil Appeal No and would inter alia submit that keeping in view the fact that the <ORG> issued advertisements which were published in various newspapers in the year declaring availability of educational sites in the colony in question it cannot be said that the respondents No and were not in the know thereof Mr <NAME> the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Respondent Nos and would on the other hand submit that although there does not exist any express bar on transfer of lands by the owners thereof by creating third party or fourth party interest the same must be inferred having regard to the scheme of the said Act It was submitted that if the <ORG> can take over the lands without payment of any compensation it must necessarily be held that it has also the concomitant right to keep control thereover which would include imposing restriction on transfer of the said land The owner of the land by necessary implication the learned counsel would urge was not entitled to exercise any right over the property and its right to use the same was restricted to get constructions raised through a third party wherefor also it has itself to incur costs It came into force with effect from th November except Section thereof which came into force on th January when the State Act received the assent of the Governor of State of Haryana It is further not in dispute that licences had been granted to it for the construction of a colony Section of the said Act provides for application for licence and grant thereof iii the responsibility for the maintenance and upkeep of all roads open spaces public park and public health services for a period of five years from the date of issue of the completion certificate unless earlier relieved of this responsibility and thereupon to transfer all such roads open spaces public parks and public health services free of cost to the Government or the local authority as the case may be iv to construct at his own cost or get constructed by any other institution or individual at its cost schools hospitals community centers and other community buildings on the land set apart for this purpose or to transfer to the <ORG> at any time if so desired by <ORG> free of cost the land set apart for schools hospitals community centers and community buildings in which case the <ORG> shall be at liberty to transfer such land to any person or institution as it may deem fit They come within the purview of the term Amenities The expression Amenity has been used only in proviso appended to Clause of Section a and Rule of the Rules In terms of the said Act in the event the <ORG> takes over the plots it would be at liberty to transfer such land to any person or institution including a local authority as it may deem fit Once it is held that such transfer would only be irregular which can be cured it would necessarily mean that there was no absolute statutory bar in relation thereto If it be held that such transfers by <ORG> were illegal there was no occasion for the respondents No and herein to pass the building plans keeping in view of the fact that transferee thereof did not acquire any title whatsoever Had the intention of the legislature been as has been held by <ORG> that the cost for such a construction has to be borne by the licensee irrespective of the fact as to whether it undertakes such constructions itself or get them constructed by its contractors there was absolutely no reason as to why clearer terms could not be used by the legislature Indisputably any person can get constructions made on his own land either under his own supervision or through a contractor We do not also agree with the submission of Mr <NAME> to the effect that as regards development of community sites the State acts as a parens patriae We may now consider the decisions whereupon Mr <NAME> placed strong reliance The question which arose for consideration therein was as to whether the <ORG> has the requisite jurisdiction and power as a parent to fight litigation for the victims so as to uphold their fundamental rights A question as to whether the <ORG> Act is ultra vires the Constitution also arose for consideration How could they survive the long ordeal of litigation and ultimate execution of the decree or the orders unless provisions be made for their sustenance and maintenance especially when they have been deprived of the right to fight for these claims themselves We therefore read the Act accordingly In The State of Punjab Vs <NAME> and Another SCR this Court was considering the constitutional validity of the provisions of Abducted Persons Recovery and Restoration Act in terms whereof police officers were entitled to take abducted person to the custody of the officer in charge of the camp If however two constructions are possible then the court must adopt that which will ensure smooth and harmonious working of the Constitution and eschew the other which will lead to absurdity or give rise to practical inconvenience or make well established provisions of existing law nugatory The question which arose for consideration therein was as to whether the principles of natural justice had to be read in the proviso appended in the Section a of the Act SCC the question which fell for consideration of this Court was as to whether <ORG> performs judicial functions that are ordinarily performed by courts under Section A of the Act and in that context it was held to be a court The question which now arises for consideration is as to whether clause of the licence agreement can be read as a restriction of the right to transfer the community sites In case the net profit exceeds the after completion of the project period surplus amount shall either be deposited within two months in <ORG> by the owner or he shall spend this money on further amenities facilities in his colony for the benefit of the residents therein For the foregoing reasons the appeals are allowed but in the fact and circumstances of the case there shall be no order as to costs The preamble of the act shows it is meant to regulate use of land in certain manner How could they survive the long ordeal of litigation and ultimate execution of the decree or the orders unless provisions be made for their sustenance and maintenance especially when they have been deprived of the right to fight for these claims themselves We therefore read the Act accordingly If however two constructions are possible then the court must adopt that which will ensure smooth and harmonious working of the Constitution and eschew the other which will lead to absurdity or give rise to practical inconvenience or make well established provisions of existing law nugatory
