Rule II of the Rules of General Applica tion made inter alia under sub section of section lays down five years as the maximum period for which wholesale licences for the manufacture supply and sale of liquor could be granted Rule XXII provides for the manner in which licences for the manufacture or sale of intoxicants shall be disposed There was a demand from all sections of the public living in surrounding area to move the distilleries away in order to avoid water and environmental pollution It was pro vided by cl of the Letter of Intent that the licensee shall make proper arrangements for treatment of effluents discharge under a scheme duly approved by the <ORG> and that any direction issued by <ORG> in this regard shall be binding on the licensee This policy decision was challenged by <NAME> by filing No by <NAME> by filing his No and by a firm called <ORG> during the course of the arguments in the two writ peti tions All the three writ petitions were disposed of by a common judgment delivered by a Division Bench of the High <ORG> consisting of Acting Chief Justice <NAME> and Justice <NAME> On a plain grammatical construction of Rule XXII it is obvious that the Collector or an Officer authorised by him in that behalf can choose anyone of the four modes set out in that Rule There is nothing in the language of Rule XXII to justify the interpretation that an earlier mode of disposal set out in the Rule excludes a latter mode or that reasons must be specified where a latter mode is adopted in preference to an earlier one It is also clear from Rules III IV and that there are two purposes for which a licence in Form for con struction and working of a distillery may be granted It may be granted as an adjunct to the licence in Form under Rule IV or it may be granted as an independent licence under Rule irrespective whether the grantee holds a licence under Rule irrespective whether the grantee holds a li cence in Form or not There are also two types of li cences for wholesale supply of country liquor to retail vendors namely licence in Form and licence in Form A licence in Form can be granted to a person under Rule even though he does not hold a licence in Form It is obvious that without an amendment of Rule II of the Rules of General Application the maximum period for which licence could be granted to respondent Nos was only years and there could be no provision for automatic renewal thereafter from year to year The so called concession made on behalf of <ORG> and re spondent Nos to was therefore really not a conces sion at all but it was a stand taken in recognition of the correct position in regard to the grant of licence The policy decision dated th December was a single integrated decision arrived at by the <ORG> Govern ment taking a holistic view of all the aspects involved in the decision and it is difficult to appreciate how <ORG> could sustaining one part of the policy and strike down the other The consequence of sustaining one part of the policy decision and striking down the other would not only be to create a new policy for <ORG> but it would also cause considerable hardship and injustice to the licen sees and also result in public mischief and inconvenience detrimental to the interest of the <ORG> Since the peti tioners were guilty of enormous delay in filing the writ petitions and in the intervening period the rights of respondents Nos were created in that they spent con siderable amount of time energy and resources and incurred huge expenditure in setting up the new distilleries sus taining one part of the policy decision while striking down the other would amount to creating a new policy for <ORG> and would also entail considerable hardship and inconvenience to respondent Nos and would also be detrimental to the interest of the <ORG> There is nothing in the policy deci sion dated th December which is contrary to time Rules made under the Act Section of the Act clearly provides that <ORG>er may license the construction and working of a distillery and there was therefore nothing contrary to the Act or the Rules in <ORG>er issuing Letter of Intent in favour of each of res pondent Nos granting licence for construction of a new distillery There is nothing to show that or more workers were going to he employed in the new distilleries It is well settled that the power of <ORG> to issue an appropriate writ under Art If there is inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner in filing a writ petition and such delay is not satisfactory explained <ORG> may decline to intervene and grant relief in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction The lights of third parties my intervene and if the writ juris diction is exercised on a writ petition filed after unrea sonable delay it may have the effect of inflicting not only hardship and inconvenience but also injustice on third parties Here the petitioners were guilty of enormous delay in filing the writ petitions inasmuch as during the intervening period the rights of third parties had intervened and re spondent Nos acting on the basis of the policy decision dated th December had incurred to expenditure towards setting up the distilleries There is no fundamental right in a citizen to carry on trade or business in liquor No one can claim as against the <ORG> the right to carry on trade or business in liquor and the <ORG> cannot be compelled to part with its exclusive right or privilege of manufacturing and selling liquor in such a case the court must bear in mind that having regard to the nature of the trade or business the court would be slow to interfere with the policy laid down by <ORG> for grant of licences for manufacture and sale of liquor In complex economic matters every decision is necessarily empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error meth od and therefore Metropolis Theatre Company <ORG> of Chicago Lawyers Edition quoted with approval In the instant case the words used in paras to and of Lal judgment are undoubtedly strong and highly disparaging remarks attributing mala fides corrup tion and underheard dealing of <ORG> which are not justified by the record The judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals by special leave are directed against a judgment of <ORG> in what has come to be known as Liquor case brought before <ORG> by way of three writ petitions under article of the Constitution writ petition No of was also filed challeng ing the same policy decision of the State of Madhya Pradesh by a firm called <ORG> but it was filed much later at a time when arguments were actually going on in court in the first two writ petitions The respondents in the first two writ petitions were not aware at that time that it was a writ petition which was filed by <ORG> They thought that it was merely an intervention appli cation since no notice was served upon them and they had also no opportunity of filing an affidavit in reply to that writ petition All these three writ petitions were disposed of by a common judgment delivered by <ORG> of <ORG> consisting of Acting Chief Justice <NAME> and Justice <NAME> The facts giving rise to these appeals and special leave petitions are mate rial and need to be stated in some detail There is also the definition of spi rit in section which provides that spirit means any liquor contain ing alcohol obtained by distillation whether it is denatured or not Section provides inter alia that no distillery or brewery shall be constructed or worked and no person shall use keep or have in his posses sion any material still utensil implement or apparatus whatsoever for the purpose of manufacturing any intoxicant other than taft except under the authority and subject to the terms and conditions of a licence granted in that be half Establishment or licensing of distilleries and warehouses a establish a distillery in which spirit may be manufactured under a licence granted under section on such conditions as the State Government may impose discontinue any such distillery licence on such conditions as the State Government may impose the construction and working of a distillery or brewery establish or licence a warehouse wherein any intoxicant may be deposited and kept without payment of duty but subject to pay ment of such fees as the State Government may direct and discontinue any such warehouse We may then refer to section which provides inter alia that no intoxicant shall be sold except under the authority and subject to the terms and conditions of a licence granted in that behalf Section recognises the power of <ORG> to lease to any person on such conditions and for such period as it may think fit the right a of manufacturing or of supplying by wholesale or of both or of selling by wholesale or by retail or of manufactur ing or of supplying by wholesale or of both and selling by retail any liquor or intoxicating drug within any speci fied area There are no other sections in the Act material for our purpose until we come to section which confers on the State Govern ment the power to make Rules for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the Act Sub section of section provides that <ORG> may make Rules prescrib ing the authority by the form in which and the terms and conditions on and subject to which any licence permit or pass shall be granted and by such rules among other mat ters fix the period for which any licence permit or pass shall continue in force <ORG> has in exercise of the power conferred under section made several sets of Rules Rules III to of the Distillery and Warehouse Rules also made inter alia under sub section of section deal with the subject of grant of licence and provide in the following terms for different kinds of licences which may be issued viz This would seem to be plain and incontrovertible but Mr Justice <NAME> has rather curiously in his judgment held that these four modes of disposal are inter related and failing in one of the clauses the next is to be acted upon and for applying the fourth clause it is incumbent for the <ORG> to specify the manner by general or special order and this also includes specifying how and why the other three clauses are not possible to be acted upon which compels to take resort to the fourth clause This view taken by Mr Justice <NAME> in regard to the interpretation of Rule XXII is obvious ly unsustainable On a plain grammatical construction of Rule XXII it is obvious that the Collector or an Officer authorised by him in that behalf can choose any one of the four modes set out in that Rule There is nothing in the language of Rule XXII to justify the interpretation that an earlier mode of disposal set out in the Rule excludes a latter mode or that reasons must be specified where a latter mode is adopted in preference to an earlier one It is also clear from Rules III IV and which we have set out above that there are two purposes for which a licence in Form for construction and working of a dis tillery may be granted It may be granted as an adjunct to the licence in Form under Rule IV or it may be granted as an independent licence under Rule irrespective whether the grantee holds a licence in Form or not There are also two types of licences for wholesale supply of country liquor to retail vendors namely licence in Form and licence in Form A licence in Form can be granted to a person under Rule even though he does not hold a licence in Form It may be pointed out that at the material time the bottling and sealing charges were fixed at paise per bottle which came to Rs per proof litre The total production of country liquor from all the distilleries in the year came to only lacs proof litres and though in the year there was some improvement the total production did not go beyond lacs proof litres Moreover it seems that though at the time of construction these distilleries were away from the city or town what had happened was that with the growth of population and haphazard and unplanned urban development these distilleries had now come to be in the heart of the city or own and they created health hazards and pollution problems There was a demand from all sections of the public living in surrounding area to move the distiller ies away in order to avoid water and environmental pollu tion But since several points required consideration such as whether the distilleries should be transferred to private ownership during the period of the subsisting contracts and if so what would be the legal consequences and whether the distilleries should be allowed to continue at the same place or should be trans ferred to new sites in view of the problem of pollution and the question of transfer of distilleries to private owner ship was itself an important policy issue <ORG> referred the matter to the Chief Minister with a suggestion that a high level committee should be appointed for the purpose of examining the various issues These issues may be summarised as follows Whether the transfer of ownership of <ORG> distilleries should be made during the present contract period only or on the commencement of new contract Necessity of spot inspection of distiller ies and survey of buildings and change of their place Policy to be adopted for transfer of buildings and lands of distilleries Establishment of proper machine and imple ments for manufacture of liquor in the dis tilleries for use of Mahuwa product in the State Determination and question of fixing prices of liquor under the new management <ORG> Committee at its meeting held on th June considered these issues and after discussion came to the conclusion that in view of the problem of pollution it should first of all be examined as to which distillery is to be transferred from the existing site and which distill ery is to be maintained at the present site and in order to determine this question <ORG> Committee consti tuted a Committee headed by <NAME> Special Secre tary <ORG> <ORG> was also authorised to select new sites for the distilleries which in its opinion required to be removed from the exist ing sites on account of the problem of pollution <ORG> Committee directed that an estimate of the cost involved in setting up the Bhopal Ujjain Badwaha Seoni and Bhilai distilleries at the new sites should be worked out by <ORG> as also by <ORG> tion and the valuation of the lands and buildings of Gwalior and Dhar distilleries which according to the Vijayvargi Report were not necessary to be shifted to new sites should also be got done by the Collectors concerned on the basis of prevailing market rates <ORG> Committee thereafter met on th August and at this meeting <ORG> Committee consid ered the report of the Excise Commissioner in regard to the estimated cost of establishing Bhopal Ujjain Badwaha Seoni and Bhilai distilleries at new sites as also the estimated increase in consumption of liquor over the next years and after discussing all the various related issues <ORG> Committee arrived at certain deci sions which are set out in paragraph of the proceeding of this meeting which form part of the record It is not neces sary here to set out these decisions because ultimately they culminated in the recommendations made by <ORG> Committee to which we shall presently make reference Some suggestion was also made on behalf of these representatives that compensation should be paid by <ORG> to the existing contractors for the expenditure incurred by them in construction of roads molasses collection pits wharehouses etc One was that trans<ORG> fer of distilleries should be made by getting the compara<ORG> tive bids offered and it should be given to the highest bidder and the other was whether on transfer to private ownership the distillers would be required to obtain any permission under the Industries Development and Regulation Act and if permission is not granted whether any problem would arise out of it The <ORG> <ORG><ORG>Committee at the meeting held on th September discussed these two points and so far as the first point was concerned the <ORG> <ORG><ORG>Committee came to the conclusion that the transfer of distilleries should be made only to the present contractors and their present supply area should be attached with them and with regard to the second point the <ORG> <ORG><ORG>Committee felt that since the distilleries which were going to be established at the new sites were in lieu of the present distilleries it may not be necessary to obtain fresh licence under the Industries Development and Regula<ORG> tion Act but if fresh licence was required it should be the responsibility of the distillers to obtain the same If the land allotted is used for any other purpose than the purpose for which it is allotted the land would auto matically stand diverted to <ORG> <ORG> however submitted a Report raising points against the recommendations made in the Report of the <ORG> Sub Committee Point No A serious thought should be given to the question that <ORG> should give an undertaking to the distillers that <ORG> shall purchase liquor from them for ever and for that purpose no tender will be invited Point No As there is a possibility of increases of consumption of liquor in future and the increased quantity of liquor will have to be purchased by <ORG> from the present contractors that will amount to monopoly system and the contractors may put <ORG> into trouble at any time <ORG> should possess a right of granting licence to any other distiller if there is an increase in the consumption of liquor the supply of the same is done by the contractors or from outside As for as grant of licence to other distillers is concerned it will be given to them according to the requirement Answer As mentioned in recommendation No of the Sub Committee dated the rates to be made effective from will be proposed by a Committee which will be given effect to after discussion negotiations with <ORG> and the distillers It was provided by Clause of the Letter of Intent that the licensee shall make proper arrangements for treatment of effluents discharge under a scheme duly approved by <ORG> and that any direction issued by the Excise Commissioner in this regard shall be binding on the licensee Clause of the Deed of Agreement provided that the licensee shall be bound to take land on lease for a period of years from <ORG> but this clause is not material because ultimately none of respondent Nos to took land on lease from <ORG> and each of them purchased his own land the site of course being approved by <ORG> There was some dispute between the parties as to how much amount each of respondent Nos to had expended by the time the first writ petition came to be filed by <NAME> but it could not be seriously contested that considerable amount of money had already been spent by respondent Nos to in acquiring land con structing buildings There is evidence to draw that considerable more progress had been made by respondent Nos to in this direction by the time the second writ petition came to be filed by <NAME> This contention was negatived by the Division Bench and particularly by Acting Chief justice <NAME> in view of the categorical statement made on behalf of <ORG> by the learned Advocate<ORG> General as also by the learned Advocates appearing on behalf of respondent Nos to that under the policy decision dated th December D<ORG> licence was to be granted only for a maximum period of years subject to its renewal within the period of years on the terms and conditions mentioned in the Letter of Intent and there was no under<ORG> taking on the part of <ORG> to grant by way of renewal or otherwise D<ORG> licence after the expiry of the period of years commencing from st April The learned Attorney General appearing on behalf of <ORG> as also the learned advocates appearing on behalf of respondent Nos <ORG> reiterated the same stand before us namely that there was no commitment on the part of <ORG> to grant D<ORG> licence beyond the maximum period of years and that the provision in regard to renewal from year to year was to operate within this period of years The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioners however urged that this concession made on behalf of <ORG> and respondent Nos <ORG> was of no avail since it was contrary to the terms of the policy decision dated th December and the provision in the Letter of Intent and in any event the validity of the policy decision dated th December could be tested only on its own terms and if it was otherwise invalid the con<ORG> cession made on behalf of <ORG> and respond<ORG> ent Nos <ORG> could not save it We do not think that this contention urged on behalf of the petitioners is well<ORG>found<ORG> ed It is obvious that without an amendment of Rule II of the Rules of General Application the maximum period for which D<ORG> licence could be granted to respondent Nos <ORG> was only years and there could be no provision for automatic renewal thereafter from year to year This clause provided in terms clear and explicit that <ORG> shall be bound to grant D<ORG> licence to the licensee for a period of years subject to renewal every year on payment of licence fee of Rs and on the fulfilment of the conditions of the licence and the provi<ORG> sions of the Excise Act and the rules made thereunder This so called concession made on behalf of the State Gov<ORG> ernment and respondent Nos <ORG> was therefore really not a concession at all but it was a stand taken in recognition of the correct position in regard to the grant of D<ORG> licence We have therefore reached the conclusion that without expressing any opinion about the validity of the scheme relating to the grant only to the existing contractors for construc tion of the new distilleries no interference with the grant to this extent alone should be made in these petitions on the short ground that there is unexplained delay in challenging the grant to this extent in these petitions and during the intervening period the new distilleries have almost been completed if not wholly completed and any interference with the grant to this extent will result in need less complications Before we proceed to consider this question we may point out that Acting Chief Justice <NAME> who deliv ered the main judgment in the writ petitions did not make any comments against the conduct of <ORG> in granting to the existing contractors the right to construct distilleries and manufacture and make wholesale supply of country liquor from such distilleries but merely proceeded to invalidate what he called the second part of the policy decision dated th December on the ground that it violated Article of the Constitution But Justice <NAME> delivered a separate concurring opinion and in this opinion he made certain observations which have been strongly objected to by the learned Attorney General appear ing on behalf of the State of Madhya Pradesh It is neces sary to set out in extenso what the learned Judge has said in this connection because an application has been made to us by the learned Attorney General that the objectionable remarks made by the learned Judge should be expunged This new mischievous device gives scope to respondents No to to monopolize the entire trade of liquor distillery in Madhya Pradesh and also make the <ORG> dance at their tips while fixing the rates according to their wishes By making this statement at the bar I presume that the <ORG> is trying to mini mise the extent of depletion of public reve nue but still the loss of crores as argued by <NAME> continues if licence in form is granted to the respondents Nos to even for a period of five years We may first consider the question of laches or delay in filling the writ petitions because that is the question which has been decided by <ORG> against the petitioners and the petitioners have challenged the correctness of the finding reached by <ORG> of this point There can be no doubt that the petitioners were guilty of gross delay in filing the writ petitions with the result that by the time the writ petitions came to be filed respondent Nos to had pursuant to the policy decision dated th Decem ber altered their position by incurring huge expendi ture towards setting up the distilleries Now it is well settled that the power of <ORG> to issue an appropriate writ under article of the Con stitution is discretionary and <ORG> in the exer cise of its discretion does not ordinarily assist the tardy and the indolent of the acquiescent and the lethargic If there is inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner in filing a writ petition and such delay is not satisfactorily explained <ORG> may decline to intervene and grant relief in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction The rights of third parties may intervene and if the writ jurisdiction is excercised on a writ petition filed after unreasonable delay it may have the effect of inflicting not only hardship and inconvenience but also injustice on third parties We do not think it necessary to burden this judgment with reference to various decisions or this Court where it has been emphasised time and again that where there is inordinate and unexplained delay and third party rights are created in the intervening period <ORG> would decline tO interfere even if the <ORG> action complained of is unconstitutional or ille gal SCR We may point out that in <NAME> case supra even though the <ORG> action was held to be unconstitutional as being violative of Article of the Constitution this Court refused to grant relief to the petitioner on the ground that the writ petition had been filed by the petitioner more than five months after the acceptance of the tender of the fourth respondent and during that period the fourth respondent had incurred considerable expenditure aggregating to about Rs can be cast in a straitjacket formula for there may be cases where despite delay and creation of third party rights <ORG> may still in the exercise of its discretion interfere and grant relief to the petitioner Here obviously there was considerable delay on the part of the petitioners in filing the writ petitions and in the inter vening period respondent Nos to acquired land con structed distillery buildings purchased plant and machinery and spent considerable time money and energy towards set ting up the distilleries The petition ers however contended that they were not aware of the policy decision dated th December nor had they any knowledge of the fact that the right to construct distilleries and to manufacture and supply wholesale country liquor from such distilleries was granted to the existing contractors and it was only when they came to know about this that they immedi ately proceeded to file the writ petitions Those who are in the liquor trade would immediately know what is happening and whether any change is taking place in the policy in regard to grant of licences for manufacture and wholesale supply of country liquor The reigned ignorance of the petitioners is completely exposed by the letter dated st April addressed by <NAME> to <NAME> where it has been stated categor ically I have learnt that in order to prevent pollu tion the Government has taken a decision to transfer the distilleries from the densely populated areas and to establish them in areas having less thinner population This letter clearly shows that <NAME> very well knew about the policy decision dated th December and that he was aware that <NAME> term permanent licences were being granted to the existing contractors for constructing new distilleries and operating the same It may also be pointed out that there was considerable publicity in newspapers in regard to the construction of new distillery at village Khapri in Chhatisgarh area and information to that effect appeared in the issues of Yugdhar dated th June <ORG> dated th June and <ORG> There was also information in regard to transfer of the Badawah dis tillery to village Khodi in the issue of <ORG> published from Indore on th July We may also point out that apart from the letter dated st April there was also another letter dated th September addressed by <NAME> to the Com missioner of <ORG> where he made a specific reference to the policy decision dated th December which shows that in any event <NAME> knew specifically about the policy decision as far back as th September and yet no action was taken by him until th January We do not therefore see any reason to up set the finding of <ORG> that the petitioners were guilty of enormous delay in filing the writ petitions and that in the meanwhile during the intervening period the rights of third parties had intervened in that respondent Nos to acting on the basis of the policy decision dated th Decem ber had incurred huge expenditure towards setting up the distilleries Obviously re spondent Nos to would not have proceeded with the work of setting up the distilleries by spending considerable time and energy and incurring huge expenditure if the writ petitions had been filed in time for in that event they would have known that they would be running a serious risk of losing time money and resources in case the writ peti tions were allowed <ORG> however fell into an error in splitting up the policy decision dated th December into two parts one part relating to the grant for construction of new distilleries by the existing contractors and the other part relating to the grant of licences for manufacture and wholesale supply of liquor to the existing contractors on construction of new distilleries by them and in holding that delay on the part of the petitioners in filing the writ petitions disentitled them to relief in respect of only the first part and not in respect of the second The policy decision dated th December was a single integrated decision arrived at by <ORG> taking a holistic view of all the aspects involved in the decision and it is difficult to appreciate how <ORG> could sustain one part of the policy and strike down the other The consequence of sustaining one part of the policy decision and striking down the other would not only be to create a new policy for <ORG> but it would also cause considerable hardship and injustice to respondent Nos to and also result in public mischief and inconvenience detrimental to the interest of the <ORG> In the first place under the policy decision dated th December new distilleries were to be constructed by the existing contractors not with a view to making them available for manufacturing liquor to any other person who might give a more acceptable bid or tender for and licences in the open market but in order that the existing contractors who put up the new distilleries should be able to manufacture liquor and make wholesale supply of it under and licences to be granted to them for a period of years The entire policy of <ORG> con tained in the policy decision dated th December would be frustrated and a new policy would be made out which patently <ORG> has no jurisdiction or power to do Secondly it is obvious that respondent Nos to took tremendous trouble by way of acquiring land construct ing buildings purchasing and installing plant and machinery and procuring and utilising large resources in setting up new distilleries with a view to working them and manufactur ing liquor for wholesale supply at such rate or rates as may be fixed by the Expert Committee appointed by <ORG> There can be no doubt that this would cause considerable hardship and inconvenience to respondent Nos to Further more the entire process of acquisition would take considerable time may be years and during this period there would be no production of liquor and <ORG> would have to purchase liquor from outside the State at higher prices in order to satisfy the demand of the consuming public resulting in loss of licence fee as well as excise duty Even if the person to whom and licences may be granted agrees to set up a new distillery it would take considerable time and during the period taken up in the construction of the new distillery <ORG> would lose revenue Of course it may be urged that if respondent Nos to are not granted and licences but such licences are granted to any other person or persons who offer a more acceptable bid or tender re spondent Nos to would be constrained to transfer the new distilleries to such other person or persons because otherwise the new distilleries in their hands would remain idle investment We have therefore no doubt that <ORG> was not at all justified in splitting up the policy decision dated th December into two parts and in striking down the second part while sustaining the first We must accordingly hold that since the petitioners were guilty of enormous delay in filing the writ petitions and in the intervening period the rights of respondents Nos to were created in that they spent considerable amount of time energy and resources and incurred huge expenditure in setting up the new distilleries and sustaining one part of the policy decision while striking down the other would amont to creating a new policy for <ORG> and would also entail considerable hardship and inconvenience to respondent Nos to and would also be detrimental to the interest of the <ORG> it would be unjust But since considerable arguments were advanced before us in regard to the validity of the policy decision dated th December with reference to Article of the Constitu tion we shall proceed to consider this question It would however be convenient if we first examine two minor conten tions urged on behalf of We do not think this contention has any substance There is nothing in the policy decision dated th December which is contrary to the Rules made under the Act Section of the Act clearly provides that the Excise Commissioner may license the construction and working of a distillery and there was therefore nothing contrary to the Act or the Rules in the Excise Commissioner issuing Letter of Intent in favour of each of respondent Nos granting licence for construction of a new distillery The argument that there was no general or special order made by <ORG> pursuant to the policy decision dated th December which would bring the case within the fourth mode set out in Rule XXII is equally futile There the section which came up for consideration was section of the Bihar and Orissa Excise Act <ORG> adopted the method of selling the exclusive privilege by private negoti ations and this was challenged on behalf of the petitioners on the ground that the Government could sell the exclusive privilege by private negotiations only if an order was made under section sub section that the privilege in question shall be sold by private negotiations and no such order having been made by <ORG> the sale effected by <ORG> was invalid This decision provides a complete answer to the contention urged on behalf of This view finds complete support from the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> Secre tary <ORG> <ORG> The learned counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> also raised another contention based on the provisions of the Industries Development Regulation Act In the first place no such contention was raised in the writ petitions and neither the State Govern ment nor respondent Nos had any opportunity of answer ing such contention Moreover it is obvious from section read with the definitions of factory and industrial undertaking contained in sub sections and of section of this Act that licence from <ORG> for setting up new distilleries would be neces sary only if or more workers would be working in such distilleries and here in the present writ petitions there is nothing to show that or more workers were going to be employed in the new distilleries That takes us to the next contention urged on behalf of the petitioners in regard to the validity of the policy decision dated th December tested with reference to Article of the Constitution The argument which found favour with <ORG> was and that is the argument which was reiterated before us on behalf of the petitioners that the policy decision dated th December that licence to construct new distilleries should be given only to the existing con tractors and and licences to manufacture and supply it in wholesale to retail dealers liquor in such new dis tilleries should be granted to them alone to the exclusion of other liquor contractors without holding auction or inviting often which would give an opportunity to all liquor contractors interested in setting up new distilleries and manufacturing and supplying liquor to complete for the grant of such licences was arbitrary and irrational and there was no valid justification for selectively preferring the exist ing contractors to other liquor contractors for grant of such licences There are two very effective answers to it given by the learned Attorney General and the learned counsel for Respondent Nos and we shall immediately proceed to discuss them But before we do so we may at this stage conveniently refer to a contention of a preliminary nature advanced on behalf of <ORG> and respondent Nos against the applicability of Article in a case dealing with the grant of liquor licences The contention was that trade or business in liquor is so inherently pernicious that no one can claim any fundamental right in respect of it and Article cannot therefore be invoked by the petitioners Now it is true and it is well settled by several decisions of this Court including the decision in <ORG> etc SCR that there is no fundamental right in a citizen to carry on trade or business in liquor No one can claim as against the <ORG> the right to carry on trade or business in liquor and the <ORG> cannot be compelled to part with its exclusive right or privilege of manufacturing and selling liquor But while considering the applicability of Article in such a case we must bear in mind that having regard to the nature of the trade or business the <ORG> would be slow to interfere with the policy laid down by <ORG> for grant of licences for We had occasion to consider the scope of interference by the <ORG> under Arti cle while dealing with laws relating to economic activi ties in <NAME> <ORG> etc We pointed out in that case that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech religion etc We observed that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or strait jacket formula and this is particular ly true in case of legislation dealing with economic mat ters where having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature We quoted with approval the following admonition give by <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> US In the utilities tax and economic regulation cases there are good reasons for judicial self restraint if not judicial deference to legislative judgment The legislature after all has the affirmative responsibility The courts have only the power to destroy not to reconstruct When these are added to the complexity of economic regulation the uncertainty the liability to error the bewildering conflict of the experts and the number of times the judges have been overruled by events self limitation can be seen to be the path to judicial wisdom and institutional prestige and stability What we said in that case in regard to legislation relating to economic matters must apply equally in regard to execu tive action in the field of economic activities though the executive decision may not be placed on as high a pedestial as legislative judgment in so far as judicial deference is concerned We must not forget that in complex economic matters every decision is necessarily empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method and therefore its validity Cannot be tested on any rigid a priori considerations or on the application of any straight jacket formula The court must while adjudg ing the constitutional validity of an executive decision relating to economic matters grant a certain measure of freedom or play in the joints to the executive It is against the background of these observations and keeping them in mind that we must now proceed to deal with the contention of the petitioners based on Article of the Constitution But apart from this answer to the contention which has found acceptance with us there is another answer which is equally strong and cogent The situation which prevailed at that time in regard to the distilleries was quite disturb<ORG> ing The note prepared by the separate <ORG> for the consideration of <ORG><ORG><ORG> as also the Report of the Vijayvargi <ORG> clearly showed that there was considerable air and water pollution on account of dirty water flowing out of the distilleries and fouling air and water There are four very good reasons why <ORG><ORG><ORG> took this view In the first place the distilleries were in private ownership in almost all the States barring the State of and there was no reason why the State of should not fail in line with what was happening in the other States Thirdly <ORG> would not have to incur any recurring expenditure on maintenance of the buildings and the plant and machinery because in the event of construction of the new distilleries being entrusted to private entrepreneurs maintenance of buildings as well as plant and machinery would become their responsibility and moreover they would have real interest in keeping and maintaining them in good condition Even after the policy decision dated th December was reached by <ORG> neither <ORG> nor <ORG> made any application for grant of licence to construct a new distillery on the same terms on which licences were decided to be granted to the existing contractors It is also significant that while taking a decision to grant licences to the existing contractors to put up new distill eries <ORG> did not wish to create a monopo ly in favour of the existing contractors and <ORG> therefore when entering into the Deed of Agree ment limited the duration of licence to be granted to each of the existing contractors to five years and also left it open to other distillery contractors to come in on the same terms The <ORG> may choose to do so if it thinks fit and in a given situation it may even turn to be advan tageous for the <ORG> to do so but if any private party comes before the <ORG> and offers to set up an industry the <ORG> would not be committing breach of any constitutional or legal obligation if it negotiates with such party and agrees to provide resources and other facilities for the purpose of setting up the industry The <ORG> is not obliged to tell such party Please it In the first place it is difficult to appreciate how any such observation could be made by the learned Judge without any foundation for the same being laid in the pleadings What is necessary is to give full particulars of such alle gations and to set out the material facts specifying the particular person against whom such allegations are made so that he may have an opportunity of controverting such alle gations But no such allegation was at any time made by the petitioners and when the petitioners did not make any such allegation in the pleadings nor even stated as to which authority took monies by way of illegal gratification it is difficult to under stand how the learned Judge could possibly make such an observation The petitioners also did not make any specific imputation of under hand dealing in the writ petitiones and yet the learned Judge inexplicably came to the conclusion that <ORG> was guilty of sinister underhand dealing There is not an iota of evidence to establish or even as much as to indicate that <ORG> was actuat ed by any collateral purpose or was guility of any sinister underhand dealing or was prompted by any currupt motive in reaching the policy decision dated th December There are two important factors which throw considerable light in determining wheth<ORG> er a policy decision is mala fide or motivated by improper considerations Several queries and issues were raised by <ORG> boldly and fearlessly and these queries and issues were fully and frankly dealt with clarifications were given and the entire matter was fully considered There was no attempt at any stage of suppress discussion and debate or to avoid or side<ORG>track or push under the carpet any doubts or questions raised by any of the parties involved in the deliberations The <ORG> Sub Committee therefore felt that the system of rate fixation prevalent in West Bengal was the most beneficial to <ORG> because it provided for rate fixation by an expert Committee which would take into account the escalation or de escala tion in the price of raw materials varying labour cost and fluctuating market conditions every year and arrive at a reasonable rate fair both to the licencee and to <ORG> <ORG> also did not recommend taking over of the plant and machinery of the old distiller ies from the existing contractors against payment of its value with the result that the old plant and machinery remained with the existing contractors and obviously it would have no value because they would not be able to sell it to any one and it would be dead junk in their hands and the price paid by them to the out going licences would be totally lost This allegation did not find favour with Acting Chief Justice <NAME> but it seemed to have impressed <NAME> because he categorically stated in paragraph of his concurring opinion that even if licences were granted to respondent Nos to only for a period of five years <ORG> would suffer a loss of Rs We find it difficult to understand how <NAME> could possibly come to a conclusion that <ORG> would be incurring a loss of Rs crores was arrived at by <NAME> on the assumption that if instead of granting licence to the existing contractors to construct new distilleries and giving them and licences for a period of five years licence was granted to him for the entire territory of the State of Madhya Pradesh and he was able to get liquor from the Ratlam Alcohol plant at the rate of Rs We accordingly allow the appeals of <ORG> and respondents Nos to and dismiss the writ petitions We would however on the facts and circumstances of the present case make no orders as to costs Appeals allowed and Petitions dismissed
