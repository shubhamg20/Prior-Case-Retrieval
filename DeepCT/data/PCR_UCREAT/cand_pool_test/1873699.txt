The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> appeal raises an interesting point of law under the Indian Income tax Act The facts lie within a narrow compass The two companies carried on business of growing and manu facturing tea By rule of the Indian Income tax Rules made in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the Indian Income tax Act it is provided that income derived from the sale of tea grown and manufactured by the seller in the taxable territories shall be computed as if it were income derived from business and of such income shall be deemed to be income profits and gains liable to tax <ORG> confirmed the view that the dividend income could not be treated as agricultural income in the hands of the shareholder and decided in favour of the <ORG> but agreed that its order gave rise to a question of law and formulated the same as set out above and referred it to <ORG> Under section agricultural income means a any rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes and is either assessed to land revenue in the taxable territories or subject to a local rate assessed and collected by officers of the Government as such i Section lays down that the total income of any previous year of any person to be charged must include all income profits and gains from whatever source derived and defines the scope of its application for purposes of tax In order however that dividend may be held to be Agricultural income it will be incumbent upon the appellant to show that within the terms of the definition it is rent or revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes It is true that the agricultural process renders of the profits exempt from tax in the hands of the company from land which is used for agricultural purposes but can it be said that when such company decides to distribute its profits to the shareholders and declares the dividends to be allocated to them such dividends in the hands of the shareholders also partake of the character of revenue derived from land which is used for agricultural purposes Such a position if accepted would extend the scope of the vital words I revenue derived from land beyond its legitimate limits Agricultural income as defined in the Act is obviously intended to refer to the revenue received by direct association with the land which is used for agricultural purposes and not by indirectly extending it to cases where that revenue or part thereof changes hands either by way of distribution of dividends or otherwise There can be no doubt that the I initial source which has produced the revenue is land used for agricultural purposes but to give to the words revenue derived from land the unrestricted meaning apart from its direct association or relation with the land would be quite unwarranted The object appears to be not to subject to tax either the actual tiller of the soil or any other person getting land cultivated by others for deriving benefit therefrom but to say that the benefit intended to be conferred upon this class of persons should extend to those into whosoever hands that revenue falls however remote the receiver of such revenue may be is hardly warranted A shareholder has got no interest in the property of the company though he has undoubtedly a right to participate in the profits if and when the company decides to divide them That judgment negatives the position taken up on behalf of the appellant that a shareholder has got a right in the property of the company The proper approach to the solution of the question is to concentrate on the plain words of the definition of agricultural income which connects in no uncertain language revenue with the land from which it directly springs and a stray observation in a case which has no bearing upon the present question does not advance the solution of the question There is nothing in the Indian law to warrant the assumption that a shareholder who buys shares buys any interest in the property of the company which is a juristic person entirely distinct from the shareholders He has undoubtedly a further right to participate in the assets of the company which would be left over after winding up but not in the assets as a whole as Lord <NAME> puts it <ORG> expressed the view that until a dividend is declared there is no right in a shareholder to participate in the profits and according to them the declaration of dividend by the company is the effective source of the dividend which is subject to tax The shares or other interest of any member in a company are personal estate transferable in the manner provided by its articles and are not of the nature of real estate In fairness to Mr <NAME> it must however be stated that the contention was not so broadly put but there is no reason why one should stop at a particular stage and not pursue the analogy to its logical limits It was held that it was neither rent nor revenue derived from land within the meaning of section of the Income tax Act Lord <NAME> who delivered the judgment of <ORG> used the following piquant language in coming to that conclusion The word derived is not a term of art It was held that the assessee received no agricultural income as defined by the Act but that he received a remuneration under a contract for personal service calculated on the amount of profits earned by the employer payable not in specie out of any item of such profits but out of any moneys of the employer avail Able for the purpose and that the remuneration therefore was not agricultural income and was not exempt from tax money paid under a contract imposing personal liability on the covenantor the discharge of which was secured by a charge on I Reference was also made to some English decisions but they have no bearing upon the present case as they were founded on the English Income tax law and the provisions of the particular statute We accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs
