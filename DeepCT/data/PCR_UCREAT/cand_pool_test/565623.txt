Indian income tax Act by the <ORG> act by the <ORG> act the Indian Income tax Act by the <ORG> so as to the authorise the levy of the authorise the levy of tax on income accuring in the territory of Rajasthan in the year ie therefore valid The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> is an appeal from an order of <ORG> directing by writ issued under article of the Constitution that the Union of India appellant herein should not levy income tax on the income of the respondent accruing arising or received in Rajasthan excluding the area of the former covenanting State of Bundi prior to April By clause of the Instrument the <ORG> accepted all matters enumerated in Lists I and III of the Seventh Schedule to the Act <ORG> Act as matters in respect of which <ORG> may make laws for the United State provided that nothing contained in the said Lists or in any other provisions of the Act shall be deemed to empower <ORG> to impose any tax or duty in the territories of the United State or prohibit the imposition of any duty or tax by the Legislature of the United State in the said territories The position thus was that <ORG> had no power to make any law imposing any tax or duty in the territories of the United State of Rajasthan In July however <ORG> appointed by <ORG> submitted their report recommending among other things the financial integration of the acceding States and the imposition of the Indian income tax in their territories as from the first day of April The Constitution of India then came into force on January It created a new <ORG> for the <ORG> called <ORG> and empowered that <ORG> by article to make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India subject to the provisions of the Constitution and by article read with entry No of List it conferred exclusive power to make laws with respect to taxes on income other than agricultural income In exercise of that power and pursuant to there commendation of <ORG> referred to above <ORG> enacted the Finance Act Act XXV of providing by section that income tax and super tax shall be charged for the year beginning on the first day of April i at the rates specified in Parts I and respectively of the First Schedule to that Act Now the scheme of the Indian Act is to tax a person resident in the taxable territories during the previous year on all his income of the previous year whether accruing within or without the taxable territories and to tax a person not resident in the taxable territories upon his income accruing within the taxable territories during the previous year Residence in the taxable territories has to be determined in accordance with the provisions of section A which in the case of an individual takes into account his having been in such territories within the five years preceding the year of assessment It is however argued on his behalf by Mr <NAME> that section of the Finance Act having substituted the amended clause But where as in the rest of the territory of Rajasthan no income tax was leviable on the income of the year the amendment by the Finance Act which took effect only from April did not on its true construction bring I Bom This argument found favour with the learned Judges in <ORG> but we are unable to accept it arising to him in Rajasthan during the year would be taxable though Rajasthan was not part of the taxable territories in that year for in the case of a person resident in the taxable territories income accruing or arising to him without the taxable territories is also chargeable to tax under section sub section clause sub clause Even assuming it were necessary for the <ORG> to bring the case within proviso iii in order to sustain the charge on the respondent income accruing in Rajasthan during the year we are of opinion that the construction placed by the learned Judges on that clause cannot be supported Charge of income to tax and its computation are matters governed by other provisions of the Indian Act <NAME> And as the expression is used in the charging section in connection with the conditions which are to determine liability to tax sub clause iii of clause of the definition must when read with section of the Indian Act have reference to chargeability of income After referring to the decision of <ORG> to which reference has been made the learned Judges say There are three stages in connection with the imposition of a tax In the first place under section of the General Clauses Act the repeal of the State law as from April did not affect any liability incurred under the repealed enactment and secondly though the language used in section is very complicated a careful perusal makes it clear that the State law is not only kept alive for the purpose of levy assessment and collection of incometax the income of the year but also for the above purposes in the subsequent year It will be seen that the basis on which this reasoning proceeds is that section of the Finance Act saves the operation of the States laws relating to income tax in Part States in the year for the purpose of levy assessment and collection and it is those laws that imposed the liability to tax on the income accruing in those States during that year If immediately before the st day of April there is in force in any Part State other than Jammu and Kashmir or in Manipur Tripura or Vindhya Pradesh or in the merged territory of Cooch Behar any law relating to income tax or supertax or tax on profits of business that law shall cease to have effect except for the purposes of the levy assessment and collection of income tax and super tax in respect of any period not included in the previous year for the purposes of assessment under the Indian Income tax Act for the year ending on the st day of March or for any subsequent year In other words there remained no State law of income tax in operation in any Part State in the year No doubt there is the phrase or for any subsequent year immediately following the words for the year ending on the st day of March No argument therefore could be logically based on the words or for any subsequent period which evidently were added with a view to catch the income of any broken period prior to April which might otherwise escape assessment both under the repealed Act serve to keep alive the liability to pay tax on the income of the year assuming it to have accrued under the repealed State law for a different intention clearly appears in sections and of the Finance Act read together as indicated above In any case no question of keeping any such liability alive could arise in the present case as admittedly no State law of income tax was in operation in the territory of Rajasthan except the former State of Bundi The legislative powers conferred upon <ORG> under article an article read with List I of the Seventh Schedule could obviously be exercised only after the Constitution came into force and no retro spective operation of the Constitution is involved in the conferment of those powers Article of the Constitution enacts that subject to its provisions <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and article proceeds to distribute legislative powers as between <ORG> and the State Legislatures in the It was said however that the line of decisions like <NAME> <NAME> which defined the powers of legislatures created by <ORG> could have no application to <ORG> which came into life as a new legislature on the commencement of the Indian Constitution It could not be assumed that such a legislature had the power of making a law having retrospective operation in relation to a perio prior to its birth unless the Constitution itself clearly and explicitly conferred such power There is however no question here of the Constitution operating retrospectively in bringing into existence <ORG> or the legislatures of the States The only question is What powers have been conferred upon these legislatures by the representatives of the people who framed the Constitution and in determining that issue the principles laid down in cases The case is thus one where the statute purports to operate only prospectively but such operation has under the scheme of the Indian income tax law to take into account income earned before the statute came into force Such an enactment cannot strictly speaking be said to be retroactive legislation though its operation may affect acts done in the past Dealing with a statute authorising the removal of destitute widows from a parish it was observed in an English case <NAME> St It is however unnessary to pursue this aspect of the matter further as we have held that <ORG> has the power to make retroactive laws Secondly it was said that section of the Government of India Act which gave effect to the stipulation in the Instrument of Accession against the imposition by <ORG> of any tax or duty in the territory of the United State of Rajasthan was kept alive notwithstanding its repeal by article of the Constitution by section of the General Clauses Act which is made applicable to the interpretation of the Constitution by article as a right or privilege acquired under the repealed enactment and so i ii ii continued to operate under article as a con stitutional limitation on the power of <ORG> with the result that <ORG> had no power to impose tax contrary to section of the Government of India Act The argument is somewhat ingenious but there are obvious difficulties in the way of its acceptance For one thing section of the Government of India Act created no right or privilege in the subjects of the United State of Rajasthan which notwithstanding the repeal of that section could be regarded as still enuring for their benefit Section merely imposed a restriction upon the power of <ORG> to make laws for an acceding State inconsistent with the stipulations contained in the Instrument of Accession When that section along with the rest of the Government of India Act was repealed by the new Constitution which has created new legislatures with power to make retroactive laws it is idle to suggest that rights or privileges acquired while the old Constitution Act was in force are preserved for ever for that must be the result of the argument by section of the General Clauses Act which can have no application to such cases It follows that the amendment of section clause A of the Indian Act by the Finance Act so as to authorise the levy of tax on income accruing in the territory of Rajasthan in the year is within the competence of <ORG> and therefore valid We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of <ORG> We make no order as to costs
