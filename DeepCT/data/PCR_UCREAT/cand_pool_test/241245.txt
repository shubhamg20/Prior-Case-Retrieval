In this case the Subordinate Judge has refused to execute a decree passed on the original side of this Court upon the ground that the decree holder had fraudulently brought a suit on the original side of this Court when this Court had no territorial jurisdiction to pass a decree in the suit As the defendants who were then residing outside the local limits of the ordinary original civil jurisdiction of this Court the plaintiff asked for and obtained leave to institute the suit under Clause Letters Patent The suit was not contested and an ex parte decree was obtained which formed the subject matter of the execution and in connexion with which the order appealed from has been made by the Subordinate Judge nothing to show that there was any contract for the repayment of the money in Calcutta as was the plaintiff case and he has held that there is no satisfactory evidence to show that the money was advanced in Calcutta On these grounds he has come to the conclusion that the suit was fraudulently instituted on the original side of this Court and the said Court had no territorial jurisdiction to pass the decree But the limits of the powers of an executing <ORG> in this respect have been very definitely prescribed by the <ORG> decision of this <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra on which the Subordinate Judge purports to have proceeded but which in our opinion he ha entirely misappreciated What has been laid down in that case is this Where a decree presented for execution was made by a <ORG> which apparently had not jurisdiction whether pecuniary or territorial or in respect of the judgment debtor person to make a decree the executing <ORG> is entitled to refuse to execute it on the ground that it was made without jurisdiction The word apparently used in connexion with the proposition laid down by this <ORG> is a word which must always be very carefully kept in view What the proposition means is that the executing <ORG> would be competent to refuse to execute the decree only when on the face of the decree it would appear that the <ORG> which passed it had no jurisdiction The proposition does not mean that if there is a clear statement upon the plaint which gives the <ORG> jurisdiction to entertain a suit and if upon the basis of that jurisdiction the decree is passed by the <ORG> without there being a challenge by the defendant as regards the territorial jurisdiction of the <ORG> to pass the decree it remains open to the defendant to question the jurisdiction of the <ORG> after the decree has been made and in the course of its execution We are of opinion that the learned Judge order is entirely wrong We accordingly allow the appeal and set aside the order appealed against and direct that the execution be entertained and dealt with in accordance with law Hearing fee is assessed at three gold mohurs
