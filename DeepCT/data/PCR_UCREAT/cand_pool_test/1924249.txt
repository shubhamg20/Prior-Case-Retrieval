HEADNOTE The services of the appellant as Assistant Surgeon in the <ORG> Ranchi were terminated purportedly in terms of his contract of employment The appellant did not fall in the categories mentioned in cls a and He did hold a civil post as opposed to a military post but cl further required that it must be under the <ORG> or a <ORG> In view of the existence of shareholders of capital raised by the issuance of shares and the lack of connection between the finances of the corporation and the Consolidated Fund of the <ORG> it must be held that <ORG> was not a department of the <ORG> nor were the servants of it holding posts under the <ORG> ii The contentions sought to be raised by the appellant regarding the validity of the departmental enquiry against him were not touched upon in the High Court judgment nor mentioned in the proposed grounds filed with the application for certificate On October some witnesses were examined in the presence of the appellant The appellant then sent a notice to Mr and Mrs <NAME> charging them with defamation and actually filed a suit on November demanding damages It was stated in the order that the services were being terminated in terms of his employment The appellant thereupon filed a petition under Art His contention was that although the action was ostensibly taken according to the terms of the contract of employment he was really punished and he was entitled therefore to the protection of Art In the appeal before us attempt was made to enlarge the case by arguing other points namely that the enquiry was not properly conducted that the principles of natural justice were violated and that the appellant had no opportunity of defending himself The question that arises in this case is whether the em ployeesof a <ORG> such as <ORG> are entitledto the protection of Art This question can only be answered in favour of the appellant if we hold that the appellant held a civil post under the <ORG> No person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> or an all India service or a civil service or a <ORG> or holds a civil post under the <ORG> or a <ORG> shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Provided that this clause shall not apply a where a person is dismissed or removed or reduced in rank on the ground of conduct which has led to his conviction on a criminal charge where an authority empowered to dismiss or remove a person or to reduce him in rank is satisfied that some reasons to be recorded by that authority in writing it is not reasonably practicable to give to that person an opportunity of showing cause or where the President or Governor as the case may be is satisfied that in the interest of the security of the State it is not expedient to give to that person such an opportunity If any question arises whether it is reasonably practicable to give to any person an opportunity of showing cause under clause the decision thereon of the <ORG> empowered to dismiss or remove such person or to reduce him in rank as the case may be shall be final Clause of the article which gives the protection opens with the words no such person as aforesaid and these words take one back to clause which describes the person or persons to whom the protection is intended to go He held a post which was not borne on any of the standing services He referred in detail to the various provisions in the Articles of Association as also in the Indian Companies Act which rendered the ordinary company law in applicable in certain respects and conferred unlimited powers We must according to him hold that there is no difference between <ORG> and <ORG> and that the service under <ORG> is a service under the <ORG> In our judgment these differences rather accentuate than diminish the applicability of the principle laid down in the English case to our case We must therefore hold that the corporation which is <ORG> in this case is not a department of the <ORG> nor are the servants of it holding posts under the <ORG> The appeal fails and is dismissed but in the circumstances of the case we make no order about costs
