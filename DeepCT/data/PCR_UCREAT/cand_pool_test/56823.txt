the appellant that <ORG> was in error in examining the order of the Magistrate on merits after taking into consideration the documents filed by the respondents which did not form part of the complaint or evidence recorded in support thereof before the Magistrate Allowing the appeal HELD The order of <ORG> suffers from a serious legal infirmity and <ORG> has exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering in revision by question the order of the Magistrate In the following cases an order or the Magistrate can be quashed or set aside a Where the allegations made in the complaint or the statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does not disclose the essential ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the accused Where the allegations made in the complaint are patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused Where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in issuing process is capricious and arbitrary having been based either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly irrelevant or inadmissible and Where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal defects such as want of sanction or absence of a complaint by legally competent authority and the like a At the stage of issuing the process the Magistrate is mainly concerned with allegations made in the complaint or the evidence led and he is only to be prima facie satisfied whether there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused is extremely limited limited to the ascertainment of the truth or falsehood of the allegations made in the complaint on the materials placed by the complainant before the court ii for the limited purpose of finding out whether a prima facie case for issue of process had been made out and iii for deciding the question purely from the point of view of the complainant without at all adverting to any defence that the accused may have In coming to a decision as to whether a process should be issued the Magistrate can take into consideration inherent improbabilities appearing on the face of the complaint or in evidence led by the complainant in support of the allegations Once the Magistrate has exercised judicially the discretion given to him it is not for <ORG> or even this Court to substitute its own discretion for that of the Magistrate or to examine the case on merits with a view to find out whether or not the allegations in the complaint if proved would ultimately end in conviction of the accused The order of the Magistrate was a reasoned one which took into consideration the allegations in the complaint as also the evidence adduced in support of it It was not a case where the Magistrate had passed an order ill a mechanical manner or just by way of routine The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> by which it set aside the order of the Additional Judicial Magistrate First Class Gokak issuing process against respondents in exercise of his discretion under of the Code of Criminal Procedure The facts of the case lie within a very narrow compass and although <ORG> has taken great pains to write a laboured judgment the point involved is short and simple and does not merit a detailed discussion The new Magistrate took up the matter on November and after hearing the complainant he adjourned the case to December and on this day he directed that further inquiry may be made by Superintendent of Police <NAME> and he accordingly referred the matter for inquiry and report to <NAME> <NAME> asking him to submit his report within six weeks Before however he could pass any order he was succeeded by the present Magistrate The appellant filed an application in revision to <ORG> on December against the order of the Magistrate dated December referring the matter to <NAME> for inquiry and report While the application was pending before <ORG> respondents filed a petition before <ORG> praying for an early hearing of the revision and for vacation of the stay order Along with this petition the respondents filed a number of documents including the copies of the petitions sent by the appellant to the Chief Minister and the Speaker We might indicate here that there was absolutely no occasion for the respondents to have filed the documents before <ORG> in a miscellaneous petition nor did they obtain any permission of the Court for filing those documents <ORG> after hearing the revision application filed be the appellant allowed the same mainly on the ground that as the Magistrate had ultimately decided to hold an inquiry into the truth or falsehood of the complaint himself he had no jurisdiction to stop that inquiry and then make a reference to the police afresh Respondents then preferred a revision against this order to <ORG> under of the Code of Criminal Procedure praying that the order of the Magistrate may be quashed In support of the appeal Mr <NAME> submitted that the Magistrate had given cogent reasons for holding that there were sufficient grounds for proceeding against respondents and <ORG> was in error in interfering with the order of the Magistrate by examining the merits of the case after taking into consideration the documents filed by the respondents which could not be looked into by the Magistrate as they did not form part of the complaint or the evidence recorded in support thereof In our opinion the contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellant is well founded and must prevail In the view we take in the instant case it is not necessary for us to enter into the merits of the case at this stage It is well settled by a long catena of decisions of this <ORG> that at the stage of issuing process the Magistrate is mainly concerned with the allegations made in the complaint or the evidence led in support of the same and he is only to be prima facie satisfied whether there are sufficient grounds for proceeding against the accused The learned Judges in some of these cases have been at pains to observe that an enquiry under is not to be likened to a trial which can only take place after process is issued and that there can be only one trial No doubt as stated in sub of itself the object of the enquiry is to ascertain the truth or falsehood of the complaint but the Magistrate making the enquiry has to do this only with reference to the intrinsic quality of the statements made before him at the enquiry which would naturally mean the complaint itself the statement on oath made by the complainant and the statements made before him by persons examined at the instance of the complainant The inquiry is for the purpose of ascertaining the truth or falsehood of the complaint that is for ascertaining whether there is evidence in support of the complaint so as to justify Code of Criminal Procedure is extremely limited limited only to the ascertainment of the truth of falsehood of the allegations made in the complaint on the materials placed by the complaint before the <ORG> It is true that in coming to a decision as to whether a process should be issued the Magistrate can take into consideration inherent improbabilities appearing on the face of the complaint or in the evidence led by the complainant ill support of the allegations but there appears to be a very thin line of demarcation between a probability of conviction of the accused and establishment of a prima facie case against him Thus it may be safely held that in the following cases an order of the Magistrate issuing process against the accused can be quashed or set aside Where the allegations made in the complaint or the statements of the witnesses recorded in support of the same taken at their face value make out absolutely no case against the accused or the complaint does net disclose the essential ingredients of an offence which is alleged against the accused where the allegations made in the complaint are patently absurd and inherently improbable so that no prudent person can ever reach a conclusion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused where the discretion exercised by the Magistrate in issuing process is capricious and arbitrary having been based either on no evidence or on materials which are wholly irrelevant or inadmissible and where the complaint suffers from fundamental legal defects such as want of sanction or absence of a complaint by legally competent authority and the like The cases mentioned by us are purely illustrative and provide sufficient guidelines to indicate contingencies where <ORG> can quash proceedings Applying these principles to the facts of facts present case it seems to US that the present case is not one in which <ORG> should have quashed the proceedings To begin with the order of the Magistrate dated February issuing process against respondents and is a very well reasoned one which takes into consideration the allegations in the complaint as also the evidence adduced in support of it In the first place <ORG> ought not to have considered the document filed by respondents and in the previous revision without obtaining the permission of the Court and particularly when <ORG> itself gave no directions whatsoever to the Magistrate to consider those documents In fact the documents filed by the respondents were mere copies and they were therefore not admissible At any rate at the stage of or of the Code of Criminal Procedure as the accused had no locus standi the Magistrate had absolutely no jurisdiction to go into any materials or evidence which may be produced by the accused who could be present only to watch the proceedings and not to participate in them Having gone through the order of the Magistrate we do not find any error or law committed by him We are constrained to observe that <ORG> went out of its way write a laboured judgment highlighting certain aspect of the case of the accused as appearing from the documents filed of them which they were not entitled to file and which were not entitled in law to be considered For these reasons therefore we arc satisfied that the order of <ORG> suffers from a serious legal infirmity and <ORG> SCI has exceeded its jurisdiction in interfering in revision by quashing the order of the Magistrate We therefore allow the appeal set aside the order of <ORG> dated December and restore the order of the Magistrate issuing process against respondents and At the time of granting the special leave we has directed the <NAME> Judge who was trying the original case resulting from the I lodged before the police to stay proceedings to the extent that the judgment was not to be pronounced until this appeal was disposed of view of the order of the Magistrate issuing process against respondents and which has been confirmed by us the respondents will have to face a supplementary trial and it is not conducive in the interests of justice to allow the other trial to be stayed any further
