Thereupon on the th February the respondent who is one of the daughters of the deceased filed a petition of objection denying the genuineness of the will asserting that <NAME> was not the adopted son and that the withdrawal by <NAME> was the result of collusion and praying to be made a party to the suit Though two sons in law a cousin and a servant of <NAME> were examined not one of them was asked a single question whether <NAME> had adopted <NAME> His evidence was that <NAME> another witness was sitting near <NAME> and repeated what he had said although the witness could hear it himself that at the time of the will being written out <NAME> said There are Rs Some one said Let the will remain in <NAME> keeping and so it was given to him and he took it He said How is that <NAME> said My brother is dead and he has been given Rs The District Judge who saw the witnesses has found that the will was executed by the deceased and that he was of sound disposing mind when he executed it In this case the suspicion if there was one would be that on the morning when the will was said to have been made the deceased was in an unconscious state and unable either to sign the will or to understand what he was doing that is that the witnesses in support of the will were not telling the truth Their Lordships will therefore humbly advise Her Majesty to reverse the decree of <ORG> and order the appeal to be dismissed with costs The respondent will pay the costs of this appeal
