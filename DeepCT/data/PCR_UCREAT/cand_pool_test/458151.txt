JUDGMENT This second appeal raises an important question as to the rights of an insurer to sue in his own name to recover damages from a third party by whose negligence the <ORG> car met with an accident and was totally damaged but who was fully indemnified by the insurer under a comprehensive policy On that question the courts below have differed the lower appellate court in a reversing judgment holding such a suit to be maintainable and decreeing the suit The basis of the insurer claim in the suit was that it was subrogated to the rights of the <ORG> against the defendants including the right to sue and recover damages from them and that in any case it held an assignment from the <ORG> of all his rights The second assistant Judge of the city <ORG> who tried the suit was of the opinion that though plaintiff had armed itself with a letter of subrogation from the assured to the latter rights and remedies in respect of damages caused to his vehicle such a right was not assignable and the latter did not validly clothe the insurer with the right to recover damages On the other hand for the insurer it is urged that in cases of total loss where the insurer had indemnified the <ORG> the insurer is subrogated to the rights and remedies of the <ORG> against third parties by whose negligence the damage is caused by reason of which the insurer is entitled to sue in his own name to recover damages from such third party that on this view as a matter of fact no assignment from the <ORG> of his rights and damages to the insurer will be necessary and that under the English law if an insurer could not sue in his own name on the basis of subrogation but he could do so only on the basis of an assignment it was because of the special rules of pleading there But it should be noted that the fact that an insurer is subrogated to the rights and remedies of the assured does not ipso jure enable him to sue third parties in his own name Halsbury Laws of England <ORG> states in paragraph that subrogation is a right inherent in all contracts of indemnity and further the doctrine of subrogation applies to all contracts of non marine insurance which are contracts of indemnity such as for example contracts of fire insurance motor vehicle insurance and contingency insurance covering non payment of money In paragraph it is again stated Subrogation in the strict sense of the term expresses the right of the insurers to be placed in the position of the assured so as to be entitled to the advantage of all the rights and remedies which the assured possesses against third parties in respect of the subject matter The right does not arise until the insurers have admitted the liability to the assured and have paid him the amount of the loss Actions therefore to enforce such rights must be brought in the name of the assured as a rule and my defence which is valid against the assured as for example that he has released or compromised his right of actin is available to the defendant in such proceedings Thus unless an express assignment of the <ORG> rights has been made to the insurers which will entitle them without his intervention to take action against third parties the insurers must proceed in he name of the <ORG> who may be compelled to lend it for the purpose That was an interesting case of an insurer who having paid the assured an indemnity sued <ORG> a third party whose negligence caused damage to the assured to recoup itself to the extent of the indemnity paid The insurer sued in its own name and one of the contentions before <ORG> was that the insurer could not maintain the action in its own name Lord <NAME> speaking for the <ORG> overruled the contention in these words It is true that subrogation by act of law would not give the insurer a right to sue in a court of law in his own name Though the facts in which was decided by <ORG> were different the doctrine of subrogation as applied to contracts of insurance as in this case has been elaborately discussed and it is made clear that by reason of subrogation defined as it is in a wide sense the will not by itself enable the insurer to maintain an action in its own name to recover from third parties in order to recoup itself It is true that A of the Transfer of Property Act provides for the transfer or assignment of a policy of marine insurance but I do not accept the argument for the appellant that this express enabling provision means that impliedly assignment of insurance policies either before or after loss is prohibited Cal WN takes the same view
