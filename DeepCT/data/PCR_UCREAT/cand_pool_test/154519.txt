HEADNOTE There is a difference between a tax like the income tax and a licence fee for carrying on an occupation trade or business A licence lee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as a restric tion on his fundamental right to carry on his business of the Constitution a citizen has the right to carry on any occupation trade or business and the only restriction on this unfettered right is the author ity of the <ORG> to make a law relating to the carrying on of such occupation trade or business as mentioned in cl of that article as amended by the Constitution First Amendment Act Bye law No provided that any person can sell in wholesale at any place in the town area provided he pays the prescribed fees to the licensee A person who had been carrying on the business of wholesale dealer in vegetables and fruits in his own shop at Jalalabad for a period of seven years applied for protection under Art contending that these bye laws infringed his fundamental right to carry on his trade guaranteed by Art In the absence of any valid law authorising it such illegal imposition must undoubtedly operate as an illegal restraint and must infringe the unfettered right of the wholesale dealer to carry on his occupation trade or business which is guaranteed to him by Art The Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAs This is an application under article of the Constitution made by <NAME> for the protection of his fundamental right of carrying on his business which according to him is being infringed by the respondent The case sought to be made out in the petition may be shortly stated as follows The petitioner is a wholesale dealer in fresh vegetables and fruits at Jalalabad in the district of Muzaffarnagar in the State of Uttar Pradesh and claims to have been carrying on such business for the last years or so at his shop situated in the town of Jalalabad The respondent <ORG> has by auction given the contract for sale of vegetables and fruits and for collecting the commission for the current year to the respondent <NAME> who it is alleged has never dealt in vegetables and fruits The respondent <ORG> has not set up any market nor has it framed any bye laws for issue of licences to the vegetable and fruit merchants Although in terms there is no absolute prohibition against carrying on business as wholesale dealer in vegeta bles and fruits the result of the bye laws requiring the wholesale dealers to pay the prescribed fee of one anna in the rupee to the contractor who holds the monopoly is in effect to bring about a total prohibition of the business of the wholesale dealers in vegetables and fruits In the alterna tive the petitioner contends that the respondent <ORG> has no legal authority to impose a tax of the kind it has sought to do that the imposition of a tax calculated at one anna in the rupee is in the nature of a sale tax and cannot be regarded as a licence fee and such unauthorised impost constitutes an illegal restraint on his fundamental right under article If the bye laws are read from beginning to end the correct posi tion is that <ORG> has lawfully imposed certain taxes on the purchase and sale of fruits and vegetables within the ambit of the Town Area and instead of collecting the aforesaid taxes departmentally the <ORG> finds it more convenient and less expensive to auction the right to collect the taxes and give the contract to the highest bidder or whomsoever it thinks fit and proper There is absolutely no restriction on anybody who wants to purchase or anybody who wants to sell only he must pay the prescribed tax to <ORG> through the Contractor This is clearly the position and it is submitted there is nothing wrong with it legally and no interference of the petitioner rights Bye law expressly provides that any person can sell in wholesale at any place in the Town Area provided he pays the pre scribed fees to the licensee Learned counsel however contends and we think with considerable force and cogency that although in form there is no prohibition against carrying on any wholesale business by anybody in effect and in substance the bye laws have brought about a total stoppage of the wholesale deal ers business in a commercial sense He goes further and urges that the respondent <ORG> has no legal authority to impose this fee of one anna in the rupee on the value of goods sold or auctioned and that such imposition is in the nature of a sale tax rather than a licence fee A licence fee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as a restriction on his right to carry on his business for without payment of such fee the business cannot be carried on at all This aspect of the matter was not raised or considered in the case relied on by the learned counsel and that case therefore has no application to the facts of this case Under article the citizen has the right to carry on any occupation trade or business which right under that clause is apparently to be unfettered There were at the time when the bye laws of the respond ent <ORG> were framed five provisos to this section none of which authorised the imposition of any tax on any business and therefore they have no bearing on the ques tion now under consideration Learned counsel for the respondents however draws our attention to section of the Act which authorises <ORG> by noti fication in the Official Gazette to extend to all or any or any part of any town area any enactment for the time being in force in any municipality in the United Provinces and to declare its extension to be subject to such restrictions and modifications if any as it thinks fit Then he proceeds to draw our attention to Notification No XI dated the th February whereby in supersession of all previous notifications <ORG> in exer cise of the powers conferred by section of the United Provinces Town Areas Act extended the provisions of sections and of the United Provinces Municipalities Act of to all the town area in the United Provinces in the modified form set forth therein It will be noticed that under section as modified as aforesaid the respondent <ORG> is authorised only to make bye laws fixing any charges or fees or any scale of charges or fees to be paid under section and prescribing the times at which such charges or fees shall be payable and designating the persons authorised to receive payment thereof Bye law however allows any person to sell in wholesale at any place in the town area provided he pays the prescribed fees to the licensee In our opinion the bye laws which impose a charge on the wholesale dealer in the shape of the prescribed fee irrespective of any use or occupation by him of immoveable property vested in or en trusted to the management of <ORG> includ ing any public street are obviously ultra vires the powers of the respondent <ORG> and therefore the bye laws cannot be said to constitute a valid law which alone may under article of the Constitution ofimpose a restric tion on the right conferred by article In the absence of any valid law authorising it such illegal impo sition must undoubtedly operate as an illegal restraint and must infringe the unfettered right of the wholesale dealer to carry on his occupation trade or business which is guaranteed to him by article of our Constitution In this view of the matter the petitioner is entitled to a suitable order for protection of his fundamental right The respondent Commit tee will pay the costs of this application to the petition er
