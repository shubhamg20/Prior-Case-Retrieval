It appears that accused Nos and gave a promiss to <NAME> that accelerated promotion would be granted to his son and instead of promoting him to the second standard he would be given a jump and promoted to the third standard In that application he had asked for permission being granted to the undersigned as well as to the officers and men of this <ORG> The learned Magistrate passed a laconic order in the following terms Permission granted Accordingly on th November <NAME> appeared in the witness box but he refused to give evidence claiming privilege under section of the Indian Evidence Act The learned Judge therefore made a reference to <ORG> for the issue of a direction to the said Magistrate to give evidence in the case The case then came up before Judge <NAME> and he framed the charges These applications purport to have been made under section A Criminal Procedure Code which provides Nothing in the Code shall be deemed to limit or affect the inherent power of <ORG> to make such orders as may be necessary to give effect to any order under the Code or to prevent abuse of the process of any <ORG> or otherwise to secure the ends of justice The contentions that were urged by Mr <NAME> on behalf of accused No and Mr <NAME> on behalf of accused No can be summed up under tow heads That being the case the cognizance that was taken on the basis of illegal investigation cannot stand and will have to be quashed We will take up these points one by one So far as the power of the special Judge to take cognizance is concerned we have first of all to consider the provisions of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of The powers of the Special Judge flow from the provisions of the Act of and we have therefore to examine these provisions closely with a view to find out as to what are the powers and functions of a Special Judge It lays down Every offence specified in sub section of section shall be tried by the Special Judge for the area within which it was committed or where there are more Special Judges than one of such area by such one of them as may be specified in this behalf by <ORG> Sub section provides A Special Judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused persons shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal Procedure for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates Sub section in effect provides A special Judge may tender a pardon to an accomplice and in doing so he shall be deemed to have acted under section of the Code of Criminal Procedure Sub section in effect provides The provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall apply to the proceedings before a Special judge so far as they are not inconsistent with this Act and for the purposes of the said provisions <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury or without the aid of assessors and the person conducting a prosecution before a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor Sub section A lays down In particular and without prejudice to the generally of the provisions contained in sub section the provisions of section of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as may be apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge and for the purposes of the said Provisions a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a Magistrate There was a good deal of argument as to whether section Criminal Procedure Code applies to a Special Judge That section empowers a Judicial Magistrate to take cognizance of any offence in any of the following cases a upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge or suspicion that such offence has been committed In that connection he laid emphasis upon the language of sub section Section of the Act of which runs thus A Special Judge may take cognizance of offences without the accused being committed to him for trial and in trying the accused shall follow the procedure prescribed by the Code of Criminal procedure for the trial of warrant cases by Magistrates There is no positive provision under which the Special Judge is clothed with the authority or jurisdiction to take cognizance of an offence If this argument is pushed to its logical conclusion it would mean that under no circumstances a Special Judge has powers to take cognizance of a case There is also another reason as to why section Criminal Procedure Code may not be strictly applicable to the case of a Special Judge and it is this that one of the conditions precedent for the Special Judge taking cognizance is the existence of a valid sanction by the competent authority under Section of the Act of With a view to buttress this line of reasoning Mr <NAME> pointed out that whenever the Code of Criminal Procedure gives power to a <ORG> to take cognizance it also prescribes the manner and the method in which cognizance can be taken In that connection he referred us to section section and section Criminal Procedure Code According to Mr <NAME> in so far as the legislature has not provided the manner in which the Special Judge can take cognizance of an offence there is a lacuna and that lacuna can only be rectified by a suitable amendment Section Criminal Procedure Code is illustrative as to how and under what circumstances the Magistrate can take cognizance of an offence He can act on a report in writing by a police officer and he can also act upon information received from any person and what is more he can also act upon his own knowledge or suspicion that an offence has been committed Mr <NAME> contended that it was very easy for the legislature to have referred to section Criminal Procedure Code and say that the Special judge can take cognizance or may take cognizance in all the cases in which the Magistrate can take cognizance under section Criminal Procedure Code Whatever that may be merely because wide words have been employed and the manner of taking cognizance has not been specifically set out it is not possible to take the view that the Special Judge has no power to take cognizance of an offence for to put such a construction would be to nullify the positive words used by the legislature viz A Special Judge may take cognizance of offencs in section of the Act of In our view section of the Act gives clear authority to the Special Judge to take cognizance of an offence and no limitation as been placed as to how he should do it The powers of the Special Judge in the matter of taking cognizance are wide and untrammelled Section A the Act of provides Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure no police officer below the rank a in the presidency towns of Madras and Calcutta of an Assistant Commissioner of Police in the presidency town of Bombay of a Superintendent of Police and elsewhere of a Deputy Superintendent of Police shall investigate any offence punishable under section section or section A of the Indian Penal Code or under sub section of section of this Act without the order of a presidency Magistrate or a Magistrate of the first class as the case may be or make any arrest therefor without a warrant But the submission of a report in writing by the police is not the only way in which a Special Judge can take cognizance of an offence Originally section of the Act of as it stood before its amendment in provided that the Special Judge is to be appointed for trying offences under section section or section A <ORG> or sub section of section of the Act of So far as investigation into offences under sections to <ORG> is concerned there is no limitation similar to the limitation imposed by section A of the Act of But there may be cases where cognizance in respect of those offences can as well be taken by the magistrate otherwise than no a police report We have therefore no doubt in our mind that the powers of a Special Judge to take cognizance of offences specified in section of the Act of are wide and unlimited He enjoys a special status under the Act and is clothed with such powers as have been given to him by the provisions of the Act But so far as taking cognizance of cases which precedes the trial is concerned special provision has been made in sub section of section of the Act of For that purpose it is not necessary to consider as to whether he is a Magistrate or whether his a <NAME> Judge Sub section lays down Save as provided in sub section or sub section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as they are not inconsistent with this Act apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions the <ORG> of the special judge shall be deemed to be a <ORG> of Sessions trying cases without a jury Mr <NAME> argued that for the purposes other than the purposes mentioned in sub section and of section the Special Judge stands in the position of a Sessions Judge The same argument holds good so far as appeal or revision from the order of the Special Judge are concerned and for which provision has been made in section of the Act of Sub section A which is inserted in provided that the provisions of section Criminal Procedure Code shall apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge and for the purpose of the said provisions a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a Magistrate There is therefore no simple answer to the question as to whether a Special Judge is more of a Magistrate or more of a Sessions Judge Even if therefore it is assumed that none of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure governing the taking of cognizance including Criminal Procedure Code is applicable to a Special Judge still that will not affect his powers of taking cognizance of a case All this discussion has arisen because there is some doubt about the legality of the investigation that was carried on by sub Inspector <NAME> We do not propose to pronounce any opinion on this question except to say that the judgment recorded by <ORG> makes no reference to any concession made by the Government Plaeder and all that is stated in the judgment is that the Government Pleader suggested that the best course to be followed is to direct a fresh investigation by the Superintendent of Police However for the purpose of considering the arguments advanced before us we are prepared to proceed on the footing that the investigation carried out by Sub Inspector <NAME> bore the stamp of illegality and that it was some in violation of the mandatory provisions of section A of the Act of Even so the fact remains that the then Special Judge <NAME> took cognizance of the case issued processes and framed charges against the accused Even if that officer had no authority to carry out the investigation and to submit a charge sheet the fact remains that he did collect certain material and placed it before the sanctioning authority in the first instance and after obtaining the sanction placed it before the Special Judge who was pleased to take cognizance on the basis of that material As pointed out above the Special Judge has wide powers taking cognizance of an offence We are not prepared Judge would not take cognizance against public servants unless a report of the investigation carried out by a duly authorised personing in law which prevents him from doing so Incidentally it was contended that neither the High Court nor the Special Judge had any authority to direct reinvestigation In that connection Mr <NAME> drew our attention to the provisions of sections and Criminal Procedure Code Mr <NAME> contended that to carry on an investigation in a cognizable offence is the privilege of the police and no court has any right or authority to regulate or interfere in any manner with that investigation There is considerable substance in this line of reasoning In respect of two cases the first information disclosed offences falling under section of the Prevention of Corruption Act The Charge sheet in those case were filed on th August by a Sub Inspector of Police <NAME> and it appears that he applied to the Magistrate for permission to investigate into those cases on th March In the case out of which Criminal Appeal No of arose the evidence of <NAME> showed that he took up the investigation after he obtained permission and partly investigated it thereafter On these facts it was held by their Lordships Both these are cases of clear violation of the mandatory provisions of section of the Act of In the Second case the first information disclosed offences against persons who were not public servants The other passage occurs at and it runs thus In our opinion therefore when such a breach is brought to the notice of the <ORG> at an early stage of the trial the <ORG> will have to consider the nature and extent of the violation and pass appropriate orders for such reinvestigation as may be called for wholly or partly and by such officer as it considers appropriate with reference to the requirements of section A of the Act There is considerable substance in this line of argument We will consider the implication of these observations at a later stage of the judgment But there is no reason why the provisions of that section cannot be invoked by the Special Judge particularly so for the purpose of curing a defect or an illegality The defect or illegality in effect nullifies the protection that has been given to the public servants viz By reason of the fact that a police officer of a lower rank carried out the investigation without proper order or sanction from the Magistrate the salutary protection from harassment that has been granted to the accused has been withdrawn and an objection has been taken at the early stage of the trial viz Now it is for the purpose of giving an opportunity to an officer of the specified rank to apply his mind afresh to the question and to come to his own conclusion that reinvestigation is to be directed If it is a matter of substance then there is a possibility of the officer of the specified rank coming to a different conclusion as a result of reinvestigation It must be remembered as has been laid down in <NAME> case that it cannot be maintained that a valid or legal police report is a foundation of the jurisdiction of the court to take cognizance of a case In trap cases where the accused has been caught red handed in the act of accepting a bribe reinvestigation may amount more or less to rehearsal of what has already taken place In most cases there is very little chance of any new material coming to light in the course of reinvestigation If he raises the objection that investigation bears the stamp of illegality reinvestigation would be directed which will take the winds off the sail of defence There is substance in this grievance It will always be open to the accused to plead that miscarriage of justice has been caused by reason of the violation of the mandatory provisions on account of the first investigation having been undertaken by an officer below the designated rank In exceptional cases it may be open to the Special Judge or the Magistrate who has taken cognizance himself to annual the cognizance For instance if the officer to whom re investigation has been entrusted comes to a different conclusion from the one reached by his predecessor in the course of the first investigation it willbe opento the Special Judge who has taken cognizance to proceed to discharge the accused at the very commencement of the trial Assuming for a moment that fresh material has been collected in the course of re investigation that material by itself will not affect the cognizance that has been taken because after all the material has got to be proved in the course of the trial that takes place after cognizance is taken Considering the question from any point of view we feel no hesitation in rejecting the argument viz that re investigation has the effect of effacing the first investigation and superseding the cognizance that has already been taken on the basis of the first investigation That takes us to the second argument viz It has been laid down by the Madras High court in the matter of <NAME> ILR Mad But the <ORG> in according or withholding sanction under section for the prosecution of a public servant in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed by him as such public servant acts purely in its executive capacity and the sanction need not be based on legal evidence The sanction accorded in the present case is not attacked on the ground that the sanctioning authority had not applied his mind to the facts consituting the offence The sanctioning authority must see through the medium of the representations made to him It was not for Mr <NAME> to judge the truth of the allegations made against the appellant by calling for the records of the connected claim cases or other records in connection with the matter from his office We are therefore satisfied that the sanction that was already granted remains valid and there is no need of any fresh sanction after re investigation
