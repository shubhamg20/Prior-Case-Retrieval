This gave the police an opportunity of which they availed themselves of tracing the movements of these persons and identifying the individuality of each Then there is the evidence of the dead man wife <NAME> who describes how her husband was murdered However that may be we must in a case of this kind regard her evidence with caution because whether an accomplice or not she was present at the murder and for weeks thereafter she gave no information about the crime and it is proved that she had illicit intimate relations with the accused It does not seem to me to matter in the least whether you call her an accomplice or not It appears that amongst the villagers who were near the scene of the offence when the murder took place was a boy who happened to see the three persons The deceased wife before the Committing Magistrate stated that she had not seen this boy Before <ORG> she stated that she had seen him On this state of facts the defence might very easily and with no other facts bearing on the point known with some force argue that the woman had changed her story that the earliest known account of the matter which she gave was less favourable to the prosecution case than that she gave to <ORG> and thereon they might very properly found an argument that the witnesses had been tampered with and that the case presented clear indications of that kind of influence which properly ought to raise doubts in the mind of the trying Judge <NAME> evidence no doubt must be received with caution though I do not accept the argument that she is an accomplice On a careful consideration of the evidence and the arguments advanced on behalf of the accused I have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the deceased <NAME> was murdered by the accused It is urged on behalf of the prosecution however that the argument is based upon a misapprehension of facts and that the Sub Inspector has been examined to show that <NAME> stated before the police that she did see a boy at the time Her statement to the police was admittedly reduced to writing and it is common ground that such writing cannot be used as evidence On the other hand it is argued on the strength of Section of the Evidence Act that the right of the prosecution to prove any statement to corroborate the testimony of any witness under that section is not taken away by Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure which only provides that the writing shall not be used as evidence The point is not free from difficulty which is sufficiently reflected in the diversity of judicial opinions bearing on the question I have carefully considered the question and on the whole I incline to the view that looking to the plain language of Section Criminal Procedure Code the writing only is excluded from evidence but the right to prove any statement made to the police by oral evidence to corroborate the testimony of any witness is not taken away by that section in which the <ORG> while directing a retrial ordered that the Chief Constable should be examined as to the statements made to him by the witnesses during the police investigation At the same time I think that under ordinary circumstances the admission of the oral evidence of the statements made to the police when they are reduced to writing is not in keeping with the spirit of Section Criminal Procedure Code and the existence of exceptional circumstances would be absolutely necessary to give any appreciable value to such evidence
