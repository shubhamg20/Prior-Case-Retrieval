There were items under Schedule I including processing of animal or vegetable products industry under Entry The question for consideration in the batch of appeals writ petitions and transferred cases arising out of the notices issued by the concerned assessing authorities de manding water cess from the sugar manufacturers was whether sugar manufacturing industry fell under Entry of Schedule I of the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Cess Act Unless the botani cal meaning is given to the word vegetable it is not possible to conclude sugarcane as vegetable There is no room for any intendment and no room for bringing within the provision of the Cess Act anything by implication The meaning given to the same word occurring in a social security measure or a regulating enactment may not be apposite or Processing essentially effectuates a change in form cantour physical appearance or chemical combination or otherwise by artificial or natural means and in its more complicated form involves progressive action in performing producing or making something The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Leave granted in all Special Leave Peti tions <NAME> In this batch of civil appeals writ petition and trans ferred case a common question of law arises as to whether the industries which manufacture sugar from sugar cane are covered by Entry of Schedule I to the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution Cess Act Central Act of hereinafter called the Cess Act There are also certain provisions relating to constitution of joint boards the details of which need not detain us The cess is payable by every person carrying on any specified industry and every local authority and is calculated on the basis of water consumed by such person or local authority as the case may be for any of the purposes specified in column I of Schedule II to the Act at such rate not exceeding the rates specified in the corre sponding Entry in column II thereof as <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette from time to time specify Specified industry is defined in the Act as meaning any industry specified in Schedule I There are entries in Schedule I and they read as follows SCHEDULE I See Section The concerned assessing authorities have in all the cases under consideration issued notices demanding water cess from the sugar manufacturers on the ground that this industry falls under item processing of animal or vege table products industry On the other hand <ORG> and <ORG> have taken the view that sugar manufacturing industries would not come within Entry of the ist Schedule A writ petition which was filed in <ORG> Bangalore by one of the sugar mills in Karnataka raising similar question has been withdrawn to this Court in transfer peti tion No of to be dealt with along with other appeals raising identical question The question is whether industries manufacturing sugar is covered by Entry that is process ing of vegetable product industry AIR SC with reference to the meaning of the word vegetable in Item of Schedule I to the Bengal Finance Sales Tax Act held That the word vegetable in Item of Schedule I to the Act must be construed as understood in common parlance and it must be given its popular sense meaning that sense which people conversant with the subject matter with which the statute is dealing would attribute to it and so construed it denotes those classes of vegetables which are grown in a kitchen garden or in a farm and are used for the table This Court also observed It has to be borne in mind that this Act with which we are concerned is an Act imposing li ability for cess There is no room for any intendment There is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to tax This Court quoted with the approval a passage from the judgment of <ORG> in <ORG> State of Madhya Pradesh wherein it was held the word vegetable in taxing statutes is to be understood as in common parlance that is denoting class of vegetables which are grown in a kitchen garden or in a farm and are used for the table It was further held that sugarcane is normally considered to be a grass specie and it would not fail within the definition of words green vegetable In the same decision the following passage from the Permanent Edition of Words and Phrases from an American Judgment was quoted with approval Manufacture implies a change but every change is not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation Processing essentially effectuates a change in form contour physical appearance or chemical combination or otherwise by artificial or natural means and in its more complicated form involves progressive action in performing producing or making something There is no room for any intendment and there is no room for bringing within the provision of the Act anything by impli cation Unless we give the botanical meaning to the word vegetable it is not possible to conclude sugar cane as vegetable The meaning given to the same word occurring in a social security measure or a regulating enactment may not be apposite or appropriate when the same word is interpreted with reference to a taxing statute In the context in which the word vegetable is used in Entry vegetable product means product of or made of or out of vegetable If the botanic meaning of vegetable as referring to any and every kind of plant life is to be given then some of the indus tries listed in Schedule I like Paper Industry and Textile Industry and even chemical industry which are covered by other entries could also be brought within Entry We have held already that the industry manufacturing sugar itself is not an industry within the meaning of Entry and a fortio ri the manufacture of alcohol from molasses could not be considered to be an industry within Entry of Schedule I In the result we allow Civil Appeals arising out of SLP Nos of of of and SLP No
