The decree holder applied on for the execution of his decree for over Rs When the judgment debtor appeared in court he put in an application stating various reasons why he should not be arrested in execution of the decree He was examined on his behalf and stated on oath that he had no intention not to pay the decree holder He was cross examined by the decree holder and it came out during cross examination that he had sold certain property to the co operative societies under two sale deeds one for Rs It has been urged for the appellant that this order is bad in law in view of the provisions of Section and in view of no opportunity being given to the judgment debtor to explain how he had utilised the sale consideration he had received Section provides that one mode of the execution of the decree is by arrest and detention in prison and the proviso to the section is Provided that where the decree is for the payment of money execution by detention in prison shall not be ordered unless after giving the judgment debtor an opportunity of showing cause why he should not be committed to prison the <ORG> for reasons recorded in writing is satisfied a that the judgment debtor with the object or effect of obstructing or delaying the execution of the decree i is likely to abscond or leave the local limits of the jurisdiction of the <ORG> or ii has after the institution of the suit in which the decree was passed dishonestly transferred concealed or removed any pare of his property or committed any other act of bad faith in relation to his property or that the judgment debtor has or has had since the date of the decree the means to pay the amount of the decree or some substantial part thereof and refuses or neglects or has refused or neglected to pay the same or that the decree is for a sum for which the judgment debtor was bound in a fiduciary capacity to account Under Rule it made it incumbent on the court to issue a notice calling upon the judgment debtor to appear before the court and show cause why he should not be committed to the civil prison instead of issuing a warrant for his arrest The other amendment made in this rule was the insertion of the proviso to the effect that such a notice would not be necessary if the court was satisfied by affidavit or otherwise that with the object or effect of delaying the execution of the decree the judgment debtor is likely to abscond or leave the local limits of the jurisdiction of the court Notice has to be issued to the judgment debtor whenever the grounds for the arrest of the judgment debtor would be those mentioned in Sub clause ii to Clause a to the proviso of Section or Sub clause and to the proviso of Section The amendment in Rule led to a different procedure at the hearing of the application when the judgment debtor appeared in compliance with the notice issued to him Sub rule of Rule is When a judgment debtor appears before the court in obedience to a notice issued under Rule or is brought before the court after being arrested in execution of a decree for the payment of money the court shall proceed to hear the decree holder and take all such evidence as may be produced by him in support of his application for execution and shall then give the judgment debtor an opportunity of showing cause why he should not be committed to the civil prison It is when the decree holder has led prima facie evidence in support of his application that the judgment debtor has to be given an opportunity of showing cause why he should not be committed to the civil prison The learned Civil Judge does not appear to have called upon the decree holder to lead evidence as required by Order Rule He appears to have examined the judgment debtor either of his own motion or at the desire of the judgment debtor and it was in cross examination of the judgment debtor that this fact was elicited that he had sold away some of his property for Rs If there was nothing on the record which would justify an order against the judgment debtor for the clarification of this point There is nothing on the record to suggest that any such request was made when the judgment debtor had that money with him and that the judgment debtor refused to pay the decree holder In the absence of evidence which could have a bearing on these considerations the court below could not have felt satisfied that the judgment debtor had refused or neglected to pay the decree holder amount within the meaning of Clause to the proviso to Section The learned Civil Judge does not record such a finding The next question is as to what order should be passed in this appeal We therefore allow the appeal set aside the order of the court below and remand the case to the court below for further proceedings as indicated above We further order the respondent to pay the cost of the appeal to the judgment debtor appellants
