The present suit is brought for the purpose of determining certain questions which arise on the construction of his will No express provision is to be found in the will as to what will happen to the house in question on the determination of the plaintiff life estate but there is a provision directing the executors after carrying out the provisions of the will to sell the residue of such of the estate as consists of landed property and to make over the proceeds thereof to <ORG> In the present suit the question as to what may be the effect of these limitations in the event of <NAME> dying and leaving no children without exercising the power of appointment conferred upon him cannot be now decided first because one of the parties to whom the shebaitship is limited is riot Wore the <ORG> and secondly because it is not the practice of the <ORG> to decide questions which may arise on a contingency which has not yet happened and may never happen reliance is placed on the case of <NAME> Bishop of Durham Ves In that case the question was whether a devise could or could not be supported its a charitable gift and it was decided in that case that it could not In interpreting the words of the devise I am bound I think to interpret them if I can in favour of a valid bequest rather than in favour of an intestacy Gifts to poor relatives have been supported as charitable gifts see for example the case of Attorney General Duke of Northumberland Ch and the cases cited in the judgment in that case and if a gift to poor relatives can be supported it appears to me a gift to poor dependents and poor servants can equally well be supported And and it will he given effect to not withstanding the very wide discretion which the testator has given to his executors The last question which arises on the will is what is the residue which is given to <ORG> The residuary devise in favour of that body is in these terms I direct that my executors shall after payment of all my just debts and making due provisions for the objects hereinbefore mentioned and the costs they are likely to incur in the administration of my estate sell the rest and residue of such of my estate as consists of landed properties and my jewellery and furniture and make over the proceeds thereof and all moneys or securities for money of which I may die possessed to <ORG> for the following purposes It was argued that the words used shewed that he had intended to enumerate all the moveable property he had got to dispose of and that effect should he given to that intention It was suggested without being pressed in course of the discussion on the construction of this will that the <ORG> should direct what property the trustees were to set apart for the purpose of raising a yearly sum to be applied for certain religious purposes and it was suggested that a scheme might be framed but I do not think it is necessary for the <ORG> to interfere with the discretion of the executors Will there be any direction to frame a scheme as to the <ORG>
