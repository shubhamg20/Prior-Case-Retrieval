One is an appeal against the order of the Master refusing leave to amend the plaint and the other is for leave to sue on the basis of the plaint sought to be amended The suit is for specific performance of a contract for the sale of certain lands in Salem District entered into at Madras and for an injunction restraining the second defendant from bringing about a breach of the said contract Application No of was filed by the plaintiff for amendment of the plaint consequent on the plaintiff having been made aware sub saquent to the suit that the second defendant claimed to be purchaser of the same property under a sale deed executed in his favour on the th September The application was opposed on the grounds that the amendment could not be allowed as it substantially alters the cause of action secondly that the amendment would covert the suit into a suit for land and this <ORG> would not have jurisdiction to try the suit and thirdly that in any event the amendment petition was incompetent as it was filed without previously obtaining leave of <ORG> to sue in respect of the suit as proposed to be amended The learned Master held in favour of the plaintiff on the first two contentions but dismissed the application on the ground that as amendment substantially alters the cause of action the suit having been filed after obtaining previous leave of <ORG> under clause of the Letters Patent no amendment could be allowed The learned Master however observed that he considered the question as to whether he should grant the plaintiff an adjournment to enable him to apply for leave to sue in regard to the amendment sought but as the obtaining of the leave was a condition precedent to the presentation of the application for amendment he considered that no purpose would be served by an adjournment I have only to consider whether the amendment should be rejected for the reason that this being a suit instituted after obtaining leave to sue under Clause of the Letters Patent no further amendment can be ordered and any cause of action to which the plaintiff has become entitled could only be adjudicated in a separate suit Clause of the Letters Patent provides that <ORG> in exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction shall be empowered to receive try and determine suits of every description if the cause of action shall have arisen either wholly or in case the leave of the <ORG> shall have been first obtained in part within the local limits of the ordinary original Jurisdiction of <ORG> Does the circumstance that previous leave to institute has been obtained in a suit disentitle the plaintiff from asking for an amendment of the plaint in the suit so instituted There are three decisions which were referred to by the learned Master and relied upon as establishing the proposition that no amendment could be allowed in a suit so instituted It is held in Rampurtab Prem sukh Bom that the grant of leave under Clause of the Letters Patent is a judicial act which must be held to relate only to the cause of action contained in the plaint as presented to the <ORG> at the time of the grant that such leave which affords the very foundation of the jurisdiction is not available to confer jurisdiction in respect of a different cause of action which was not judicially considered at the time it was granted that in respect of such a different cause of action leave under Clause cannot be granted after the institution of the suit and therefore the <ORG> cannot try such different cause of action except in another suit duly instituted and further that in suits for which leave to sue under Clause of the Letters Patent is necessary the plaint cannot be afterwards amended In that case the suit was originally instituted by six persons as representing a firm and as the defendant was a resident outside the jurisdiction of <ORG> leave to sue under Clause was obtained before the filing of the plaint On an objection raised by the defendant that his dealings were not with the firm but with an individual amendment of the plaint was asked for and granted and the plaint was amended The defendant then raised the contention that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to try the suit and it was pointed out that the individual who by reason of the amendment proceeded with the suit had not obtained leave under Clause of the Letters Patent and the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to try the suit In Rampurtab Premsukh Bom it was held that the leave granted was confined to the cause or causes of action set forward in the plaint at the time the leave was granted hence the plaint cannot be amended so as to alter the cause of action If an amendment which would alter the cause of action was made it necessarily follows that fresh leave should be obtained in respect of the altered cause of action The two causes of action being thus entirely different and no leave having been obtained when <NAME> the individual desired to carry on the suit this issue must be found against the plaintiff An amendment to a plaint raising a new cause of action upon which a claim is made is not a fresh suit but is an additional claim made in an existing suit The <ORG> leave is previously required in respect of a cause of action before the <ORG> can have jurisdiction to receive the suit in which it is alleged in my opinion the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to receive try and determine the claims upon the causes of action in the amendment to the plaint since leave was not previously obtained in respect of those causes of action before the suit in which those claims are made was instituted in this <ORG> While in agreement with the views of Telang that the grant of leave under Clause of the Letters Patent being a judicial act must relate only to the cause of action contained in the plaint as presented to the <ORG> at the time of the grant and that such leave affords the very foundation of the jurisdiction would not be available to confer jurisdiction in respect of a substantially different cause of action which was not and could not have been judicially considered at the time it was granted it does not necessarily follow that in respect of such a different cause of action leave under Clause cannot be granted after the institution of the suit and that therefore the <ORG> cannot try such a different cause of action except in another suit duly instituted In cases where leave is required in order to enable <ORG> to have jurisdiction right is conferred on <ORG> in its ordinary original civil jurisdiction to receive try and determine such suits provided the leave of the <ORG> is previously obtained Therefore the grant of leave must Be made before <ORG> receives tries and determines the suit and the grant ipso facto vests jurisdiction to receive try and determine such suits But if a <ORG> finds that a cause of action is not inconsistent and that to avoid multiplicity of suits or for the purpose of determining the real question in controversy raised in the suit between the parties or for other reasons an amendment is necessary though based on a different cause of action the <ORG> has ample power to order an amendment of the plaint but in view of the decision in <NAME> <NAME> Bom What all that is required to be complied with to satisfy the provisions of Clause is that in cases where leave is required the High <ORG> has no power to receive a plaint before such leave is granted There is nothing to show that a plaint instituted under Clause would not include an amended plaint and if an amended plaint after obtaining leave to amend is to be received and the cause of action arising therein is to be tried and determined which cannot be done since previous leave is required which alone confers jurisdiction there is no reason why such leave to present an amended plaint should not be granted under Clause on a fresh application stating the cause of action on which the amendment has been applied for and the reasons for grant of leave under Clause AIR Bom where the learned Judge after referring to the decision in <NAME> <NAME> Bom observes that if an amendment which would alter the cause of action was made it necessarily follows that fresh leave should be obtained in respect of the altered cause of action In that case however the point as to want of jurisdiction was raised at the time of the trial of the suit and the learned Judge was of opinion that fresh leave which ought to have been obtained for the amended plaint was not obtained obviously being of the view that such leave could be granted in the case of an amended plaint considers this observation of <NAME> and similar argument based thereon and proceeds to observe that leave was not sought in the case with which he was dealing with respect to the cause of action in the amendment either at the time the application was made to amend or when leave was given for the amendment or when the plaint with the amendment was presented to the <ORG> and states that this omission and the grant of leave to amend the plaint cannot confer upon the <ORG> jurisdiction which it does not possess Eventually however he says that the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to receive try and determine the claims upon the causes of action in the amendment to the plaint since leave wag not previously obtained in respect of those causes of action before the suit in which those claims are made was instituted in this <ORG> I am of opinion that in cases where the <ORG> on an application of the plaintiff considers that the plaint has to be amended so as to include a cause of action which was not originally in the plaint on the ground that such an amendment is necessary it does not prevent the <ORG> from granting such an amendment merety for the reason that it was a suit instituted after obtaining previous leave to sue under Clause of the Letters Patent The appeal is allowed and the order of the Master is set aside and leave to amend the plaint is granted
