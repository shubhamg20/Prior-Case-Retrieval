The appeal is preferred against the judgment of <ORG> <ORG> disposing of Original Application No of with certain directions It was originally filed as a writ petition in <ORG> which on the constitution of <ORG> <ORG> was transferred to the <ORG> The writ petition original application came to be filed in the following circumstances Among the category of Guards in the Railway service there are four categories viz The rule of reservation is applied not only at the initial stage of appointment to Grade but at every stage of promotion The general candidates asked for three reliefs viz It may provide for accelerated promotion but it cannot give seniority also to a reserved category candidate in the promoted category The <ORG> submsitted that seniority is determined on the basis of the date of promotion and since promotion effected applying the forty point roster cannot be said to be an ad hoc promotion a Scheduled Caste Scheduled Tribe candidate promoted earlier to a particular grade becomes senior to another candidate general or otherwise who is promoted to that grade later They submitted that inasmuch as in the higher grades the representation of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes members was quite inadequate the Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes candidates obtained rapid promotions from one grade to another but it is neither contrary to the rules nor is it inconsistent with Articles and To clarify the position further we will enunciate the principles of determining seniority in situations as are under dispute here The <ORG> directed that a fresh seniority list be drawn in the light of the principles enunciated by it in Para and promotions made on that basis The <ORG> rejected the contention of the general candidates that no promotions at all be made for reserved community candidates because quota is full Similarly it rejected the contention of the general candidates petitioners in the original applaication that all promotions in the higher grades shall be made on the basis of the seniority list pertaining to Grade alone But those reserved community candidates who obtained promotion by jumping the queue on the basis of rule of reservation will get the promotion on the basis of the revised seniority list to be prepared in accordance with the directions contained in Para So far as the rule of reservation is considered it has been made applicable to Railway service by orders issued by <ORG> from time to time pursuant to and in obedience to the policy decisions of <ORG> We shall therefore refer to <ORG> circulars alone relevant on this aspect Here too we will refer first to orders applicable to non selection posts Indeed <ORG> letter dated January Pages Chapter VIII dealing with promotion to selection posts of the Brochure shows that even in the case of promotions made on the basis of merit the same principle applies The <ORG> after careful consideration have decided that in the posts filled by direct recruitment on or after the date of issue of this letter reservation may be made for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes both at the time of initial appointment on temporary basis as well as at the time of confirmation In posts filled by promotion however no reservation is admissible at the stage of confirmation of promotees and the existing procedure of confirming employees in order of their panel position may continue The seniority of candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes vis a vis others will continue to be determined as at present i according to the panel position in the case of categories where training is not provided and in accordance with the merit position in the examination where training is provided In the case of non selection posts there is no question of such a panel Once the rule of reservation is remembered that in the higher echelons of administration representation of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes has been inadequate all these years there is nothing surprising if the members of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes get promotions sooner and earlier than the general candidates Sri <NAME> learned counel appearing for the respondents general candidates put forward the following submissions while opposing the contentions of the learned Additional Solicitor General i Article of the Constitution enables the <ORG> to define the extent and nature of the benefits to be extended to the backward classes It is not as if there is only one particular method of providing reservations under the said clause vi A candidate belonging to reserved category appointed promoted on the basis of rule of reservation should not be held entitled to compete for a general vacancy in the roster Sri <NAME> learned counsel appearing for the respondents in Civil Appeal No of for Guards belonging to Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes categories supported the contentions of the learned Additional Solicitor General Clause of Article of the Constitution enables the <ORG> to make any provision for the reservation of appointments or posts in favour of any backward class of citizens which in the opinion of the <ORG> is not adequately represented in the services under the <ORG> III it has been held by the majority in the opinion delivered by one of us <NAME> The question then arises whether clause of Article is exhaustive of the topic of reservations in favour of backward classes Before we answer this question it is well to examine the meaning and content of the expression reservation The question is whether the said words contemplate only one form of provision namely reservation simpliciter or do they take in other forms of special provisions like preferences concessions and exemptions The other type of measure is the one in Thomas There was no provision for reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes in the matter of promotion to the category of <ORG> Clerks There is no reason why such a special provision should not be held to be included within the larger concept of reservation This statement of law makes it clear that there is no uniform or prescribed method of providing reservation The extent and nature of reservation is a matter for the <ORG> to decide having regard to the facts and requirements of each case rendered by one of us <NAME> on behalf of the Bench which included <NAME> and <NAME> JJ Only a concession set out in the judgment was provided in favour of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes candidates with a view to enable them to obtain promotions within Clas I which they may not have obtained otherwise It was held by this Court that such a concession can also be provided under Article In short it is open to the <ORG> if it is so advised to say that while the rule of reservation shall be applied and the roster followed in the matter of promotions to or within a particular service class or category the candidate promoted earlier by virtue of rule of reservation roster shall not be entitled to seniority over his senior in the feeder category and that as and when a general candidate who was senior to him in the feeder category is promoted such general candidate will regain his seniority over the reserved candidate notwithstanding that he is promoted subsequent to the reserved candidate If so the question arises what did the circular letter dated August mean when it spoke on seniority being governed by the panel position In our opinion it should mean the panel prepared by the selecting authority at the time of selection for Grade There is however one situation where this rule may not have any practical relevance In this sense the rule confers a limited benefit a qualified benefit We are of the opinion that the aforesaid circulars letters providing for reservation in favour of Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes candidates rosters and their operation and on the subject of seniority as between general candidates and reserved category candidates being in the nature of special rules prevail over the general instructions contained in Volume I of the Indian Railway Establishment Manual including those contained in Paras and et al Accordingly we agree with the conclusion of the <ORG> in the order under appeal <NAME> though we may not agree with all the reasons given by the <ORG> In this decision it has been held that where the total number of posts in a cadre reserved for reserved candidates are filled by operation of a roster the object of rule of reservation must be deemed to have been achieved and that thereafter there would be no justification to operate the roster Para of the said judgment brings out the reasons for the said rule and the rule itself We see considerable force in the second contention raised by the learned counsel for the petitioners We see no justification to operate the is to operate only till the quota provided under the impugned instructions is reached and not thereafter As and when there is a vacancy whether permanent or temporary in a particular post the same has to be filled from amongst the category to which the post belonged in the roster Similarly if the persons holding the post at points to or to retire then these slots are to be filled from among the general category It has further been held in the said decision that the percentage of reservation has to be worked out in relation to the number of posts which form the cadre strength and that the concept of vacancy has no relevance in operating the percentage of reservation As a matter of fact it is stated that this batch of cases were also posted for hearing before <ORG> along with <NAME> batch of cases but these cases were de linked on the ground that they raise certain other issues which did not arise in <NAME> Be that as it may as a result of the decision in <NAME> and the views findings recorded by us hereinabove the following position emerges i Once the number of posts reserved for being filled by reserved category candidates in a cadre category or grade unit for application of rule of reservation are filled by the operation of roster the object of rule of reservation should be deemed to have been achieved and thereafter the roster cannot be followed except to the extent indicated in Para of Sabharwal While determining the said number the candidates belonging to the reserved category but selected promoted on their own merit and not by virtue of rule of reservation shall not be counted as reserved category candidates ii The percentage of reservation has to be worked out in relation to number of posts in a particular cadre class category or grade unit for the purpose of applying the rule of reservation and not with respect to vacancies <NAME> learned counsel for the general candidates pointed out what according to him are the inequitable and anamolous situations which would follow if the candidate appointed promoted on the basis of rule of reservation is not confined to reserved posts alone and is allowed to compete for general posts as well Sri <NAME> submits that this is precisely what has happened in the case of Railway Guards Sri <NAME> says that in practice the candidates belonging to reserved categories got rapid promotions leaving their erstwhile senior general candidates in the category in which they were originally appointed It is another matter that since then a constitutional amendment has been brought in permitting reservation in promotions to the extent of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes only we need express no opinion on the said amendment This the learned counsel says amounts in effect to punishing the Scheduled Caste candidate at No for his merit These appeals are accordingly disposed of in the above terms and matters remanded to the respective <ORG>s This appeal arises from the judgment of <ORG> <ORG> allowing Original Application No of filed by the respondent <NAME> The posts of Assistant Station Masters in the scale of Rs are filled by direct recruitment through <ORG> to the extent of fifty percent The first respondent Sri <NAME> petitioner in the original application before the <ORG> was promoted to the post of Deputy Station Superintendent Traffic Inspector in the scale of Rs on December The relief granted by the <ORG> is in the following terms In the result we allow the application and pass the following orders We direct the respondents to revise the seniority of the applicants and respondents in the scale of Rs taking into account for the applicant his date of actual promotion and for the respondents to the date on which they would have been granted promotion in that grade but for the preferential treatment based on reservation Not a single candidate among them belongs to general category In other words not only have the <ORG> not observed the principle that the reservation must be vis a vis posts and not vis a vis vacancies but they had also not kept in mind the rule of seniority in the promotion posts enunciated in <ORG> circulars referred to supra There is yet another circumstance the Scheduled Castes Scheduled Tribes candidates cannot be barred from competing for general posts The said Para reads The seniority of candidates belonging to Scheduled Cates and Scheduled Tribes vis a vis others will continue to be determined as at present i according to the panel position in the case of categories where training is not provided and in accordance with the merit position in the examination where training is provided As explained in the main opinion while there is no question of a panel being prepared at the time of promotion to non selection posts a panel has to be prepared for promotion to selection posts This appeal is accordingly allowed and the matter remanded to the <ORG> with a direction to dispose of the original application afresh in the light of the principles enunciated herein There are three vacancies Whether they are to be reverted or not that is the matter for the respondents to decide all such observations which have been made in <NAME> case but the respondents are directed to promote the members of the general community to the extent they are entitled to by adhering to the seniority It is evident that out of the cadre strength of thirteen there were three vacancies on the date of filing of the original application before the <ORG> and of the remaining ten posts only two were occupied by the general candidates and the remaining eight were occupied by the members of Scheduled Castes The original application was filed by three candidates belonging to general category Four are filled up and there are two vacancies The only contention urged by the appellants herein is concluded against the appellants by the decision of this Court in <NAME> referred to hereinbefore
