PETITIONER WORKMEN OF MESSRS FIRESTONE TYRE RUBBER COMPANY OF INDIA Vs RESPONDENT MANAGEMENT OTHERS With connected appeals DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH VAIDYIALINGAM A BENCH VAIDYIALINGAM A DUA I CITATION AIR SCR SCC CITATOR INFO SC SC SC RF SC SC SC SC SC SC SC RF SC ACT Industrial Disputes Act as amended by Industrial Disputes Amendment Act Section A interpretation of Power of <ORG> how far modified Section whether applicable to disputes referred before when it came into force The new section provided that if in the course of the adjudication of an Industrial dispute relating to the discharge or dismissal of a workman <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> is satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified it may by its award set aside the order of discharge or dismissal and direct reinstatement of the workmen or reduce punishment etc The section came into force with effect from December In the present appeals by special leave the two questions that arose for consideration were i whether A had made any changes in the existing legal situation as laid down by this <ORG> and if so to what extent ii whether the section was applicable to industrial disputes which had been already referred for adjudication and were pending as on December it will further have to be found from the words of the section whether it has altered the entire law as laid down in the existing decisions and if so whether there is a clear expression of that intention in the language of the section Even in cases where an enquiry has been held by an employer and a finding of misconduct arrived at the <ORG> can now differ from that finding in a proper case and hold that no misconduct is proved There is no provision either in the Industrial Employment Standing Orders Act or in the Industrial Disputes Act which states that an order of dismissal or discharge is illegal if it is not recorded by a proper and valid domestic enquiry On the other hand the materials on record in the proviso must be held to refer to materials on record before the <ORG> The expression fresh evidence has to be read in the context in which it appears namely as distinguished from the expression materials on record The <ORG> for the purpose of determining the question of misconduct or punishment or relief to be granted to workmen has to act only on the basis of the materials on record before it and There cannot be a proceeding under this section before the section has come into force at also gives an indication that section A applies only to disputes which are referred for adjudication after the section has come into force There are no express words in A which would make it applicable even to disputes referred before it came into force nor could such an inference be gathered by necessary intendment The section therefore does not apply to proceed ings before The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <ORG> In these appeals by special leave two common questions arise for consideration proper interpretation of section A of the Industrial Disputes Act and whether the above section applies to industrial dis putes which have already been referred to for adjudication and were pending as on I dated appointed the th day of December as the date on which the said Act would come into force Accordingly the Amendment Act came into force with effect from December The new section A so inserted runs as follows Powers of Labour Courts <ORG>s and National <ORG>s to give appropriate relief in case of discharge or dismissal of workmen A Where an industrial dispute relating to the discharge or dismissal of a workman has been referred to <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> for adjudication and in the course of the adjudication proceedings <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> as the case may be is satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified it may by its award set aside the order of discharge or dismissal and direct reinstatement of the workman on such terms and conditions if any as it thinks fit or give such other relief to the workmen including the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of discharge or dismissal as the circumstances of the case may require Provided that in any proceeding under this section <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> as the case may be shall rely only on the materials on record and shall not take any fresh evidence in relation to the matter Regarding section A in the Statement of objects and reasons it is stated as follows In <ORG> and another their workmen AIR at <ORG> while considering the <ORG> power to interfere with the management decision to dismiss discharge or terminate the services of a workman has observed that in case of dismissal on miscon duct the <ORG> does not act as a court of appeal and substitute its own judgment for that of the management and that the <ORG> will interfere only when there is want of good faith victimisation unfair labour practice etc In accordance with these recommendations it is considered that the <ORG> power in an adjudication proceeding relating to discharge or dismissal of a workman should not be limited and that the <ORG> should have the power in cases wherever necessary to set aside the order of discharge or dismissal and direct reinstatement of the workman on such terms and conditions if any as it thinks fit or give such other relief to the workmen including the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of discharge or dismissal as the circumstances of the case may require For this purpose a new section A is proposed to be inserted in the Industrial Disputes Act There is no controversy that in all the four appeals the reference had been made long before the date of coming into force of section A and the industrial disputes were pending adjudication at the hands of the concerned authorities on On behalf of the companies it appears to have been urged that the section does not apply to the disputes which had already been referred to for adjudication and that the management had a right to adduce evidence to justify the action taken against the workmen even though no enquiry had been held before the order of discharge or dismissal had been passed and also in cases where the enquiry held is found to be defective or if the enquiry conducted by it was found to be defective has no right to adduce evidence before the authority to justify its action <ORG> by its order dated April has held that the restrictions imposed upon the powers of <ORG> or <ORG> to interfere with orders of dismissal passed by the management have been removed by section A which has the effect of affecting the substantive part of the law of master and servant and therefore the said section has no retrospective effect <ORG> has held that section A applies even to all proceedings pending adjudication as on as it only deals with matters of procedure The said Court has further held that the new section makes it clear that there must be a proper enquiry by an employer before dismissing or discharging a workman and that if no enquiry has been held or if the enquiry held is found to be defective there is no option but to reinstate the employee In this view <ORG> has further held that an employer under those circumstances has no right to adduce evidence in the adjudication proceedings to justify his action Against all these three orders the company has filed appeals The management and the workmen concerned in certain other disputes have also intervened in these appeals and they have placed before us copies of the orders passed by other authorities The said section comes into play only after the court has come to a conclusion that the enquiry held by an employer was proper Both parties have still a right to adduce evidence to prove the legality or otherwise of the domestic enquiry Even if no enquiry has been held by an employer or if the enquiry is held to be defective reinstatement cannot be ordered straightway as urged by the labour On the other hand an employer has got a right to adduce evidence to justify the action taken by him Similarly in Reference I A No of <ORG> in its order dated January has held that the section is retrospective in its operation and that the employer has got a right to lead evidence before <ORG> if the domestic enquiry has not been held or is found to be defective From what is stated above it is clear that there is a very wide divergence of views expressed by the various authorities both regarding the applicability of the section to pending proceedings as well as the interpretation to be placed on the said section We will first take up the question regarding the proper interpretation to be placed on section A The contentions of Mr <NAME> learned counsel who advanced the main arguments in this regard on behalf of the workmen are as follows Originally limitations had been placed by judicial decisions in respect of the jurisdiction of <ORG> When considering the action of an employer in the matter of discharge or dismissal of a workmen It a domestic enquiry had been held by an employer on the basis of which a workman is dismissed or discharged <ORG> can interfere with the decision of the management only if the domestic enquiry is vitiated by the circumstances mentioned by this Court in <ORG> Another Their workmen Once the <ORG>s hold that the domestic enquiry has been conducted properly and the action of an employer is bona fide and the conclusions arrived at therein are plensible they had no jurisdiction to substitute their own judgment Even in cases where the domestic enquiry is held to be defective or even if no domestic enquiry had been conducted by an employer before passing an order of termination or discharge the employer was given an opportunity to adduce evidence before the <ORG> to justify his action Once the <ORG> accepts that evidence and holds that the misconduct is proved it had no power to interfere with the discretion of the management regarding the quantum of punishment When a dispute is referred for adjudication and it is found that the domestic enquiry conducted by the management is defective or if it is found that no domestic enquiry at all had been conducted the order of discharge or termination passed by the employer becomes without anything more Unjustified and <ORG> have no option but to direct the reinstatement of the workmen concerned as his discharge or dismissal is illegal Even if the enquiry proceedings are held to be proper and the finding of misconduct is also accepted the <ORG> has now power to consider whether the punishment of dismissal or discharge was necessary for the type of misconduct of which the workman is found guilty In such circumstances the <ORG> can also give any other relief to the workman including the imposing of a lesser punishment Various decisions of this court have emphasised that there is an obligation on the part of an employer to hold a proper enquiry before dismissing or discharging a workman And it has also been stated that the enquiry should conform to certain well defined principles and that it should not be an empty formality He referred us to certain decisions of this Court in sup port of his contentions that the opportunity that was so far directed to be given to an employer to adduce evidence for the first time before the <ORG> was not by way of recognising a right in an employer but really for the benefit of the workman who will otherwise be jeopardised by a further enquiry being conducted by the employer after filling up the lacunae that are Mr <NAME> was prepared to accept that even now it is open to the parties to adduce evidence before the <ORG> strictly limited to the validity or otherwise of a domestic enquiry conducted by an employer Mr <NAME> however was prepared to take a slightly different stand regarding the proviso to section A According to him only such evidence which could and should have been produced by the parties in the domestic enquiry is not allowed to be adduced before the <ORG> Mr <NAME> learned counsel who advanced the leading arguments on behalf of the employers broadly contended as follows The restrictions imposed upon the jurisdiction exercised by <ORG> in respect of disputes arising out of orders passed by way of dismissal or discharge as laid down by this <ORG> in a number of decisions over a period of years have not been altered by the new section The right of an employer to manage his affairs in his own way provided he does not act arbitrarily is kept intact The <ORG> will not interfere with the finding recorded by an employer in a proper enquiry merely on the ground that it would have come to a different conclusion But under section A after the <ORG> holds that the enquiry has been conducted properly by an employer and that the finding about misconduct is correct it has jurisdiction to consider whether the punishment requires modification If it holds that the punishment has to be modified it has power to do so and award a lesser punishment This is the only modification regarding the powers of the management that has been introduced by section A Neither the fact that no enquiry at all has been held by an employer nor the circumstance that the enquiry if any He however referred us to the provisions of section of the Act It will lead to an anomaly if it is held that the <ORG> can straightaway order reinstatement merely because no domestic enquiry has been held or the domestic enquiry conducted is defective for one reason or other We have broadly indicated above the stand taken on behalf of the workmen and the employers regarding the interpretation of section A There are several decisions of this <ORG> as also of the Labour Appellate <ORG> laying down the principles in this regard but we will refer only to a few of them Sup CI late Tribunal held that the decision of the Management in relation to charges against the employee will not prevail if a there is want of bona fide or it is a case of victimisation or unfair labour practice or violation of the principles of natural justice or there is a basic error of facts or there has been a perverse finding on the materials In <NAME> <ORG> Muzafferpur <ORG> <ORG> Muzaffarpur the Labour Appellate <ORG> has recognised the right of a management to ask for permission to adduce evidence for the first time before the <ORG> to justify its action though no domestic enquiry had been held by it We may say that this decision was in respect of a proceeding under section of the Act but as held by this Court there is no difference in such matters whether the <ORG> was deciding a dispute referred to it under section or an application filed before it under section of the Act In discussing the nature of the jurisdiction exercised by <ORG> when adjudicating a dispute relating to dismissal or discharge it has been emphasised by this Court in <ORG> as follows Undoubtedly the management of a concern has power to direct its own internal administration and discipline but the power is not unlimited and when a dispute arises <ORG> have been given the power to see whether the termination of service of a workman is justified to give appropriate relief It will interfere i when there is want of good faith ii when there is victimisation or unfair <ORG> practice iii when the management has been guilty of a basic error or violation of a principle of natural Justice It was further emphasised that There is another principle which has to be borne in mind when the tribunal deals with an industrial dispute arising from the dismissal of an employee We have already pointed out that before an employer can dismiss his employee be has to hold a proper enquiry into the alleged misconduct of the employee and that such an enquiry must always begin with the supply of a specific charge sheet to the employee The effect of an employer not holding an enquiry has been stated as follows But it follows that if no enquiry has in fact been held by the employer the issue about the merits of the impugned order of dismissal is at large before the tribunal and on the evidence adduced before it <ORG> has to decide for itself whether the misconduct alleged is proved and if yes what would be proper order to make It was contended on behalf of the workmen that when once the domestic enquiry was found to be defective the tribunal had no option but to dismiss the application filed by an employer for approval and that it cannot allow an employer to adduce evidence before it justifying its action This Court rejected this contention as follows When an application for permission for dismissal is made on the allegation that the workman has been guilty of some misconduct for which the management considers dismissal the appropriate punishment the <ORG> has to satisfy itself that there is a prima facie case for such dismissal Where there has been a proper enquiry by the management itself the <ORG> it has been settled by a number of decisions of this <ORG> has to accept the finding arrived at in that enquiry unless it is perverse and should give the permission asked for unless it has reason to believe that the management is guilty of victimisation or has been guilty of unfair labour practice or is acting mala fide But the mere fact that no enquiry has been held or that the enquiry has not been properly conducted cannot absolve the <ORG> of its duty to decide whether the case that the work man has been guilty of the alleged misconduct has been made out In the above decision this Court quoted with approval the decision of <ORG> in Buckingham and <ORG> supra holding that the materials on which a <ORG> acts may consist of entirely the evidence taken by the management at the enquiry and the proceedings of the enquiry or that evidence and in addition thereto further evidence led before the <ORG> or evidence placed before the <ORG> for the first time in support of the charges The important effect of the omission to hold an enquiry is merely this that the tribunal would not have to consider only whether there was a prima facie case but would decide for itself on the evidence adduced whether the charges have really been made out The powers of a <ORG> when a proper enquiry has been held by an employer as well as the procedure to be adopted when no enquiry at all has been held or an enquiry held was found to be defective again came up for consideration in Management of Ritz Theatre If the enquiry has been properly held the order of dismissal passed against the employee as a result of such an enquiry can be challenged if it is shown that the conclusions reached at the departmental enquiry were perverse or the impugned dismissal is vindictive or mala fide and amounts to an unfair labour practice Again regarding the procedure to be adopted when there has been no enquiry or when there has been a defective enquiry it was stated It has also been held that if it appears that the departmental enquiry held by the employer is not fair in the sense that proper charge had not been served on the employee or proper or full opportunity had not been given to the employee to meet the charge or the enquiry has been affected by other grave irregularities vitiating it then the position would be that the <ORG> would be entitled to deal with the merits of the dispute as to the dismissal of the employee for itself In other words where the <ORG> is dealing with a dispute relating to the dismissal of an industrial employee if it is satisfied that no enquiry has been held or the enquiry which has been held is not proper or fair or that the findings recorded by the Enquiry Officer are perverse the whole issue is at large before the <ORG> It is well settled that if the enquiry is held to be unfair the employer can lead evidence before the <ORG> and justify his action but in such a case the question as to whether the dismissal of the employee is justified or not would be open before the <ORG> and the <ORG> will consider the merits of the dispute and come to its own conclusion without having any regard for the view taken by the management in dismissing the employee The workmen were also given an opportunity to adduce evidence in rebuttal Before this Court it was contended on behalf of the workmen that when no enquiry whatever had been conducted by the employer as required by the Standing Orders before passing an Order of dismissal or discharge the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to hold an enquiry itself by permitting the employer to adduce evidence be fore it for the first time in rejecting this contention it was held It is now well settled by a number of decisions of this Court that where an employer has failed to make an enquiry before dismissing or discharging a workman it is open to him to justify the action before the tribunal by leading all relevant evidence before it In such a case the employer would not have the benefit which he has in cases where domestic inquiries have been held The entire matter would be open before the tribunal which will have jurisdiction not only to go into the limited questions open to a tribunal where domestic inquiry has been property held but also to satisfy itself on the facts adduced before it by the employer whether the dismissal or discharge was justified If the enquiry is defective or if no enquiry has been held as required by Standing Orders the entire case would be open before the tribunal and the employer would have to justify on facts as well that its order of dismissal or discharge was proper A defective enquiry to our opinion stands on the same footing as no enquiry and in either case the tribunal would have jurisdiction to go into the facts and the employer would have to satisfy the tribunal that on facts the order of dismissal or discharge was proper The reasons for allowing an employer to lead evidence before the <ORG> justifying his action have been stated thus If it is held that in cases where the employer dismisses his employee without holding an enquiry the dismissal must be set aside by the industrial tribunal only on that ground it would inevitably mean that the employer will immediately proceed to hold the enquiry and pass an order dismissing the employee once again In that case another industrial dispute would arise and the employer would be entitled to rely upon the enquiry which he had held in the meantime This course would mean delay and on the second occasion it will entitle the employer to claim the benefit of the domestic enquiry On the other hand if in such cases the employer is given an opportunity to justify the impugned dismissal on the merits of his case being considered by the tribunal for itself and that clearly would be to the benefit of the employee That is why this <ORG> has consis tently held that if the domestic enquiry is irregular invalid or improper the tribunal may give an opportunity to the employer to prove his case and in dealing so the tribunal tries the merits itself This view is consistent with the approach which industrial adjudication generally adopts with a view to do justice between the parties without relying too much on technical considerations and with the object of avoiding delay in the disposal of industrial disputes Therefore we are satisfied that no distinction can be made between cases where the domestic enquiry is invalid and those where no enquiry has in fact been held Similarly the management has also a right to defend the action taken by it on the round that a proper domestic inquiry has been held by it on the basis of which the order impugned has been passed It is a right given to the management and it is for the management to avail itself of the said opportunity It has been emphasised that when no enquiry has been held by an employer or when the enquiry held has been found to be defective the employer has got a right to adduce evidence before the <ORG> justifying its action We have exhaustively referred to the various decisions of this <ORG> as they give a clear picture of the principles governing the jurisdiction of the <ORG> when adjudicating disputes relating to dismissal or discharge From those decisions the following principles broadly emerge The right to take disciplinary action and to decide upon the quantum of punishment are mainly managerial functions but if a dispute is referred to a <ORG> When a proper enquiry has been held by an employer and the finding of misconduct is plausible conclusion flowing from the evidence adduced at the said enquiry the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to sit in judgment over the decision of the employer as an appellate body Even if no enquiry has been held by an employer or if the enquiry held by him is found to be defective the <ORG> in order to satisfy itself about the legality and validity of the order has to give an oppor tunity to the employer and employee to adduce evidence before it The effect of an employer not holding an enquiry is that the <ORG> would not have to consider only whether there was a prima facie case A case of defective enquiry stands on the same footing as no enquiry to consider the evidence placed before it for the first time in justifications of the action taken only if no enquiry has been held or after the enquiry conducted by an employer is found to be defective It has never been recognised that the <ORG> should straightaway without anything more direct reinstatement of a dismissed or discharged employee once it is found that no domestic enquiry has been held or the said enquiry is found to be defective An employer who wants to avail himself of the opportunity of adducing evidence for the first time before the <ORG> to justify his action should ask for it at the appropriate stage The giving of an opportunity to an employer to adduce evidence for the first time before the <ORG> is in the interest of both the management and the employee and to enable the <ORG> itself to be satisfied about the alleged misconduct Once the misconduct is proved either in the enquiry conducted by an employer or by the evidence placed before a <ORG> for the first time punishment imposed cannot be interfered with by the <ORG> except in cases where the punishment is so harsh as to suggest victimisation At the time of introducing section A in the Act the legislature must have been aware of the several principles laid down in the various decisions of this <ORG> referred to above The object is stated to be that <ORG> should have power in cases where necessary to set aside the order of discharge or dismissal and direct reinstatement or award any lesser punishment To invoke section A it is necessary that an industrial dispute of the type mentioned therein should have been referred to <ORG> for adjudication If it comes to such a conclusion tile <ORG> has to set aside the order and direct reinstatement of the workman on such terms as it thinks fit The <ORG> has also power to give any other relief to the work man including the imposing of a lesser punishment having due re gard to the circumstances We cannot accept the extreme contentions advanced on behalf of the workmen and the employers Another principle to be borne in mind is that the Act in question which But we should not also lose sight of another canon of interpretation that a statute or for the matter of that even a particular section has to be interpreted according to its plain words ind without doing violence to the language used by the legislature Therefore it will have to be found from the words of the section whether it has altered the entire law as laid down by the decisions and if so whether there is a clear expression of that intention in the language of the section We will first consider cases where an employer has held a proper and valid domestic enquiry before passing the order of punishment Previously the <ORG> had no power to interfere with its finding of misconduct recorded in the domestic enquiry unless one or other infirmities pointed out by this <ORG> in <ORG> existed What was originally a plausible conclusion that could be drawn by an employer from the evidence has now given place to a satisfaction being arrived at by lie <ORG> that the finding of misconduct is correct The limitations imposed on the powers of the <ORG> by the decision in <ORG> If there has been no enquiry held by the employer or if the enquiry is held to be defective it is open to the employer even now to adduce evidence for the first time before the <ORG> justifying the order of discharge or dismissal We are not inclined to accept the contention on behalf of the workmen that the right of the employer to adduce evidence before the <ORG> for the first time recognised by this <ORG> in its various decisions has been taken away There is no indication in the section that the said right has been abrogated Admittedly there are no express words to that effect and there is no indication that the section has impliedly changed the law in that respect This right in the management to sustain its order by adducing independent evidence before the <ORG> if no enquiry has been held or if the enquiry is held to be defective has bean given judicial recognition over a long period of years Having held that the right of the employer to adduce evidence continues even under the new section it is needless to state that when such evidence is adduced for the first time it is the <ORG> which has to be satisfied on such evidence about the guilt or otherwise of the workman concerned Even in cases where an enquiry has been held by an employer and a finding of misconduct arrived at the <ORG> can now differ from that finding in a proper case and hold that no misconduct is proved We are not inclined to accept the contentions advanced on behalf of the employers that the stage for interference under section A by the <ORG> is reached only when it has to consider the punishment after having accepted the finding of guilt recorded by an employer To come to a conclusion either way the <ORG> will have to reappraise the evidence for itself first time the <ORG> originally had no power to interfere with the punishment imposed by the management The power to interfere with the punishment and alter the same has been now conferred on the <ORG> by section A Mr <NAME> rather strenuously urged that in all its pre vious decisions this <ORG> had not considered a breach or an illegality as he calls it committed by an employer in not holding a domestic enquiry The learned counsel urged that this <ORG> has consistently held in several decisions that there is an obligation on the part of an employer to conduct a proper domestic enquiry in accordance with the Standing Orders before passing an order of discharge or dismissal The effect of such an illegal order deprives the employer of an opportunity being given to him to adduce evidence for the first time before the <ORG> to justify his action aspects according to the learned counsel have not been considered by this <ORG> when it recognised an opportunity to be given to an employer to adduce evidence before the <ORG> We have already indicated our views regarding the scope of section A and held that the right of an employer to adduce such evidence before the <ORG> has not been taken away Mr <NAME> referred us to section of the Act prohibiting a workman from going on strike in the circumstances mentioned therein and further pointed out that if a strike is illegal it cannot be lawful But there is no provision either in this statute or in the Act which states that an order of dismissal or discharge is illegal if it is not preceded by a proper and valid domestic enquiry But it is not correct to say that this <ORG> when it laid down that an employer has a right to adduce evidence for the first time before the <ORG> was not aware of a breach committed by an employer of the provisions of the Standing Orders A similar contention though in a different form advanced on behalf of the workmen was rejected by this <ORG> in <ORG> We will now pass on to consider the proviso to Section II A Mr <NAME> relied on the terms of the proviso in support of his contention that it is now obligatory to hold a proper domestic enquiry and the <ORG> can only take into account the materials placed at that enquiry From the wording of the Proviso he wants us to infer that the right of an employer to adduce evidence for the first time has been taken away as the <ORG> is obliged to confine its scrutiny only to the materials available at the domestic enquiry The Proviso specifies matters which the <ORG> shall take into account as also matters which it shall not On the other hand the materials on record in the Proviso must be held to refer to materials on record before the <ORG> Nor does it follow that the <ORG> deprives an employer of his right to adduce evidence for the first time before the <ORG> The expression fresh evidence has to be read in the context in which it appears namely The legislature in section A has made a departure in certain respects in the law as laid down by this Court For the first time power has been given to a <ORG> to satisfy itself whether misconduct is proved The <ORG> has also been given power also for the first time to interfere with the punishment imposed by an employer When such wide powers have been now conferred on <ORG>s the legislature obviously felt that some restrictions have to be imposed regarding what matters could be taken into account It is to be noted that an application made by an employer under section for permission or for approval has still to be dealt with according to the principles laid down by this <ORG> in its various decisions It has been held by this <ORG> that even in cases where no enquiry has been held by an employer before passing an order of dismissal or discharge it is open to him to adduce evidence for the first time before the <ORG> Though the <ORG> is exercising only a very limited jurisdiction under this section nevertheless it would have applied its mind before giving permission or approval They will form part of the materials on record before the <ORG> which adjudicates the main dispute has to ignore those proceedings and straightaway order reinstatement on the ground that no domestic enquiry had been held by an employer it will lead to very startling results This is another reason for holding that the right to adduce evidence for the first time recognised in an employer has not been disturbed by section A But he will certainly be entitled to take disciplinary action for which purpose he can serve a charge sheet and after calling for explanation impose the necessary punishment without holding any enquiry This will be a case where no enquiry at all has been held by an employer We have indicated the changes effected in the law by section A We should not be understood as laying down that there is no obligation whatsoever on the part of an employer to hold an enquiry before passing an order of discharge or dismissal If a proper enquiry is conducted by an employer and a correct finding arrived at regarding the misconduct the <ORG> even though it has now power to differ from the conclusions arrived at by the management will have to give very cogent reasons for not accepting the view of the employer Having dealt with the proper interpretation to be placed on section A we will now proceed to consider the second point regarding the applicability of the section to industrial disputes which had already been referred for adjudication and were pending with the <ORG> on We have earlier referred to the fact that the Amendment Act received the assent of the President on th December It came into force only with effect from December as per the Notification issued by <ORG> on under section Mr <NAME> appearing for the workman in the other Appeals adopted her arguments According to the learned counsel section A applies not only to references which are made on or after but also to all references already made and which were pending adjudication on that date It was stressed that even assuming that an employer has a right to adduce evidence for the first time before the <ORG> that right enures to him only after the <ORG> had adjudicated upon the validity of the domestic enquiry The <ORG> when it adjudicates a dispute on or after has to exercise the powers conferred on it by section A even though the dispute may have been referred prior to that date Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the employers contended that retrospective operation should not be given unless it appears very clearly by the terms of the section or arise by necessary and distinct interpretation The words of the section clearly show that it applies only to disputes in respect of which a reference is made after the section has come into force i The expressions has been referred in the section only signify that on the happening of a particular event namely a reference made in future the powers given to the <ORG> whatever they may be can be exercised Hence we do not propose to refer to those decisions nor to the passages in the text books as the principle is well established that a retrospective operation is not to be given to a statute so as to impair an existing right Miss <NAME> learned counsel placed considerable reliance on the use of the expressions has been referred in section A as indicating that the section Applies even to all references made before reference may be made to section and section A of the Act laying down qualifications for being appointed as a presiding officer of <ORG> or a <ORG> respectively The words has been occurring in these sub sections immediately after the word is or even separately clearly shows that they refer to a past event But is the section so expressed as to plainly make it applicable to such references In our opinion there is no such indication in the section There cannot be a proceeding under this section before the section itself has come into force That also gives an indication that section A applies only to disputes which are referred for adjudication after the section has come into force Section of the Bombay Police Act dealt with the removal of persons convicted of certain offences and not the past participle in the opening part of the section it should be understood that the section was intended to be used only where a person was convicted of the offences re ferred to in section subsequent to the coming into force of the Act This Court differed from the interpretation placed by <ORG> on section of the Bombay <ORG> Act and held that the section enabled the authorities to take note of the convictions of the accused prior to the Act It was observed An offender who has been punished may be res trained in his acts and conduct by some legislation which takes note of his antecedents but so long as the action taken against him is after the Act comes into force the statute cannot be said to be applied retrospectively apply to a statute dealing with the adjective law i procedure It must be stated at this stage that procedural law has always been held to operate even retrospectively as no party has a vested right in procedure The point that arose for consideration was whether the above section operates so as to govern the distribution of dividend under a contract made under a scheme which had taken effect before the Act was passed or came into operation But this form of words is often used to refer not to a past time which preceded the enact ment but to a time which is made past by anticipation a time which will have become a past time only when the event occurs on which the statute is to operate We have already expressed our view regarding the interpreta tion of section A The position further was that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to interfere with the punishment imposed by an employer both in cases where the misconduct is established in a proper domestic enquiry as also in cases where the <ORG> finds such misconduct proved on the basis of evidence adduced before it These limitations on the powers of the <ORG>s were recognised by this <ORG> mainly on the basis that the power to take disciplinary action and impose punishment was part of the managerial functions We have pointed out that this position has now been changed by section A The section has the effect of altering the law by abridging the rights of the employer inasmuch as it gives power to the <ORG> for the first time to differ both on a finding of misconduct arrived at by an employer as well as the punishment imposed by him There is no such express indication A proceeding under the section can only be after the section has come into force In Civil Appeal No of <ORG> had considered only the question regarding the applicability of the section to disputes which had been referred before the section came into force The <ORG> and <ORG>s concerned in all these appeals will proceed with the adjudication of the disputes in accordance with the views expressed in this judgment As Nos allowed in part
