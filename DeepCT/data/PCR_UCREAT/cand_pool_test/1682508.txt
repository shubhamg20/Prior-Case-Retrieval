The questions that fell for consideration were i whether the impugned Act was within the legislative competence of the <ORG> of Kerala ii whether the impugned Act was protected from challenge under Art A of the Constitution The object of ss and seems to be enable the <ORG> to acquire all the lands which do not fall within the categories a and of i It was said that there is conflict because it is <ORG> and not <ORG> which should determine what land is necessary for the efficient working of the plantation but <ORG> has not chosen even if it could to say so It is stated in Travancore Land Revenue Manual Volume IV there are no lands that do not belong to a Janmam and the <ORG> becomes a Janmi by escheat confiscation or otherwise If the <ORG> were to use lands for purposes which have no direct connection with the promotion of agriculture or welfare of agricultural population the <ORG> could be restrained from using the lands for these purposes The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> Two main points arise in this petition under art This deed of ratification laid down the terms and conditions in regard to Government assessment and other matters under which the Government permitted the grantee to hold the land It pro vides inter alia that the grantee can appropriate to his own use within the limits of the grant all timber except the following and such as may hereafter be reserved namely Teak Cole Teak Blackwood Bhony Karoontbaly Sandalwood should he carry any timber without the limits of the grant it will be subject to the payment of <ORG> or Customs Duty The eleventh clause reads The land granted shall be held in perpetuity as heritable or transferable property but every case of transfer of the grant by the grantee shall be immediately made known to the Sircar who shall have the right of apportioning the tax if a portion of the holding is transferred It appears that by this time a company called <ORG> had acquired the rights in the said land from <NAME> The inhabitants of the said tract and all others whom it may concern are hereby informed and warned that they are not to pay any taxes rents or dues or make any other payment to the Poonjar Chief or his representatives or to any person other than an officer of our Government authorised in this behalf in respect of anything in upon or connected with the said tract with the exception however of a payment of rupee three thousand per annum from the successors in interests of the late Mr <NAME> of London and <ORG> now being paid to the said Chief in virtue of a Lease deed executed by the said Chief in favour of the said late Mr <NAME> on the th July and which we are pleased to permit the said Chief to continue to receive We have set out these facts in detail because it will be necessary to appreciate the significance of the documents in order to decide the question whether these lands fall within expression Janmam right in art Other grass lands We may now notice the provisions of the impugned Act The preamble reads as follows Whereas the lands comprising the entire revenue village of Kannan Devan Hills in the Devicolam taluk of the Kottayam district had been given on lease by the then Poonjar Chief to late Mr <NAME> of London and Peermade on the th day of July for coffee cultivation And Whereas the right title and interest of the lessor had been assumed by the former <ORG> And Whereas by such assumption the lands have become the property of the former <ORG> And Whereas <ORG> have be come the successor to the former <ORG> And Whereas large extent of agricultural lands in that village has not been converted into plantations or utilised for purposes of plantation and such lands are not required for the purposes of the existing plantation I And Whereas the Government consider that such agricultural lands should be resumed for the distribution thereof for cultivation and purposes ancillary thereto It would be noticed that in the preamble the State claims that the right title and interest of the Poonjar Chief had been assumed by the former <ORG> and the lands had become the property of the former <ORG> and now <ORG> Vesting of Possession of certain lands Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any contract or other document but subject to the provisions of sub sections and with effect on and from the appointed day the possession of all lands situate in the Kaanan Devan Hills village in the Devicolam taluk of the Kottayam district shall stand transferred to and vest in the <ORG> free from all encumbrances and the right title and SupCI interest of the lessees add all other persons including rights of mortgagees and holders of encumbrances in respect of such lands shall stand extinguished Any person Put in possession of any land under sub section shall be entitled to possess that land on the same terms and subject to the same conditions on or subject to wh ich he was holding such land immediately before the appointed day After we had heard the arguments for some time and it became necessary to adjourn the case the <ORG> obtained permission to amend its reply and raised the point that the lands of the petitioner were gestate within the purview of art We may reproduce the relevant paras We may first deal with the question of legislative competence It seems to us clear that in pith and substance it is a law dealing with entry of List II and entry of List Entry reads Land that is to say rights in or over land land tenures including the relation of landlord and tenant and the collection of rents transfer and alienation of agricultural land land improvement and agricultural loans colonization to control the working of the tea plantation the legislation must be regarded as legislation with respect to entry List I The learned counsel has drawn our attention to various reports to show that the plantation is a self contained unit of <ORG> In the Second five Year Plan While considering the question of exemption from ceilings one of the factors taken into account was the integrated nature of operations especially where industrial and agricultural work are undertaken as a composite enterprise It was recommended that if these considerations are kept in view there would appear to be an advantage in exempting the following categories of farms from the operations of ceilings which may he proposed tea coffee and rubber plantation It seems to us clear that the <ORG> has legislative competence to legislate on entry List and entry List The object of ss and seems to be to enable the <ORG> to acquire all the lands which do not fall within the categories a and of It was held in that case that entry List was subject to entry of the Union List and once a declaration was made and the extent laid down the subject of legislation to the extent laid became an exclusive subject for legislation by <ORG> Once it is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest to control the industry <ORG> can legislate on that particular industry and the States would lose their power to legislate on that industry ture or production would be comprised in Entry of List except where the industry was a controlled industry when it would fall within Entry of List I and the products of the industry would also be comprised in Entry of List except where they were the products of the controlled industries when they would fall within entry of List Chapter III contains provisions to enable control to be exercised over the extension of tea cultivation We may mention that no body has challenged the validity of the Tea Act and we are proceeding on the basis that the Act is valid The Court then examined the question whether the impugned Act would continue in force under art This Court held that the impugned Act provided only for requisition or acquisition of lands in public interest and it had nothing to do with tea industry After examining the scheme of the Act <NAME> observed It is therefore manifest that the Tea Act mainly concerned with the development of the tea industry and it has nothing to do with the requisition or acquisition of lands though the said lands may form part of a tea estate or used for purposes incidental to the tea industry It was said that there is conflict because it is <ORG> and not <ORG> which should determine what land is necessary for the efficient working of the plantation but <ORG> has not chosen even if it could to say so Dealing with the first point there is no doubt that <NAME> was a janmi when the First Concession was granted to the predecessor in interest of the petitioner and if nothing had transpired after that the whole lands would have fallen within the expression janmam right There are no lands that do not belong to some janmi or other If as stated in Travancore Land Revenue Manual Volume IV there are no lands that do not belong to a Janmi and the <ORG> becomes a janmi by gift escheat confiscation or otherwise the effect of the Royal Proclamation of must be that the <ORG> became the Janmi Assuming that the lands do not fall with Janmam Right we may now deal with the second point In the Travancore Land Revenue Manual Vol Regarding Pandaravaka lands it is stated Pandaravaka or Sircar lands are lands of which the <ORG> is the landlord or the Jenmi and whatever rights which vest in the ryots are derived from the Sircar Under clause of the proclamation dated March the holders of Pandaravaka Verumpattom tenure acquired full rights to the soil of the lands and held them subject to the liability to pay <ORG> assessments This <ORG> by majority held that the holders of land held as Pandaravaka Verumpattom were proprietors of the lands and held the lands subject to the liability to pay the assessment to the <ORG> and therefore Pandaravaka Verumpattom would be regarded as local equivalent of an estate under cl of Art <ORG> observed It seems to us that the basic concept of the word estate is that the person holding the estate should be proprietor of the soil and should be in direct relationship with the <ORG> paying land revenue to it except where it is remitted in whole or in part It seems that if it is held that the land does not fall within the expression janmam right it may possibly be covered by the decision of this Court in <NAME> case <NAME> but as arguments were not addressed to us on this point we do not express our final opinion If the State were to use lands for purposes which have no direct connection with the promotion of agriculture or welfare of agricultural population the State could be restrained from using the lands for those purposes
