But in reference <ORG> answered the question in favour of the assessee for it proceeded on the basis that the unit was completed and became ready to go into business after the Act had come into force The criterion for determining the period of exemption is based on the commencement of the operations for establishment of the unit The word set up in clause xxi of of the Act is equivalent to the word established but operations for establishment cannot be equated with the establishment of the unit itself or its setting up The applicability of the proviso has therefore to be decided by finding out when the company commenced operations for establishment of the unit which operations must be antecedent to the actual date on which the company is held to have been set up for purposes of the principal clause The Wealth Tax Officer disallowed the claim on the ground that the unit was set up prior to the date on which the Wealth Tax Act hereinafter referred to as the Act came into force i st April Thereupon at the request of the respondent the following question of law was referred for opinion of <ORG> Whether the aforesaid asset of Rs is exempt under section xxi read with the second proviso thereunder of the Wealth tax Act <ORG> answered the question in favour of the respondent and consequently this appeal has been brought up to this Court by the Commissioner of Wealth Tax Madras by special leave The question that fell for determination depended on the interpretation of section xxi of the Act read with the second proviso to that clause which are reproduced below lm xxi that portion of the net wealth of a company established with the object of carrying on an industrial undertaking in India within the meaning of the Explanation to clause of section as is employed by it in a new and separate unit set up after the commencement of this Act by way of substantial expansion of its undertaking Provided that a Provided further that this exemption shall apply to any such company only for a period of five successive assessment years commencing with the assessment year next following the date on which the company commences operations for the establishment of such unit It has been urged before us by learned counsel for the Commissioner that the main provision of clause xxi should be interpreted in conjunction with the second proviso so as to give a harmonious construction to both parts of the provision with which we are concerned Relying on this principle he urged that we should hold that a new and separate unit is set up only when the company commences operations for the establishment of such unit at that there is no rule that the first or enacting part is to be construed without reference to the proviso The proper course is to apply the broad general rule of construction which is that a section or enactment must be construed as a whole each portion throwing light if need be on the rest The true principle undoubtedly is that the sound interpretation and meaning of the statute on a view of the enacting clause saving clause and proviso taken and construed together is to prevail It is only when the unit has been put into such a shape that it can start functioning as a business or a manufacturing Organisation that it can be said that the unit has been set up The expression used in the proviso under which the period for which the exemption is available is to be deter mined is not the same as used in the principal clause In the proviso the period of five successive years of exemption has to commence with the assessment year next following the date on which the company commences operations for the establishment of the unit The word set up in the principal clause in our opinion is equivalent to the word established but operations for establishment cannot be equated with the establishment of the unit itself or its setting up The applicability of the proviso has therefore to be decided by finding out when the company commenced operations for establishment of the unit which operations must be antecedent to the actual date on which the company is held to have been set up for purposes of the principal clause This is also the meaning that <ORG> derived in the case of <ORG> where that <ORG> was concerned with the interpretation of the expression set up as used in section of the Income tax Act The distinction is this that when a business is established and is ready to commence business then it can be said of that business that it is set up The criterion for determining the period of exemption is based on the commencement of the operations for the establishment of the unit it is the operations for establishment of a unit which ultimately culminate in the setting up of the unit In the statement of the case and in its appellate judgment the <ORG> did not specifically record any finding as to the date when the unit was ready to go into business and to start production On these facts <ORG> and we consider rightly proceeded on the basis that the unit was completed and became ready to go into business only after st April when the Act had already come into force Consequently the condition laid down in the principal clause of xxi was satisfied and the company became entitled to exemption in respect of the value of the assets used up in setting up this unit Learned counsel for the Commissioner however challenged the right of the respondent to claim this exemption on another ground viz It was urged that if it be held that the unit was set up after the Act had come into force on the st April it must also be held that the operations for the establishment of the unit had been commenced by the company almost simultaneously with the unit having been set up and that date would therefore be a date subsequent to the assessment year in which year the exemption was claimed The only contention before the <ORG> on behalf of the Commissioner was that the operations for the establishment of the unit had been commenced by the respondent before the Act came into force and that it should be held that the unit was also set up at the same time when those operations were commenced There was no contention at any stage that the operations for the establishment of the unit were commenced at a subsequent stage In fact it was only for the purpose of urging that the principal clause was not applicable to the case of the respondent that the position was taken up on behalf of the Commissioner that the operations for establishment of the unit had been commenced before st April and the unit must be held to have been set up at the same time when those operations were commenced It does not appear to be necessary for us to express any opinion as to the particular stage at which it can be said that a company commences operations for the establishment of a unit It is not even a question that might have been raised before the <ORG> and the <ORG> might have failed to deal with nor is it a question which may not have been raised before the <ORG> and yet was dealt with by it The question referred to <ORG> had to be answered on the basis that the respondent did commence operations for establishing this unit before st April and the further finding of fact recorded by the <ORG> is that a sum of Rs Since the Act came into force on the st April the financial year was the first assessment year for which tax became chargeable and consequently for purposes of the second proviso to section xxi the assessment year following the commencement of operations for establishment of the unit in the case of any company which commenced the operations any time before the st April will be the assessment year
