Notification declaring that traditional trading activity in old market area be shifted to new market Whether permissible Infringement of fundamental right to carry on trade Whether arises Section empowers the <ORG> by a notification to be published in the Official Gazette to declare its intention of regulating the marketing of such agricultural produce in such areas as may be specified and section provides that the marketing of the agricultural produce shall be regulated under the Act in the area specified in the notification Section provides that no person shall use any place in the market area for the marketing of the declared agricultural produce or operate in the market area or in any market therein as a trader commission agent broker processor weighman measurer surveyor warehouseman or in any other capacity in relation to the marketing of the declared agricultural produce on and after the date on which the declaration under section is made Section provides that section shall not apply to sales by retail sales by an agriculturist who sells his own produce and sales by a person to another for the latter personal consumption The Maharashtra Agricultural Produce Marketing Regulation Rules were promulgated pursuant to the power conferred by section of the Act The proviso to the rule enables the Director of Marketing to authorise <ORG> to permit a trader or commission agent to market declared agricultural produce or to permit any other market functionary to operate at any place within the market area as may be mentioned by <ORG> in the licence granted to such trader The petitioners who were wholesale traders in onions and potatoes in their writ petitions to <ORG> assailed the notices requiring them to carry on business in regulated agricultural produce in the market yard at the specified areas of the State and at no other place contending that the Act did not invest the Director of Marketing or <ORG> with any power to compel a trader to transfer this activity from a previously existing market to a principal or subsidiary market established under section of the Act Rule was inconsistent with section and therefore ultra vires Section of the Act read with sections and of the Maharashtra General Clauses Act vest enough power in the Director to close an existing market and establish it elsewhere includes the power to exercise in like manner to add to amend vary or rescind any notification order rule etc There is a greater possibility of abuse and greater likelihood of the object of the Act being frustrated This cannot lead to the inference that the rule making authority has no power to make a rule banning marketing activity outside the market once the market is established even when such a ban is found to be necessary There was nothing unreal and unreasonable in establishing a single market for a large area There is therefore nothing unreasonable in the statutory declaration of Greater Bombay and Turbhe Village as a market area nor in the establishment of a single market in Turbhe Village for the entire market area When this was sought to be done there were representations by the traders and the <ORG> thought that it was advisable to give the traders sufficient time to enable them to prepare themselves to move into the new market yards We will first recite the facts in one of the cases Writ Petition No of and thereafter consider the questions raised in that as well as the other cases It meant that traders like the petitioner who had for generations been carrying on business in these commodities in Bhavanipeth Nanapeth had perforce to move into Gultekadi market yard if they wanted to stay in the business The petitioner seeks to resist the situation thus sought to be forced upon him and challenges the notification dated October and the consequential notices requiring him to carry on business in regulated agricultural produce in the Gultekadi market yard and at no other place Similarly in Writ Petition Nos to of and Writ Petition Nos to of other traders who are presently carrying on business in the existing market of Bhavanipeth Nanapeth question the notification and the notices following the notification In Writ Petition Nos of and to of the petitioners are wholesale traders in onions and potatoes who carry on their business in the Maulana Azad Road Market in Bombay It was argued on behalf of the petitioners that the Maharashtra Agricultural Produce Marketing Regulation Act did not invest the Director of Marketing or <ORG> with any power to compel a trader to transfer his activity from a previously existing market to a principal or subsidiary market established under Sec There was no provision in the Act by which a trader could be compelled to market declared agricultural produce in the principal or subsidiary market established under Sec It was also submitted that once a principal or subsidiary market was established at one place there was no provision in the Act which enabled the principal or subsidiary market to be transferred to another place In any event it was urged that the notification was an unreasonable restriction on the right of the petitioners to carry on their trade provides that no person shall use any place in the market area for the marketing of the declared agricultural produce or operate in the market area or in any market therein as a trader commission agent broker processor weighman measurer surveyor warehouseman or in any other capacity in relation to the marketing of the declared agricultural produce on and after the date on which the declaration under Sec is made except in conformity with the terms and conditions of a licence granted by <ORG> or by the Director when <ORG> has not yet started functioning shall not apply to sales by retail sales by an agriculturist who sells his own produce and sales by a person to another for the latter personal consumption also may be extracted here Subject to the provisions of this section and of the rules providing for regulating the marketing of agricultural produce in any place in the market area no person shall on and after the date on which the declaration is made under sub section of section without or otherwise than in conformity with the terms and conditions of a licence granted by the Director when <ORG> has not yet started functioning and in any other case by <ORG> in this behalf a use any place in the market area for the marketing of the declared agricultural produce or operate in the market area or in any market therein as a trader commission agent broker processor weighman measurer surveyor warehouseman or in any other capacity in relation to the marketing of the declared agricultural produce Nothing in sub section shall apply to sales by retail sales by an agriculturist who sells his own produce nor to sales by a person where he himself sells to another who buys for his personal consumption or the consumption of any member of his family empowers <ORG> subject to rules made in that behalf and after making such enquiry as it thinks fit to grant or renew a licence for the use of any place in the market area for marketing of the agricultural produce or for operating therein as a trader etc <ORG> may refuse to grant or renew any licence for reasons to be recorded in writing A makes special provision for Greater Bombay and Turbhe village Section empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying into effect the purposes of the Act The proviso to Rule enables <ORG> to authorise <ORG> to permit a trader or Commission Agent to market declared agricultural produce or to permit any other market functionary to operate at any place within the market area as may be mentioned by <ORG> in the licence granted to such trader Rule prescribes the procedure by which any person desiring to use any place in a market area for marketing of any declared agricultural produce or for operating therein as a trader commission agent or broker may obtain a licence There are several other rules providing for the constitution of <ORG> preparation of their budgets discharge of their other duties etc There was a proviso to Sec In October after the amendment came into force Vakhar Bagh was declared as the principal market yard for the market area under the proviso to A of the Act The argument was that Vakhar Bagh had necessarily to be declared as a Principal Market Yard since there was no sub market yard under the proviso to Sec This argument was repelled by <NAME> and <NAME> It was observed at Now A confers upon the <ORG> the power to declare any enclosure building or locality in any market area to be a principal market yard for the area and other enclosures buildings or localities to be one or more sub market yards for the area It is clear that by reason of of the General Clauses Act any power that is conferred on Government can be exercised from time to time as occasion requires It is also clear under of the General Clauses Act that when a power to issue notifications orders rules or bye laws is conferred then that power includes a power to exercise in the like manner and subject to the like sanction and conditions if any to add to amend vary or rescind any notifications orders rules or bye laws so issued under A Government can by issuing notifications from time to time after the principal market yards which have been set up and which did not exist before the passing of the Amending Act Neither the text nor the context of the relevant provisions of the Act warrant such a prohibition and bar and there is no reason to imply any such of the Act empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying into effect the purposes of the Act There is a greater possibility of abuse and greater likelihood of the object of the Act being frustrated this Court had occasion to observe No body can be allowed to establish a purchasing centre of his own at any place he likes in the market area without there being such a permission or authority from <ORG> The latitude given to the rule making authority cannot lead to the inference that the rule making authority has no power to make a rule banning marketing activities outside the market once the market is established even when such a ban is found to be necessary We therefore hold that the rule prescribing that no marketing operation in any declared agricultural produce shall be carried on outside the principal or subsidiary markets is consistent and in consonance with the scheme of the Act and is within the competence of the rule making authority and that it is reasonable Next we pass on to the main submission made on behalf of the petitioners that the transactions between trader and trader and transactions by which the agricultural produce was imported into the market area from outside the market area were outside the purview of the Act and that if Sec If the produce imported from outside the market area were to be exempted from the scope of the market regulation it would only provide an additional opportunity for the traders to circumvent the provisions of the Act and Rules even in respect of the agricultural commodities produced within the market area We are unable to say that the other supervisory measures for which there is provision in the Act are sufficient to make it unnecessary for the traders to move their places of business into the market If all transactions are carried on in the market under the watchful and at the same time helpful vigil of <ORG> and its officers there is surely a greater chance of the success of the objectives of the statute The argument was that Rule which banned marketing of any declared market agricultural produce in any place in a market area other than the principal market or subsidiary market established therein applied only to a sale of the agricultural produce by a producer to trade It has been explained in the counter affidavit filed on behalf of the respondent that the existing markets in Maulana Azad Road and Mahatma Phule Mandal were highly congested and located in areas which were over crowded with the result that it took several hours to even unload onions and potatoes from the trucks which carried them Though the broad scheme of the Karnataka Act is the same as the Maharashtra Act there are some differences which however are not basic In between the market area and the market yard there is to be a market but market does not seem to play any part in the scheme of the Act as it now stands after the amendments The arguments advanced in the Maharashtra and Karnataka cases were advanced in the Bihar cases also It was said that even as there was express provision for inviting and hearing objections before a market area was declared under the Act so should objections be invited and heard before a market yard was established at any particular place it has been pointed out at There is no doubt that a Minister or any other body in making legislation for example by statutory instrument or by law is not subject to the rules of natural justice <NAME> Lord <NAME> of St There is no right to be heard before the making of legislation whether primary or delegated unless it is provided by statutes There is therefore no substance in the invocation of the rules of natural justice Not withstanding the filing of the appeal the State of Bihar chose to issue a fresh notification after observing the procedure prescribed by Rule From the history of events it may appear as if declarations regarding market yards have been made in a most erratic fashion but as pointed out by the learned Attorney General who appeared for the State of Bihar it was not madness There was a method When this was sought to be done there were representations by the traders and the <ORG> appears to have thought that it was advisable to give the traders sufficient time to enable them to prepare themselves to move into the new market yards We therefore see no force in any of the submissions made on behalf of the petitioners All the Writ Petitions and Civil Appeals are therefore dismissed with costs
