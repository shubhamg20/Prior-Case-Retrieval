No of is a suit for partition instituted by the appellant against his brother defendant and his sons defendants to The demand not having been complied with the plaintiff instituted the present suit for partition on According to the plaint the assets of the family consisted of immovable properties in British India and Pudukottai being items to and item No respectively in schedule A to the plaint of jewels and moveables described in schedule and two money lending firms at Minla and Sitkwin in Burma mentioned in schedules and It was further alleged in the plaint that <NAME> the father of the plaintiff and defendant had entered large amounts belonging to the There was a further plea that some of the jewels mentioned in the plaint belonged to the several defendants to the wife of defendant and to his daughters <NAME> and <NAME> as their own and that they were therefore not liable for partition Defendants denied that there was any manipulation of accounts or misappropriation of amounts and contended that accounts should be taken only of the assets as they stood on the date of the partition They also pleaded that the court had no jurisdiction to divide the immoveable properties situate in Burma The plaintiff pleaded that there was a custom in the Nattukottai Chettiar community for a member of the joint family setting up separate family after marriage that monies drawn by him thereafter would be entered in a separate account called Pathuvazhi that at the time of the partition the amounts appearing in the Pathuvazhi account would be debited against the member and that in accordance with this custom the amounts shown in the Pathuvazhi account of defendant should be debited against his share On those pleadings issues were framed on and the suit was posted for trial on Meantime defendant filed on an application under Order Rule for leave to file additional written statement Therein defendant alleged that the deceased <NAME> the father of the plaintiff and defendant herein set apart on two sums Of money of Rs It was also held on issue No that the Court had no jurisdiction to direct a division of immoveable properties not situated in British India On this petition an order was passed on that there was no need to stay all proceedings in No of and that it was sufficient if the passing of the final decree alone was stayed lakhs should be paid to the plaintiff on account There was also a petition under Order Rule that the <ORG> might grant leave to refer the matters to arbitration on behalf of the minor defendants to as it was beneficial to them On the <ORG> passed an order that all matters in dispute in this suit and all matters and proceedings connected therewith be referred to the arbitration of <NAME> of Kandanur and <NAME> of Kothamangalam They complained that the agreement dated to refer to arbitration was brought about by coercion and undue influence that there was no proper enquiry that the arbitrators were partial and biassed and that the award was unjust It was urged that as the reference to arbitration comprised all the matters in dispute in the suit and as division of the immoveable properties in Burma was prayed for in the plaint the reference comprehended a subject over which the <ORG> had no jurisdiction and that therefore it was illegal and that in consequence the award was void He pleaded that there was proper enquiry and that the charges of misconduct were unfounded The Subordinate Judge held that there was no basis for the charges of misconduct levelled against the arbitrators that there was due and proper enquiry and that the award was not open to objection on the merits but he agreed with the defendants that the reference to matters in dispute in the suit comprised also questions relating to immoveable properties in Burma and that it was without jurisdiction and that it also included the dispute relating to the sums of Rs In this <ORG> apart from supporting the judgment of the <ORG> below on the two grounds aforesaid Mr <NAME> the learned counsel for the respondents raised a further contention that under Section Arbitration Act the power of the <ORG> to refer matters in a suit to arbitration could be exercised only so long as judgment has not been delivered and that where judgment has been pronounced as it was in this case on that power comes to an end and there is no jurisdiction in the <ORG> thereafter to refer the dispute to arbitration and that therefore the reference dated is without jurisdiction It was also argued that even if this contention is to be held to be too wide the reference to arbitration should at any rate be limited to matters still remaining to be decided and could not include what had been already decided by the <ORG> and as the reference on was not so limited it was illegal and so was the award passed thereon As a branch of the same argument it was contended that <ORG> before which the appeals against the preliminary decree were pending has seisin of the cause that that <ORG> alone had power to refer to arbitration and that the reference by the Subordinate Judge was without jurisdiction The judgment of the lower <ORG> was also sought to be supported on the ground that the agreement to refer to arbitration was obtained by coercion that there was no proper enquiry by the arbitrators and that the award was liable to be set aside on the merits On these contentions four questions arise for determination Is the reference bad on the ground that it involved the determination of title to immovable properties situated in foreign jurisdiction Is the reference bad on the ground that the Subordinate Judge had lost the power to refer matters in dispute to arbitration by reason of judgment having been delivered on or on the ground that the reference comprehended matters which had been decided by the preliminary judgment or that the Court had no jurisdiction by reason of the appeals against the preliminary judgment having been pending in <ORG> and Is the award vitiated by any misconduct or irregularity We shall deal with the above questions in the order mentioned above The first proposition is that the <ORG> have no jurisdiction to determine questions of title to immoveable properties in foreign countries or to effect a division thereof In Nachiappa Muthukaruppan AIR Mad A this Court had occasion to consider this question elaborately and the substance of the decision is correctly set out in the headnote which runs as follows Neither under Section nor under the rules of private international law has a <ORG> jurisdiction to entertain a suit for partition of immoveable properties situate outside British India for instance in Ceylon especially where the partible nature of such properties is disputed It has no jurisdiction even to declare that the said properties are partible joint family properties Rule Subject to the exceptions hereinafter mentioned the <ORG> has no jurisdiction to entertain an action for the determination of the title to or the right to the possession of any immoveable property situate out of England foreign land or the recovery of damages for trespass to such immoveable There are three exceptions to this rule Whore there is a contract or an equity between the parties with reference to immoveable property where the action is one for the administration of an estate or trust and where the action is for enforcing a maritime lien on a ship or for damage done to an immoveable property situate out of England The learned advocate for the appellants does not contend that <ORG> would have jurisdiction either to decide the question of disputed title with reference to foreign immoveable property or to direct division thereof The second proposition is that a <ORG> which has no jurisdiction to determine any matter in controversy in a suit has no jurisdiction to refer it for determination by arbitrators This stands to reason because the award becomes effective only when a decree is passed thereon and as the <ORG> is bound to pass a decree in terms of the award when it is not open to any objection to recognise a power to refer the dispute relating to foreign immoveables to arbitration would be to assume jurisdiction to pass a decree with reference to such properties It was held that the subject matter of the award must be wholly within the jurisdiction of the <ORG> where it is sought to be filed and as a portion thereof was in Travancore the sub <ORG> at Palghat had no jurisdiction to entertain the application notice is given to the other parties to the arbitration and under para Upon judgment so pronounced a decree shall follow and no appeal shall lie from such decree except in so far as the decree is in excess of or not in accordance with the award Has the <ORG> in British India jurisdiction to pass such a decree Prima facie not His contention is that all these propositions of law have no application to the facts of the present case because there was no dispute about title to immoveable properties in Burma and there was no claim for their partition at the date of reference to arbitration It has already been mentioned that the title of the plaintiff to a half share in the Burma assets including immoveable properties was unequivocally admitted by the defendants in their written statement and therefore there was no question of title in dispute to be adjudicated by the <ORG>s It runs as follows Whether this <ORG> has jurisdiction to divide immoveable properties of the joint family in Burma The Court held by its judgment dated that it had no jurisdiction It is next contended that apart from the reference the award settled questions of title to immovable properties in Burma and that it was therefore void It is argued on behalf of the respondents that the award purports to give a half shape each to the plaintiff and to the defendants in all the Burma assets including the amounts entered in the <NAME> account of the plaintiff and defendant and their accretions that these assets included also immoveable properties that I A No of raised the question of the divisibility of these assets and though it was rejected on by the Subordinate Judge it was pending decision in A No of in <ORG> and that therefore the question of title to the immoveable property in Burma was in dispute at the date of the reference The pleadings in the suit contain an admission of the plaintiff title to these assets and unless and until the additional written statement of defendant is ordered to be received there was no dispute in the suit with reference to foreign immoveables The fact that the order in I A No of was challenged in appeal has not the effect of altering or enlarging the scope of the suit so as to comprehend a dispute in respect of title to foreign immoveables There is therefore no force in this objection It is further contended that under the terms of the award the title of the plaintiff as well as that of the defendants to a half share in the foreign assets including immoveables has been recognised and declared that such a decision has a force and operation independent of the admissions of the parties on which it is based that unlike admissions the effect of the declaration is to conclude the rights of the parties and that therefore it is hit by the rule of private international law that there is no jurisdiction to declare title to foreign immoveable properties But it is only a declaration following upon adjudication by the <ORG> of disputed title to foreign immoveables that is beyond its jurisdiction and where there is no adjudication there is no declaration such as is prohibited by the principles of private international law Though the word declare might be given a wider meaning they are satisfied that the view originally taken by West is right In <ORG> <NAME> AIR there was an award in respect of a claim of <ORG> under a mortgage deed and it provided that in default of payment of the amount due the amount might be realised through civil <ORG> by the sale of all the properties This award was made a rule of <ORG> and a decree was passed in terms thereof The decree was not registered and the question was raised in execution that as it declared rights to immoveable property it was not admissible under Section Registration Act It was held by <NAME> that the decree did not declare any right within the meaning of Section Registration Act and that it was admissible without registration Mr <NAME> argued that even if there was in the award an affirmation of title to foreign immoveable properties that was only incidental and that such incidental declarations are not opposed to any principle of private international law We shall now deal with the second question whether the reference to arbitration contravenes the order in No of There is nothing to prevent the parties themselves settling the matters by compromise notwithstanding this order and likewise there is nothing to prevent them from agreeing to have their disputes settled by arbitration which is in these terms Where in any suit all the parties interested agree that any matter in difference between them in the suit shall be referred to arbitration they may at any time before judgment is pronounced apply in writing to the <ORG> for an order of reference The argument for the respondents is that the <ORG> possess no inherent jurisdiction to refer disputes in pending actions to arbitration that it is a power which must be expressly conferred by statute that Section Arbitration Act is the enactment which confers such a power on the <ORG> that under the terms of that section the power to refer to arbitration can be exercised only at any time before judgment is pronounced that it cannot be exercised thereafter that in this case on the pronouncement of the judgment on the power of the Subordinate Judge to make a reference came to an end It may be conceded that the power to refer to arbitration must he expressly conferred by statute In Abani Bhusan Hemchandra AIR Cal where the point for determination was whether an appellate Court had the power to refer disputes to arbitration there is the following observation in the judgment of <NAME> Whatever the proper view might be we are bound to apply the law as it stands and as the power of referring a case to arbitration is not one that is inherent in a <ORG> we must hold that in the absence of any express provision the appellate <ORG> is not competent to exercise it That section provides that where in a suit all the parties agree that matters in difference in the suit shall be referred to arbitration that might be done at any time before judgment is pronounced What is the meaning of the word judgment in this context Judgment is defined in Section as the statement given by the Judge of the grounds of a decree or order and that is wide enough to cover judgments on applications for injunction appointment of a receiver and so forth and also judgments in the suit on such questions as court fees payable on the plaint To ascertain its true import we must turn to the language of the section itself Section contemplates that any matter in dispute in the suit can be referred to arbitration and therefore a judgment which bars the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to refer any matter to arbitration must be a judgment which does not leave any matter undecided In this context therefore it can only mean a judgment which finally decides all matters in controversy in the suit it does not mean an interlocutory judgment which still leaves any of the matters in dispute undecided Findings on issues though called judgments are not judgments in this sense nor are preliminary judgments even though they decide some of the matters finally because there are still matters to be decided in the suit For the purpose of Section Arbitration Act nothing is a judgment which does not put an end to the suit and so long as an action is pending there can be reference under that section It has been repeatedly held that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code applicable to pending suits apply to suits in which there has been a preliminary but not a final decree The partition has not yet been made and until the partition has been made and the final decree pronounced it could not be said that any decree in terms of the last paragraph of Section has been passed in the case The order that is made and which was made in this case under the first paragraph of Section has no doubt the force of a decree but the question that we have to consider is whether the proceedings that are taken subsequent to such order being passed for the purpose of effecting a partition are proceedings in the suit itself or proceedings in execution of the decree The question has frequently come up as to whether Order Rule is applicable to adjustments made after the preliminary and before a final where a suit has been adjusted the <ORG> shall decree in a suit In <ORG> <ORG> AIR the question was raised whether an adjustment made after the preliminary decree in a mortgage suit came within Order Rule which provides that the adjustment of the decree should be certified and if not certified within time it could not be taken into account <ORG> held that the case was governed by Order Rule which applies to pending suits and not by Order Rule which applies to execution of decrees Admittedly the suit continues until the final decree is passed and there is no time for recording the agreement arrived at as there is under Order In applying Order Rule the <ORG> observed as follows This is a necessary corollary of the view taken by this Court that a preliminary decree does not terminate the suit which continues till a final decree is passed The position being well established that the action is pending until a final decree is passed it follows that there is jurisdiction in the <ORG> to refer the matters in dispute to arbitration until the final judgment is pronounced Mr <NAME> contended that there were reasons of policy why the <ORG> should not have the power to refer matters in dispute to arbitration after a preliminary judgment is pronounced He relies on certain observations occurring in Juggeswur Das Kritartha Moyee Dossee Beng FB There the question was whether under the Civil Procedure Code Act of the appellate <ORG> had the power to refer disputes to arbitration <ORG> of the Calcutta High <ORG> held that the appellate <ORG> had no power under this section to refer disputes to arbitration Thus it is impossible to discover any principle of public policy in negativing the power to refer matters which had been decided by a <ORG> to arbitration It is true that under the Arbitration Act there is authority for holding that the appellate <ORG> has no power to refer disputes to arbitration It would cause a revolution in the existing practice if it is to be held that there is no power in the <ORG> to refer such matters to arbitration Mr <NAME> the learned advocate for the appellant referred to a number of cases in which there was reference to arbitration after preliminary decree had been passed and he relied on them as supporting the position that the power to refer to arbitration could be exercised until the suit terminated by the passing of a final decree In the case in Cal already referred to there was a reference to arbitration in a partition suit after the preliminary decree and that was relied on as saving limitation The question that arose for determination was whether the appeal against that decree was competent In holding that the appeal did not lie <NAME> observed as follows It is next contended that the present ease did not fall within the second schedule of the Civil Procedure Code at all because this schedule is intended to apply to those cases only where a decree is based wholly upon the award of the arbitrators whereas in the present case the final decree is based partly upon a preliminary decree and partly upon the award of the arbitrators This contention must be negatived on the short ground that there is nothing in the Code to prevent the parties from referring the matter in difference between them to arbitration at any stage of the suit and that it is not quite correct to say that the final decree which has been passed in the suit is not wholly based upon the award of the arbitrators The question was whether there was a valid reference to arbitration The fallowing observations occurring at page are relied on by the learned counsel for the appellant as supporting his contention In our view the best analogy is that of a preliminary decree and a final decree and pending the final order of <ORG> On receiving the answers of <ORG> to the reference the suit was still to adopt the language of the arbitration schedule in the Civil Procedure Code pending judgment In our opinion in spite of the reference to <ORG> and not in any way because of the reference to <ORG> or because of anything which <ORG> said this was an arbitration in a suit in which the parties agreed that the matters between them should be referred to arbitration In their Lordships opinion there is no ground for impugning the validity of this award In Lalta Prasad Kedarnath AIR Oudh ZA the facts were that there was a preliminary decree in a partition suit and against that there was an appeal pending It was held that as the suit was pending in that <ORG> until a final decree was passed it had jurisdiction to pass the decree under Order Rule There is no reason why the same principle should not apply to references to arbitration It must therefore be held that the order of reference dated was within the jurisdiction of the Sub <ORG> and that the award could not be impeached on the ground that it was without jurisdiction It is next argued that in any event the reference should have been limited to the matters still remaining to be decided and that as it included all the matters in the suit including those already decided it was illegal It is contended on behalf of the appellant that the award is confined to the matters not decided by the preliminary decree that the decisions of the <ORG> that foreign immoveables could not be divided that defendant was not entitled to remuneration that no contribution need be made for Seer murais had all been adopted in the award and that the objection of the respondents had no foundation on the facts of the case and that therefore the question did not arise for decision Paragraph provides that A No of A No of and A No of should not be prosecuted and it also decides the question of costs in the appeals Under that section all the matters in dispute in the suit could be referred to arbitration without any limit or qualification provided the three conditions mentioned there in are satisfied namely that the reference relates to matters in dispute in the suit that all the parties interested agree to the reference and the suit has not been disposed of by judgment which as already held by us must mean that the suit is pending There is no further limitation under the section that only those matters in dispute could be referred which have not been decided by the <ORG> Once the conditions laid down in the section are satisfied the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to refer the entire subject matter of the suit to arbitration is absolute and unqualified It is finally argued that as appeals against the preliminary decree were pending in <ORG> it was only that <ORG> that could refer the dispute to arbitration and that the Subordinate Judge had no jurisdiction to make the reference This contention again is not sought to be supported either by reference to the language of Section Arbitration Act or by any authority There is nothing in Section to limit the power of the <ORG> to refer matters to arbitration because of the pendency of an appeal so long as the action is pending in that <ORG> its jurisdiction to refer is complete It is contended that it would be inconvenient for two <ORG>s to have concurrent jurisdiction to refer the same matters to arbitration that it will result in a conflict of jurisdiction and that there might even be inconsistent awards But if it is a question of deciding which of two <ORG>s has the power to refer disputes to arbitration there is no reason why the choice should fall on the appellate <ORG> and not on the trial <ORG> It is contended that in respect of matters decided by the preliminary judgment the jurisdiction vests only with the appellate <ORG> and not with the <ORG> of first instance but it can equally be contended that in respect of matters not covered by the preliminary judgment the jurisdiction is exclusively vested in the trial <ORG> and not in the appellate <ORG> Then there was a reference to arbitration and the question was whether it was valid This observation could have no application when the suit itself has not been finally disposed of When once it is conceded that the action is pending until it is finally disposed of by a final decree the <ORG> where it is pending has the power under Section Arbitration Act to refer the matters in dispute to arbitration It was argued that defendant was not a free agent in consenting to the reference to the arbitration and that he signed Ex The only basis for the charge is that defendant had fixed the marriage of his daughter for that the plaintiff having obtained an order for the appointment of a Commissioner to take possession of papers in the possession of defendant on defendant consented to the arbitration with a view to avoid humiliation and disgrace There is no basis for the contention that the plaintiff was not entitled to relief if misappropriation was established and the award of the arbitrators is therefore within their province and further this finding was embodied in para There is no substance in this objection The next objection is that the decision of the arbitrators on the question of jewels was opposed to the judgment in the suit which had declared that the Commissioner should decide whether the gifts of the jewels in favour of the several members of the family pleaded by the defendants was true and was binding on the plaintiff of the award the arbitrators state We have determined that all the jewels comprised in Schedules a and belong to the family in common and no one has any separate right to them This is within the directions given in the preliminary judgment There were some complaints about the valuation of the jewels but that is not a ground for setting aside the award We agree with this finding The interests of defendant were not adverse to that of defendants to and there is no sound reason for holding that defendants to are not bound by the action of defendant The order of the lower Court is therefore set aside and this appeal is allowed and it is directed that a decree be passed in terms of the award But as the matter is one which might be taken in appeal to <ORG> we have considered it desirable to hear all these appeals and record our findings thereon The facts leading up to this appeal have been set out in our judgment in A No of The only point that arises for decision in this appeal apart from the contention in A No of is about the correctness of the order in I A No of whereby the Subordinate Judge declined to receive the additional written statement sought to be filed by defendant The only point for determination in this appeal is whether there is ground for permitting defendant to put forward his present case He could have had no personal knowledge about this matter We are satisfied that there is no substance in the contentions sought to be raised in I A No of and that the Subordinate Judge has exercised a sound discretion in dismissing this application There is no other point in this appeal and it is accordingly dismissed with costs stated that he received some amount as remuneration for the management of a business under an agreement with his brother There is not even a plea in the written statement that this property had been dedicated to charity The contention raised in this appeal is again a question of custom The separate accounts in the names of the members are called Pathuvazhis and the point for determination is whether there is a custom that the amounts standing as debits in the Pathuvazhi accounts could be debited against the shares of the particular members at the time of the partition If the custom pleaded by the plaintiff is to be accepted in its entirety it would mean that in a joint family members have no right of maintenance after marriage a position which is inconsistent with the fundamental character of the joint family The evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiff does not however go so far He is given a certain allowance out of the paternal estate but if he spends more he is debited with the excess amount With reference to the evidence adduced in support of this custom he observed This bold bid at revolutionising the law of partition among Nattukottai Chetties by giving a novel meaning to their thrifty method of upkeeping family accounts failed miserably There is a provision in the award that the Thanathu drawings off each party should be debited against them In the result this appeal also will be dismissed with costs A No of and of These two appeals are against application filed in No of for passing a decree under Order Rule on the ground that the defendants had consented to the interim award
