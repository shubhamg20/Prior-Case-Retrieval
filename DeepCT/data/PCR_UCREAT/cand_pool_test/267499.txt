This appeal is directed against the dismissal of an application filed by the appellant under Section of the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act for rectification of the register by removing the trade mark NG The Assistant Registrar of Trade Marks dismissed the application for rectification by his order dated on the ground that he appellant had not adduced any evidence of the distinctiveness of the word Thennamarakkudi as Postulated under Section that there was no evidence to show that there was a quality in the word Thennamarakkudi which earmarked the appellant goods as distinct from from those of other producers of such goods The appellant took the matter in appeal The learned counsel for the appellant further submits that the evidence does not sustain the finding of the Assistant Registrar that Thennamarakkudi is not a distinctive name for the medicinal preparation made by the appellant and that it is a common name applied to the preparation of the medicinal oil under a formula Thus the main question is whether the first respondent has made out his case that the expression Thennamarakkudi is a common name as used for the preparation of medicinal oil under a particular formula and it is not distinctive of the appellant medicinal preparations But a Perusal of the label which has been registered as his appellants trade mark would show that it contains not only the word Thennamarakkudi but also several other words and therefore the whole label containing the word Thennamarakkudi along with other features should be taken into consideration In this case apart from the use of the word Thennamarakkudi in the appellant label no evidence has been adduced by him to show that he is the only Person manufacturing such a medicinal preparation in that place that the name has come to indicate only the oil manufacture by him and that there are no other persons manufacturing the same oil in the Place Thennamarakkudi there are words whose primary signification is geographical however distinctive they may in fact have become even to allow one trader by registration to seek to monopoliesthem There are other geographical words where for one reason or another when considered as applied to the goods in respect of which it is sought to reLrFter Tujuana Smalls Tm them The appeal having arisen out of the Proceedings for rectification of the first respondent mark we cannot now go into the question as to whether the appellant mark containing the word Thennamarakkudi has been rightly registered in the year word or get up commonly used by traders in connection with their trade and in respect of which no particular trader can claim as exclusive right to use may be considered common to that particular trade Thus words expressions or devices which are descriptive of particular goods are open to use by all persons dealing with those goods it has been held that a word or device which was originally a trade mark The proper test to decide whether a mark which was originally a trade mark has become public juris But there is no clear evidence whether the appellant father at the time of registration of this label intended to claim proprietary right in the word Thennamarakkudi Therefore the appellant cannot be taken to have acquired a proprietary right in the word Thennamarakkudil though he might have acquired the proprietary right in the label by its registration
