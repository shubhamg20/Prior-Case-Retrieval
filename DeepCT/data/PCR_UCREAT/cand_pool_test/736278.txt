The facts are set out in the judgment proposed by my brother <NAME> To say this is to equate processing to manufacture and for this we can find no warrant in law The word manufacture used as a verb is generally understood to mean as bringing into existence a new substance and does not mean merely to produce some change in a substance however minor in consequence the change may be The passage runs thus Manufacture implies a change but every change is not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation But something more is necessary and there must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use There is no order as to costs On st February <ORG> issued a notification under Section A of the Act being Notification No which contained two separate entries one relating to plain glass bangles and the other to ornamented glass bangles The petitioner has challenged the assessment order for the assessment year by means of this writ petition on the ground that the notification referred to above is ultra vires If the State Government makes a declaration under Sub section it may further declare that the turnover in respect of such goods shall be liable to tax at such rate not exceeding ten naye paise per rupee as may be specified There was no separate entry relating to ornamented glass bangles so that all varieties of glass bangles were comprehended within entry No The ornamentation may at best be called processing and there is a well recognised distinction between the two To say this is to equate processing to manufacture and for this we can find no warrant in law The word manufacture used as a verb is generally understood to mean as bringing into existence a new substance and does not mean merely to produce some change in a substance however minor in consequence the change may be The passage runs thus Manufacture implies a change but every change is not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation But something more is necessary and there must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use It was observed by their Lordships at page There is no use to which the groundnut oil can be put for which the hydrogenated oil could not be used nor is there any use to which the hydrogenated oil could be put for which the raw oil could not be used Similarly we consider that hydrogenated oil still continues to be groundnut oil notwithstanding the processing which is merely for the purpose of rendering the oil more stable On this authority of <ORG> it can safely be said in the instant case that ornamentation of glass bangles merely results in bringing into existence a different variety of glass bangles but not a commercially different commodity In the circumstances however I would make no order as to costs There is no order as to costs
