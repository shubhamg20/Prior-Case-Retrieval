For this purpose we quote hereinbelow Section as it stood during the relevant period For the accounting year ending it claimed deduction on account of modernisation and replacement expenses amounting to Rs The question which arises for determination in this case is whether the assessee was entitled to claim the aforestated amounts as current repairs under Section i To complete the chronology of events it may be stated that the assessee claimed the aforestated amounts as deduction in its annual returns Subsequently a Notice under Section was issued to the assessee According to the assessment order the assessee claimed the cost of the new machinery as revenue expenditure on the ground that the expenditure involved should be treated as current repairs since the new machinery was installed only as a replacement of the old machinery which had become derelict see page of the Paper Book Aggrieved by the said order the matter was carried in appeal to the CIT A Accordingly the CIT A allowed the appeal and allowed the expenditure as revenue expenditure Aggrieved by the said decision of <ORG> the <ORG> carried the matter in appeal to the <ORG> which took the view that different segments of a textile mill are integrated parts of a continuous process and the expenditure incurred on replacement of the machines in any segment of the plant should be treated as revenue expenditure Apart from Ring Frames different assessees have claimed deduction for other Items like simplex machines doubling machines cone winders card conversion equipments According to <ORG> all the above items of machines though independent are part of an integrated textile mill and therefore the expenditure incurred on replacement of any one of the above items of machine was an expenditure incurred to maintain production without breakdown and therefore the assessee was entitled to claim deduction for the said expenditure as revenue expenditure under Section i The issue before us is whether the expenditure incurred by the assessee for modernisation and replacement came within the connotation of the words current repairs in Section i In <ORG> we have Autoconers in order to produce fault free yarn So is in the case of the picture tube in a Television Set when the picture tube is replaced the Television Set is not replaced therefore such repairs alone can come within the connotation of the word current repairs in Section i of the said Act as it stood at the material time In the Cooling Chamber we have cooling plant which has a concept similar to air condition plant An allowance is granted by clause i of Section in respect of amount expended on current repairs to machinery plant or furniture used for the purposes of business irrespective of whether the assessee is the owner of the assets or has only used them However the words used in Section i are current repairs Therefore the expenditure incurred by the assessee did not fall within the meaning of current repairs in Section i In that case it was observed as follows The simple test that must be constantly borne in mind is that as a result of the expenditure which is claimed as an expenditure for repairs what is really being done is to preserve and maintain an already existing asset If the amount spent was for the purpose of bringing into existence a new asset or obtaining a new advantage then obviously such an expenditure would not be an expenditure of a revenue nature but it would be a capital expenditure and it is clear that the deduction which the <ORG> has permitted under section is a deduction where the expenditure is a revenue expenditure and not a capital expenditure The <ORG> intended to stress that under Section i the permissible deduction admissible is only for current repairs therefore the question as to whether the expenditure incurred by the assessee conceptually is revenue or capital in nature is not relevant for deciding the question as to whether such an expenditure comes within the etymological meaning of the expression current repairs The test formulated above applies to cases where the assessee claims allowance under Section i In the present case <ORG> has lost sight of the test to be applied for an expenditure to fall under Section i as current repairs In our view applying the test laid down by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra the assessees were not entitled to claim allowance under Section i for current repairs In that case the assessee carried on the business of manufacture and sale of cotton yarn After a detailed study the <ORG> held that on account of the stress and strain of production over a long period there was a need for change and that the assessee had replaced old parts by introducing the said System In our view the said judgment has no application with the facts of the present case That is not the case before us hence the said judgment has no application to the facts of the present case In the said judgment it is nowhere stated that the entire textile mill is one single asset and that it represents one single integrated process Some of the decisions cited on behalf of the assessees are not being discussed by us as they deal with cases falling under Section Under Section a particular item of expenditure may be deductible if the expenditure does not fall within Sections to that it should have been incurred in the accounting year that it should be in respect of a business carried on by the assessee that it should not be on personal account of the assessee that it should not be in the nature of capital expenditure and that it should be spent wholly and exclusively for business Therefore whether an expenditure is revenue or capital in nature would depend on the facts of each case There were certain civil appeals wrongly tagged with the present batch which will be decided separately by us as they concern with Section It was submitted on behalf of the assessees in the present case that although the assessees had claimed deduction under Section i they should be permitted to claim deduction under Section as on facts it has been held by <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> that the expenditure was revenue in nature We find no merit in this contention For the aforestated reasons we find merit in the above batch of civil appeals filed by the <ORG> Accordingly we hold in this batch of civil appeals that the assessees were not entitled to claim allowance under Section i of the Income Tax Act as it stood at the relevant time
