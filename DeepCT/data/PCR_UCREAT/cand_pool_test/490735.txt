The court fees were paid on the memo of appeal one year and days out of time and if Article applies the appeal would be barred The question is of first impression and cannot be said to be quite free from difficulty The Land Acquisition Act gives a right to appeal by Section which lays down subject to the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to appeals from original decrees an appeal shall lie to the High court from the award or from any part of the award of the court in any proceedings under that act There is no special period of limitation provided in the Land Acquisition Act nor is there any allusion unless it be by implication of this very section to the Limitation Act Article of the Limitation Act provides a period of days for Appeal under the Code of Civil Procedure to <ORG> except in the cases provided for by Article and Article the time to run from the date of decree or order appealed from There is no direct authority on the point Section of that Act provided for an appeal to <ORG> in cases where the amount of value of the subject matter exceeded Rs They say The Limitation Act Schedule II Article when it speaks of the Civil Procedure Code is on the face of it speaking of a Code which relates to procedure and does not ordinarily deal with substantive rights and the natural meaning of an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code appears to us to be an appeal governed by the Code of Civil Procedure so far as procedure is concerned There seems to be no good reason for saying that an appeal under the Civil Procedure Code means only an appeal the right to prefer which is conferred by the Code itself On the other hand it would not be straining the language of the article too much to hold that an appeal the procedure with respect to which from its inception to its disposal is governed by the Civil Procedure Code may rightly be spoken of as an appeal under the Code this interpretation seems to us to be strengthened by the reference in Article itself to Article of the same schedule Article provides for appeals from a decree or order of <ORG> in the exercise of its original jurisdiction That also tends to show that what is meant by the legislature is appeals the hearing and disposal of which is governed by the rules of procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code As regards column there can be no doubt after the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> The Collector Rangoon I that an award under the Land Acquisition Act is not a decree passed in the ordinary jurisdiction of <ORG> Though the award of the Land Acquisition Judge is not a decree or order for purposes of further appeal from the decision of <ORG> in appeal nevertheless the procedure laid down in the Civil Procedure Code with reference to appeals from original decrees which are also made applicable to appeals from Orders by Rule of Order XLIII Civil Procedure Code governs appeals under Section of the Land Acquisition Act although in the rules the word decree is used It is to be pointed out that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code regarding procedure to be followed in appeals from original decrees are incorporated in the Land Acquisition Act by virtue of Section If the st column of Article includes as we hold appeals provided for by Section of the Land Acquisition Act there is really no difficulty created by the use of the words decree or order in the rd column We hold upon a proper construction of Article that it applies to appeals provided for by Section of the Land Acquisition Act This appeal must be dismissed with costs
