In the assessment year the aggregate of all depreciation allowances including initial depreciation exceeded the original cost of machinery but in respect of that year as well as for the assessment years and the Income Tax Officer failed to deduct initial depreciation and the company was allowed normal depreciation in excess of the amount permissible under proviso to vi of the Income Tax Act On November the Income Tax Officer issued notices of reassessment for the three years under section of the Income Tax Act It was common ground that excessive depreciation was in fact allowed to the Company and that certain income escaped assessment but it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the income did not escape assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment of that year In dismissing a Letters Patent appeal <ORG> took the view that there was apparently a mistake and error on the side of the Company as well as the Income Tax Officer and that the Income Tax Officer could reasonably come to the conclusion that it was due to the omission and failure on the part of the assessee in disclosing fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment that the error was committed by the Income Tax Officer as a result of Which some income had escaped assessment Although <ORG> held that the Income Tax Officer had decided that certain income had escaped assessment it did not consider whether the income escaped assessment by reason of omission or failure on the part of the Company to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment within the meaning of section of the Act In proceedings for assessment of income tax the <ORG> was allowed in computing its income from business for the assessment years and initial depreciation aggregating to Rs In the assessment year the aggregate of all depreciation allowances including initial depreciation exceeded the original cost of the machinery but the Income tax Officer on the written down value of the machinery computed at Rs Depreciation allowance was also allowed in the assessment years and as a percentage on the appropriate written down value in those years It was also common ground that by virtue of cl to Explana tion of of the Income tax Act income having been made the subject matter of excessive relief under the Indian Income tax Act the income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment But it was urged that the income had not escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment of that year for the Indian Income tax Art and the forms of returns prescribed under the rules did not require the assessee to disclose that initial depreciation had been allowed in the earlier years and that in any event the Income tax Officer knew that initial depreciation had been allowed to the Company in the years and <NAME> who heard the petitions held that the Company committed no error in failing to take into account the initial depreciation while entering the written down value in column of Part of the return The order passed by Pathak was confirmed in appeal under the Letters Patent a in respect of buildings which had been newly erected or the machinery or plant being new had been installed after the st day of March but for the application of cl of the proviso to vi the initial depreciation allowed in the years and had to be taken into account But he was still of the opinion that the Act imposed upon the Company a duty to disclose all material facts which went to show the true amount of the allowances to which it was entitled and the Company by failing to disclose that initial depreciation had been allowed in three earlier years the Company had failed to disclose fully and truly all material facts necessary for assessment and on that account a was attracted and the notice was properly issued After stating that there was apparently a mistake and error on the side of the Company as well as the Income tax Officer the Court observed that the Income tax Officer could reasonably comer to the conclusion that it was due to the omission and failure on the part of the assessee in disclosing fully and truly all material facts necessary for the assessment that the error was committed by the Income tax Officer as a result of which some income had es caped assessment and held that the notices were not Section a of the Income tax Act provided
