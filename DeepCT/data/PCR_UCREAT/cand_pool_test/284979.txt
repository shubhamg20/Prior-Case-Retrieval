The appellant got the select list examined which revealed that the select list was not prepared by the members of <ORG> fairly and judiciously in that the members had taken undue advantage of awarding marks in the interview to favour candidates of their choice although there was no evidence of corruption The <ORG> on the ground of non affording of opportunity to the members of the <ORG> before cancelling the select list set aside the order issued by the appellant and directed the appellant to appoint in the available vacancies the candidates from the cancelled select list in preference to candidates from the select list prepared by the newly constituted <ORG> Beingaggrieved by the <ORG> order the appellant preferred the present appeal by special leave On behalf of the appellant it was contended that affording of an opportunity to the members of the <ORG> before cancelling the select list being neither a requirement of law nor a requirement of any of the principles of natural justice it could not have been made the sole ground for setting aside the order issued by the appellant On behalf of the respondents it was contended that the select list of candidates prepared by the earlier <ORG> has been cancelled by the appellant though there was no proof of corruption charges against the members of the <ORG> and that an opportunity of hearing ought to have been given to the candidates in the select list before it was cancelled Such an order cannot be vitiated on the ground that it had been made without affording an opportunity of hearing to the members of the <ORG> who had prepared it Further such an order cannot be vitiated either because no direct evidence was made available to prove corruption charges against the members of the <ORG> in the matter of award of interview marks by them so as to tilt the balance in favour of candidates with poor educational qualifications and against the candidates with high educational qualifications or because there was no opportunity of hearing afforded to the candidates in theselect list to sustain it before its cancellation by the appellant <ORG> Besides there is no personal right or interest of any member of a <ORG> which could be adversely affected by the <ORG> cancelling a select list of candidates prepared by the <ORG> when it is found to have been prepared by the <ORG> in unfair and injudicious manner when the said reasons formed the basis for the appellant <ORG> to cancel the select list the fact that charges of corruption levelled against the members of the <ORG> in the preparation of that select list had not been established by direct evidence produced in that regard can make no difference Since it is accepted that a candidate who finds a place in the select list as a candidate selected for appointment to a civil post does not acquire an indefeasible right to be appointed in such post in the absence of any specific Rule entitling him for such appointment and he could be aggrieved by hes non appointment only when the <ORG> does so either arbitrarily or for no bona fide reasons it follows as a necessary concomitant that such candidate even if he has a legitimate expectation of being appointed in such posts due to his name finding a place in the select list of candidates cannot claim to have a right to be heard before such select list is cancelled for bona fide and valid reasons and not arbitrarily The short question arising for our decision in this Appeal is whether the Order by which <ORG> cancelled the select list of candidates for appointment as Conductors in <ORG>CTU prepared by <ORG> constituted therefor because of its view of that select list not having been prepared in a fair and judicious manner was liable to be interfered with by <ORG> CAT on the ground of that Order having not been made after affording an opportunity of hearing thereon to the members of the concerned <ORG> The facts giving rise to the said question lie in a narrow compass The select list of candidates meant to fill the vacancies of conductors in <ORG> when was announced on September it invited severe criticism from the members of both the public and the Press as to the role of the members of he <ORG> in the matter of its preparation These revelations compelled <ORG> to conclude that the select list of candidates for appointment as conductors in <ORG> had not been prepared by the members of the <ORG> fairly and judiciously in that those members had taken undue advantage of the marks awardable by them at the interview to favour the candidates of their choice although there was no clinching evidence of corruption attributable to the members Consequently <ORG> made an order of cancelling the select list of candidates for appointment as conductors prepared by the <ORG> and published on September and constituted a new <ORG> to prepare a fresh select list of candidates including those who had been interviewed by the earlier <ORG> according to the fresh selection criteria with per cent marks awardable for educational qualifications of candidates and per cent marks awardable for their performance at interview It was contended on behalf of the Appellant <ORG> that affording of an opportunity of hearing to the members of the earlier <ORG> before cancelling their dubious select list of candidates for appointment as conductors in <ORG> being neither a requirement of law nor a requirement of any principle of natural Justice the <ORG> could not have made it the sole ground for setting aside of the order by which the Appellant had cancelled such select list and hence the Judgment of <ORG> under appeal based on such untenable ground required to be set aside No doubt the <ORG> Appellant has found that there was no direct evidence of corruption produced against the members of the <ORG> for the favour they had shown in the matter of awarding high interview marks to unmerited candidates Such an order as is held by <ORG> cannot be vitiated on the ground that it had been made without affording an opportunity of hearing to the members of the <ORG> who had prepared it Further such an order cannot be vitiated either because no direct evidence was made available to prove corruption charges against the members of the <ORG> in the matter of award of interview marks by them so as to tilt the balance in favour of candidates with poor educational qualifications and against the candidates with high educational qualifications or because there was no opportunity of hearing afforded to the candidates in the select list to sustain it before its cancellation by the <ORG> Besides there is no personal right or interest of any member of <ORG> which could be adversely effected by the <ORG> cancelling a select list of candidates prepared by <ORG> when it is found to have been prepared by <ORG> in unfair and injudicious manner When the said reasons formed the basis for <ORG> to cancel the select list of <ORG> the fact that charges of corruption levelled against the members to <ORG> in the preparation of that select list had not been established by direct evidence produced in that regard can make no difference Unless the relevant Recruitment Rules so indicate the State is under no legal duty to fill all or any of the vacancies If we have regard to the above enunciation that a candidate who finds a place in the select list as a candidate selected for appointment to a civil post does not acquire an indefeasible right to be appointed in such posting the absence of any specific Rule entitling him for such appointment and he could be aggrieved by his non appointment only when the <ORG> does so either arbitrarily or for no bona fide reasons it follows as a necessary concomitant that such candidate even if has a legitimate expectation of being appointed in such posts due to his name finding a place in the select list of candidates cannot claim to have a right to be heard before such select list is cancelled for bona fide and valid reasons and not arbitrarily In the instant case when the Chandigarh <ORG> which received the complaints about the unfair and injudicious manner in which select list of candidates for appointment as conductors in <ORG> was prepared by <ORG> constituted for the purpose found those complaints to be well founded on an enquiry got made in that regard we are unable to find that the Chandigarh <ORG> had acted either arbitrarily or without bona fide and valid reasons in cancelling such dubious select list In the result we allow this appeal set aside the Judgment under appeal and reject the applications made by Respondents before <ORG> Chandigarh However in the facts and circumstances of this appeal we make no order as to costs
