The relevant facts lie within a narrow compass There was a further condition in the contract that the purchaser was to bear all the expenses including customs duty etc But it was found that the goods did not conform to some of the specifications in the licence and the customs authorities confiscated the goods but gave an option to the assessee to pay a penalty of Rs It was in the next year that the sale of the goods to <ORG> took place The Income tax Officer found on verification that the penalty as such had not been recovered by the assessee from <ORG> but the amount of penalty it appears was taken into account in determining the price at which the said goods were sold to <ORG> The assessee then preferred a second appeal to <ORG> The <ORG> came to the conclusion that the assessee had contravened some of the conditions or specifications of the licence and the penalty was levied upon the assessee and not the purchaser The question set out above has been referred to us from the decision of the <ORG> We shall deal with this case after setting out our own views It was the assessee who imported the goods in question and it was the fault of the assessee if the goods in question imported did not conform to the specifications of the licence In these circumstances there is no escaping the conclusion that the penalty was levied on the assessee for the default of the assessee itself and not on the ground of any other person default It is well settled that if an assessee has to pay a penalty to the customs authorities in respect of goods imported by the assessee on account of its own default the amount of that penalty cannot be deducted in the computation of taxable profits of the assessee In that case in the course of its business the assessee had purchased bills of lading and other shipping documents from certain parties in respect of some consignments of goods imported by them from a foreign country The assessee paid the penalty for saving the goods from being confiscated It was held by <ORG> that on the facts and circumstances the actual cost of the goods to the assessee was not only what it had paid to the importers but in addition thereto what it had to pay by way of penalty in order to save the goods from being confiscated and lost to it It is significant that the observations of <ORG> set out at page of the aforesaid report show that <ORG> clearly took the view that in cases where penalty had to be incurred because of the fault of the assessee himself as for instance by reason of his having carried on his business in an unlawful manner or in contravention of certain rules and regulations the penalty paid by the assessee for such conduct thereof could not be regarded as wholly laid out for the purpose of the business and in support of this conclusion the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> CIT ITR was cited This decision in our view does not advance the argument of Mrs <NAME> and in fact the aforesaid observations pointed out by us lend considerable support to the view which we have taken The assessee to pay the costs of this reference to the Commissioner
