Scope of When <ORG> may issue writ of habeas corpus ex parte of the Constitution to be issued to the respondents to produce the two persons <NAME> and <NAME> in the <ORG> who according to the petitioner were whisked away by the army jawans from Huining village to Phungrei Camp and unauthorisedly detained by the Officer incharge of <ORG> and were held incommunicado and whose whereabouts were not made known Allowing the petition HELD A writ of habeas corpus be issued to the respondents and commanding them to produce <NAME> and <NAME> before this court and file the return of the Constitution is moved before the court ordinarily the court would not issue ex parte a writ of habeas corpus unless the urgency of the situation so demands or issuing of a notice of motion was likely to result in defeat of justice The normal practice is that when a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is moved the court would direct a notice to be served upon the respondents with a view to affording the respondents to file evidence in reply If the facts alleged in the petition are controverted by the respondents appearing in response to the notice by filing its evidence the court would proceed to investigate the facts to determine whether there is substance in the petition for a writ of habeas corpus If on investigation of facts the court rejects the contention of the respondents and is satisfied that the respondent was responsible for unauthorised and illegal detention of the person or persons in respect of whom the writ is sought the <ORG> would issue a writ of habeas corpus which would make it obligatory for the respondents to file a return Even if upon a notice of motion it is contended by the person against whom the writ is sought that the person alleged to be in the custody of the respondents has long since left the custody a writ can be issued and return insisted upon The respondents and in their various affidavits adopted a positive stand that <NAME> and <NAME> were taken by the army jawans on March though not under arrest to the army camp for the purpose of identifying <NAME> and that they spent the night at the army camp and that they left the army camp on March in company of <NAME> and <NAME> The petitioner and those filing affidavits in support including <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> wife of <NAME> and <NAME> wife of <NAME> denied that <NAME> and <NAME> left army camp on March and returned to the village therefore an issue squarely arose to ascertain whether the positive stand of respondents was borne out by the facts alleged and proof offered The jawans resorted to firing which resulted in the death of one <NAME> The direction given to <NAME> was to find out the whereabouts of the persons named in the radiogram and to submit his report at an early date Accordingly <NAME> submitted his report on March stating therein that three persons of Phungcham village mentioned in the radiogram have been released by <ORG> on March and that all attempts to secure the knowledge as to how the officers and jawans of <ORG> have dealt with the aforementioned two persons have not met with success and he has no other option but to file this petition for a writ of habeas corpus The petitioner filed a rejoinder affidavit in which inter alia it was stated that the earlier writ petitions were not specifically concerned with the mysterious disappearance of <NAME> and <NAME> after they were taken away by the army personnel but they were primarily concerned with the constitutional validity of the aforementioned Armed Forces Special Powers Act It was further stated that the <ORG> should direct the respondents to produce the report of enquiry made by the Superintendent of Police Ukhrul to the Deputy Commissioner and the connected documents It was specifically stated that <NAME> and <NAME> were respectable persons who were asked to go to the Army Camp on March to identify some suspects names not mentioned and that after the identification they were permitted to leave It was stated that after they work of identification was over <NAME> and <NAME> were permitted to leave the Army Camp but as it was evening time and it was dangerous to travel at night on account of fear of the insurgents both of them preferred to spend the night at the Army Camp which the Camp Commandant permitted and they left in the morning of March It was further stated that <NAME> and <NAME> were not suspects or accused in any of the cases initiated by <ORG> and that they were never arrested or apprehended by <ORG> It was pointed out to him that Mr <NAME> is a Delhi based officer and either he must explain his source of knowledge or if he has relied on any record the same may be produced before the <ORG> on the pain of both the returns being rejected as utterly unreliable It was further stated that in the records with <ORG> there is no statement of Police Constable <NAME> <NAME> of a date prior to the filing of the present writ petition and a notice was ordered to be issued It however become a compelling necessity in this case for the obvious reason that certain inferences were drawn and submitted for the consideration of this <ORG> by both sides after referring to facts admitted and or not controverted It is admitted by the respondents that <NAME> and <NAME> were at Phungrei Camp at the instance of army officers on March and spent the night at the camp between March and March It is not necessary to speculate in that behalf because the real question is whether on the material placed on record is it possible to affirmately arrive at a conclusion that <NAME> and <NAME> left the Phungrei Camp latest by a or thereabout on March <NAME> name is referred to because he had already made a complaint to the Deputy Commissioner on March And the affidavits of various members of security forces personnel bear the date between May and first week of June that is subsequent to the order dated May Turning to the affidavits filed on behalf of the respondents to substantiate the stand of the respondents <NAME> says in his affidavit that at about A on March two persons from Huining village arrived at the gate of the army camp and introduced themselves as <NAME> and <NAME> This would unmistakably show that <NAME> and <NAME> never entered the army camp and surprisingly yet in the two extracts Annexures and <NAME> and <NAME> are shown to have entered the army camp one after the other between A and A and left at A If <NAME> and <NAME> came upto army gate never entered the same and according to the respondents <NAME> and <NAME> were brought to the gate of the army camp there was absolutely no justification for making an entry in the register evidencing that they had both entered the army camp There is a further infirmity in that the entry in the name of <NAME> appearing in the <ORG> on March appears to be overwritten over another entry which was already there Therefore in view of the direct evidence furnished by the affidavits of <NAME> and <NAME> coupled with the suspicious circumstances herein discussed and effort made to bolster up the stand by entries of dubious character as also the eloquent silence in the earlier stage of the proceedings about existence of any record leave us with no alternative but to hold that the respondents have failed to prove that <NAME> and <NAME> left the army camp on March around A This inference is further buttressed by the fact that all these documents along with the affidavits were placed on record after this Court made an order on May clearly pointing out that the affidavit of <NAME> lacks credibility as the source of information is not traced therein and after Mr <NAME> learned counsel for <ORG> stated that the first respondent is not in possession of any record in respect of <NAME> and <NAME> There is one curious feature of the whole case which cannot be overlooked There is further evidence that after the authorities of the Manipur State such as Deputy Commissioner and Superintendent of Police started making enquiries the army jawans again went to Huining village on May and obtained some more certificates as well as signatures on blank papers The village residents of Huining were so co operative with the security forces that they refused to be instigated by him and on other hand they praised the security forces for the good treatment meted out to the villagers by the security forces On the contrary it would be legitimate to infer that there was something very despicable in the conduct of the army jawans and therefore to forestall any action they procured certificates which inevitably must be under threat duress or coercion The Superintendent of Police was called upon to furnish the report about the whereabouts of the persons whose names were set out in the direction given to him From the evidence herein collated it unquestionably follows that not only <NAME> and <NAME> after admittedly they were taken presumably under arrest to Phungrei Camp on March in the afternoon they never left the Phungrei Camp on March as claimed on the respondents in company of <NAME> and <NAME> but a very crude attempt was made to concoct evidence in the from of certificates with a view to disowning the responsibility to explain what happened to <NAME> and <NAME> after they were taken to army camp on March In reaching the conclusion that the respondents have failed to discharge the burden heavily lying on them to affirmatively establish once having admitted taking them to army camp on March that <NAME> and <NAME> left Phungrei Camp on March around A we have completely overlooked and not take into consideration the affidavits of Mrs <NAME> wife of Shri <NAME> and Mrs <NAME> wife of Shri <NAME> that they had seen <NAME> and <NAME> being led away by army personnel on March as contended by Mr <NAME> Once we unerringly reach the conclusion that <NAME> and <NAME> were taken to Pungrei Camp by officers and jawans of <ORG> on March and they never left the army camp as canvassed on behalf of the respondents on March it is obligatory upon the respondents to produce <NAME> and <NAME> and to explain their whereabouts more so because respondents claim the power to arrest and question anyone under the provisions of Armed Forces Special Powers Act We may now examine some technical contentions raised on behalf of the respondents of the Constitution is moved before the <ORG> ordinarily the <ORG> would not issue ex parte a writ of habeas corpus unless the urgency of tee situation so demands or issuing of a notice motion was likely to result in defeat of justice The normal practice is that when a petition for a writ of habeas corpus is moved the <ORG> would direct a notice to be served upon the respondents with a view to affording the respondents to file evidence in reply If the facts alleged in the petition are controverted by the respondents appearing in response to the notice by filing its evidence the <ORG> would proceed to investigate the facts to determine whether there is substance in the petition for a writ of habeas corpus If on investigation of facts the <ORG> rejects the contention of the respondent and is satisfied that the respondent was responsible for unauthorised and illegal detention of the person or persons in respect of whom the writ is sought the <ORG> would issue a writ of hebeas corpus which would make it obligatory for the respondents to file a return It is in this sense that in <NAME> <NAME> <ORG> held that even if upon a notice of motion it is contended by the person against whom the writ is sought that the person alleged to be in the custody of the respondents has long since left the custody a writ can be issued and return insisted upon Vincent Home Harrow Road a Catholic home and a request to that effect was made to the appellant It was further contended on behalf of the appellant that <NAME> was not with him since November when he transferred him into the care of Mr <NAME> and at the time of the service of the summons he was not in his custody or power <NAME> case was decided by the <ORG> of Appeal in which it was laid down that it was not an excuse for non compliance with a writ that the defendant had parted with the custody of the child to another person if he had done so wrongfully and accordingly a fresh application was made for a writ of habeas corpus The petitioner and those filing affidavits in support including <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> wife of <NAME> and <NAME> wife of Shri <NAME> denied that <NAME> and <NAME> left army camp on March and returned to the village therefore an issue squarely arose to ascertain whether the positive stand of the respondents was borne out by the facts alleged and proof offered Therefore we do not propose merely to add to the length of the judgment by examining the question of the privilege claimed in respect of the two reports first dated April by the Superintendent of Police and another dated May by the Deputy Commissioner Accordingly this petition is allowed and we direct that a writ of habeas corpus be issued to the respondents and commanding them to produce <NAME> retired Naik Subedar of Manipur Riffles and Headmaster of <ORG> and <NAME> Assistant Paster of <ORG> who were taken to Phungrei Camp by the jawans of <ORG> on March before this <ORG> on Dec
