In this reference under section of the Indian Income tax Act made at the instance of the revenue the following two questions of law arise for decision Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case there was any evidence before the Tribunal to justify the finding that there was no market for sugarcane produced by the assessee and Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the income received by the assessee was agricultural income within the meaning of the Indian Income tax Act In respect of the income from sales of jaggery for the assessment years and being the accounting years and he claimed that the income was agricultural income and that he was entitled to exemption from income tax in respect thereof having regard to the provisions in section iii read with section viii This exemption was refused to him and in Appeals Nos and of <ORG> by its order dated August had that proper attempt had not been made to ascertain the truth whether there was in fact a market for the sale of sugarcane grown by the assessee The assessee was given opportunity to tender further evidence in support of his case that his income was agricultural income and that he was entitled to exemption having regard to the above provisions in the Act The Income tax Officer issued a questionnaire on the Phaltan Sugar Works being a factory which carried on business of manufacturing sugar and was situated approximately at a distance of miles from the fields of the assessee It was further found that the capacity of the factory was to absorb about tons per day and that the factory worked in year approximately for the season which lasted for about days There was no demand by merchants and others in respect of the sugarcane of the quality that he produced for consumption thereof as sugarcane By its very nature the sugarcane was heavy in weight and perishable in quality and there was no practice to send sugarcane to any distant places for sale The substance of the case on behalf of the revenue through the report of the Income tax Officer and otherwise appears to have been that since the above factory was a purchaser of sugarcane grown in the areas of miles radius from the site of its premises there was a market where sugarcane in its natural condition was saleable In so far as under the above circumstances the assessee converted his sugarcane crop into jaggery he was not covered by the provisions in section iii read with section viii The contrary submissions on behalf of the assessee was that having regard to the facts brought on the record by way of evidence both by the revenue and the assessee it was clear that the sugarcane crop of the assessee was not marketable and conversion of this crop into jaggery having been made by process ordinarily employed by a cultivator to make sugarcane fit to be taken to market his earnings from sale of jaggery were agricultural income and he was entitled to exemption in accordance with the provisions of the above sections There is no market as such where sugarcane of this quality can be sent and sold The existence of a mill in our opinion does not mean that there is a market for the sale of sugarcane We have examined the evidence on record If the mills would refuse to buy sugarcane the poor agriculturist has no other alternative but to convert it into gur Mr <NAME> for the revenue has challenged the correctness of the above findings and has submitted that there was no evidence before the <ORG> to justify the finding that there was no market for sugarcane produced by the assessee The total substance of his submission was that since the Phaltan Sugar Works was situated within a distance of miles from the fields of the assessee and since in connection with the business of manufacturing sugar this factory required to purchase sugarcane of the quality produced by the assessee from the outsiders to the extent found by the Income tax Officer the sugarcane crop of the assessee must be held to be marketable in its natural condition That was the effect of the evidence on record and therefore there was no evidence to justify the finding of the <ORG> that there was no market for the sugarcane produced by the assessee He accordingly submitted that for the above two reasons the findings should be set aside and the question raised should be answered in favour of the revenue In reply Mr <NAME> for the assessee submitted that the findings of the <ORG> have been arrived at after all relevant evidence was brought on the record on behalf of the parties He altogether denied the second contention made on behalf of the revenue and in that connection largely relied upon the reasoning of the <ORG> which we have quoted above He further submitted that the contention is made beyond the scope of the questions raised in the reference He repeatedly drew our attention to various pieces of evidence which could all have been included in the judgment of the <ORG> so as to explain in a better manner the recorded reasoning for the finding that the factory was not a market available for sale of the sugarcane crops of the assessee The first contention made on behalf of the respondent in that case was that <ORG> under section had no right to go behind the findings of fact made by <ORG> But the question whether the conclusions of the <ORG> on pure questions of fact are justified whether there is sufficient evidence to come to those conclusions is not a matter for inquiry by the court On that point the court has only to ask the question whether there is any evidence to justify the conclusion of fact We have therefore to decide in this case whether the findings of fact recorded by the <ORG> are based on any evidence Inspector of Taxes <NAME> <NAME> the questions raised by the parties in this case will have to be decided on the footing that the only question which this court has jurisdiction to consider is to find whether the findings recorded by the Tribunal are based on No evidence Apparently immediately upon a finding being made that there is relevant evidence on record in connection with the findings made by <ORG> it will not be competent for us to hold that the findings were unwarranted having regard to the inadequacy of the evidence on record But without any such misconception appearing ex faces it may be that the facts found are such that no person acting judicial and properly instructed as to the relevant law could have come to the determination under appeal I do not think that it much matters whether this state of affairs is described as one in which there is no evidence to support the determination or as one in which the evidence is inconsistent with and contradictory of the determination or as one in which the true and only reasonable conclusion contradicts the determination Relying upon the above observations Mr <NAME> for the revenue has with some emphasis submitted that the finding of <ORG> that there was no market for the sale of the sugarcane produce of the assessee is based on such misconception of law that it must be held to be a finding which no reasonable person could have arrived at The submission was made in the above manner apparently because it was pointed out to the learned counsel that there was overwhelming evidence on the record which was tendered on both sides in support and or denial of the assessee case that his sugarcane produce was during the relevant assessment years not saleable because there was no market for sale thereof the produce must retain its original character in spite of the process unless there is no market for selling it in that condition The further observation was If there is no market to sell the produce then any process which is ordinarily employed to render it fit to reach the market where it can be sold would be covered by the definition The whole of the dispute raised by the parties in this case centre round the question whether the case of the assessee that of the sale of his sugarcane produce in its natural condition there was no market was true or otherwise The contention made by the revenue that there was no evidence on record in this connection must prima facie be rejected because if one may so describe it there is plethora of evident entered on behalf of the assessee written and oral in support of his case the there was no market for selling his sugarcane produce during the assessment years in its natural condition i as sugarcane In that connection there is no dispute between the parties the quality of the sugarcane produced by the assessee was such as was not fit for chewing The first contention made by Mr <NAME> that there was no evidence on record on the basis whereof a finding could be made by the <ORG> for accepting the above case of the assessee must accordingly be rejected The question which arose in the above manner for decision was a question of fact The question is whether the relevant contents of the order of the <ORG> disclose materials on the basis whereof it can be held in favour of the revenue that the <ORG> was not aware of the true effect of the relevant provisions of law and or its finding that the sugarcane produce of the assessee in the two assessment years was not saleable in its original condition because there was no market for selling it in that condition is so unreasonable that no person with reason could make it He specifically in that connection relies upon the following contents in the order of the <ORG> There is no market as such where sugarcane of this quality can be sent and sold A market indicates a number of purchaser and sellers The <ORG> has by mentioning certain facts disclosed that it applied its mind to the basic fact that the only purchaser who was available for sale of the sugarcane produce of the assessee was one single mill factory Towards the fact that other purchasers could not be available the sentence relied upon by Mr <NAME> was included the sentence being there is not market as such where sugarcane of this quality can be sent and sold As regards the factory in question the text sentence ran as follows The mills buy their requirements at prices fixed by the Government or at such other prices at which sugarcane can be purchased according to their requirements It is with reference to the evidence on record that the <ORG> used the next sentence The existence of a mill in our opinion does not mean that there is a market for the sale of sugarcane It is only in this connection that the <ORG> made the second observation on which <NAME> relied i a market indicates a number of purchasers and sellers For the reasons contained in its order it rejected the contentions made on behalf of the revenue We do not accept the contention that the approach of the <ORG> to the question which arose before it was utterly unreasonable and the findings of the <ORG> should for that reason be set aside The Commissioner will pay costs
