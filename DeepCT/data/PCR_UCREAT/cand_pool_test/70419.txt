The Government filed their written statement and issues were framed which covered all the questions of factrelied upon by the plaintiff He was of opinion that unless there was an express agreement the <ORG> are entitled to levy water cess at pleasure In these circumstances as the evidence had not been taken and the plaintiffs relied only on the facts alleged in the plaint and raised by the issue an amendment of the plaint setting forth that the plaintiff relied on an engagement with government should have been allowed if necessary With reference to these two clauses there was no difficulty In the second class of cases where irrigation was carried out with water supplied from the <ORG>s and only by means of <ORG> irrigation works channels etc There were however other cases which it was more difficult to deal with There was a fourth class The rule was made applicable to Zamindaries also There is only one further order to be referred to There is little ground for apprehension that the option would be exercised by the cultivator in the way of declining to use the means of irrigation when they are supplied to him at a moderate price and the possession of it would in no respect limit the right which the <ORG> acting on your own behalf or on that of the irrigation Company must retain the right of declining to supply any particular tract of country with water unless the cultivator should be prepared to enter into engagements to take the water at the stipulated rate in such numbers and for such terms of years as might warrant the required outlay There were thus three circumstances recognised as conferring a right to exemption from water rate otherwise leviable Before considering what the relations of the parties were or whether there was an engagement between the parties at this time i in and I shall finish my review of the proceedings which led to the Act The word engagement in the section is no doubt used in the same sense in which it was used in the proceedings to which I have already drawn attention When the <ORG> intercepted the flow of the water from the other three tanks mentioned in the plaint into Vodu Cherava they undoubtedly inflicted an injury upon the plaintiff and if the plaintiff had enforced his claim in a civil court he would have obtained a decree for compensation payable to him for such interference which would probably have been a direction to supply him with that water which his tank was usually getting before the interruption or some equivalent compensation We see here there was such interference and the consequent free supply Under these circumstances unless the free supply of water from is explained by <ORG> it appears to me the presumption not only natural but almost irresistible is that there was an implied engagement between the parties for the free supply of water And I have no doubt it was open to the parties to enter into any engagement at any time they liked From where could the <ORG> supply such water Not from these tanks with which they had nothing to do so and it is not shown there was any other source of water supply Otherwise I see no reason for any implied contract so far as the lands irrigated with any pre existing source of supply which did not belong to the <ORG> are concerned It appeared that various accounts showed the various extent of land under cultivation but they adopted the greatest area irrigated which no doubt showed those lands were capable of irrigation works before the days of anicut <NAME> concur in the decision just now pronounced by my learned brother and if I add a few words in my own language it is merely on account of the importance of the questions involved in this case There was in my opinion therefore a clear completed engagement between the <ORG> and the plaintiffs set out in the plaint and hence the plaint shows a good cause of action On appeal to <ORG> by the <ORG> it was contended as the very first ground in the appeal memorandum see the appeal memo in Appeal No of that the District Judge erred in law in finding that there was an implied contract between the plaintiffs and the <ORG> to allow free irrigation for the extent of land the irrigation sources of which had been cut off by the anicut works The learned Judges <NAME> and <NAME> who decided that appeal and connected Appeals Nos and of saw nothing in that contention and begin their judgment at once with the sentence Following the decision in those appeals we must in this case set aside the decision of <ORG> which held that the plaint discloses no cause of action In the result I agree in the order proposed by my learned brother
