Sub section of the amended provided for exemption of certain categories of despatches from the liability to pay the whole or part of the cess or to reduce the rate of the cess payable thereon Article of the Constitution permits the legislature of a State to impose reasonable restrictions on the freedom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State provided the Bill or amendment for that purpose is introduced with the previous sanction of the President It was contended for the petitioners that the levy of the cess under read with aa of the Act as amended in and HELD If the levy of a tax on goods has direct and immediate effect of impeding the movement of goods through out the territory of India there is a violation of Article of the Constitution There is also no violation of Article if the case fails under Article and its proviso Therefore if the legislature of a State enacts a law which imposes such reasonable restrictions on the free dom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest and further that the Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause has been introduced or moved in the <ORG> of a State with the previous sanction of the President such enactment will not offend Article To determine whether the levy was in respect of tea estates and therefore of land thus making an indirect impact or was a levy on despatches of tea thereby directly impeding movement of goods the substance of the legislation must be ascertained from the relevant provisions of the statute If there is no nexus at all it can conceivably be inferred that the levy is not what it purports to be There is nothing to suggest that a particular tea estate produces only one class of tea and when reference is made to a certain class of tea the reference identifies a certain class of tea estates Variations considered appropriate for the purpose of determining the measure must correspond to variations in the subject of the levy The petitioners are entitled to the refund of cess paid by them By these writ petitions and transferred cases the petitioners challenge the validity of the levy of cess in respect of tea estates under the West Bengal Rural Employment and Production Act The rural employment cess shall be levied annually a in respect of lands other than a tea estate at the rate of six paise on each rupee of development value thereof aa in respect of a tea estate at such rate not exceeding rupees six on each kilogram of tea on the dispatches from such tea estate of tea grown therein as <ORG> may by notification in <ORG> fix in this behalf Provided that in calculating the dispatches of tea for the purpose of levy of rural employment cess such dispatches for sale made at such tea auction centres as may be recognised by the State Government by notification in the Official Gazette shall be excluded Explanation For the purpose of this section tea means the plant Camellia Sinen sis Kuntze as well as all varieties of the product known commercially as tea made from the leaves of the plant Camellia Sinensis Kuntze including green tea and green tea leaves processed or unprocessed Section was also amended further by the insertion of sub which provided The State Government may if it considers necessary so to do by notification in the Official Gazette exempt such categories of despatches or such percentage of despatches from the liability to pay the whole or any part of the rural employment cess or reduce the rate of the rural employment cess payable thereon under clause aa of sub section on such terms and conditions as may be speci fied in the notification It seems to us that these cases can be disposed of on the short ground based on Article of the Constitution and want of legis lative competence cannot also be disputed that if the levy of a tax on goods has the direct and immediate effect of impeding the movement of goods throughout the territory of India there is a violation of Article of the Constitution Therefore there is no violation of Article if the case falls under Article and its proviso In other words if <ORG> enacts a law which imposes such reasonable restrictions on the free dom of trade commerce or intercourse with or within that State as may be required in the public interest and further that the Bill or amendment for the purposes of clause has been introduced or moved in <ORG> with the previous sanction of the President such enactment will not offend the Article The question then is whether the impugned levy impedes the free flow of trade and commerce throughout the territory of India and if it does whether it fails within the excep tion carved out in Article If the levy imposes a cess in respect of tea estates it may well De said that even though the free flow of tea is impeded in its movement throughout the territory of India it is in consequence of an indirect or remote effect of the levy and that it cannot be said that Article is contravened If that contention is sound there can be no doubt that it constitutes a violation of Article unless the legisla tion is brought within the scope of Article To determine whether the levy is in respect of tea estates or is a levy on despatches of tea the substance of the legis lation must be ascertained from the relevant provisions of the statute It cannot be disputed that the subject of the levy the nature of which defines the quality of the levy must not be confused with the measure of liability that is to say the quantum of the tax The statute also provides that in calculating the despatches of tea for the purpose of levy of rural employment cess the despatches for sale made at such tea auction centres as may be recognised by <ORG> shall be excluded And there is a proviso which empowers <ORG> to fix different rates on despatches of different classes of tea There is also which empowers <ORG> to exempt such categories of despatches or such per centage of despatches from the liability to pay the whole or any part of the rural employment cess or to reduce the rate of the rural employment cess payable thereon under clause aa of sub on such terms and conditions as it may specify by notification and therefore of land or in respect of despatches of tea we must as we have said take all the relevant provisions of the legislation into account and ascertain the essential substance of it It seems to us that although the impugned provisions speak of a levy of cess in respect of tea estates what is really contemplated is a levy on despatches of tea instead The entire structure of the levy points to that conclusion If the levy is regarded as one in respect of tea estates and the measure of the liability is defined in terms of the weight of tea des patched from the tea estate there must be a nexus between the two indicating a relationship between the levy on the tea estate and the criteria for determining the measure of liability If there is no nexus at all it can conceivably be inferred that the levy iS not what it purports to be The statutory provisions for measuring the liability on account of the levy throws light on the general character of the tax as observed by <ORG> in Re A Reference under the Government of Ireland Act and Section of the Finance Act Northern Ireland All All these cases were referred to in <ORG> supra where in the discussion on the point at page this Court said Any standard which maintains a nexus with the essential character of the levy can be regard ed as a valid basis for assessing the measure of the levy There is nothing to suggest that a particular tea estate produces only one class of tea and when reference is made to a certain class of tea the reference identifies a certain class of tea estates If the impugned legisla tion were to be regarded as a levy in respect of tea es tates it would be referable to Entry in List II of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution which speaks of taxes on lands and buildings It may be noted that <ORG> had made a declaration in of the Tea Act that it was expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the tea industry Under the Tea Act <ORG> has assumed control of the tea industry including the tea trade and control of tea prices The petitioners are entitled to their costs
