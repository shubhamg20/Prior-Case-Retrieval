The relevant facts out of which the appeal arises lie in a narrow compass and can be briefly stated The accident according to the plaintiffs was caused by the rash and negligent driving of the lorry by the second defendant The first plaintiff brought the suit against the owner and the driver of the lorry as defendants and claiming compensation of Rupees on account of the death of <NAME> The first defendant took a further defence that if compensation was to be awarded <ORG> should be directed to pay it Counsel for the appellant opened the appeal contending that the suit should have been dismissed as there was no evidence of rashness or negligence on the part of the driver the <ORG> having rejected the relevant witnesses Ws We therefore heard full arguments on this point and in the event it became the central issue in the appeal As we are inclined to uphold the objection of counsel for the respondents it is needless to canvass the merits of the contention raised by the appellant on the adequacy of the evidence Sub section provides that a policy of insurance must be a policy which a insures the person or classes of persons specified in the policy to the extent specified in Sub section i against any liability which may be incurred by him in respect of the death of or bodily injury to any person or damage to any property of a third party caused by or arising out of the use of the vehicle in a public place Section I lays an obligation upon the insurer who has issued a policy in terms of Section to pay to the person entitled to the benefit of a decree any sum not exceeding the sum assured payable thereunder as if he were the judgment debtor in respect of the liability together with any amount payable in respect of costs and interest on that sum Sub section reads No sum shall be payable by an insurer under Sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the Court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceeding is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds namely a that the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein before the accident giving rise to the liability and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that the person to whom the certificate was issued has made an affidavit stating that the certificate has been lost or destroyed or that either before or not later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provisions of Section or that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy being one of the following conditions namely i a condition excluding the use of the vehicle a for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward or for organised racing and speed testing or for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a transport vehicle or without side car being attached where the vehicle is a motor cycle or ii a condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licensed or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or iii a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war riot or civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the non disclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular Sub section which is the only other provision that falls to be noticed provides No insurer to whom the notice referred to in Sub section or Sub section A has been given shall be entitled to avoid his liability to any person entitled to the benefit of any such judgment as is referred to in Sub section or Sub section A otherwise than in the manner provided for in Sub section or in the corresponding law of the reciprocating country as the case may be The plaintiffs contended that the written statements should be taken off the records on the ground that the insurers could defend the action only on the pleas specified in the sub section and on no others It is enough to reproduce the headnote as it correctly represents the substance of the decision Apart from the statute an insurer has no right to be made a party to the action by the injured person against the insured causing the injury Sub section of Section however gives him the right to be made a party to the suit and to defend it The right therefore is created by statute and its content necessarily depends on the provisions of the statute The only manner of avoiding liability provided for in Sub section is through the defences therein mentioned Therefore when Sub section talks of avoiding liability in the manner provided in Sub section it necessarily refers to those defences It cannot be said that in enacting Sub section the legislature was contemplating only those defences which were based on the conditions of the policy the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the <ORG> and if he does so all defences open to the <ORG> can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge He can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the <ORG> and this he has full liberty to do As the appellant is seeking to raise defences which are outside the grounds enumerated in Section and as the appellant has not proved that it has reserved any right in that regard in the insurance policy we cannot entertain those defences
