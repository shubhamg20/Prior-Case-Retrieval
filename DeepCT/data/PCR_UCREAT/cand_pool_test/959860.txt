Per <NAME> and <NAME> contra In the absence of any indication in the grounds as to the nature of the words used by the petitioners in their speech es from which an inference has been drawn against them the petitioners would not be able fully to exercise their funda mental right of making a representation and as there were no such indications in the grounds supplied there was a non compliance with the provisions of el The petitioners were arrested on nd August by order of the District Magistrate Delhi made under sub section read with clause a sub clause i of sub section of section of the Preventive Detention Act hereinafter referred to as the Act the scope of authorised restrictions on the right to freedom of speech conferred by article This distinction appeared to the learned Judge to be illogical and he thought that there was an apparent conflict between the decisions of this <ORG> in <NAME> case and the other cases which could only be resolved by this <ORG> No wonder that after this encouragement the peti tioners have preferred these petitions raising the same contention before us It is true that in those cases this <ORG> decided by a majority of to that unless a law restricting freedom of speech and expression is directed solely against the undermining of the security of the State or the overthrow of it such law cannot fall within the reservation of clause of article although the restrictions which it seeks to impose may have been conceived generally in the interests of public order No question arose of depriving any person of his personal liberty by detaining him in custody whereas here as in <NAME> case the <ORG> is called upon to adjudge the legality of the deten tion of the petitioners with a view to prevent them from making speeches prejudicial to the maintenance of public order Although personal liberty has a content sufficiently comprehensive to include the freedoms enumerated in article and its deprivation would result in the extinction of those freedoms the Constitution has treated these civil liberties as distinct fundamental rights and made separate provisions in article and articles and as to the limitations and conditions subject to which The question arose whether section of the Act was a law impos ing restrictions on the right to move freely throughout the territory of India guaranteed under article and as such was liable to be tested with reference to its reasonableness under clause of that article If the learned Judges in the High <ORG> had paid close attention to the judgments delivered in this <ORG> they would have found that there was nothing illogi cal in that view and no conflict between the decisions in that case and in the other cases to which reference has been made The observations of the Chief Justice in <NAME> case make the position quite clear As the preventive detention order results in the deten tion of the applicant in a cell it was contended on his behalf that the rights specified in article a and have been infringed It was argued that because of his detention he cannot have a free right to speech as and where he desired and the same argument was urged in respect of the rest of the rights mentioned in sub clauses and Although this argument is advanced in a case which deals with preventive detention if correct it should be applicable in the case of punitive detention also to any one sentenced to a term of imprisonment under the relevant section of the Indian Penal Code Unless such conclusion necessarily follows from the article it is obvious that such construction should be avoided The article has to be read without any preconceived notions So read it clearly means that the legislation to be examined must be directly in respect of one of the rights mentioned in the sub clauses If there is a legislation directly attempting to control a citizen freedom of speech or expression or his right to assemble peaceably and without arms etc the question whether that legislation is saved by the relevant saving clause of article will arise On that short ground in my opinion this argument about the infringement of the rights mentioned in article generally must fail Any other construction put on the article it seems to me will be unreasonable In the case relied on this <ORG> no doubt held by a majority that though the first part of article which casts an obligation on the detaining authority to communicate the grounds of the order of detention would be sufficiently complied with if the deductions or conclusions of facts from facts on which the order was based were disclosed the latter part of the clause which confers on the person detained the right of making a representation against the order imposed by necessary implication a duty on the authority to furnish the person with further particu lars to enable him to make his representation It was further held that the sufficiency of this second communica tion of particulars was a justiciable issue the test being whether it is sufficient to enable the detained person to make a representation which on being considered may give relief to the detained person While the communication of particulars should subject to a claim of privilege under clause be as full and adequate as the circumstances permit it did not however follow from clause that what is not stated or considered to be withheld on that ground must be disclosed and if not disclosed there is a breach of a fundamental right it was remarked If on reading the ground furnished it is capable of being intelligently understood and is sufficiently definite to furnish materials to enable the detained person to make a representation against the order of detention it cannot be called vague This decision does not in our opinion support the broad proposition contended for by Mr <NAME> that wherever an order of detention is based upon speeches made by the person sought to be detained the detaining authority should communicate to the person the offending passages or at least the gist of such passages on pain of having the order quashed if it did not Nor do these cases belong to the category where a reference had to be made to <ORG> under the Act so that any attempt by the petitioners to rebut the inference drawn by the detaining authority from their speeches had to be made only before the executive authori ties It may be possible to conceive of peculiar situations where perhaps the person detained on ground of prejudicial speeches might be in a better position to make a representation if he was given the objectionable passages or the gist of them but the present cases are not of such peculiar character Such allegations could only be based in most cases on information received by the executive authorities from confidential sources and it would not be practicable in all such cases to have a record made of the speeches delivered The omission to do so for which no reason is disclosed in these proceedings is regrettable as it has given rise to avoidable grievance and complaint Instead of giving the information with reasonable details there is a deliberate attempt to use the minimum number of words in the communication conveying the grounds of detention This however does not affect our conclusion in these cases that the grounds communicated to the petitioners contain sufficient particulars to enable them to make their representations to the authority concerned and that the requirements of article have thus been complied with Lastly it was said that the petitioners were prominent members of a political organisation which was opposed to the ideals and policies of the party in power and that the orders of detention were made for the collateral purpose of stifling effective political opposition and legitimate criticism of the policies pursued by <ORG> and had nothing to do with the maintenance of public order The District Magistrate has in his affidavit filed in these proceedings stated that from the materials placed before him by persons experienced in investigating matters of this kind he was satisfied that it was necessary to detain the petitioners with a view to preventing them from acting in a manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order and he has emphatically repudi ated the purpose and motive imputed to him The grounds of detention supplied to them are almost identical The grounds supplied to the other two petitioners were the same except that in the case of <NAME> only the th August is mentioned as the date on which the public speech was made and in the case of the third petitioner it is only the th August The question for decision is whether what is stated in the grounds is sufficient material on the basis of which the fundamental right conferred on the petitioners by article of the Constitution can be adequately exercised and whether without knowing the substance of the offending passages in the speeches from which the inference has been drawn by the District Magistrate it is possible to prove that this infer ence is not justified In that case certain general principles ap plicable to cases of this nature were stated by the learned Chief Justice who delivered the majority judgment in the following terms That if the representation has to be intelligible to meet the charges contained in the grounds the information conveyed to the detained person must That while there is a connection between the obliga tion on the part of the detaining authority to furnish grounds and the right given to the detained person to have an earliest opportunity to make the representation the test to be applied in respect of the contents of the grounds for the two purposes is quite different On an infringement of either of these two rights the detained person has a right to approach the court and to complain that there has been an infringement of a fundamental right and even if the infringement of the second part of the right under article is established he is bound to be released by the court That it cannot be disputed that the representation mentioned in the second part of article must be one which on being considered may give relief to the detaining person It was pointed out that in the numerous cases that had been brought to the notice of the court it was found that there had been quite an unnecessary obscurity on the part of the detaining authority in stating the grounds for the order and that instead of giving the information with reasonable details there is a deliberate attempt to use the minimum number of words in the communication conveying the grounds of detention and that such an attitude was quite deplorable In my opinion these observations have an apposite application to the grounds furnished to the petitioners in the present cases That being so the material on the basis of which the District Magistrate drew the inference that these speeches would cause or were likely to cause disaffection amongst Hindus and Muslims should have been communicated to the petitioners so that they may be able to make a representation which on being considered may give relief to them In my opinion in the absence of any indication in the grounds as to the nature of the words used by the detenus in their speeches from which an inference has been drawn against them they would not be able fully to exercise their fundamental right of making a representation and would not be able to furnish a proper defence to the charge made against them Judicial literature abounds in cases where words and passages likely to cause disaffection between Hindus and Muslims or which have that effect have been considered and discussed detention case on a similar charge should be regarded as insufficient when a man has not even a right of being heard in person and has merely to defend himself by means of a written representation No reason whatsoever has been stated in the affidavit of the District Magistrate for not disclosing the words used by the detenus even after this length of time and from which he drew the conclusions on the basis of which he has kept the petition ers under detention for a period well over six months or more For the reasons given above I venture to dissent from the opinion of the majority of the <ORG> with great respect and hold that the detention orders above mentioned are illegal I accordingly order the release of the petition ers On the other points argued in the case I agree with judgment of <NAME> <NAME> agree with my brother <NAME> whose judgment I have had the advantage of reading and with the utmost respect find myself unable to accept the majority view In others <ORG> has been given the power to impose fur ther restrictions and in doing so to confer authority on the executive to carry its purpose into effect We are here to preserve intact for the peo ples of India the freedoms which have now been guaranteed to them and which they have learned through the years to cher ish to the very fullest extent of the guarantee and to ensure that they are not whittled away or brought to nought either by <ORG>ary legislation or by executive action It is the right to personal freedom which is affected here what the Constitution calls the right to move freely throughout the territory of India So far as the Constitution is concerned it has given <ORG> the power to legislate on this subject by article read with item of List I of the th Schedule and item a in List III and I have no doubt that the legislation sought to be impugned here is intra vires But I am unable to hold that the executive action taken in these cases on the strength of that legislation is within the law The executive has no power to detain except within the four corners of the Constitution and the Act now challenged The provisions of the Constitution relevant to the present purpose have been examined by this <ORG> in previous cases and I have neither the right nor the desire to go behind them I conceive it to be our duty to give the fullest effect to every syllable in the Articles dealing with these rights But I do insist that they should be interpreted in a broad and liberal sense so as to bring out in the fullest measure the purpose which the framers of the Constitution had in mind as gathered from the language they used and the spirit their words convey namely to confer the fullest possible degree of personal liberty upon the subject consistent with the safety and welfare of the <ORG> Put at their highest the grounds set out the date and place of the meetings at which the speeches complained of are said to have been made and they do no more than say that they were Now I fully agree that each case will have to be decided on its own facts so far as this is concerned He may know what he said but he cannot know what the authorities think he said unless they give him some reasona ble inkling of what is in their minds It has to be remem bered that what <ORG> has before it is not necessarily the words employed or even their substance but what the authorities say the man said What would be the value of a detenu saying I said nothing objectionable and that is almost all he can say in such a case The fact that there is absent in the case of these persons all the usual safeguards the glare of publicity the right to know with precision the charge against him the right to speak in his own defence is all the more reason why <ORG> should be thoughtful considerate and kind and should give them the maximum help My attention has been drawn to two decisions of this Court which are said to be on all fours with the present case It was also said there that the conferment of the right to make a representation necessarily carries with it the obligation on the part of the detaining authority to furnish the grounds i mate rials on which the detention order was made It is therefore sufficient for me to say that in a case of this kind where the matter has to turn on the facts and circumstances of each case no useful purpose can be served by examining the facts of some other case for use as an analogy
