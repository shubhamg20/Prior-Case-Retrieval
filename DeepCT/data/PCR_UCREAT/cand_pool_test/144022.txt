The claim was resisted by defendants and mostly on the ground that there was a division in the family years before the suit and that the properties in Schedule and some other plaint mentioned properties belonged to defendant solely as his self acquisition They came to the conclusion that the parties constituted a joint family on the date of the institution of the suit The ground alleged by the learned District <NAME> is that defendant had no right to make the remissions without the knowledge or consent or acquiescence of the other members of the family and that he is liable for interest on the amounts he has received from the date of collection The managing member of a joint family is entitled to settle accounts with the debtors and in the course of the settlement he will have the right to make a reasonable reduction either towards interest or principal if the circumstances of the case should allow it He will have the right and discretion to make the remissions and if they were done bona fide it ought not to be open to the other members to question them but he will have to satisfy that the remissions were made by him in the interest of the family having regard to the particular circumstances of the case Prima facie the burden will be upon him and if he has given a satisfactory explanation of the same it is open to the other members to show that the remissions were not in the interest of the family and without consideration and not in the bona fide exercise of the discretion The circumstance that <ORG> was not made a party to the suits may have afforded the defendants an opportunity of taking a technical objection but cannot by itself and without any other evidence afford sufficient reason for concluding that they were compromised without adequate cause or contrary to the interests of the family
