Probate of the will was granted on the th February to <NAME> and <NAME> On the other hand Mr <NAME> on behalf of the defendant has forcibly argued that the language of the will manifests an intention on the part of the testator to confer upon his daughter family the perpetual sebaitship of the pagoda and he contends that the words giving the sebaitship to the testator daughter and her husband and their mole children successively are equivalent to an absolute gift to them of the sebaitship that these words are equivalent to the expression putra vautradi krame i son and son son successively commonly found in a Hindu will find which are regarded as apt words to pass an estate of inheritance There is a class of cases which supports Mr <NAME> argument namely Cases in which an estate is devised to a person and his children in succession where the <ORG> in order to effectuate the general intent will construe the gift as of successive estates in tail There the Marquis of Waterford devised estates to Lord <NAME> and to his children in succession and it was held that the intention of the testator was to give a succession of fee simple estates but inasmuch as it would he contrary to law to limit a fee upon a fee the <ORG> must adopt the <NAME> doctrine and interpret the will so that it may be as nearly in accordance with the intention of the testator as the law will permit He stated the principle thus When there is a devise to several in succession in words sufficient to pass the fee or the whole interest of the testator in freehold the <ORG> will in order to give effect to the general intent construe the gift as of successive estates in tail If it had been the intention of the testator to vest the sebaitship absolutely in his daughter and her husband and their male children in succession it may be that the principle laid down in the cases to which I have referred would have applied and the contention of Mr <NAME> would have been well founded But it appears to me that the language of the will precludes me from adopting this construction It is contended by the defendant that the present plaintiffs are estopped by this deed from raising the present contention who delivered the following judgment dismissing the appeal For the appellant it was contended by the Advocate General that one three contentions must prevail That the sebaitship was conferred upon the testator daughter <NAME> absolutely or that she her husband and children took as joint tenants absolutely or that the sebaitship was given to <NAME> for life then to her husband for life and then to their children absolutely This in effect means that we are to read the words and their male children successively as equivelent to a well recognized Hindu expression putra pautradi krame words regarded as sufficient to pass an estate of inheritance or to out it in another way that we must read the words used as words of limitation and not as words of purchase It was contended before us for the respondent that we are not dealing with an actual bequest or gift of immovable property but only with the appointment of sic pers sic to superintend and manage the pagoda It would appear however from the observations of their Lordships of <ORG> in the recent and as yet unreported case of <NAME> <NAME> I A I Mad We are guided by the principles laid down by their Lordships of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> I A where their Lordships say at page of the report The case is not free from difficulty but upon the best consideration I can give to the language used I do not think the testator intended to confer a perpetual sebaitship upon the daughter or her husband or their male children I do not see what reasonable effect we can give to the word successively if we adopt such a construction This reasoning seems to me rather fallacious for we are at once led to inquire what meaning in this view we can fairly attribute to the word successively and which are the words which create the perpetual sebaitship I see nothing in the will which would justify us in reading the expression male children save in its ordinary acceptation
