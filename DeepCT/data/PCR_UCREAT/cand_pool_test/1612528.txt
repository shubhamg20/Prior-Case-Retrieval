These tax revision cases arise out of orders of rectification passed by the Deputy Commissioner of Sales Tax under Section of the Sales Tax Act holding that the exemption from sales tax granted in respect of dyed yarn was unjustified and that the turnover from the same must also be brought to account for the purpose of sales tax Every dealer other than a casual trader or agent of a non resident dealer whose total turnover for a year is not less than twenty five thousand rupees and every casual trader or agent of a non resident dealer whatever be his total turnover for the year shall pay tax on his taxable turnover for that year i in the case of goods specified in the First or Second Schedule at the rates and only at the points specified against such goods in the said schedule and ii in the case of other goods at the rate of four per cent at all points of sale Every dealer other than a dealer referred to in Sub section whose total turnover for a year in respect of the goods specified in the First or Second Schedule is not less than two thousand five hundred rupees shall pay tax at the rate and only at the point specified against the goods in the First or Second Schedule as the case may be on his taxable turnover in that year relating to such goods Provided that where a tax has been levied under Sub section or Sub section of this section or under Section A in respect of the sale or purchase of goods specified in the Second Schedule and such goods are sold in the course of inter State trade or commerce the tax so levied shall be refunded to such person in such manner and subject to such conditions as may be prescribed Under Section of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act no tax shall be payable on the sale of goods specified in the second column of Schedule II It was observed What the petitioners sell may be dyed yarn but it is yarn all the same It was observed Mr <NAME> contends that when the quantity of cloth sold by the petitioners is printed coloured or dyed it gets transformed into some other material and therefore what is exported is not the same cloth It seems to us that there is a vast difference between prepared cashew nuts and printed cloth and the observations there can by no stretch of imagination have any application to this case It has nothing to do with the transformation by printing and designs on the cloth In the view which we take that the cloth exported is the same as the cloth sold by the petitioners there can be no question about the exemption clause not applying to it and if the exemption applies then the tax has been levied without jurisdiction We dismiss these tax revision cases in the circumstances without costs
