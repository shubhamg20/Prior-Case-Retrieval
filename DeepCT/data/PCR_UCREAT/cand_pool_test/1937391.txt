In the case of the Justices of the Peace for Calcutta <ORG> Sir <NAME> said We think that judgment in Clause means a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties determining some right or liability It may be either final or preliminary or interlocutory the difference between them being that a final judgment determines the whole cause or suit and a preliminary or interlocutory judgment determines only a part of it leaving other matters to the determined In the case before us the order for transfer does not involve a decision which affects the merits of the question between the parties nor does it determine some right or liability Where it was ruled that an order granting leave to sue to the plaintiff under Clause of the Letters Patent is a judgment and is appealable under Clause It was explained that an order granting leave to sue was not a mere formal order or an order merely regulating the procedure in the suit but one that had the effect of ving a jurisdiction to the <ORG> which it otherwise would no have and from this point of view it tight fairly be said lo determine some right between the parties namely the right to sue in a particular <ORG> and to compel the defendants who were not within its jurisdiction to come in and defend the suit or if they did not to make them liable to have a decree passed against them in their absence It has been contended however that the order under appeal not only directs the transfer of the suit but also declares thus the defendant firm will be at liberty to proceed with the gale in execution of the decree of <ORG> made in a previous suit This declaration is merely ancillary to the order for transfer and cannot be deemed appealable irrespective of the character of the primary order It is worthy of mention that our attention has not been drawn to any case in which an appeal has been entertained from an order of this description Orders for transfer have frequently been made for years past and many of them are to he found in the reports but there is no trace that an appeal has ever been successfully maintained against an order for transfer under Clause of the Letters Patent The result is that the appeal is dismissed with costs
