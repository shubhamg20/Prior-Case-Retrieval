The appellant offered Rs The next best offer was for Rs and the third for Rs The highest offer was accepted but the appellant could not pay the amount except the earnest money even after repeated extension of time and offer to receive the balance in instalments The public property owned by the <ORG> or by any instrumentality of the <ORG> should be generally sold by public auction or by inviting tenders not only to get the highest price for the property but also to ensure fairness in the activities of the <ORG> and public authorities The appellant submitted the highest tender in response to the said notification If the appellant could not act according to his tender there was no reason why the property should not be offered to the person who was next in order There was no bidder So the <ORG> itself had to purchase the property for about Rs There was long standing dispute between the workmen of the estate and the previous management relating to payment of their wages He had then offered Rs His tender was the next best He could not get relief in the suit since by then the sale deed was executed in favour of <ORG> He contended that the <ORG> being a public authority was bound to act reasonably and fairly and it ought not to have arbitrarily selected the purchaser This is clearly a case where in execution proceedings the decreeholder has purchased the property and thereafter the property was sold in public auction to the petitioner who purchased it for Rs Being aggrieved by the judgment of <ORG> the appellant has preferred the present appeal The only question that arises for consideration is whether on the facts and in the circumstances the <ORG> was not justified in selling the property by private negotiations in favour of <ORG> at the instance of <NAME> The learned Judge went on to state Every action taken by the Government must be in public interest the Government cannot act arbitrarily and without reason and if it does its action would be liable to be invalidated If the Government awards a contract or leases out or otherwise deals with its property or grants any other largess it would be liable to be tested for its validity on the touch stone of reasonableness and public interest and if it fails to satisfy either test it would be unconstitutional and invalid The learned Judge continued at But one basic principle which must guide the <ORG> in arriving at its determination on this question is that there is always a presumption that the <ORG>al action is reasonable and in public interest and it is for the party challenging its validity to show that it is wanting in reasonableness or is not informed with public interest This burden is a heavy one and it has to be discharged to the satisfaction of the <ORG> by proper and adequate material The <ORG> cannot lightly assume that the action taken by the <ORG> is unreasonable or without public interest because as we said above there are a large number of policy considerations which must necessarily weigh with the <ORG> in taking action and therefore the <ORG> would not strike down governmental action as invalid on this ground unless it is clearly satisfied that the action is unreasonable or not in public interest We had willy nilly to spend quite some valuable time in satisfying ourselves that the reduction in the price was a necessary and fair consequence of the reduction in the quantity of the goods later offered for sale on March One of the methods of securing the public interest when it is considered necessary to dispose of a property is to sell the property by public auction or by inviting tenders There may be situations where there are compelling reasons necessitating departure from the rule but then the reasons for the departure must be rational and should not be suggestive of discrimination The public property owned by the <ORG> or by any instrumentality of the <ORG> should be generally sold by public auction or by inviting tenders Nothing should be done by them which gives an impression of bias favouritism or nepotism The appellant submitted the highest tender in response to the said notification That was also granted to him In the circumstances however we make no order as to costs
