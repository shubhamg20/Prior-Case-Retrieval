DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH REDDY JAYACHANDRA BENCH REDDY JAYACHANDRA SHARMA CITATION AIR SCR SCC JT SCALE ACT Civil Services A Engineering Subordinate Service Rules Seniority <ORG> orders issued from time to time Supervisors upgraded as Junior Engineers on acquiring degree Degree holders directly appointed as Junior Engineers on temporary basis regularisation of Weightage given to both categories for service rendered Inter se seniority Fixation of Directions issued The <ORG> heard all the matters together and gave a finding that there was no bar to the retrospective regularisation of the directly recruited Engineers from the dates of their initial appointments In respect of upgraded Junior Engineers who acquired degree qualification after the <ORG> gave a specific direction that their seniority has to be fixed on the basis of specific notional date of appointment given to them by interspersing their names among regular Junior Engineers as arranged in chronological order of dates from which such regular Junior Engineers are entitled to count their seniority Aggrieved against the <ORG> order <ORG> and the supervisors upgraded as Junior Engineers preferred the present appeals On behalf of the <ORG> it was contended that the direction of the tribunal particularly interspersing was not workable since the upgraded Junior Engineers have put in long years of service and were discharging the same duties as the directly recruited Junior Engineers and this factor should be taken into account in fixing the notional date of appointment and inter se seniority The <ORG> has rightly pointed out that under Rule A of the A <ORG> and Subordinate Service Rules if a person having been appointed temporarily under Rule to a post borne on the cadre is subsequently appointed in the service in accordance with the rules he shall commence his probation from such subsequent date or the earlier date as the appointing authority may determine The <ORG> was also right in holding that there was no bar to the retrospective regularisation of the service of the direct recruit Junior Engineers The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The questions involved in these matters being common they are being disposed of by a common judgment First we shall state the relevant facts in each of the appeals and then formulate the points that arise for consideration CIVIL APPEAL NOS AND These two appeals are filed against the order in No The case of the petitioners is that the respondents acquired degree qualification after therefor they were not entitled to be appointed as regular <ORG> Junior Engineers and at any rate they cannot be treated as seniors on the basis of reckoning their seniority from the date of acquiring degree qualification and that the seniority of these graduate Supervisors should be reckoned from the date of their actual appointment as Junior Engineers and not from the date of acquiring degree qualification CIVIL APPEAL NO This appeal is filed against the order in No Their contention was that they were appointed much before the respondents namely the directly recruited Junior Engineers and the services of the respondents Junior Engineers should not be regularised in such a way so as to effect the seniority of the petitioners and that the seniority of the petitioners should be reckoned from the notional date of appointment CIVIL APPEAL NO This appeal is filed against the order in No After considering the various Ms and the arguments the <ORG> held that there was no bar to the retrospective regularisation of the services of the directly recruited Junior Engineers from the dates of their initial appointments We are of the opinion that once the dates from which the directly recruited Junior Engineers can claim seniority are thus fixed on the basis of this formula it should not be difficult to fix their inter se seniority vis a vis the upgraded Junior Engineers on the basis of the notional dates of appointment given to the latter His seniority will therefore have to be fixed on the basis of the specific notional date of appointment given to him by interspersing his name among the regular Junior Engineers as arranged in chronological order of dates from which such regular Junior Engineers including directly recruited Junior Engineers are entitled to count their seniority It is this part of the Order that has given rise to all these appeals before us It is contended on behalf of <ORG> that the direction given by the <ORG> particularly interspersing is not workable Learned counsel for the <ORG> however pointed out that the upgraded Supervisors have put in long years of service and they have been discharging the same duties as directly recruited Junior Engineers and that this fact also has to be borne in mind in fixing the notional date of appointment of the two categories officers and in fixing their inter se seniority For appreciating these rival contentions it becomes necessary to refer to some of the Ms particularly with a view to arrive at the crucial date in respect of each of these categories for the purpose of fixation of the seniority In conformity with the same Rule A was also relaxed for the purpose of fixing their inter se seniority Since then representations have been made to Government by several Associations that the benefit of upgradation should be extended also to Supervisors who acquired the Graduate qualification on or after On a reconsideration of the matter the Governement are of the view that some consideration should be shown to the Supervisors who have acquired the Graduate qualification while in service They will not be entitled for appointment as Junior Engineers automatically from the date of acquisition of degree qualification ii A Supervisor who is appointed as Junior Engineer shall be entitled to count rd of the service rendered by him as Supervisor before his appointment as Junior Engineer subject to a maximum of four years for the purpose of computing the service as Junior Engineer which will render him eligible for consideration for promotion as Assistant Engineer In Paragraph i it is also made abundantly clear that they will not be entitled for appointment as Junior Engineers automatically from the date of acquisition of degree qualification It must be borne in mind that it is only after acquiring such degree qualification that a Supervisor is appointed as Junior Engineer and having regard to the service rendered by him the <ORG> as a policy decided to give weightage of four years for the purpose of considering the eligibility for promotion as Assistant Engineer In this context it is contended on behalf of the upgraded <ORG> that the regularisation of the direct <ORG> retrospectively that is with effect from two years prior to the date of their appointments is unwarranted In this context the <ORG> has rightly pointed out that under Rule A of the A State and Subordinate Service Rules if a person having been appointed temporarily under Rule to a post borne on the cadre is subsequently appointed in the service in accordance with the rules he shall commence his probation from such subsequent date or the earlier date as the appointing authority may determine We agree with the <ORG> that there is no bar to the retrospective regularisa tion of the service of the direct Junior Engineers This Court held that in the light of their experience there is nothing unreasonable in giving them limited benefit or weightage <NAME> learned counsel relied on the decisions of this Court in Smt Learned counsel also relied on some unreported judgments of <ORG> in writ Petitions Nos and and also Writ Petitions Nos We have perused all these judgments and we are of the view that such a question did not arise in these cases The question to be considered is from which date the weightage of four years service should be given to the upgraded Junior Engineers namely the Supervisors Having referred to the Rules the <ORG> in paragraph observed thus We thus find that the appointment of the upgraded JEs as well as the direct JEs to the <ORG> posts have not been made strictly in accordance with the Rules and hence it is necessary for the Government to issue specific orders after following the procedure laid down in the Rules in regard to their appointment to the <ORG> post of Junior Engineers Thus after having examined the points raised for and against the action taken by the <ORG> in giving the upgraded Junior Engineers the benefit of the notional dates of appointment given to them and in giving the direct Junior Engineers benefit of the dates of the regularisation of their services from the dates of their initial appointment subject to the maintenance of the order ranking given by the we feel that the <ORG> action in this respect was quite justified The grievance of the petitioners was that the respondents could not have been put above the petitioners in the matter of seniority and their seniority should have been reckoned from the date of their acquiring the graduate qualification They have questioned Ms No under which some promotions were made on the basis of the inter se seniority list of the direct recruits and upgraded Junior Engineers
