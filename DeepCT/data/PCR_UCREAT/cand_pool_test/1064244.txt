Though reference is made in the grounds of appeal to the carton being a piece of artistic work within Section of the Copyright Act arguments were mainly focussed on trade dress The appellants grievance in the suit as well as in the IA was that the carton was likely to confuse the buyers of corn flakes and there was every likelihood of consumers purchasing the respondent goods in the belief that they were of the appellant I would have had no hesitation to accept the arguments of Mr <NAME> Applying the test laid down therein I am of the view that the trade dress of the defendant in this case is entirely different from the trade dress of the plaintiff and there is absolutely no scope for any confusion In this appeal we have heard learned counsel for the appellant at the stage of admission It was contended before us that the learned single Judge having accepted the legal principles relied upon for the appellant in respect of trade dress erred on facts in holding that there was no scope for confusion among the consumers It was further stated that in all the cartons of <ORG> in regard to various commodities there was a red band at the top which took off from the square on the left top and ran horizontally across on the front top into the right and to the other sides and respondent also used a similar red band taking off horizontally from the square on the left top It was submitted that there was a presumption that the consumer memory was short and if a consumer had purchased a carton of appellant at one point of time he would easily mistake the respondent carton for the appellant Before we go into the above aspects it is necessary to refer to a few more facts In <ORG> <NAME> RPC the plaintiff bag displayed the words Fison Gro Bag while the defendant bag contained the words <ORG> Crop Bag and it was held that the prominence given to the name overshadowed the other similarities in get up While refusing injunction <ORG> observed that even accepting that the plaintiff had a get up reputation in their growing bags and though there were obvious similarities between the bags in issue it was inconceivable that any one seeing the defendant grow bag could fall to observe that it was a product of the defendants and that a normal purchaser could not be misled <ORG> refused to grant injunction and in <ORG> while confirming his order <NAME> observed that the word <NAME> being printed prominently on the packets and the words <ORG> printed on defendant packets there was no scope for confusion in spite of the similarity in the packets and boxes It was held by <ORG> that a fraudulent intent cannot be presumed inspite of the similarities in the bottles labels colour and medallion because the distinguishing feature of name adopted by defendants showed that they had no intention to deceive purchasers It was held that the name of <ORG> was so plainly placed upon the bottle as it could possibly be and it was in the place where Schweppes was on the bottle of the appellant and there was no intention to deceive In the present case in spite of any other close resemble ness in the cartons the name <ORG> written prominently on the respondents carton would in our view prima facie as in case before Lord <NAME> show that there was no intention on the part of the defendant to play fraud by misrepresenting his goods as the goods of the appellant That brings us finally to the question of the failing memory of the customer It has now been held that there are limitations to the theory of imperfect memory It says The <ORG> must bear in mind that the marks will not normally be seen side by side and quard against the danger that a person seeing the new mark may think that it is the same as one he has seen before or even that it is a new or associated mark of the proprietor of the formal mark Marks are often remembered by general impressions of by same essential feature <ORG> RPC PC on appeal RPC para page it is said that it is necessary to note the fact that customers for fasteners are sophisticated and discerning that defendant acted with goods faith <NAME> in fact observed in the above case Of course one knows that the persons who buy these articles are generally persons of some education my opinion is having regard to the nature of the customer the article in question and the price at which it is likely to be sold and all the surrounding circumstances no man of ordinary intelligence is likely to be deceived We are on the facts of the case before us prima facie of the same opinion in regard to <ORG> and <ORG> Learned counsel for the appellant placed reliance on <ORG> <NAME> supra Prima facie the case goes against the view expressed by <ORG> in the cases referred to above It was also held that there was infringement of registered trade mark So far as passing off was concerned it was seen as a case where having regard to the arrangement of the picture of the sweets on the top of the box that a person with imperfect memory could be misled In the result on our prima facie conclusions we reject the plea of similarity or likelihood of confusion we reject the plea of fraud as well as the one based on imperfect memory These are prima facie views and it is made clear that the suit will be disposed of on the basis of such evidence as may be produced therein without being influenced by anything said
