The plaintiffs pray that the release deed be declared void as having been obtained under coercion and that the defendant be directed to render an account of the transactions during the period he was their agent The Subordinate Judge held that the release deed was obtained from the plaintiffs agent under coercion and that they did not ratify the release deed and directed an account to be taken The defendant has preferred this appeal He wrote to the plaintiffs Ex The following passage in the letter is important As soon as he arrives get the accounts prepared and closed and come without delay If there is something more to be collected better get it collected and make out a copy of the items that can be copied and come away after getting the accounts closed on th January to the plaintiffs in which he stated You should send my salary chit to <NAME> who has come here for the new account together with a letter signed by yourself and <NAME> and directing that the accounts documents etc <NAME> strongly advised the plaintiffs to consent to give a release deed to the defendant as otherwise the plaintiffs might sustain heavy loss owing to stoppage of business and that if so advised they might take steps against him afterwards After he was asked to hand over charge to <NAME> he had no right to withhold from the plaintiffs new agent their property Coercion is defined in Section of the Contract Act as committing or threatening to commit any act forbidden by the Indian Penal Code or the unlawful detaining or threatening to detain any property to the prejudice of any person whatever with the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement IV the account books cash on hand and the vouchers were handed over to <NAME> by the defendant and he executed a power of attorney in <NAME> favour so as to enable him to collect the loans outstanding on mortgages It was necessary that <NAME> should get a fresh power of attorney from the defendant in order to realise the loans outstanding on mortgages on th April that everything had been done at the defendant request and there was no reason why he should require a fresh release and that their clients were unwilling to accede to that request The plaintiffs solicitors wrote to the defendant solicitors on th August We find that there are certain difficulties in connection with the making of a vesting order in Johore and that it would therefore be necessary to sue for a declaration and an order to execute the transfer He seems to have insisted that the counsel for the plaintiffs should make a statement that the plaintiffs ratified the arrangement under Ex As a mere vesting order on originating summons would not satisfy the requirements of the law obtaining in Johore the plaintiffs solicitors filed Suit No of in <ORG> praying for an order directing the defendant to execute in the name of <NAME> in manner conforming with the law in Johore such memoranda or other documents as may be necessary according to the laws of Johore to transfer each of the said charges to the plaintiffs or their present agent <NAME> son of <NAME> It is contended by Mr <NAME> for the plaintiffs that the counsel had no authority to make the statement that the plaintiffs acknowledge that the said release was and is in full force and of full effect and that it is for the defendant to show that the counsel was specially authorised to make it The only question is whether he had authority to bind his clients by the statement he made The learned Chief justice observes at page There cannot I think be any reasonable doubt at the present day that counsel possesses a general authority an apparent authority which must be taken to continue until notice be given to the other side by the client that it has been determined to settle and compromise the suit in which he is actually retained as counsel and in the exercise of his discretion to do that which he considers best for the interest of his client in the conduct of the particular case in which he is so retained Here there was no settlement of collateral matters These are some observations of <ORG> which may be taken as lending support to Mr <NAME> contention There are a number of cases which take a liberal view of the authority of a counsel to compromise suits in which he is engaged In <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> ER Sir <NAME> observes In the absence of evidence a Court will conclude that he had authority for it is not to be presumed that counsel would enter into an agreement without authority There is in this case evidence on both sides but after duly considering it I come to the conclusion that counsel had authority which would bind his client <ORG> ILR the plaintiffs instituted a suit for the recovery of the price of goods sold and delivered to the defendants and for damages in respect of goods of which it was alleged the defendants had refused to take delivery making a total claim of Rs It was admitted that the attorney for the defendants who was present in <ORG> never asked the learned Counsel to settle the suit nor did he put any limitation on the authority or discretion of the learned Counsel in any respect to compromise the suit The following observation of the learned Chief Justice may well be applied to the present case In my judgment there is no evidence in this case that there was any limitation placed upon the authority of the learned Counsel I have a strong suspicion that the course which the learned Counsel took on behalf of the defendants was a wise one having regard to the nature of the suit and the admissions which the defendants made in the suit There are numerous cases English and Indian on the question of a counsel power to make admissions in or to refer to arbitration or compromise suits in which he is instructed A counsel has authority to confess judgment withdraw or compromise or refer to arbitration the suit in which he is instructed if his doing so is for his client advantage or benefit even though he has no express authority from his client A counsel cannot without express authority agree to compromise or refer to arbitration matters unconnected with the subject matter of the suit in which he is instructed Where in the course of a suit a counsel makes an admission as to a collateral matter or gives up a doubtful claim which is not a subject matter of the suit there is a presumption that the counsel acts under instructions if the admission or the giving up of the doubtful claim is for the benefit of the client It is a question of fact in each case whether the counsel acts under instructions when he compromises or refers to arbitration matters not involved in the suit and the Court on a consideration of the probabilities and the circumstances of the case can find that the counsel acted on instructions even though there is no direct evidence on the point A counsel has no power to make an admission in or compromise or refer to arbitration a suit if he is instructed not to do so without express authority from his client All the circumstances of the case and the evidence on record the non examination by the plaintiffs of their agent <NAME> who instructed the counsel in the proceedings before <ORG> the absence of any statement in the nd plaintiff deposition that he or his brother the st plaintiff did not empower <NAME> to make the statement as to ratification contained in the judgment of <ORG> the urgency with which the mortgage deeds were required by the plaintiffs and the speedy manner in which the suit was decreed in plaintiffs favour owing to the defendant consent to accept service and remain ex parte and the readiness with which the defendant executed the transfer deed within a fortnight of the approval of the draft judgment by his solicitors lead to the irresistible conclusion that the plaintiffs counsel was specially authorised to make the statement that the plaintiffs acknowledged that the said release was and is in full force and of full effect Even if the counsel was not specially instructed to make the statement we hold that the circumstances of the case and the evidence on record fully justify the conclusion that he acted within his authority in making the above statement A decree has been passed embodying the statement by <ORG> and in pursuance of that decree the defendant signed the transfer deeds We have therefore no hesitation in holding that the plaintiffs by their counsel ratified the arrangement evidenced by <ORG> and they cannot now sue to set it aside In the result the appeal is allowed and the plaintiffs suit dismissed We therefore direct that each party do bear his costs throughout
