This first appeal by the vendee <NAME> is directed against the judgment and decree of the Additional District Judge No Jaipur City dated September decreeing the suit of the respondent <NAME> for pre emption It is however admitted by the parties that before the sale actually took place a general notice in the name of the appellant husband <NAME> was published in a newspaper showing <NAME> intention to purchase the disputed property The respondent <NAME> instituted a suit on Dec It was further alleged in the plaint that though the vendor had earlier agreed to sell the property to the pre emptor <NAME> for a consideration of Rs The suit was resisted by the appellant vendee as also by the vendor respondent No on the ground that the respondent pre emptor has waived his right of pre emption on repairs of the disputed property and a decree for possession of the house in dispute can only be passed in favour of the pre emptor on payment of Rs As regards the other issues the trial court on consideration of the evidence led by the parties recorded the following findings That there was no waiver of the right of pre emption on the part of the plaintiff inasmuch as there existed no reliable evidence to prove that the suit house was offered for sale to the plaintiff for Rs That though the defendant vendee carried out repairs and improvements on the disputed property there was no reliable evidence to prove how much amount was spent by her vendee It is not in dispute that the plaintiff had a proferential right to purchase the property in dispute under the Act According to the learned counsel if in the light of the above admission of the plaintiff the oral evidence produced by the defendant vendee is judged there exists ample evidence on the record to show that the plaintiff was consulted not only before the agreement to sell was executed between the vendor and the vendee but also before the actual sale took place in favour of the vendee It is urged that the plaintiff <NAME> was offered to purchase the property in question and that it is only when he declined to do so the defendant vendee purchased the same On the other hand it is contended by Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the plaintiff respondent that there is no reliable evidence on record to show that after the agreement of sale was entered into between the purchaser and the seller on any offer was made either by the vendee or the vendor to purchase the suit property He therefore contends that no question of waiver arises in the present case Mr <NAME> also invited my attention to the notice given by the plaintiff to the appellant and also to her husband <NAME> and the replies received from them Mr <NAME> has further argued that there exists no documentary evidence to show even remotely that the vendor or her husband ever approached the plaintiff and made any offer to purchase the property either before or at the time or after the sale took place Mr <NAME> further pointed out that the oral evidence produced in the case by the defendant vendee is wholly unreliable being afterthought and consists of the persons who are either relatives of the vendee or are highly interested in the success of the vendee In the present case as already pointed out above it is not in dispute that notice under Section of the Act was not given by the seller to the plaintiff Notice to pre emptors When any person proposes to sell or to foreclose the right to redeem any immovable property in respect of which any persons have a right of pre emption he shall give notice to all such persons as to the price at which he is proposing so to sell or as to the amount due in respect of the mortgage proposed to be foreclosed as the case may be Any person having a right of pre emption in respect of any immovable property proposed to be sold shall lose such right unless within two months from the date of the service of such notice he or his agent pays or tenders the price specified in the notice given under Section to the person so proposing to sell Provided that the right of pre emption shall not be so lost if the immovable property in question is actually sold for an amount smaller than that mentioned in the notice or to a person not mentioned in the notice as purchaser These provisions in the Act provide that if the seller serves a notice in writing in the manner prescribed under Sub section of Section of the Act intimating his desire to sell the property for a specified sum mentioned therein then if the pre emptor does not exercise his right of pre emption within the period prescribed under Section of the Act the sale would not be challenged on the ground that the pre emptor had better title to purchase the property the purchaser the pre emptor and the vendor so that after the sale has taken place nobody thereafter can claim a preferential right to purchase the property Another purpose of such a notice under Section is that it discloses to the prospective purchaser the name or names of those persons who have a preferential claim to the property by invoking their right of pre emption It must however be remembered that the steps to be taken under Section are available to the vendor only and not to the vendee In the present case it is contended by Mr <NAME> that the husband of the vendee published a general notice in a newspaper before the property was actually sold by the vendor and therefore in such circumstances it should be held that the piaintiff pre emptor had forfeited his right of pre emption In my opinion there is no substance in the above center on A general notice issued in the present case by the husband of the vendee in a newspaper signifying his intention to purchase the property and inviting objections if any does not cast any duty on the pre emptor to give any response to such a notice and put forth his preferential right to purchase the property and negotiate with the purchaser to purchase the property There is no documentary evidence in proof of the above fact The case on the point of waiver solely rests on the oral testimony of <NAME> <NAME> vendee <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> husband of the vendee <NAME> <NAME> father of the vendor and <NAME> <NAME> The primary right claimed by the pre emptor as explained by <ORG> undoubtedly resides in the pre emptor even before the sale takes place A reading of these two paras clearly goes to show that the agreement between the plaintiff and the vendor if at all it took place must have taken place long before March on which date the vendor executed agreement to sell the property in question in favour of the vendee There is thus no substance in the argument of Mr <NAME> that the admission contained in para No is relevant on the question of deciding waiver on the part of the plaintiff Omission to mention these important facts in reply Ex Besides that the plaintiff sent a notice Ex The witness then says that thereafter he left for his house and no agreement to sell was executed before him I have carefully gone through his statement and I have no hesitation to say that he is not a reliable witness According to the witness <NAME> in his presence and in the presence of <NAME> asked <NAME> to purchase the property in dispute but <NAME> declined to do so and also allowed <NAME> to purchase the property in dispute On the other hand the plaintiff <NAME> in his statement as and has totally denied that he had any talk with <NAME> or <NAME> or <NAME> at any time before or after the sale and that he agreed not to object if the property was purchased by <NAME> There is thus no reliable evidence to prove that after the agreement for sale between the vendor and the vendee was concluded and the price was fixed between them an approach was made to the plaintiff to purchase the property in dispute for the price settled between the vendor and the vendee The relevant portion of Section of the Act reads as follows When the transferee of immovable property makes any improvement on the property believing in good faith that he is absolutely entitled thereto and he is subsequently evicted therefrom by any person having a better title the transferee has a right to require the person causing the eviction either to have the value of the improvement estimated and paid or secured to the transferee or to sell his interest in the property to the transferee at the then market value thereof irrespective of the value of such improvement The amount to be paid or secured in respect of such improvement shall be the estimated value thereof at the time of the eviction In the present case there is no room for any doubt that the defendant vendee knew it very well from the very beginning that the plaintiff being a co sharer and having other rights had a right of pre emption under the Act On consideration of the evidence on record I have further come to the conclusion that neither the vendee nor the vendor took steps to be sure that the plaintiff would not pre empt Consequently she is not entitled to any amount spent on account of repairs and improvements There is yet another aspect of the case The sale deed in the present case was executed in favour of the vendee on June In this notice it was specifically mentioned that the plaintiff has preferential right to purchase the property by way of pre emption A similar notice was issued by the plaintiff to the defendant <NAME> on The reply given by <NAME> to the notice Ex It further appears from the statement of <NAME> that the plaintiff <NAME> objected to carrying out of repairs even before any notice was sent to <NAME> or her husband <NAME> <NAME> then replied that he would serve a notice in this connection There is thus no doubt that the defendant vendee did not stop the work of repairs and improvements even after it was objected to by the plaintiff respondent The defendant appellant in the circumstances was rightly held not entitled to the amount spent by her on repairs and improvements In this connection I would like to mention Section of the Transfer of Property Act wherein it has been provided that the amount to be paid in respect of improvements shall be the estimated value thereof at the time of the eviction
