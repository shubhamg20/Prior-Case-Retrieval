of the Constitution is wider than maintenance of public order because a law may not have been designed to directly maintain public order and yet it may have been enacted in the interest of public order and public order is capable of taking within itself not only the absence of those acts which disturb the security of the <ORG> or the absence of insurrection riot turbulence or crimes of violence but also absence of certain acts which disturb public tranquility or are breaches of peace The area of detention by a Magistrate under the Code of Criminal Procedure and the area under the laws relating to preventive detention are entirely different A Ordinarily the order would be directed against a person found acting or likely to act in a particular way A general order is thus justified but if the action is too general the order may be questioned by appropriate reinedies for which there is ample provision in law A person affected by the order can ask the order to be vacated as against him he can file a revision and even a petition for issue of a writ The restraint is temporary the power is exercised by senior Magistrates who have to make a judicial enquiry and give reasons for the order with an opportunity to an aggrieved person to have it rescinded either by the Magistrate or by superior courts Section enables certain specified class es of Magistrates to make an order calling upon a person to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a bond with or without sureties for keeping the peace for such period not exceeding one year as the Magistrate thinks fit to fix The condition for taking action is that the Magistrate is informed and he is of the opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding that a person is likely to commit a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquillity or to do any wrongful act that may probably occasion a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquillity A The procedure for taking action is set out in the remaining sections of the Chapter These provisions are thus essentially conceived in the interest of public order and in the interest of the general public If the prevention of crimes and breach of peace and disturbance of public tranquillity are directed to the maintenance of the even tempo of community life they are in the interest of public order and there is nothing contrary to Art There is no room for invocation of ss or of the Code of Criminal Procedure in considering the effect of Chapter VII Per Bhargava a Under the Magistrate takes action when he is informed that any person is likely to commit a breach of peace or disturb the public tranquillity only after forming an opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against him When making that order he has to record in it in writing the substance of the information received which necessarily means the part of the information which was the basis It is at this preliminary stage that the Magistrate is thus required to ensure that a prima facie case does exist for the purpose of initiating proceedings against the person who is to be called upon to furnish security for keeping the peace Such a power is obviously necessary where there is immediate danger of breach of the peace and immediate measures are necessary for its prevention When the inquiry is held the correctness of the information and the tentative opinion formed ex parte under will be properly tested after going through the judicial procedure prescribed and if it is found that there was no justification the order would be revoked A A person may be detained in jail even prior to a court arriving at a judicial finding but such a procedure is not only reasonable but essential The power is similar to that given to a Magistrate to order the detention as an undertrial prisoner of a person accused of a cognizable offence even though in law he is deemed to be innocent JUDGMENT ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Writ Petitions Nos and of a and We reservedour reasons and now we proceed to give them All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression to assemble Peaceably and without arms to form associations or union and to move freely throughout the territory of India These sub clauses deal with four distinct but loosely related topics The clauses as they exist today read Nothing in sub clause a of clause shall affect the operation of any existing law or prevent the <ORG> from making any law in so far as such law imposes reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India the security of the <ORG> friendly relations with foreign <ORG>s public order decency or morality or in relation to contempt of court defamation or incitement to an offence Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the <ORG> from making any law imposing in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause Nothing in sub clause of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing in the interests of the sovereignty and integrity of India or public order or morality reasonable restrictions on the exercise of the right conferred by the said sub clause and Nothing in sub clause and of the said clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevent the State from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of the rights conferred by the said subclauses either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe Before we proceed to do so we may dispose of a very ingenious argument by Mr <NAME> which may be summarised thus The original clause had to be read on the commence ment of the Constitutionand it was as follows Nothing in sub clause a of clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates or prevent the <ORG> from making any law relating to libel slander defamation contempt of Court or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> This clause did not allow restrictions to be placed in the interests of public order on which the impugned provisions are justified today Therefore although we consider the matter today after much history has been written and then unwritten by retrospective amendments of the Constitution assuming this to be permissible we read the protection of amended cl as available from January without a break Firstly what is meant by the expressions in the interest of public order occurring in cls It was observed that a law may not have been designed to directly maintain public order and yet it may have been enacted in the interest of public order as it was then worded gave protection to a law relating to any matter which undermined the security of or tended to overthrow the <ORG> be restricted to the aggravated form of activities which were calculated to endanger the security of the <ORG> Nor was there any guarantee that those officers who exercised the Power under the Act would in using them discriminate between those who acted prejudicially to the security of the <ORG> and those who did not Article has been amended so as to extend its protection to a law imposing reasonable restrictions in the interests of public order and the language used in the two sections of the impugned Act quite clearly and explicitly limits the exercise of the powersconferred by them to the purposes specifically mentioned in the sections and to no other purpose He referred first to the observations of <NAME> later in <NAME> case supra distinguishing offences involving disturbances of public tranquillity which the learned Judge said were in theory offences against public order of a purely local significance and other forms The words public order and Public tranquillity overlap to a certain extent but there are matters which disturb public tranquillity without being a disturbance of public order it was pointed out that for expounding the phrase maintenance of public order One has to imagine three concentric circles Law and order represents the largest circle within which is the next circle representing public order and the smallest circle represents the security of the State The acts become graver and graver as we journey from the periphery of the largest circle towards the centre In this journey we travel first through public tranquillity then through public order and lastly to the security of the <ORG> In our judgment the expression in the interest of public order in the Constitution is capable of taking within itself not only those acts which disturb the security of the <ORG> or are within ordre publique as dewribed but also certain acts which disturb public tranquillity or are breaches of the peace it was argued that there cannot be two kinds of detention one by Magistrates under the Code of Criminal Procedure an another under laws made for preventive detention under Art We proceed to consider the impugned provisions of the Code in light of what we have said above We first take up for consideration of the Code finds place in Chapter XI which contains one section only The section confers powers to issue order absolute at once in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger Such orders may be made by specified classes Magistrates when in their opinion there is sufficient ground proceeding under the section and immediate prevention or speedy remedy is desirable The order may direct A Any person to abstain from a certain act or to take certain order with certain property in his possession or under his management Stated briefly the section provides for the making of an which is either prohibitory A or mandatory as above Under sub the order may be directed to a particular individual or to the public generally when frequenting or visiting a particular place An order by the Magistrate does not remain in force after two months from the making thereof but the State Government may however extend the period by a notification in the <ORG> but only in cases of danger to human life health or safety or where there is a likelihood of a riot or an affray Further the order may be so general as to affect not only a particular party but persons who are innocent as for example when there is in order banning meetings processions playing of music etc The effect of the order being in the interest of public order and the interests of the general public occasions may arise when it is not possible to distinguish between those whose conduct must be controlled and those who conduct is clear Thus the person affected has several remedies But no person can ask to be considered free to do what he likes when there are grounds for thinking that his conduct would be of the kind des cribed in the section for purposes of preventive action Ordinarily the order would be directed against a person found acting or likely to act in a particular way A general order is thus justified but if the action is too general the order may be questioned by appropriate remedies for which there is ample provision in the law We have reconsidered all these matters and are satisfied that there are sufficient safeguards available to person affected by the order and the restriction therefore are reasonable and it provides that on conviction for certain offences the <ORG> may at the time of passing sentence on the person convicted if of opinion that it is necessary to take a bond for future good behaviour order him to execute a bond with or without sureties for keeping the peace for a period not exceeding three years Sections lay down the procedure to be followed in these cases It enables certain specified classes of Magistrates to make an order calling upon a person to show cause why he should not be ordered to execute a bond with or without sureties for keeping the peace for such period not exceeding one year as the Magistrate thinks fit to fix The condition of taking action is that the Magistrate is informed and he is of opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding that a person is likely to commit a breach of the peace or disturb the public tranquillity or to do any wrongful act that may probably occasion a breach of the peace or disturb the public tran quillity It is also contended that there are no proper procedural safeguards in the sections that follow Before we deal with these contention it is necessary to glance briefly at ss of <ORG> and ss A of Division We have seen the provision of It requires that the Magistrate acting under shall make an order in writing setting forth the substance of the information received the amount of the bond the term for which it is to be in force and the number character and class of sureties if any required It may not repeat the information bodily but it must give proper notice of what has moved the Magistrate to take the action Section deals with the situation when the person is present in court then the order shall be read over to him and if he so desires the substance of it shall be explained to him Section then provides that such summons or warrant under as the case may be must be accompanied by the order under and the person serving or executing the summons or warrant must serve the order on the person There is enabling power in under which the Magistrate may dispense with the presence of the person in Court and allow him to appear by a pleader and which do not concern us may be read here of any offence or for the public safety may for reasons to be recorded in writing direct the person in respect of whom the order under section has been made to execute a bond with or without sureties for keeping the peace on maintaining good behaviour until the conclusion of the inquiry and may detain him in custody until such bond is executed or in default of execution until the enquiry is coneluded The Magistrate has to justify his action by reasons to be recorded in writing There is a difference of opinion in the High Courts <NAME> there was only a petition and a report and these were not found sufficient material The case arose before the present Code of Criminal Procedure and therefore there was no provision for an interim bond The order must be one which can be made into a final order unless something to the contrary is established that as the case was simply adjourned from time to time and there was no inquiry before remanding him to custody his detention was illegal Section gives the contents of the bond and the conditions under which there is a breach of the bond Section gives power to commit a person to prison or to be detained in prison if already there for the duration mentioned in the bond Section empowers the District Magistrate or a Chief Presidency Magistrate to release a person so detained when there is no longer any hazard to the community or to any other person There are other provisions for reducing security etc There is no need to prove overt acts although if overt acts have taken place they will have to be considered The action being preventive is not based on overt act but on the potential danger to be averted These provisions are thus essentially conceived in the interest of public order in the sense defined by us We find nothing contrary to article a and because the limits of the restrictions are well within cls Before we leave this topic it is necessary to emphasise that there is no room for invocation of other provisions of the Code such as or Then there is no room for There is also no question of bail to the person because if instead It has to be noticed that when proceedings are contemplated under section the Magistrate takes action when he is informed that any person is likely to commit a breach of the peace or disturb the public tranquillity only after forming an opinion that there is sufficient ground for proceeding against him When making that order he has to record in it in writing the substance of the information received which necessarily means the part of the information which was the basis of his opinion that sufficient ground exist for initiating the proceedings Another alternative procedure is laid down for cases where it appears to the Magistrate t<NAME>t there is reason to fear the commission of a breach of the peace and t<NAME>t such breach of the peace cannot be prevented otherwise t<NAME>n by the immediate arrest of such person in such case the Magistrate can issue a warrant for the arrest of t<NAME>t person In such cases the person concerned has a right to be represented by a lawyer in the inquiry It is in the light of these principles that in my opinion the power granted to the Magistrate under section should be interpreted That power is given for cases where immediate measures are necessary for the prevention of a breach of the peace Such a power for requiring that bonds be furnished pending inquiry is obviously necessary where there is immediate danger of breach of the peace and immediate measures are necessary for its prevention Subsequently of course when the inquiry is held under the correctness of the information and the tentative opinion formed ex parte under will be pro perly tested after going through the judicial procedure prescribed for the trial of summons cases and thereupon if it is found that there was no justification the order would be revoked If trate has sufficiently reliable information to form an opinion that a person has committed a cognizable offence the Magistrate can order his detention as an undertrial prisoner In this connection it was urged by Mr <NAME> that if is interpreted as permitting a Magistrate to direct furnishing of bonds for keeping the peace and to order detention in default without any evidence being obtained in the course of the inquiry the Magistrate may keep on adjourning the hearing of the inquiry under and thus keep the person in detention for long periods without giving him the opportunity of showing that there is no justification for orders being made against him rafter making orders under unnecessarily postpones the inquiry he would in my opinion be not only abusing his powers but will be acting contrary to the mandate of the law contained in itself which as I have indicated above requires that the Magistrate must proceed to enquire into the truth of the information without unnecessary delay
