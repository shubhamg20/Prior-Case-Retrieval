According to the plaintiffs the st defendant overloaded bus propelled recklessly by its driver barged against a waterpipe pillar turned turtle and as a result several persons sustained serious injuries of whom the three men later succumbed to their injuries and died All the three were the breadwinners of their poor families and on their death the dependants were cut adrift and so they claimed compensation under the Fatal Accidents Act Act of for short called the Act by way of pauper suits which were duly resisted by the owner of the bus the st defendant company both regarding culpability and quantum of compensation If that be so and perhaps it is Government is lucky that few people are conscious of their right to claim damages from it where the injury is reasonably occasioned by its misfeasance But I have no doubt that the negligence of the defendant driver is the causa causans of the accident under consideration However he rightly stressed his case that the quantum of compensation award able under the Act was far less than the excessive award made by <ORG> and on this part of the case we found consideraable force in his submission But we find a curious and indefensible procedure in drawing up a common decree for all the three suits each suit must have a separate decree and even where there is a joint trial there cannot be joint decree What happens if all these dependants are not on record although they are alive or the suit is brought by some but not for the benefit of the others also Strictly speaking the section visualises some sort of a representative action but where the suit is brought not by the executor or administrator but by some of the beneficiaries themselves should the suit be dismissed because the others are not on record That would be taking an extremely technical view and therefore an objection in that form taken in two suits where the parents are alive but not impleaded nor claim made on their behalf has been rightly overruled by <ORG> although that does not mean that the plaintiffs should get the benefit of the compensation which should have gone to the parents had they also claimed There was evidence led regarding funeral expenses presumably on the footing that a claim could be put forward in that behalf but the Indian Act does not provide for it while the amended English Act provides for award of damages in respect of the funeral expenses of the deceased if such expenses have been incurred by the parties for whoso benefit the action is brought We are therefore concerned only with assessing the amount of damages awardable to such of the plaintiffs as come within die scope of Section A of the Act measured by the loss occasioned to them by the death of the one on whom they depended although a claim under Section of the Act available to the legal representatives by way of loss caused to the estate of the deceased has not been put forward by a serious omission in the pleading Facts material to issue under Section A are set out below A No of The multiplier to be adopted and the circumstances relevant to fixing the multiplier As in the case of A taking into account the decrease in multiplier How do we ascertain the loss of the pecuniary benefit arising from the relationship which would have been derived from the continuance of the life and which may consist of money property or services in other words the value of the dependency This amount would depend largely upon how long the deceased would have lived and earned had he not been killed by the accident and how long the dependants would live in other words on how long the dependency would last What would the deceased have contributed on an average to the dependant well being over the years in other words what is the basic figure In a world where imponderable forces operate and unexpected changes occur a peep into the future and prediction with precision of things dependant on varying human and social factors may be cynically called an exercise in the art of pretense Had he been alive he would have given various small sums over the months and the years and to pay the aggregate in one lump is to help the dependant benefit by the death Similarly there are contingencies which might cut off the benefit prematurely This is not very scientific because this annual figure may vary from time to time and for a number of reasons but effect is given to these uncertainties while choosing the multiplier as is the practice in <ORG> The expectation of life not merely of the deceased but also of the dependant is a matter to be taken into account particularly when we are dealing with aged parents as dependants for in No of Among the many matters urged on this part of the case there is one which has been the subject of much debate It seems to me wholly wrong to say that where a death which involves the liability of a third party has occurred as in the case some years before the assessment of damages by the <ORG> the <ORG> ought to shut its eyes to the fact that one dependant has had only a short tenure of life before death put an end to her dependence And so if a decree is passed on a reasonable estimate made by the plaintiff of the expectation of his life the defendant consents to it and files no appeal and some days later the claimant dies can the defendant get the award of compensation upset on that ground or has he to accept it as a decree of fate what if the man lives longer If the decree can be amended on this ground can it be done years later or on the score that other similar material factors have altered That would be introducing hobgoblins into the administration of law and un doing finality of decisions for every Such illustrations bring home the necessity for drawing the line somewhere and the futility of endeavouring to avoid injustice by looking into later happenings apart from procedural complications of pleading and evidence So long as there is a comprehensive legal proceeding pending an appeal in which the subject matter of compensation is legitimately available for judicial scrutiny light on the decisive facts beyond the manipulation of parties may be received and reliefs moulded accordingly But our imperfect instruments have pragmatic limits in the search for perfection The learned Chief Justice observed in that case which was one relating to the grant of a permit to one among many competing applicants under the Motor Vehicles Act having regard to development between the disposal by the <ORG> and the hearing of the appeal by the A If the duty of <ORG> is to decide as we think it is whether <ORG> was wrong or not it must naturally follow that the appellate decision must be on the basis of the facts and circumstances which formed the foundation of the order under appeal There is of course a type of subsequent events which a Court of appeal has to take into account in moulding the relief to be granted the death of a party a change of law AIR FC a judgment in rem AIR SC There are certain exceptions engrafted upon this rule as pointed out by My Lord the Chief Justice A great deal of argument and reference to precedents has been our pleasure to listen to but I am not much the wiser for all that because essentially this is a question which has to be resolved on the specific facts and circumstances of each case the broad guidelines of judicial pronouncements being helpful only to a limited degree No one knows what is the right sum of damages in any particular case and no two cases are alike I do not consider that a Judge is bound to hear such evidence fof compensation awarded in other comparable cases It would not be wrong for counsel appearing in such a case to say to a Judge I have here the report of a decision in the <ORG> of Appeal on an appeal on damages in a case very like this one and I have another case a decision of Mr Justice <NAME> a case again very like this one Would your Lordship like to have them The Judge could not be wrong if he said Yes I should like that information I should like to know what the <ORG> of Appeal said and I should like to know how Mr Justice <NAME> dealt with this subject for it is one of which no one has great experience In the case of <NAME> it has been mentioned by the <ORG> below that there was some property belonging to him which would be inherited by the claimants in the present suit and that income should be deducted when working out the annual value of the dependency As I mentioned earlier there are two ways in which the present value of the dependency can be worked out either you fix he multiplier disregarding the fact of lump sum payment now and then with reference to the relevant annuity tables read down that figure into the present value or alternatively you reduce the multiplier having in mind the thought that a lump sum is being paid now in the place of staggered payments over the years I see no reason why a successful party should be made to suffer because his claim is not decided soon after the filing of his plaint Mr Justice <NAME> observed on the same question It is however contended for the defendant that if at the time of the suit the damages were unliquidated interest cannot be awarded under the section I find it difficult to accept the suggestion that the word money in the section should be understood in the limited sense of an ascertained sum Had the plaintiff brought the suit in the ordinary course he would have had to pay Court fee on the full amount claimed in the plaint The direction regarding court fee has not been challenged before us by any party and it is not part of the subject matter in appeal and so we leave it as it is In one part of the judgment i at the close of paragraph the learned Subordinate Judge rightly observed It is therefore clear that the plaintiffs have sought their remedies only under Section A in the plaint and they cannot at this stage assert any claim under Section Somewhat curiously what he said in paragraph swam out of his ken as he reached paragraph for he concludes Taking all these facts into consideration considering the pain and sufferings and mental agnoy the deceased persons had till their death and the loss of expectations of life and considering the age of the persons it seems to me that it will be reasonable to fix Rs And what is stranger still all the three plaints allege not the pain and suffering of the deceased which alone are compensable under Section of the Act but the great mental pain and shock due to this tragedy to the plaintiffs for which there is no remedy except words of sympathy The Act contemplates not merely the award of a gross sum by way of compensation payable by the defendant but also its division among the dependants proportioned to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively The appeals are allowed to the extent set out above I have read the Judgment prepared by my learned brother and I unreservedly agree with the conclusions reached by him and with the reasoning germane thereto
