Bench in pursuance my order dated March and the question which arises for determination is whether the trial Magistrate could pass an order for summoning the petitioners as accused persona even though the police challaned some other persons and not the petitioners <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> who are all brothers were not challaned and their names were mentioned in column No of the challan The learned Magistrate after hearing the counsel for the parties passed an order on June to the effect that <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> be summoned as accused persons to stand trial along with other three accused for causing injuries to <NAME> and <NAME> When the case came up for hearing before me on March it was pointed out that there was some conflict of view Except as hereinafter provided any Presidency Magistrate District Magistrate or Sub divisional Magistrate and any other Magistrate specially empowered in this behalf may take cognizance of any offence a upon receiving a complaint of facts which constitute such offence upon a report in writing of such facts made by any police officer upon information received from any person other than a police officer or upon his own knowledge or suspicion that such offence has been committed Perusal of the above sub section goes to show that when a Magistrate acts under any of the clauses of the above Sub Section he takes cognizance of an offence The expression takes cognizance of an offence cannot be equated to take cognizance of an offender and the normal rule is that when a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence he takes cognizance of the case as a whole The contention that when a Magistrate takes cognizance under Clause of the above Sub Section upon a report made by a police officer he is restricted to issuing process only to the persons challaned by the police is not warranted by the language of the sub section The matter has been dealt with on page of Sohoni Code of Criminal Procedure th Edition and the passage which is based upon a number of authorities reads as under Generally when a Magistrate has taken cognizance of an offence and proceeds with the trial of the case it is his duty to proceed to deal with the evidence brought before him and to see that justice is done in regard to any person who might be proved by the evidence to be concerned in that offence The ordinary rule is that when a Magistrate takes cognizance of an offence he takes cognizance of the case as a whole and is empowered to summon all persons against whom there appears to be any reason for their prosecution even though their names are not mentioned for this purpose in the petition of complaint It is to be noted that the expression cognizance of an offence in this Section is not equivalent of the cognizance of an offender for the definition of complaint includes a complaint that some person unknown has committed an offence Criminal Procedure Code was sent up to the Magistrate he took cognizance of the offence of theft of six buffaloes under Section Clause and when he proceeded to deal with the evidence brought before him it was certainly his duty to see that justice was done with regard to any other person that may be suspected of being concerned in the offence The initiative was taken on the police report of the offence of theft and though the police may choose to place before the Magistrate for trial only one of the suspects yet as the Magistrate was seized of the whole case as soon as he takes cognizance of it he would be perfectly justified in issuing process against any other persons who he has reasons to believe are implicated in the offence which he has taken cognizance of and his action against them would fall under Section Clause and not under Clause This concession was not well founded because reference to Sohoni Code of Criminal Procedure th Edition page goes to show that according to <ORG> notification of all Magistrates in the Punjab of the first and second class are invested with power to take cognizance of offences upon complaint and upon information but not on their own knowledge or suspicion In none of the above two <NAME> cases in the circumstances could it be said that the Magistrate had taken cognizance of the offence while in the present case as stated above the trial Magistrate did take cognizance of the offence As a result of the above we hold that there was no legal impediment in the way of the trial Magistrate passing order for summoning the petitioners as accused persons even though the police had challaned some other persons and not the petitioners
