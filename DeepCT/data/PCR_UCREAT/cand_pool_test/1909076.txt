This arrangement however if it became effective at all was almost immediately superseded by an agreement in writing dated November to which <NAME> his three sons the appellant and <NAME> were privy or parties and under which in effect <NAME> retired from the firm and it was agreed that the business should as from January belong in stated shares to the appellant to the son to be taken in adoption by <NAME> and to the three sons of <NAME> viz <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> with a variation in interest as between these three if <NAME> proved to be the son to be taken in adoption to <NAME> as contemplated The property dealt with by this agreement in terms extends to <NAME> interest in the partnership although that interest appears to have been disposed of and differently by the agreement already set forth It is stated in this second agreement that it had become necessary in order to settle the disputes which had arisen regarding the rights of <NAME> who unlike each of his younger brothers was an adopted son and not a natural son of <NAME> <NAME> a son of <NAME> as the son whom she had adopted to her late husband The appellant disputed both the factum and the validity of such adoption further alleging that <NAME> had drawn out of the firm about twenty one lacs without the knowledge of any of the parties that he had taken forcible possession and refused inspection of the partnership books that he was making unauthorised entries therein to suit his own purposes and that he had been guilty of gross misconduct in the affairs of the partnership and towards the partners No written statements have ever en put in but it may their lordships think be fairly gathered from his plaint that the only question which the appellant at all events desired to raise in the suit were first whether the adoption of the infant defendant <NAME> had ever taken place whether it was valid if it had and who on either view were the persons interested and in what shares in the partnership which was treated as one constituted by the agreement of November and secondly whether the allegations made by the appellant against <NAME> were if established sufficient to entitle the appellant to the decree of dissolution which he sought First of all in the appellant own immediate branch of it there was apparently a serious dispute between him and <NAME> upon the question whether the appellant and <NAME> were joint or separate in estate there was another as to the rights of each brother in the ancestral or self acquired property of their father <NAME> there was a third as to the claim of <NAME> to certain company shares standing in the name of the appellant Next there was a question with <ORG> representatives in which not only the appellant but the In <NAME> branch of the family again there were further serious questions as to the validity of the second agreement of November as to the extent of his widow <NAME> property and as to the rights and interests in the property of <NAME> both of his widow and his three sons respectively And if the application made to the <ORG> had been that all proceedings in the suit should be stayed and an order in these terms had been made thereon that doubtless would have been the result It took the form of a petition presented in the suit by the appellant purporting to act with the approval of all parties and referring to the agreement of May as an agreement to refer all matters in dispute between them and it prayed in effect that the matters alluded to in the agreement should all be remitted to arbitration in accordance with its terms But whatever may have then been the desire of the parties including it may well be even Annardeyi and whatever may have been the belief of the arbitrators as to the terms of the order actually made the <ORG> had on that application no power to refer to arbitration any questions between the parties to the suit other than those in question in the suit or any questions in which was concerned anyone not a party to the suit It was an order made in pursuance of paras and of the second schedule to the Code of Civil Procedure and in the exercise of power thereby given to the <ORG> to refer to arbitration matters in difference in a suit defined by itself in the order of reference The order of May is recited as one By which all matters in dispute between the parties were referred to our arbitration provided that the arbitration is to be in terms of the said agreement dated May and that the attorney for the guardian ad littm of the infant defendant be allowed to represent him And it is clear to their lordships from the terms of the award itself and there is extrinsic evidence to the same effect that in reaching their conclusions the arbitrators took a comprehensive view of the family situation and made an award which doubtless they regarded as just on the whole and as a whole but which probably they would not in any of its parts have themselves made precisely in the same terms if the dispute thereby dealt with had alone or separately been submitted to them for adjudication the partnership business up to December that the adoption of <ORG> was valid while with special reference to the partnership business the award declares that the partnership is to be dissolved with effect from June it prescribes the shares in which the old partners are to be interested therein and with reference to that partnership declares that in case any of the partners do not agree to the prescribed conditions he shall inform the firm in writing whereupon his capital will be returned to him and his connection with the firm shall cease and his share be taken up equally by the remaining partners To the award when published Musammat Surji as guardian ad litem of <ORG> took strong exception and on July gave notice to the other parties to the suit of an application by her for an order that the award should be set aside or modified or corrected by expunging therefrom all passages relating to matters that were not in question in the suit Their lordships desire to reserve their opinion upon the question whether there may not be exceptions to that comprehensive statement They are satisfied however for the reasons they have given that the order actually made by one <ORG> and affirmed by the other was in this case the proper order to be made They will accordingly humbly advise his Majesty that this appeal therefrom should be dismissed and with costs
