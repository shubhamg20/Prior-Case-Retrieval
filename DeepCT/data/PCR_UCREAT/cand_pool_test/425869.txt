This appeal under special leave is directed against the judgment passed by <ORG> at Jabalpur disposing Criminal Reference No of submitted by the learned Sessions Judge Raipur under Section of the Criminal Procedure Code for confirmation of the sentence of death awarded by him in Session Trial No of and the Criminal Appeal No of preferred by the appellant <NAME> challenging the correctness and legality of the judgment made by <ORG> convicting him under Sections and and sentencing to death and to undergo rigorous imprisonment for years respectively Though the motive for the appellant to murder <NAME> as put forth now by the prosecution is that there was a quarrel between <NAME> and the appellant on some money matters the real motive seems to be a story of shameful intrigue as disclosed from the evidence of PW the wife of <NAME> Be that as it may it appears from the evidence that the deceased was last seen with the appellant in Bhatapara on to letters written in Bengali and Ex These letters alongwith specimen handwriting were sent to PWs and who were the Additional and Assistant Station Examiners of Questioned Documents i handwriting experts for comparison of the writings of these letters with the specimen writings of the appellant The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant assailed the judgment of <ORG> inter alia contending That the prosecution has not satisfactorily established the guilt of the appellant through cogent reliable and trustworthy evidence from which the guilt of the accused is to be drawn and the evidence available on record does not lead to any irresistible conclusion that the appellant alone and none else committed this heinous crime All the letters except Ex This <ORG> in a series of decisions has laid down the principles of law governing the exercise of powers by this <ORG> to interfere in an appeal against conviction under Article of the Constitution of India of which we shall make reference to a few the following dictum is laid down Before we consider the contentions urged for the appellants we may recall that these are appeals by special leave under Article of the Constitution The fact that the special leave has been granted should not make any difference to this practice There is no direct evidence to prove this case and the conviction is founded solely on circumstantial evidence This <ORG> in a line of decisions has consistently held that when a case rests upon circumstantial evidence such evidence must satisfy the following tests the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is sought to be drawn must be cogently and firmly established those circumstances should be of a definite tendency unerringly pointing towards guilt of the accused the circumstances taken cumulatively should from chain so complete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human probability the crime was committed by the accused and none else and the circumstantial evidence in order to sustain conviction must be complete and incapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the guilt of the accused and such evidence should not only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but should be inconsistent with his innocence Before adverting to the arguments advanced by the learned counsel we shall first of all dispose of the contention with reference to the identity of the victim These circumstances indicate that the occurrence had taken place inside the house of the deceased The letters written by <NAME> about which we have made reference in the narrative portion of this judgment also refer to the murder of <NAME> In view of the above unassailable circumstances we are fortified in our view that both the <ORG> have rightly found that the dead body was that of <NAME> and we do not see any reason to dislodge that concurrent finding At the time when the victim was murdered except the appellant and the deceased there was none in the scene house because PW had left Bhatapara with her daughter and <NAME> had followed them sometimes later There is one more clinching evidence connecting the appellant with the crime in question is the contents of the post card Exh The learned counsel for the defence advanced his argument contending that since the post card is dated the appellant should have been taken to the police custody even much earlier to and this letter was fabricated In the post card there is reference about the death of <NAME> The contents of this letter clearly show that <NAME> was murdered by the appellant on and that the appellant coming to know about the suicide of his cousin brother <NAME> had decided to surrender before the <ORG> and suffer the consequences For all the discussions made above we are of the view that there are number of impelling circumstances attending this case leading to an irresistible and inescapable conclusion that it was the appellant and the appellant alone who caused the death of the deceased <NAME> in a very ghastly manner by cutting him into pieces and throwing his various parts of body at different parts of the city Bhatapara and there cannot be any dispute that this cold blooded murder is diabolical in conception and extremely cruel in execution
