Except a few all other respondents gave their unequivocal and unconditional written consent In these appeals by special leave it was contended for the appellant <ORG> that the income of the applicants was relevant only to determine the category of the scheme in which they had to be included for eligibility to get a house under the scheme but not for enhancement of the cost of the house and monthly instalments that it had fixed the cost of the houses and the rate of instalments after taking into consideration the escalation in the price of building mate rial labour charges cost of transport and allied valuable factors which all enter into the price fixation that in price fixation the executive has a wide discretion and it is only answerable provided there is any statutory control over its policy of price fixation and that after the parties had entered into the field of ordinary contract as in the instant case the relations were no longer covered by the constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines the rights and obligations of the parties inter se Allowing the appeals HELD Where the contract entered into between the <ORG> and the persons aggrieved is non statutory and purely contractual and the rights are governed only by the terms of the contract no writ or order can be issued under Article of the Constitution of India so as to compel the authorities to remedy a breach of contract pure and simple All the same the respondents gave their written consent unconditionally accepting the changed and varied terms and conditions A The respondents after accepting the conditions imposed by the <ORG> had thus entered into the realm of a con cluded contract pure and simple with the <ORG> and hence they could only claim the right conferred upon them by the said contract and were bound by the terms of the contract unless some statute stepped in and conferred some special statutory obligations on the part of the <ORG> in the contractual field Even conceding that the <ORG> had the trappings of a <ORG> or would be comprehended in other authority for the purpose of Article of the Constitution while determining price of the houses flats constructed by it and the rate of monthly instalments to be paid the authority or its agent after entering into the field of ordinary contract had acted purely in its executive capacity governed by the Constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determined the rights and obligations of the parties inter se In this sphere they could only claim rights conferred upon them by the contract in the absence of any statutory obligations on the part of the <ORG> in the said contractual field <ORG> while exercising its jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution had therefore gone wrong in its finding that there was arbitrariness and unreasona bleness on the part of the appellants in increasing the cost of the houses flats and the rate of monthly instalments and giving directions in the writ petitions as prayed for The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These five appeals by Special Leave under Article of the Constitution of India are preferred against the Judgment and Or let dated passed by <ORG> in Civil Misc Writ Petition No is more comprehen sive and the facts alleged therein may be taken as represen tative in character the facts relating to this appeal are briefly stated With a view to casing the acute housing problem in the said District the <ORG> has undertaken construction of dwelling units for people belonging to different income groups styled as Lower Income Group Middle Income Group High Income Group and the Economically Weaker Sections hereinafter referred as <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> and EWS respectively In this appeal i Civil Appeal No the respondents to and got themselves registered for allotment of flats in <ORG> scheme and respondents and in <ORG> scheme with the <ORG> in accordance with the terms and conditions contained in the brochure issued by the <ORG> The note under the General Information Table given in the said brochure states that the cost shown therein is only estimated cost and it would increase or decrease according to the rise or fail in the price at the time of completion of the houses flats Thereafter the respondents in <ORG> group received indentical notices dated from the Secretary <ORG> second appellant intimating that the revised cost of houses flats of <ORG> group as well as the amount of monthly instalment would be as follows Similar notices were issued to all the registered allottees for all types of houses and the respondents were also intimated that in case any of the registered persons does not want to purchase the house his name would not be included in the draw but he would have his choice later on At this stage all the respondents in these appeals approached <ORG> under Article of the Constitu tion of India challenging the revised terms and conditions of the <ORG> on the ground that the petitioners were estopped from changing the conditions subject to which the respond ents applicants had applied for registration and deposited the initial payment in the year that the enhancement of cost of the house flat amounting almost double of the estimated cost as shown in the brochure while inviting the applications and the increase of the monthly instalments are much beyond the means of the respondents and that this arbitrary and unilateral stand of the petitioners is to the prejudice of the respondents The above plea was resisted by the petitioners strongly relying on certain conditions contained in the brochure especially of clauses and as per which the <ORG> has reserved its discretion to change alter or modify any of the terms and or conditions of the allotment given in the brochure that its decision would be final with regard to any matter concerning the registration and allot ment and that the <ORG> has right to relax any condition in its discretion It has been further contended that respond ents barring and have given their written acceptance to the changed conditions as mentioned in the notice dated and as such they are not entitled to the reliefs claimed in the writ petition Being aggrieved by the impugned judgment the appellants have filed these appeals by special leave after taking us through the relevant documents and the additional affidavit filed by the second respondent and the reply affidavit assailed the reasonings given by <ORG> contending that the said Court has erroneously held that the <ORG> has failed to justi fy the demand of the enhancement in the cost of houses flats as well as the increase of the monthly instalments in dis proportionate to their income because the income of the applicant was relevant only to determine the category of the scheme in which the applicant had to be included for eligi bility to get a house flat under the scheme but not for enhancement of the cost of the houses flats and monthly instalments According to him since the declared policy of the <ORG> being No Profit No Loss it had fixed the cost of the houses flats and the rate of instalments after taking into consideration of the escalation of the building materi al labour charges cost of transport and the allied valu able factors which all enter into the price fixation and as such <ORG> is not correct in going into the ques tion of computation of cost of the construction of houses flats and the plea of clerical mistakes exercising its jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution of India He further submits that <ORG> has gone wrong in importing the principle laid down in <NAME> <ORG> AIR <ORG> to the present facts and circumstances of the case in view of the fact that in price fixation the execu tive has a wide discretion and it is only answerable provid ed there is any statutory control over its policy of price fixation and it is not the function of <ORG> to sit in judgment over such matters of economic policy It has been vehemently urged that after the parties have entered into the field of ordinary contract the relations are no longer covered by the constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines the rights and obligations of the parties inter se Clauses and of the brochure issued by the <ORG> and the notes and of the General Information Table thereto read thus Clause For allotment by lottery all the above men tioned terms and rules given in the booklet would ordinarily be followed but <ORG> will have the right to change enhance or amend any of the terms and or condition as and when it thinks necessary and at its discretion It would have the right to relax any of the conditions at its discretion The last paragraph of the letter dated Annexure reads thus If you want to buy the house on the above price instalment then you must send by your written acceptance on the annexed proforma to <ORG> of this office This is not only the case of the applicants of <ORG> scheme but also of the other applicants falling under the other categories i <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> So it cannot be said that there was a mis statemennt or incorrect statement or an fraudulent concealment in the information supplied in the brochure published by the <ORG> on the strength of which all the applicants falling under the various categories applied and got their names registered More so the respondents barring respondent Nos and after having given their written consent accepting the changed and varied terms and conditions as shown in the letter dated are not justified in contending that the <ORG> has gone back on its original terms and conditions and has substituted new conditions to their detriment Thus the factual position in this case clearly and unambiguously reveals that the respondents after voluntarily accepting the conditions imposed by the <ORG> have entered into the realm of concluded contract pure and simple with the <ORG> and hence the respondents can only claim the right conferred upon them by the said contract and are bound by the terms of the contract unless some statute steps in and confers some special statutory obligations on the part of the <ORG> in the contractual field This finding in our view is not correct in the light of the facts and circumstances of this case because in <NAME> case there was no concluded contract as in this case Thereafter the relations are no longer governed by the constitutional provisions but by the legally valid contract which determines the rights and obligations of the parties inter se In this sphere they can only claim rights conferred upon them by the contract in the absence of any statutory obligations on the part of the authority i <ORG> in this case in the said contractual field In view of the authoritative judicial pronouncements of this Court in the series of cases dealing with the scope of interference of <ORG> while exercising its writ jurisdiction under Article of the Constitution of India in cases of non statutory concluded contracts like the one in hand we are constrained to hold that <ORG> in the present case has gone wrong in its finding that there is arbitrariness and unreasonableness on the part of the appel lants herein in increasing the cost of the houses flats and the rate of monthly instalments and giving directions in the writ petitions as prayed for For the reasons hereinbefore stated we set aside the judgment of <ORG> and accordingly allow all the appeals
