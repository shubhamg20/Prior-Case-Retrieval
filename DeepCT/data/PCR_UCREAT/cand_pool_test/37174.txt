Since its enactment in it has found favour with the law enforcement officials and has been enthusiastically applied wherever possible by the law enforcement agencies and the concerned <ORG> These three appeals have been filed by the appellants herein to assail the common judgment and order dated rendered by <ORG> at Bombay in Writ Petition No of whereby <ORG> dismissed the Writ Petition filed by the appellants herein The appellants herein challenged before <ORG> the constitutional validity of that part of Section of the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act MCOCA hereinafter which refers to insurgency However since the said issue was raised before this <ORG> during the course of arguments in the said case this <ORG> on a conjoint reading of the said provision with the object and purpose of the <ORG> held that there is no vagueness in the provision and the same also does not suffer from the vice of class legislation During the course of hearing Mr <NAME> the counsel appearing for one of the respondents herein tried to contend that the aforesaid provisions of Section and of the MCOCA are unconstitutional on the ground that they violate the requirement of Article of the Constitution and that they make serious inroads into the fundamental rights by treating unequals as equals and are unsustainably vague There is no vagueness as the definitions defined with clarity what it meant by continuing unlawful activity organised crime and also organised crime syndicate Thus in the said case there was no specific challenge to the constitutional validity of Section of the MCOCA We may also refer to the findings of this Court in a situation of this nature where once the constitutional validity of a provision has been upheld and the same is again challenged on a ground which is altogether different from the earlier one SCC notwithstanding the fact that <ORG> of this Court had once upheld the constitutionality of the Public Premises Eviction of Unauthorized Occupants Act the petitioner therein had renewed his challenge on the ground that the <ORG> did not have the legislative competence to legislate on the subject of the said legislation However since there was no specific challenge before this <ORG> to the constitutional validity of Section of the <ORG> and the point with reference to which the arguments were advanced in the present appeal was actually not decided in the earlier decision of this <ORG> we wish to proceed to examine the same The appellants have challenged the constitutional validity of Section of the MCOCA so far it relates to promoting insurgency on following two grounds a the Maharashtra State legislature did not have legislative competence to enact such a provision and the part of Section of the MCOCA so far as it covers case of insurgency is repugnant and has become void by enactment of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Act amending the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act The learned senior counsel appearing for the parties have advanced elaborate arguments before us on the aforesaid issues Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant in Civil Appeal No of submitted that insurgency is an offence falling within the ambit of Defence of India Entry of List I i the Union List as it threatens the unity integrity and sovereignty of India and in any event under the residuary power conferred on the <ORG> under Article read with Entry of the Union List and therefore the Maharashtra State legislature did not have legislative competence to enact the latter part of Section of the MCOCA which relates to promoting insurgency Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant in Civil Appeal No of in addition to the above noted submission submitted that Section of the <ORG> so far as it covers insurgency is repugnant and has become void by enactment of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Act amending the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act <ORG> hereinafter He submitted that insurgency and terrorism are two sides of the same coin and after the amendment the <ORG> exhaustively deals with the offence of terrorism and the meaning of the term insurgency as contained in Section of the <ORG> is very well included in the definition of terrorist act as contained in Section of the <ORG> He further submitted that due to the said anomaly an act would constitute an offence under Section of the <ORG> as also under Section of the <ORG> and that while <ORG> lays down a different procedure and envisages a different competent court to try that offence the <ORG> provides for a different procedure and different court for the trial of the same offence Thus according to him in the present case after the amendment to the <ORG> there is an implied repeal of the MCOCA so far as it covers insurgency As against this Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent State of Maharashtra submitted that the <ORG> deals with the activities of the organized gangs and the criminal syndicate and that no other law including the <ORG> deals with the said subject They further submitted that at the first blush they may appear to be similar but a closer scrutiny would dispel any such notion and would show a vast area of dissimilarity between the two They further submitted that the law is settled on the point that a given act can constitute more than one offence under two or more statutes but merely because an act also becomes an offence under a subsequent statute does not automatically result in repugnancy or implied repeal of the offence defined in the earlier statue Mr <NAME> learned ASG appearing for <ORG> respondent No herein and Mr <NAME> learned ASG appearing for the <ORG> supported the contentions made by Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> Before we proceed further to deal with and answer the issues that have been raised for our consideration we wish to make note of a minor development which took place during the pendency of the present appeal Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel has in detail taken us through the provisions of the amendment At the time of hearing the counsel appearing for both the parties have fairly agreed that the amendment did not bring about any such change which would affect the decision of this <ORG> on the issues raised and urged Article confers on a State legislature the exclusive power to enact laws for the whole or any part of the territory of the State on any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution So far as the question of legislative competence of the Maharashtra <ORG> legislature to enact a law like MCOCA is concerned <ORG> in the impugned judgment has held that MCOCA in pith and substance falls in Entry No of List III which refers to the criminal law This Court in <NAME> supra has already held that the subject matter of the <ORG> is maintaining public order and prevention by police of commission of serious offences affecting public order and thus would be within the purview of and be relatable to Entries and of List II as also to Entries and of List III of Schedule VII to the Constitution of India The question that needs to be determined in the present case is whether the said finding in <NAME> supra can be extended to the term promoting insurgency and also whether the term promoting insurgency would be within the purview and relatable to Entry of List II It has been seen that the propositions laid down in the above noted cases have been time and again followed in subsequent judgments of this Court and still govern the field Maintenance of public order within a province is primarily the concern of that province and subject to certain exceptions which involve the use of His Majesty forces in aid of civil power <ORG> is given plenary authority to legislate on all matters which relate to or are necessary for maintenance of public order It is a well established rule of interpretation that the entries in the List being fields of legislation must receive liberal construction inspired by a broad and generous spirit and not a narrow or pedantic approach If there is a challenge to the legislative competence the courts will try to ascertain the pith and substance of such enactment on a scrutiny of the Act in question The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond its competence may be an element in determining whether the legislation is colourable that is whether in the guise of making a law on a matter within it competence the legislature is in truth making a law on a subject beyond its competence This doctrine of pith and substance is applied when the legislative competence of a legislature with regard to a particular enactment is challenged with reference to the entries in the various lists i a law dealing with the subject in one list is also touching on a subject in another list On a scrutiny of the Act in question if found that the legislation is in substance one on a matter assigned to the legislature enacting that statute then that Act as a whole must be held to be valid notwithstanding any incidental trenching upon matters beyond its competence i on a matter included in the list belonging to the other legislature It is common ground that <ORG> does not have power to legislate upon any of the matters enumerated in the Union List This may result in a large number of statutes being declared unconstitutional because the legislature enacting law may appear to have legislated in a field reserved for the other legislature This principle came to be established by <ORG> when it determined appeals from Canada or Australia involving the question of legislative competence of the federation or the States in those countries This doctrine came to be established in India and derives its genesis from the approach adopted by the courts including <ORG> in dealing with controversies arising in other federations Now that we have examined under what circumstances a State Law can be said to be encroaching upon the law making powers of <ORG> we may proceed to evaluate the current issue on merits Let us once again examine the provision at the core of this matter organized crime means any continuing unlawful activity by an individual singly or jointly either as a member of an organized crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate by use of violence or threat of violence or intimidation or coercion or other unlawful means with the objective of gaining pecuniary benefits or gaining undue economic or other advantage for himself or any person or promoting insurgency After examining this provision at length we have come to the conclusion that the definition of organized crime contained in Section of the <ORG> makes it clear that the phrase promoting insurgency is used to denote a possible driving force for organized crime The illegal wealth and black money generated by the organised crime being very huge it has had serious adverse effect on our economy There was reason to believe that organised criminal gangs have been operating in the <ORG> and thus there was immediate need to curb their activities We find no merit in the contention that the <ORG> in any way deals with punishing insurgency directly This brings us to the second ground of challenge i the part of Section of the MCOCA so far as it covers case of insurgency is repugnant and has become void by the enactment of Unlawful Activities Prevention Amendment Act amending the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act As per <ORG> both the enactments can stand together as there is no conflict between the two Article of the Constitution provides that the <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the legislature of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State Subject matter of laws made by <ORG> and by the legislature of States Notwithstanding anything in clauses and <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule in this <ORG> referred to as the Union List Notwithstanding anything in clause <ORG> and subject to clause the legislature of any State also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule in this <ORG> referred to as the Concurrent List Subject to clauses and the legislature of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule in this <ORG> referred to as the State List Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List Inconsistency between laws made by <ORG> and laws made by the legislatures of States If any provision of a law made by the legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of Clause the law made by <ORG> whether passed before or after the law made by the legislature of such State or as the case may be the existing law shall prevail and the law made by the legislature of the State shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void Where a law made by the legislature of a State with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by <ORG> or an existing law with respect to that matter then the law so made by the legislature of such State shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent prevail in that State Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent <ORG> from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same matter including a law adding to amending varying or repealing the law so made by the legislature of the State Where however a law made by <ORG> on a subject covered by the Concurrent List is inconsistent with and repugnant to a previous law made by <ORG> then such a law can be protected by obtaining the assent of the President under Article of the Constitution Such a state of affairs will exist only until <ORG> may at any time make a law adding to or amending varying or repealing the law made by <ORG> under the proviso to Article That there is a clear and direct inconsistency between the Central Act and the State Act That in order to decide the question of repugnancy it must be shown that the two enactments contain inconsistent and irreconcilable provisions so that they cannot stand together or operate in the same field That where the two statutes occupy a particular field but there is room or possibility of both the statutes operating in the same field without coming into collision with each other no repugnancy results That where there is no inconsistency but a statute occupying the same field seeks to create distinct and separate offences no question of repugnancy arises and both the statutes continue to operate in the same field <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I notwithstanding anything contained in clauses and of Article The non obstante clause under Article indicates the predominance or supremacy of the law made by <ORG> in the event of an overlap of the law made by <ORG> with respect to a matter enumerated in List I and a law made by <ORG> with respect to a matter enumerated in List II of the Seventh Schedule There is no doubt that both <ORG> and <ORG> are supreme in their respective assigned fields However if the conflict is unavoidable and the two enactments are irreconcilable then by the force of the non obstante clause in clause of Article the parliamentary legislation would prevail notwithstanding the exclusive power of <ORG> to make a law with respect to a matter enumerated in the State List Thereafter this <ORG> in para held that the question of repugnancy between the parliamentary legislation and the <ORG> legislation could arise in following two ways First where the legislations though enacted with respect to matters in their allotted sphere overlap and conflict Second where the two legislations are with respect to matters in the Concurrent List and there is a conflict The <ORG>ment of Objects and Reasons of the <ORG> inter alia states that organized crime has for quite some years now come up as a very serious threat to our society and there is reason to believe that organized criminal gangs are operating in the <ORG> and thus there is immediate need to curb their activities There is reason to believe that organised criminal gangs are operating in the <ORG> and thus there is immediate need to curb their activities Clause of sub section of Section of the <ORG> defines the expression continuing unlawful activity to mean an activity prohibited by law for the time being in force which is a cognizable offence punishable with imprisonment of three years or more undertaken either singly or jointly as a member of an organised crime syndicate or on behalf of such syndicate in respect of which more than one charge sheets have been filed before a competent court within the preceding period of ten years and that court has taken cognizance of such offence The Preamble of the UAPA was also amended to state that the said Act is enacted to provide for the more effective prevention of certain unlawful activities of individuals and associations and dealing with terrorist activities and for matters connected therewith It also makes reference to the order issued by <ORG> in exercise of power under Section of <ORG> Security Council Act which is known as the Prevention Suppression of Terrorism Implementation of Security Council Resolutions Order Whereas <ORG> of <ORG> in its th meeting adopted Resolution on th September under Chapter VII of the Charter of <ORG> requiring all the States to take measures to combat international terrorism And whereas Resolutions and of <ORG> of <ORG> require the <ORG> to take action against certain terrorists and terrorist organisations to freeze the assets and other economic resources to prevent the entry into or the transit through their territory and prevent the direct or indirect supply sale or transfer of arms and ammunitions to the individuals or entities listed in the Schedule And whereas the Central Government in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the United Nations Security Council Act has made the Prevention and Suppression of Terrorism Implementation of Security Council Resolutions Order And whereas it is considered necessary to give effect to the said Resolutions and the Order and to make special provisions for the prevention of and for coping with terrorist activities and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto terrorist act has the meaning assigned to it in section and the expression terrorism and terrorist should be construed accordingly Whoever with intent to threaten the unity integrity security or sovereignty of India or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country does any act by using bombs dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances whether biological or otherwise of a hazardous nature in such a manner as to cause or likely to cause death of or injuries to any person or persons or loss of or damage to or destruction of property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community in India or in any foreign country or causes damage or destruction of any property or equipment used or intended to be used for the defence of India or in connection with any other purposes of <ORG> <ORG> or any of their agencies or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person in order to compel the Government in India or the Government of a foreign country or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act commits a terrorist act Section of the UAPA which defines the term unlawful activity reads as under unlawful activity in relation to an individual or association means any action taken by such individual or association whether by committing an act or by words either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representation or otherwise i which is intended or supports any claim to bring about on any ground whatsoever the cession of a part of the territory of India or the secession of a part of the territory of India from the Union or which incites any individual or group of individuals to bring about such cession or secession or ii which disclaims questions disrupts or is intended to disrupt the sovereignty and territorial integrity of India or iii which causes or is intended to cause disaffection against India Before we proceed to analyse the provisions of the two statutes in order to ascertain whether they are repugnant or not we may note that it is well settled that no provision or word in a statute is to be read in isolation The offence of terrorist act under Section and the offence of Unlawful activity under Section of the <ORG> have some elements in commonality Section takes in its compass even a written or spoken words or any other visible representation intended or which supports a challenge to the unity sovereignty integrity and security of India There is no clear and direct inconsistency or conflict between the said provisions of the two Acts
