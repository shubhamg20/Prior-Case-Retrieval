This is an application made to the <ORG> under Sub section of Section of the Indian Income tax Act asking the <ORG> to require the Commissioner to state a case and raise certain points of law The assessee was assessed as an individual for the year in respect of his income for the previous year He alleges that in May a son was born to him and he says that having regard to the construction of two documents the business in respect of which he was assessed was as between himself and his son a Hindu joint family business The Income tax Officer in the first instance and the Assistant Commissioner on appeal rejected the claim of the assessee as I understand it mainly on the ground that they considered these two documents illusory and that no Hindu joint family existed That no doubt is a question of fact and the only point of law Which would arise in connection with that finding would be whether there was any evidence to justify the finding Within sixty days after the decision of the Assistant Commissioner an application was made by the assessee to the Commissioner under Sub section of Section requiring him to state certain questions of law and as not infrequently happens when these applications are made by laymen the questions of law formulated had not been carefully considered and were frankly unintelligible The assessee then made an application under Sub section of Section asking us to require the Commissioner to state a case is that we have power under Sub section of Section to direct the Commissioner to state a case raising questions of law which have not been formulated before him The learned Advocate General has drawn our attention to the fact that that view has not prevailed in some of the other High <ORG>s of India and he has referred particularly to a recent decision of a full bench of the High <ORG> of Rangoon The Commissioner of Income tax Burma Chettiar Firm I Rep In that case Sir <NAME> who delivered the leading judgment expressed the view that in a reference under Section the Commissioner has to state sufficient facts to raise the specific question of law which in the view of the assessee arises that the ambit of Section is not wider than that of Section and that in a reference under Section the <ORG> has seisin only of such questions of law as have been raised before the Commissioner and upon which the Commissioner has expressed his opinion What he has to do within the required time is to require the Commissioner to refer to the High <ORG> any question of law arising out of the order or decision of the Assistant Commissioner and then the Commissioner has within sixty days to draw up a statement of the case and refer it with his own opinion thereon to the High <ORG> In the present case if the view of the Rangoon <ORG> is right we must either refuse to direct the Commissioner to raise questions of law which in our view do arise or direct the Commissioner to raise the questions which the assessee suggested and which may have meant something to him but are unintelligible to a lawyer Sir <NAME> thinks that on our interpretation of the Act the assessee may raise frivolous questions before the Commissioner in the hope that the <ORG> will discover some meritorious point of law In any case it is better that the <ORG> should occasionally be moved unnecessarily than that persons should be deprived of the right to raise proper points of law through their inability to express them correctly Turning now to the circumstances of the present case I think there are questions of law which arise and the actual form of the questions will have to be considered by the Commissioner But substantially I think the questions are first of all whether on the true construction of these two documents which are dated August and March the assessee share in the partnership firm <ORG> was an undivided Hindu family estate as between himself and his son in which the son acquired an interest at birth and if so whether there was any evidence to justify the Assistant Commissioner in coming to the conclusion that those two documents were illusory and should not be given effect to according to their terms Then if these questions were answered in the affirmative there would be a third question which is an important question of general law under the Income tax Act whether the birth of the son in May affected in any and what way the assessment to which the assessee was liable under the Income tax Act in respect of the profits of the business
