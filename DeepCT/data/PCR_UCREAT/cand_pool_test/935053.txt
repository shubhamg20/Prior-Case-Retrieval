His appeal was within limitation only if he was entitled under Section of the Limitation Act to deduct the time spent by him in obtaining a copy of the order of the court of first instance Accordingly he dismissed the appeal It has been treated by the office as a first appeal from an order but it is an application under the proviso to Section of the Provincial Insolvency Act They distinguished that case on the ground that it proceeded on a very special line of reasoning held that if Section of the Limitation Act were applied to an appeal under Section of the Insolvency Act it would within the meaning of Section of the present Limitation Act affect or alter the period of limitation prescribed for an appeal under the Insolvency Act The question has been argued very fully before us and our attention has been drawn to a large number of decisions bearing upon it For the applicant it has been contended that the Provincial Insolvency Act is not a special law within the meaning of Section of the Limitation Act and that even if it is a special law the application of Section of the Limitation Act to the appeal in this case does not within the meaning of Section of that Act affect or alter the period prescribed for an appeal under Section of the Provincial Insolvency Act So far as we are aware the expression special law has not been defined by the <ORG> except in the Penal Code and it is not permissible to use the definition in that Code as a guide to the meaning of that expression in the Limitation Act It may be that the expression was intended to cover only laws like the Rent Act of which was held by <ORG> to be a complete Code in itself but it seems more likely that the words were intended to be understood in their ordinary sense as meaning an Act dealing with a particular subject Act XIV of Section provided that when by any law then or thereafter to be in force a shorter period of limitation than that prescribed by that Act was specially prescribed for the institution of a particular suit such shorter limitation should be applied notwithstanding that Act and Section of that Act contained provisions similar to those contained in Section of the present Limitation Act Section of the Limitation Act of provided as follows When by any law not mentioned in the schedule hereto annexed and now or hereafter to be in force a period of limitation differing from that prescribed by this Act is especially prescribed for any suits appeals or applications nothing herein contained shall affect such law This was replaced in by Section of the Limitation Act of that year which provided as follows When by any special or local law now or hereafter in force in British India a period of limitation is specially prescribed for any suit appeal or application nothing herein contained shall affect or alter the period so prescribed On the strength of three of the Calcutta decisions it was held in a reference under the Madras Forest Act of I Mad There is therefore authority for the proposition that the general provisions of the Limitation Act are applicable to suits and other proceedings under other Acts which prescribe special periods of limitation but which are not intended to be complete Codes in themselves and that the words affect or alter in Section of the Limitation Act of relate only to the period prescribed and not to the way in which that period is to be computed Upon the question whether this or that Act is a complete Code in itself to which the Limitation Act should not be applied there is considerable difference of opinion It is unnecessary to express any opinion on this point but the soundness of one of the reasons given for holding that the general provisions of the Limitation Act do not apply to suits under the Registration Act namely that a suit to compel registration of a document might be delayed for many years under Section of the Limitation Act of Section of the present Act is open to question for that Section applies only to suits the period of limitation for which is prescribed by the schedule for holding that the general provisions of the Limitation Act did not apply to proceedings under the Insolvency Act There remains the question whether the Provincial Insolyency Act is a complete Code in itself In our opinion it is not order to ascertain the procedure to be followed in original appellate or revisional proceedings one has to refer to the Code of Civil Procedure There are several Acts for example the Succession Act the Probate and Administration Act and the Land Acquisition Act which make the Code of Civil Procedure applicable to proceedings under the Act and give a right of appeal to <ORG> but do not prescribe any period of limitation for the appeal It has always been assumed probably rightly that such appeals are appeals under the Code of Civil Procedure governed by what is now Article of Schedule I to the Limitation Act and by the general provisions of the Act also Sub section of Section of the Provincial Insolvency Act does not seem to have been required but whether it was required or not we do not think that it can have been inserted for the purpose of rendering the general provisions of the Limitation Act inapplicable We set aside the order of the District Judge and remit the case to him to be disposed of according to law
