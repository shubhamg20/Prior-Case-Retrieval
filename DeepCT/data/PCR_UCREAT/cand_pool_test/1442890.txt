In respect of the pilfer proof caps they were claiming exemption under notification and in respect of the other aluminium vial seals they were claiming exemption under notification The contentions of the appellants stated in short are that i The aluminium vial seals in question are not caps at all but only seals and therefore there is no question of these products being pilfer proof caps ii These seals are not known as pilfer proof caps in the trade ill Reliance of the Collector on two earlier decisions of this Tribunal is misplaced since in one of them the party was not represented and the other did not deal with a product similar to the product in question iv the classification of the product having been approved by the Assistant Collector the same cannot in law be disturbed by the Collector except by way of proceeding in review the Collector had no jurisdiction to confirm the demand under Section A of the Act as it then stood vi the confiscation of the goods was in any event not called for and vii the demand as confirmed was in any event in excess of the period prescribed in Section A of the Act As mentioned earlier there is no dispute regarding the classifiability under TI CET of the screw down caps manufactured by the appellants which they themselves have classified under TI as pilfer proof caps This argument overlooks the fact that in order that the product may be described as a pilfer proof cap it must first be a cap It is pointed out for the appellants that the assessee went unrepresented in the case of <ORG> and therefore the arguments now advanced were not put before the <ORG> and had therefore not been considered No doubt reference has been made in that judgment to the definition of pilfer proof caps in but it has been observed that in the absence of any definition of the terms pilfer proof cap in the tariff entry the entry has to be given widest meaning particularly in the context of the qualifying word all sorts The first was that the Collector had no jurisdiction to go into the matter since the Assistant Collector had already once gone into the matter and given a finding that these seals are to be classified under Tl GET and in the absence of any further or better material the Collector was not entitled to come to a different conclusion except by way of review under the provisions of Section A of the Central Excises and Salt Act as it then stood In view of the said circumstances we agree with the learned counsel that the Collector had no jurisdiction to differ from the earlier conclusion of the Assistant Collector except by way of taking proceeding for review of the earlier order under Section A Shri <NAME> further contends that so far as the demand for payment of duty is concerned the Collector had no jurisdiction under Section A to do so Therefore we are convinced that so far as demand for duty is concerned the Collector had no power in the instant case Accordingly this appeal is allowed and the order of the Collector is set aside with consequential relief if any In the above view of the matter it does not appear to be necessary in my opinion to consider the other contentions raised by <NAME> Counsel for the appellants and discussed in para and of <NAME> order and I do not propose to go into them I also agree that Rule has in any event no application to the facts of the present case I agree with brother <NAME> <NAME> Dated Member FINAL ORDER The Order bearing No dated issued by the <ORG> as disposing of this appeal had been recalled vide Misc
