Since the impugned Act imposed tax on land holdings it was within the competence of <ORG> and its validity was beyond challenge if it purports to impose on the same class of property similarly situated an incidence of taxation which leads to obvious inequality Article can have no application to such a statute even though the tax may be excessive and may ultimately lead to the loss of the assessee property Similar notices were served on the petitioner subsequently for the years and fasli In response to the said notices the petitioner filed his returns and objected to the annual value of the land calculated by the assessing authority After the petitioner received notices for the years and fasli he filed writ petition in <ORG> challenging the validity of the said notices on the ground that the material provisions of the On the nd November the petitioner filed three petitions in this Court under Art These three petitions were directed against the notices served on the petitioner for the years and fasli respectively It is common ground that after <ORG> dismissed the petitioner writ petitions he applied for and obtained a certificate from the said <ORG> to appeal to this Court but he failed to deposit the necessary security for printing charges as required by the rules of <ORG> and in consequence on the th August the certificate granted to him was cancelled That is how the two writ petitions which purported to challenge the validity of the notices served on the petitioner for the two years and fasli were held to be barred by res judicata It appears that for the relevant year a notice has been served on the petitioner under of the Act and a tax of Rs He also contends alternatively that the said Act violates the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles and and as such is void These grounds are denied by the respondents and it has been alleged by them that <ORG> was competent to pass the Act that the Act does not violate the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles and and that the rates have been fixed in accordance with the provisions of of the Act It may The pointed out that this Act itself has been subsequently repealed by section Under the Act land means land whether assessed to land revenue or not which is held or occupied for a purpose connected with agriculture horticulture animal husbandry pisciculture or poultry farming and includes uncultivated land held by a land holder as such Section provides that there shall save as hereinafter provided be charged levied and paid for each agricultural year on the annual value of each land holding a tax hereinafter called the Holding Tax at the rates specified in the Schedule Sub section empowers the State Govern ment to exempt or remit in whole or in part for such period as it may think fit and as often as it may consider necessary the holding tax chargeable under sub section in respect of any class or classes of land holdings as may be prescribed tax is leviable at a graded scale and is recoverable from the land holder subject to conditions a specified in the Schedule Section provides that for the purposes of sub section the rent payable shall be deemed to be an amount calculated at the sanctioned hereditary rates applicable to the land or lands included in the land holding and where there are no sanctioned heredi tary rates on such principles as may be prescribed provided that the State Government may where such rates were sanctioned prior to the first day of July enhance the rates by such percentage not exceeding fifty as may be specified by notification in <ORG> and different percentages may be specified for the different classes of lands and for different areas of Uttar Pradesh Section deals with notice of demand Section allows an appeal against the assessment of holding tax According to the procedure prescribed by the relevant provisions of the Land Revenue Act are made applicable to the proceedings before <ORG> under Section deals with cases of land holdings that escaped assessment and empowers the appropriate authority to rectify mistakes This procedure contemplates a notice to be given to an assessee who would be heard and gives the assessee a right to make an appeal and to move the <ORG> in revision The last Chapter deals with miscellaneous provisions to which it is unnecessary to refer excepts The first contention which has been raised by Mr <NAME> before us is that the Act is unconstitutional and void inasmuch as it is beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> and this contention raises the question about the construction of Entry in List II of the th Schedule of the Constitution This Entry relates to taxes to lands and buildings In considering the merits of this argument it is necessary to bear in mind that we are interpreting the words used in the Constitution and it is an elementary cardinal rule of interpretation that the words used in the Constitution which confer legislative power If this principle is borne in mind it is obvious that the words lands cannot be interpreted in the manner suggested by Mr <NAME> But it must be remembered that both Entries and are in List II and it would make no difference whether the State legislation imposing taxes on agricultural income is sustained by reference to Entry rather than by reference to Entry It is then argued that when the Constitution wanted to refer to agricultural land it has used the expression agricultural land as for instance We have therefore no hesitation in rejecting the argument that Entry in List II does not take in agricultural lands As we have already seen the scheme of the Act is to impose a tax on land holdings though the measure of the tax has to be determined by its annual value as is ascertained in the manner prescribed by section This argument proceeds on the assumption that imposes an obligation on <ORG> In our opinion there is no substance in this argument Section has prescribed the maximum limits of the multiple which may be adopted and it has left to the discretion of <ORG> to adopt such multiple for different districts or by reference to different classes of land as it may deem proper This contention raises the familiar problem as to whether a taxing statute is subject to the provisions of Part III of the Constitution or not and it arises in regard to a statute which has been passed for the purpose of only raising revenue The power of taxation is no doubt the sovereign right of the <ORG> as was observed by Chief Justice <NAME> in <NAME> Maryland The power of taxing the people and their property in essential to the very existence of Government and may be legitimately exercised on the objects to which it is applicable to the utmost extent to which the Government may choose to carry it Article of the Constitution provides that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law and so for deciding whether a tax has been validly levied or not it would be necessary first to enquire whether the <ORG> which passes the Act was Competent to pass it or and so its validity can be challenged on the ground that is contravenes one or the other of the fundamental rights guaranteed by part Ill is not a right conferred by Part III of the Consti tution it could not be enforced under Art Therefore it must now be taken to be settled that the validity of a tax law can be challenged on the ground that it infringes one or the other of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III and so the argument that the tax with which we are concerned is invalid because it offends against Arts if it purports to impose on the same class of property similarly situated an incidence of taxation which leads to obvious inequality There is no doubt that it is for the <ORG> to decide on what objects to levy what rate of tax and it is not for the <ORG> to consider whether some other objects should have been taxed or whether a different rate should have been prescribed for the tax Similarly if a taxing statute makes no specific provision about the machinery to recover tax and the procedure to make the assessment of the tax and leaves it entirely to the executive to devise such machinery as it thinks fit and to prescribe such procedure as appears to it to be fair an occasion Therefore whenever the validity of a taxing statute is challenged on the ground that it contravenes Art is different when the challenge is made on the ground that the Act is inconsistent with Art is that no person can be deprived of his property save by authority of law and as we have just observed the authority of law postulated by Art If the law is not valid because it offends against Art or some other fundamental right guaranteed by Part III then the imposition of tax levied by it cannot be said meet the requirements of Art It may be that the imposition of the tax levied by the statute is excessive and may ultimately lead to the loss of the assessee property but even so it cannot be said that by virtue of the Act the property has been acquired or requisitioned i specifically provides that nothing in Cl shall affect the provisions of any law which the <ORG> may hereafter make for the purpose of imposing or levying any tax or penalty cannot be invoked in impeaching the validity of a taxing statute and so we come back to the position that a taxing law which does not offend against any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part would justify the imposition of a tax and would meet the requirements of Art Section prescribes the maximum limit of this multiple and leaves it to the discretion of <ORG> to adjust the multiple as local conditions and conditions of land may require We must accordingly hold that the challenge to the validity of on the ground that it contravenes Articles and must fail cannot be invoked in challenging the validity of a taxing statute on the ground that the tax levied is unreasonably high and we have also noticed that if the taxing statute does not contravene any other fundamental right guaranteed by part III it would normally be treated as a valid law by whose authority tax can be collected without infringing Art It would thus be noticed that the main sections of the Act were found to be discriminatory and were also found to have imposed unreasonable restrictions on the citizens right to hold property There is no doubt that the decision in the case of <NAME> is not an authority for the proposition that in testing the validity of a taxing statute the <ORG> can embark upon The allegations thus made by the petitioner have been denied by the respondents in their counter affidavit According to the counteraffidavit cost of cultivation would not exceed and that amounts to about Rs He holds the lands as <NAME> and the respondents contend that the rent recovered from <NAME>s is very low Besides as we have already seen the scheme of the present Act does not disclose any constitutional infirmity either in its charging sections or in the sections providing for the procedure for the levy of the tax and its recovery That is why we feel no hesitation in holding that there is no substance in the plea that the Act is a colorable piece of legislation
