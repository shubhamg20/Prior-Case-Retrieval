The evidence against them mainly consisted of six witnesses who had identified them at test parades There was also unexplained error as to the date on which appellant was admitted into the jail The purpose of identification parades which belong to the investigation stage is to enable the witnesses to identify persons concerned in the offence who are not previously known to them and thereby to satisfy the investigating officers of their bona fides by pointing out the persons they recognise as having taken part in the crime Generally the Magistrates must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence The persons required to identify an accused should have had no opportunity of seeing him after the commission of crime and before identification and secondly that they should make no mistakes or the mistakes made are negligible The statements of the three witnesses were also otherwise unimpressive and coupled with the fact that there was a possibility of their having seen at least one of the accused appellant outside jail gates a week before the identification parades were held the test identification parades could not be considered to provide safe and trustworthy evidence on which the appellants conviction could be sustained <NAME> at whose instance that prosecution was initiated presented a revision petition in <ORG> against the order of the Assistant Sessions Judge challenging the benefit given to <NAME> under the First Offenders Probation Act Two of them caught hold of <NAME> and <NAME> one of them sat on the cot of <NAME> and pressed his legs and the fourth who was carrying a red jhola in his hand took out a pistol from the jhola and fired at <NAME> from point blank range He found one discharged cartridge and two wads at the place of the occurrence He recorded the statements of some witnesses including <NAME> on the following day His statement as left some doubts in the minds of the Judges of <ORG> to clear which it was considered necessary to examine him again in <ORG> The court took into consideration the identification parade for <NAME> held by Magistrate <NAME> on October and that for <NAME> on October <NAME> stated in the additional evidence that he had made entry at sl Holding that there was no opportunity for those witnesses to see the appellants before their identifications the court confirmed their conviction and sentence as already observed It was also urged that according to the prosecution evidence four unidentified persons having participated in the unfortunate murder of <NAME> there is no reliable evidence showing that any one of the present appellants actually fired the fatal shot My brother jumped and fell down the cot and he fired another shot at my brother who had fallen down which hit <NAME> at his chest as a result whereof he died Generally speaking the Magistrate must make a note of every objection raised by an accused at the time of identification and the steps taken by them to ensure fairness to the accused so that the court which is to judge the value of the identification evidence may take them into consideration in the appreciation of that evidence The power to identify it may be kept in view varies according to the power of observation and memory of the person identifying and each case depends on its own facts but there are two factors which seems to be of basic importance in the evaluation of identification The persons required to identify an accused should have bad no opportunity of seeing him after the commission of the crime and before identification and secondly that no mistakes are made by them or the mistakes made are negligible Ka we find a note that <NAME> had stated that he had been shown to the witnesses and had also been photographed As against the other five witnesses namely <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> we only find the word Do In this connection the note at the foot of the printed form containing the following direction seems to us to be of some importance It is very useful to note whether the witness knew the name of the person he had come to identify or he only described him in some such way as the man who was standing at the door at the time of the dacoity Ka we find the word Do This takes us to the evidence of the identifying witnesses <NAME> was sitting on a cot and <NAME> and the witness were sitting on a heap of fodder nearby in the Duari because that was the only place affording shelter against rain On two occasions he identified the accused persons in separate parades but did not identify anyone on his third visit Two assailants held these two witnesses and one sat on the cot of the deceased and pressed the legs of the deceased with his own legs and the fourth one fired two shots having re loaded the pistol after the first shot I heard an alarm from the eastern side in which direction lay the <NAME> of <NAME> He had a <NAME> in his right had and a jhola in his left hand In the first identification he identified the person who had a jhola in his hand and at the second identification he recognised the other <NAME> of the Constitution this Court does not interfere with the conclusions of facts arrived at on appreciation of evidence and in this case on consideration of the evidence relating to the test identification parades two courts below have come to a positive conclusion that the appellants were two out of the four unknown assailants of <NAME> deceased In regard to the sentence the counsel con tended that this is a matter which rests in the discretion of the trial court and when the sentence of death is confirmed by <ORG> this Court should not interfere on appeal under Art except where there is legal error or some disregard of the forms of legal process or a violation of the principles of natural justice resulting Sup this <ORG> after examining its previous decisions in which this <ORG> had not accepted concurrent findings or had re examined the evidence for itself said The above cases show that this <ORG> has not accepted concurrent findings of fact if there is no evidence for the finding or if there has been an omission to notice material points while appreciating evidence or to bear in mind relevant considerations which swing the balance in favour of the accused It has also on occasions reexamined the evidence in view of the fact that the case against the accused was based on circumstantial evidence and it was of an extraordinary nature In view of this infirmity in the judgment and other considerations which will be pointed out later we are satisfied that this is one of the exceptional cases in which we should undertake the examination of the entire evidence and appraise it But the case against the appellant is entirely based on circumstantial evidence and there is no direct evidence that he administered a poison and no poison has in fact been detected by the doctor who performed the postmortem examination or by the Chemical Analyser But what weight should be attached to the evidence of the witnesses was essentially a matter with which the <ORG> of first instance before whom the witnesses were examined was concerned and if the view taken by that <ORG> is confirmed by <ORG> even assuming that this <ORG> may if the case were tried before it have taken a different view though we do not say that in this case we would have so done we would not be justified in making a departure from the settled practice of this <ORG> and proceed to review the evidence In Brahmin <NAME> <ORG> Court stated the position thus We have dealt with the arguments of Mr <NAME> at some length but we wish to restate that this Court will not examine for itself evidence led in a criminal case unless it is made to appear that justice has failed by reason of some misapprehension or mistake in the reading of the evidence by <ORG> There must ordinarily be a substantial error of law or procedure or a gross failure of justice by reason of misapprhension or mistake in reading the evidence or the appeal must involve a question of principle of general importance before this <ORG> will allow the oral evidence to be discussed
