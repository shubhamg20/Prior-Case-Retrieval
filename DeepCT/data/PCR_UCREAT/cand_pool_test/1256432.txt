He committed criminal breach of trust in respect of Rs On the basis of the information collected he submitted a report Subsequently obtained permission of a Magistrate st Class to investigate into the case as required by A of the Prevention of Corruption Act These acts constituted an investigation within the meaning of the definition of investigation under of the Code of Criminal Procedure and as such there was a contravention of A of the Prevention of Corruption Act Subsequently rectified the earlier defect by obtaining the permission of the Magistrate st Class to investigate into the offence alleged to have been committed by the accused and in effect there was practically de novo investigation in strict compliance with the provision of Code of Criminal Procedure Mudholkar In fact there was no defect <NAME> appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> at Allahabad Lucknow Bench Lucknow setting aside that of the Special Judge West Lucknow who convicted the accused respondent and sentenced him to one year rigorous imprisonment Under of the Prevention of Corruption Act No The accused admitted before him that he had realized the amounts as alleged by the prosecution but pleaded that he had no dishonest intention and that the deficit found was due to inadvertance and oversight The Special Judge considered the entire evidence and found that the evidence adduced by the prosecution established that the accused misappropriated the amounts received by him as a public servant It was contended before him that the investigation of the case has been made by SubInspector <NAME> who under the law was not entitled to investigate the case as he was below the rank of Deputy Superintendent and hence the trial was vitiated The learned Special Judge held that the said Sub Inspector did not conduct any investigation before he obtained the requisite permission from the appropriate authority and that even if he did it had not been established that the accused was prejudiced by such an enquiry On appeal by the accused <ORG> set aside the conviction mainly on the ground that the SubInspector <NAME> made Investigation before he obtained the permission of the Additional District Magistrate Judicial Lucknow to investigate the case and as the said investigation was in violation of the provisions of the Act the accused must be held to have been seriously prejudiced by the said contravention of the Act The State has preferred the present appeal against the said judgment of <ORG> The only question that was argued before us is whether <ORG> was right in acquitting the accused on the ground that the investigation made by Sub Inspector <NAME> before he obtained the permission of the Magistrate vitiated the entire trial Learned counsel for the <ORG> contended that the said Sub Inspector only made a preliminary enquiry to ascertain the truth of the information received by him and thereafter after obtaining the requisite permission of the Magistrate he made an investigation of the offence and therefore there was neither illegality nor irregularity in the matter of investigation In any view the argument proceeded <ORG> went wrong in setting aside the conviction based on evidence without considering and coming to a conclusion whether the said irregularity if any had prejudiced the accused On April <NAME> the Railway Sectional Officer <ORG> Lucknow sent report to <NAME> <ORG> stating that he had received information through a source that the accused was in the habit of misappropriating Government money giving instances of the acts of misappropriations committed by him and informing him that if a proper investigation was made many more cases of misappropriation would come to light After he submitted the report on October the said Sub Inspector applied to the Additional District Magistrate Judicial Lucknow for permission to investigate the case The first question is whether the enquiry made by him before he obtained the permission of the Magistrate was investigation within the meaning of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure Section of the Code prescribes the mode of recording the information received orally or in writing by an officer incharge of a police station in respect of the commission of a cognizable offence Section thereof authorizes such an officer to investigate any cognizable offence prescribed therein Section which prescribes the procedure in the matter of such an investigation can be initiated either on information or otherwise It is clear from the said provisions that an officer incharge of a police station can start investigation either on information or otherwise XIV of the Code of Criminal Procedure thus Thus under the Code investigation consists generally of the following steps Proceeding to the spot Ascertainment of the facts and circumstances of the case Discovery and arrest of the suspected offender Collection of evidence relating to the commission of the offence which may consist of a examination of various persons including the accused and the reduction of their statements into writing if the officer thinks fit the search of places of seizure of things considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced at the trial and Formation of the opinion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the accused before a agistrate for trial and if so taking the necessary steps for the same by filing of a charge sheet under section Did <NAME> the Sub Inspector make such an investigation before he obtained the permission of the Magistrate under A of the Act Ex shows that <NAME> the Railway Sectional Officer received through a source information that the accused was in the habit of misappropriating Government money by not accounting for the saleproceeds of blank paper and other tickets it also indicates that the information received by the said officer was not vague but contained precise particulars of the acts of misappropriation committed by the accused On the basis of the information collected he submitted a report The decisions cited by the learned counsel for the <ORG> in support of his contention that there was no investigation in the present case are rather wide off the mark <ORG> described the following three stages a policeman has to pass in a conspiracy case hears something of interest affecting the public security and which puts him on the alert makes discreet enquiries takes soundings and sets up informants and is in the second stage of qui vive or lookout and finally gathers sufficient information enabling him to bite upon something definite and that is the stage when first information is recorded and when investigation starts These and such other decisions were given in the context of the question whether an information given was the First Information within the meaning of of the Code they are not of much relevance in considering the question whether in a particular case a police officer has made an investigation of a cognizable offence within the meaning of of the Code that would depend upon the nature of the information received by the police officer and the steps taken by him for I Kerala Section A of the Act reads Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure no police officer below the rank elsewhere of a deputy superintendent of police shall investigate any offence punishable under section section or section A of the Indian Penal Code or Under sub section of section of this Act without the order of a presidency magistrate or a magistrate of the first class as the case may be or make any arrest therefore without a warrant It is manifest from the section that an officer below the rank of a Deputy Superintendent of Police cannot investigate an offence punishable under the provisions of the Act without the order of a Magistrate First Class This Court further observed therein that the said statutory safeguards must be strictly complied with for they were conceived in public interest and were provided as a guarantee against frivolous and vexatious prosecution The reason for the rule was given thus at While in the case of an officer of assured status and rank the legislature was prepared to believe him implicitly it prescribed an additional guarantee in the case of police officers below that rank namely the previous order of a presidency magistrate or a magistrate of the first class The magistrate status gives assurance to the bona fide of the investigation Judicial Lucknow for permission to investigate the offence The Magistrate on October on the basis of the said facts gave the necessary permission to the Sub Inspector to investigate the offence In short after taking the permission of the Magistrate he started practically a fresh investigation in strict compliance with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure The prosecution examined witnesses and filed exhibits The learned Special Judge on a careful consideration of the entire evidence came to the conclusion that the prosecution had brought home the guilt of the accused The argument of the learned counsel for the respondent may be elaborated thus Whenever there is a consistent disregard of the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure in the matter of investigation it must be held almost in all cases that it has prejudiced the accused in the matter of trial for otherwise it would enable a police officer below the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police to make an investigation free from the statutory safeguards designed to prevent the abuse of police powers to secure the necessary information and thereafter to take the requisite permission of the Magistrate and then to shape his investigation to achieve the desired result or to implement his scheme We cannot therefore hold that the accused has been prejudiced by the illegality committed by the police in the first stage of the investigation <ORG> st aside the conviction on the ground that there was a breach of the mandatory safe guards of the Act in that the first stage of the investigation was contrary to the provisions of the Act We therefore set aside the order of <ORG> and convict the respondent under of the Act and sentence him to one year rigorous imprisonment I however find it difficult to agree with his conclusion that there was in fact a defect or irregularity in the investigation in this case I will therefore set out only those facts which have a bearing upon this point Upon receiving a report from the Railway Sectional Officer <ORG> Lucknow stating that he had received information through an undisclosed source that the respondent is in the habit of misappropriating Government money the Superintendent of police <ORG> directed Sub Inspector <NAME> to verify the truth of the allegations made against the respondent It was thereafter that he obtained the permission of the Additional District Magistrate judicial Lucknow to investigate into the case as required by A of the Prevention of Corruption Act and then proceeded to investigate the ease accused and the reduction of the their statements into writing if the officer thinks fit the search of places of seizure of things considered necessary for the investigation and to be produced at the trial and formation of the opinion as to whether on the material collected there is a case to place the accused before a Magistrate for trial and if so taking the necessary steps for the same by the filling of a charge sheet under section In the absence of any prohibition the Code express or implied I am of opinion that it is open to a Police Officer to make preliminary enquiries before registering an offence and making a full scale investigation into it Since no irregularity was committed by him there is no occasion to invoke the aid of the curative provisions of the Code
