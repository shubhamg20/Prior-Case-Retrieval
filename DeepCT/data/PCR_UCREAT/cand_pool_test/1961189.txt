PETITIONER <ORG> Vs RESPONDENT THE COLLECTOR OF CUSTOMS OTHERS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> BOSE VIVIAN <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> CITATION AIR SCR ACT Smuggled Goods Violation of Provisions of Sea <ORG> Act and Foreign Exchange Regulation Act Power of Collector of <ORG> to take action under Sea <ORG> Act Confiscation Fine in lieu of confiscation Order of confiscation coupled with conditions for release of the smuggled goods Legality of the order Sea <ORG> Act ss Foyeign Exchange Regulation Act Of ss The Collector of <ORG> after hearing the parties came to the conclusion that the gold in question was smuggled gold and that there was a contravention of the provisions of of the Sea <ORG> Act read with of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and made an order in these terms I accordingly order that the entire quantity of the gold seized on the st November amounting to tolas be confiscated under section of the Sea <ORG> Act The appellant challenged the validity of the order and contended i that on a proper construction of of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act read with of the Sea <ORG> Act it was not legally open to the customs authorities to take any action against it under the Sea <ORG> Act as such action would prejudice the provisions of of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act and that in any case the conditions which the Collector of <ORG> had imposed in the impugned order for release of the confiscated gold were not warranted by the statute and that as the order was a composite and integrated one it was not severable and therefore should be quashed Held that the scope of of the Sea <ORG> Act is different from that of Of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act There is a difference between the expression any person concerned in any such offence occurring in the third column of of the Sea <ORG> Act and the expression whoever contravenes any of the provisions of this Act occurring in of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act The question whether two remedies are available to the authorities concerned in respect of a contravention which comes both under the Sea <ORG> Act and the Foreign Exchange Act was left open The Collector of <ORG> had no jurisdiction to impose the two conditions for the release of the confiscated gold but as the aforesaid conditions are severable from the rest of the impugned order the latter is valid as to the confiscation of the gold and the payment of fine in lieu thereof Appeal from the judgment and decree dated July of <ORG> in Appeal from Original Order No of arising out of the judgment and decree dated August of the said <ORG> in Matter No of The Judgment of the <ORG> was delivered by <NAME> appeal has come to us on a certificate granted by <ORG> at Calcutta that the case is a fit one for appeal to this <ORG> The appellant is <ORG> a private limited company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act and carrying on business at Manohar Das Street Calcutta Respondents I and are the <ORG> authorities concerned respondent is <ORG> and respondents and are two banks called respectively <ORG> a foreign company carrying On business at Royal Exchange Place Calcutta and <ORG> a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act and having its registered office at Cotton Street Calcutta Oil November the appellant <ORG> received a letter signed by one <NAME> of the <ORG> Department requesting the presence of the appellant at the <ORG> House on November for opening and checking the bags of bullion which had been seized from the <ORG> On December the appellant <ORG> made an application in <ORG> under Art of the Constitution in which it asked for the issue of appropriate writs or orders quashing the orders of seizure and detention of its gold and books of account and for a further direction that the <ORG> authorities be prohibited from giving effect to the said orders of detention and seizure or from taking any steps in connection with the gold or the books of account seized This writ application was heard and disposed of by an order made by <NAME> of <ORG> on April the result of which was that the rule was made absolute to this extent only that the seizure of the books of account was declared to be illegal and a direction was made that the books be returned forthwith to the appellant <ORG> You are requested to show cause in writing within fourteen days from date hereof why penal action should not be taken against you and the tolas of gold in question under the provisions of sections clause and of the Sea Customs Act for alleged violation of section of the same Act read with section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act This notice was issued on the strength of an information contained in a note which the Superintendent Preventive Service of the <ORG> authorities submitted and which said that the gold in question had been smuggled into India in violation of the provisions of the Sea <ORG> Act hereinafter referred to as the Sea <ORG> Act and the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act hereinafter referred to as the Foreign Exchange Act and that the gold had been sent to the <ORG> for processing that is for melting and casting the same into bars weighing and stamping the same with the <ORG> Marks and also assaying small portions thereof On May <NAME> passed the order impugned in this case in which he came to the conclusion that the gold in question tolas was smuggled gold and that there was a contravention of the provisions of of the Sea Customs Act read with of the Foreign Exchange Act The learned Judge held that by purporting to proceed under of the Sea <ORG> Act in the present case the <ORG> authorities had acted in prejudice to the provisions of of the Foreign Exchange Act and this was in violation of of the Foreign Exchange Act as it stood at the relevant time He said If the petitioners had not been implicated in the charge it might have been open to the <ORG> authorities to proceed under section if steps were intended to be taken only against the offending goods but the notice to show cause makes it clear that that is not the case Although I am not prepared to go to the length of holding that section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act altogether excludes the operation of section of the Sea <ORG> Act and although I have no doubt that in appropriate cases where section is not attracted recourse can be had to section of the Sea <ORG> Act the present case is one in which adoption of the procedure under section of the Sea <ORG> Act has prejudiced section of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act On these findings the rule was made absolute the impugned order was quashed and respondents I to were directed to forbear from giving effect to the order Then there was an appeal which was heard by a Division Bench consisting of <NAME> and <NAME> That Bench held that the proceeding under the Sea Customs Act was in the nature of a proceeding in rem and an order of confiscation or penalty passed in such a proceeding was not a quasi judicial act but an administrative or executive act in respect of which no application for the issue of a writ of certiorari under Art On a construction of of the Foreign Exchange Act as it stood at the relevant time it held that the restrictions mentioned therein had a double effect and the remedies available under of the Sea Customs Act and under of the Foreign Exchange Act were cumulative in nature There is thus no question of the former proceeding prejudicing the latter proceeding With regard to the conditions imposed in the impugned order for the release of the confiscated gold it held that the invalidity if any of the imposition of such conditions did not affect the main order of confiscation It said Section casts an imerative duty on the officer adjudging confiscation to give the owner of the goods an option to party such a fine as the officer thinks fit in lieu of confiscation There are two preliminary points which we may conveniently dispose of here before we go on to the main contentions urged on behalf of the appellant Company The learned <NAME> who has appeared before us on behalf of respondents I to has not accepted as correct the view that Art of the Constitution we do not think that it is necessary in the present case to decide the question mooted by the learned Chief Justice in his order dated December and we prefer not to express any opinion thereon Now we proceed to a consideration of the two main points urged on behalf of the appellant Company It has been argued before us that on a proper construction of of the Foreign Exchange Act as it stood at the relevant time read with of the Sea Customs Act it was not legally open to the customs authorities in the present case to take any action against the appellant Company under the Sea Customs Act as such action prejudiced the provisions of of the Foreign Exchange Act Sub sections and of of the Foreign Exchange Act impose restrictions on import and export of currency and bullion any gold bullion etc sub section was at the relevant time in these terms The restrictions imposed by subsections and shall be deemed to have been imposed under section of the Sea Customs Act without prejudice to the provisions of section of this Act and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly VIII of and a new section namely A was introduced which provided inter alia that the restrictions imposed by sub ss and of shall be deemed to have been imposed under of the Sea Customs Act and all the provisions of that Act shall have effect accordingly except that thereof shall have effect as if for the word shall therein the word may were substituted At the time relevant for the purpose of the present case sub of was in full force and effect and the question under our consideration has to be decided with reference to that sub section Whoever contravenes any of the provisions of this Act or of any rule direction or order made thereunder shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both and any <ORG> trying any such contravention may if it thinks fit and in addition to any sentence which it may impose for such contravention direct that any currency security gold or silver or goods or other property in respect of which the contravention has taken place shall be confiscated No Court shall take cognisaince of any offence punishable under this section except upon a complaint in writing made by a person authorised in this behalf by <ORG> or <ORG> by a general or special order Provided that where any such offence is the contravention of any of the provisions of this Act or any rule direction or order made thereunder which prohibits the doing of an act without permission no such complaint shall be made unless the person accused of the offence has been given an opportunity of showing that he had such permission If the person committing an offence punishable under this section is a company or other body corporate every director manager secretary or other officer thereof shall unless he proves that the offence was committed without his knowledge or that he exercised all due diligence to prevent its commission be deemed to be guilty of such offence Section occurs in Chapter XVI of the Sea Customs Act and in so far as it is relevant for our purpose it states The offences mentioned in the first column of the following schedule shall be punishable to the extent mentioned in the third column of the same with reference to such offences respectively Section of Offences which offence has reference Section of the Sea <ORG> Act states that whenever anything is confiscated under such thing shall thereupon vest in Government and the officer adjudging confiscation shall take and hold possession of the thing confiscated and every officer of police on the requisition of such officer shall assist in taking and holding such possession Now the argument urged on behalf of the appellant arising as it does out of of the Foreign Exchange Act and of the Sea <ORG> Act is this Under sub of a restriction imposed by a notification made under sub of the section shall be deemed to have been imposed under of the Sea <ORG> Act and all the provisions of the Sea <ORG> Act shall have effect accordingly but the argument is that this deeming provision is subject to an important qualification contained in the words without prejudice to the provisions of of this Act meaning thereby the Foreign Exchange Act It is further pointed out that there is power under itself to confiscate the goods in respect of which the contravention has taken place On behalf of respondents I to however it is contended that the clause without prejudice to the provisions of does not mean subject to the provisions of and its true effect is merely this when there is contravention of the restrictions imposed by sub and of which restrictions are deemed to have been imposed under of the Sea Customs Act the contravention may have a double effect it involves a violation of the provisions of the Sea Customs Act and may at the same time involve a violation of the provisions of the ForeignExchange Act and if the offender is known two remedies may be available to the authoritiesconcerned one remedy is to proceed under the relevant provisions of the Sea Customs Act and the other under the relevant provisions of the Foreign Exchange Act On a careful consideration of these rival contentions we have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary on the facts of the present case to decide the larger question as to whether two remedies are available to the authorities concerned in respect of a contravention which comes both under the Sea Customs Act and the Foreign Exchange Act and if so to what extent the two remedies are concurrent cumulative or otherwise and shall be deemed to have been imposed under of the Sea Customs Act secondly it states that the aforesaid deeming provision shall be without prejudice to the provisions of of the Foreign Exchange Act and thirdly it states that all the provisions of the Sea Customs Act shall have effect accordingly The construction put forward on behalf of the appellant Company is that where of the Foreign Exchange Act is applicable any other remedy under the Sea Customs Act is barred because that is the effect of the second part of the sub section which says that the deeming provision shall be without prejudice to the provisions of and the concluding part of the sub section which says that all the provisions of the Sea Customs Act shall have effect accordingly is controlled by the second part as is indicated by the use of the word accordingly therein Section of the Sea Customs Act contemplates a case of this nature when it describes the offence in col in the following words If any goods the importation or exportation of which is prohibited or restricted be imported into or exported from India contrary to such prohibition or restriction There is a further provision in the penalty column that any person concerned in any such offence shall be liable to a penalty not exceeding three times the value of the goods etc The notice asked the appellant to show cause why penal action should not be taken against it and the gold under the provisions of for alleged violation of Sea Customs Act and Foreign Exchange Act Taking the view most favourable to the appellant it may be said that the notice contemplated both kinds of proceedings namely one in rem and the other in personam and asked the appellant to show cause against the imposition of both penalties mentioned in the third column of but the notice did not show any intention nor did it suggest even a pos sibility of proceeding against the appellant under of the Foreign Exchange Act There is we think an appreciable difference between the expression any person concerned in any such offence occurring in the third column of of the Sea Customs Act and the expression whoever contravenes any of the provisions of this Act occurring in of the Foreign Exchange Act Moreover in the case under our consideration the only penalty imposed under was the confiscation of the gold which indicates that the authorities proceeded with the proceeding in rem and dropped the proceeding in personam therefore no question of prejudicing the provisions of Foreign Exchange Act arose in this case These are interesting and may be important questions and we have no doubt that they will be decided when they really fall for decision in an appropriate case This brings us to the second main contention urged on behalf of the appellant It has been fairly concened by the learned Solicitor General that there is no provision in the Foreign Exchange Act or the Sea <ORG> Act under which <ORG> could give permission in respect of smuggled gold with retrospective effect if it could there would be no offence under and the order of confiscation itself would be bad The facts of the Bombay case were entirely different it was found there that the goods which were toilet and perfumery goods had been smuggled through the port of Kantiajal near Surat without payment of any duty and in those circumstances it was held that applied In the case before us there is no finding by what means the gold was smuggled by sea or landand it is difficult to see how which relates to goods not cleared or warehoused within four months after entry of vessel can be of any help in the present Case What then is the result On behalf of the appellant it has been argued that the order being a composite and integrated order it is not severable and secondly it is contended that on an application for a writ of certiorari the superior Court must quash the whole order when it is found to be bad and in excess of jurisdiction even as to a part thereof The question of severability does not present any great difficulty Applying those principles we find no difficulty in holding that the invalid conditions imposed by the Collector are not so inextricably mixed up that they cannot be separated from the valid order of confiscation and fine in lieu thereof there is also no doubt that the Collector would have passed the order of confiscation and fine in lieu thereof on his finding No such consideration arises in the case before us There is no legal difficulty in enforcing the rest of the impugned order after separating the invalid conditions therefrom on the passing of the order of confiscation the gold vests in <ORG> and does not make it obligatory on the Collector to fix a time limit for payment of the fine in lieu of confiscation Learned counsel has relied on the decision in The King Willesden Justices Ex parte Utley for his contention that <ORG> has no power on certiorari to amend the impugned order by striking out the invalid conditions nor has this <ORG> on an appeal from an order on an application for the issue of a writ of certiorari any power higher than that of <ORG> He has contended that the essence of the remedy of certiorari is that it necessarily involves revising the decision of the inferior court to which it is It demolishes the order which it considers to be without jurisdiction or palpably erroneous but does not substitute its own views for those of the inferior <ORG> We can make an order or issue a writ in the nature of certiorari in all appropriate cases and in appropriate manner so long as we keep Cridland but having considered them all my opinion remains as it was at the outset that if a sentence be imposed which is not authorised by law for the offence for which the defendant is convicted that makes the conviction bad on its face and being a bad conviction it can be brought up here to be quashed and when so brought up must be quashed for this court has no power and never has had any power on certiorari to amend the conviction It is worthy of note that the decision proceeded on the footing that the man had a penalty imposed upon him which the law did not permit him to suffer and that made the conviction bad and the conviction being bad the applicant was entitled to his order of certiorari But we think that there is a more convincing answer to the contention urged on behalf of the appellant The appellant did not confine itself to asking for a writ of certiorari only but asked for a mandamus requiring respondents I to to forbear from giving effect to the orders of seizure detention and confiscation of the gold and further requiring them to return the gold and also asked for a writ of prohibition restraining respondents to from taking further steps in pursuance of the order of confiscation Therefore we do not see any insuperable difficulty in the present case in prohibiting respondents I to from enforcing the two invalid conditions which the Collector of Customs had imposed for release of the gold on payment of the fine in lieu of confiscation and the time limit of four months fixed by the Collector must accordingly run from the date of this order The only other points that require consideration are the points urged on behalf of the two banks respondents and Our attention has been drawn to A of the Sea <ORG> Act which enables <ORG> to make regulations either general or special respecting the detention and confiscation of goods the importation of which is prohibited and the conditions if any to be fulfilled before such detention and confiscation and also to subsection thereof under which the Chief <ORG> Officer may require the regulations to be complied with and may satisfy himself in accordance with those regulations that the goods are such as are prohibited to be imported It is pointed out that no regulations have yet been made and in the absence of any regulations the <ORG> officers have an uncontrolled and unguided power in the matter of detention and confiscation of goods So far as <ORG> respondent is concerned it has no right under Art Apart altogether from the considerations which the learned Solicitor General has pressed as to which it is un necessary for us to express any final opinion namely that a pledgee cannot have a right higher than that of the pleader ii that the pledgor does not cease to be the owner by reason of the pledge and iii that in an action in rem the order operators directly upon the status of the property and as in this case vests the property absolutely in Government there are certain other circumstances which militate against the claim now put forward by respondent The Collector passed his order oil May and a copy was forwarded to respondent The firm representative gave reasons for this difference which was mainly that instructions were given to <ORG> on the th November to send gold weighing tolas to <NAME> of Bombay but the actual delivery of this gold to this person at Bombay did not take place until the nd November that Article had no application The Collector of <ORG> had jurisdiction to make that order on his finding that the gold was smuggled gold He however had no jurisdiction to impose the other two conditions which he imposed for the release of the gold We think that the appropriate order to pass in this case is to dismiss the writ application in so far as it seeks to quash the impugned order of confiscation of the gold and the payment of fine in lieu thereof and to allow it in so far as it wants a direction restraining respondents to from enforcing the two invalid conditions imposed by the Collector of <ORG> which the Collector had no jurisdiction to impose The appeal is accordingly allowed to the very limited extent indicated above but dismissed as to the rest and in the circumstances of this case particularly in view of the invalid conditions imposed by the Collector we direct that the parties must bear their own costs of the hearing in this Court Appeal allowed in part
