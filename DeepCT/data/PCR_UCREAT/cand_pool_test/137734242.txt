These appeals by special leave arise from the orders of <ORG> Jabalpur Bench made on August in OA Nos and According to the appellants there were no clear vacancies as on April Proposal for filling up the ensuing vacancies from <ORG> was sent to the <ORG> on December Consequently the <ORG> met on March for selection of Officers to fill up the four vacancies On this factual matrix it is contended for the appellants that the crucial date for the <ORG> meeting for selection should be April or May for selection of candidates to fill up the vacancies of the year As per the procedure preparation of the panel of candidates for consideration by the <ORG> to fill up the clear vacancies as on April is necessary Though prima facie we are impressed with the arguments of <NAME> on deeper probe and on going through the procedure laid by <ORG> we find no force in the contention it is also made clear that the <ORG> should sit on regular basis to consider the cases of the eligible candidates within the zone of consideration It envisages that a post is filled upon by promotion where the Recruitment Rules so provide Sec wherein it was held that the object of writing the confidential report is two fold i to give an opportunity to the officer to remove deficiencies and to inculcate discipline should be dispensed with only after a certificate has been issued by the appointing authority that there are no vacancies to be filled by promotion or no officers are due for confirmation during the year in question are required to sit every year regularly on or before st April or st May of the year to fill up the vacancies likely to arise in the year for being filled up This requirement can be dispensed with only after a certificate is issued by the appointing authority that there are no vacancies to be filed by promotion or that no officers are due for confirmation during the year in question As regards vacancies arising out of deputation only those cases of deputation for periods exceeding one year should be taken into account due note however being kept also of the number of the deputationists likely to return to the cadre and who have to be provided for Part deals with preparation of yearwise panels by which reads as under Where for reasons beyond control the <ORG> could not be held in year even though the vacancies arose during that year or years the first <ORG> that meets thereafter should follow the following procedures i Determine the actual number of regular vacancies that arose in each of the previous year immediately preceding and the actual number of regular vacancies proposed to be filled in the current year separately The dereliction of the statutory duty must satisfactorily be accounted for by the State Government concerned and this Court takes serious note of wanton infraction It would thus be seen that the claims of the candidates eligible have to be considered for promotion objectively and dispassionately with a sense of achieving many fold purpose affording an opportunity to an incumbent to improve excellence honesty integrity devotion to public duty inculcating discipline in service afford opportunity to every eligible officer within zone of consideration for promotion to higher post or officer and ensuing that the Committee regularly meets and considers their claim objectively impartially with high sense of responsibility in accordance with the procedure and finalisation of the list in advance so as to fill up vacancies arising in the year from the approved panel without any undue delay Considered from that perspective the question arises whether the view taken by the <ORG> is justified in law It is true that filling up of the posts are for clear or anticipated vacancies arising in the year It is settled law that mere inclusion of one name in the list does not confer any right in him her to appointment The <ORG> is under no legal duty to fill up all or any of the vacancies even thought he <ORG> acts in arbitrary manner SCC it was held that mere inclusion of one name in the panel does not confer on him her any indefeasible right to appointment It was further held that the purpose of making panel was to finalise the list of eligible candidates for appointment The preparation of the panel should be to the extent of the notified or anticipated vacancies it was held that a person who is selected and empanelled does not on account of empanelment alone acquire any indefeasible right to appointment However in the light of the above principles and in the light of the clear rules extracted hereinbefore it is seen that the exercise of preparation of the panels is undertaken well in advance to fill up the clear vacancies of anticipated vacancies The preparation and finalisation of the yearly panel unless duly certified by the appointing authority that no vacancy would arise or no suitable candidate was available is a mandatory requirement If the annual panel could not be prepared for any justifiable reason yearwise panel of all the eligible candidates within the zone of consideration for filling up the vacancies each year should be prepared and appointment made in accordance therewith There were anticipated vacancies likely to arise on permanent basis and promotion to them was to be made on regular basis Therefore we do not find that the orders are vitiated by any error of law warranting interference
