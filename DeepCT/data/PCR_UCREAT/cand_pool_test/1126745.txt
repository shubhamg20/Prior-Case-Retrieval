The appellant Cooperative Union made a claim for the loss and a reference was made to the Assistant Registrar cooperative societies under section of the Bihar and Orissa Cooperative Societies Act The claim under section was rejected on the ground of limitation under second proviso to Section which prescribe a period of six years Even if the two remedies are inconsistent they continue for the person concerned to choose from until he elects one of them commencing an action accordingly In the present case no steps under Section were ever taken by the appellant The Judgement of the Court was delivered by SHARMA The question arising in this case is whether a matter if it comes within the scope of section of the Bihar and Orissa Co operative Societies Act hereinafter referred to as the Act has to be excluded from the purview of Section of the Act A claim was accordingly made for the said loss by the appellant and a reference was made to the Assistant Registrar Co operative Societies respondent No under Section of the Act The Assistant Registrar absolved the respondent No from the alleged liability and an appeal was filed by the appellant under Section of the Act before the Joint Registrar Co operative Societies respondent No who are accepted the appellant case rejected the defence and made an award accordingly It has been contended on behalf of the appellant that the provisions of Section are wide enough to embrace the dispute which has been the subject matter of the present case and they cannot be given a narrow interpretation so as to exclude their application to cases which may also be covered by Section In reply reliance has been placed on behalf of the respondent No on the decision in Purnea Ministerial Government Officer Co operative Society Ltd <NAME> Vol which has found favour with <ORG> Section pertaining to surcharge provides that if as a result of an audit or inquiry it appears to the Registrar that any person who has taken part in the organisation or management of the society or any past or present officer of the society has either made a payment contrary to law or has been guilty of misappropriation or of having committed similar acts detailed therein the Registrar may inquire into the matter and make an order requiring him to contribute an appropriate sum by way of compensation to the assets of the society The second Proviso to sub section of the said section says that no such order shall be passed in respect of any act or ommission which had occurred more than six years earlier <ORG> agreed and made the following observations It is well known proposition of law that when a matter falls under any specific provision then if must be governed by that provision and not by general provisions Generalia specialibus non derogant <ORG> has in its judgement assumed that whenever a specific remedy is made available in law the other remedy more general in nature necessarily gets excluded If any standard book on the subject is examined it will be found that the debate is directed to the application of the principle of election where two or more remedies are available to a person Even if the two remedies happen to be inconsistent they continue for the person concerned to choose from until he elects one of them commencing an action accordingly In the present case there is no such problem as no steps under Section were ever taken by the appellant We accordingly hold that <ORG> was in error in assuming that the application of provisions of Section of the Bihar Act could not be applied to the present case for the reason that Section was attracted So far the question of limitation is concerned it is true that as in the Delhi Act a period of six years was fixed under the Bihar Act also by second Proviso under Section which reads thus Provided further that no order shall be passed under this sub section in respect of any act or omission mentioned in clauses a or except within six years of the date on which such act or omission occurred It will be observed that the six years rule of limitation however is limited for the purpose of section and cannot govern the reference under section Even if the Proviso be assumed to govern a dispute between the society and its past or present officer or servant it cannot come to the aid of the present respondent No because he was dismissed from service on and he was directed to deposit the disputed amount within days therefrom The dispute was referred for adjudication under section on and the reference was registered as Award Case No of on Thus all these steps were taken within a period of two years No reliance therefore can be placed on either section or However since in the judgement it is stated that several other questions were also raised on behalf of the respondent No who was the writ petitioner which remained undecided the case requires reconsideration by <ORG> on the remaining points
