JUDGMENT BHAN These appeals are directed against a common judgment passed by <ORG> of <ORG> wherein <ORG> while setting aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge dated th July has dismissed the writ petition filed by the appellants The writ petition was filed by the appellants challenging the constitutional validity of the Bharat Hydro Power Corporation Limited Acquisition and Transfer of Undertaking Act being Assam Act of published in <ORG> dated th January Disputes arose between the parties In the writ petitions the appellants challenged the constitutional validity of the Act being ultra vires and violative of Articles and of the Constitution of India and on the ground of being vague unfair and arbitrary The Preamble of the Act reads as follows ASSAM ACT NO OF Received the

Act or any other Act for the time being in force and of any rule made under any of those Acts shall in so far as it is inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Act have any effect On completion of the pleadings the writ petitions were placed for hearing before a learned Single Judge who after hearing the counsel for the parties passed a detailed order striking down Sections A and of the Act being repugnant to the Central Act i the Indian Electricity Act and the Electricity Supply Act Resultantly the writ appeals were accepted and writ petition filed by the appellants were ordered to be dismissed Before adverting to the submissions made before us we would broadly refer to a few fundamental principles regarding the competence of the respective legislatures to enact laws and as to which law would prevail in case of inconsistency between the laws made by the <ORG> and the laws made by <ORG> Article provides that subject to the provisions of the Constitution <ORG> may make laws for the whole or any part of the territory of India and the <ORG> of a State may make laws for the whole or any part of the State Subject matter of laws made by <ORG> and by the Legislatures of States Notwithstanding anything in clauses and <ORG> has exclusive power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List I in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the Union List Notwithstanding anything in clause <ORG> and subject to clause the <ORG> of any State also have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the Concurrent List Subject to clauses and the <ORG> of any State has exclusive power to make laws for such State or any part thereof with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List II in the Seventh Schedule in this Constitution referred to as the State List Parliament has power to make laws with respect to any matter for any part of the territory of India not included in a State notwithstanding that such matter is a matter enumerated in the State List Without going into the finer aspects but broadly speaking it provides that <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate with respect to matters in List I <ORG> has exclusive power to legislate in respect to matters in List II Both <ORG> and <ORG> have power to make laws with respect to any of the matters enumerated in List III In a federal Constitution in which there is a division of legislative powers between the <ORG> and <ORG> controversies often arise as to whether one or the other legislature is not exceeding its legislative power and encroaching on the other constitutional legislative power To resolve the dispute as to which law would prevail in a case where both the <ORG> as well as <ORG> have the competence to enact laws Article provides that if any provision of a law made by the <ORG> is repugnant to any provision of law made by <ORG> which <ORG> is competent to enact or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List then subject to the provisions of clause the law made by <ORG> shall prevail and the law made by <ORG> shall to the extent of the repugnancy be void Clause provides that where a law made by the <ORG> with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provisions repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law made by the <ORG> or an existing law with respect to the matters then the law so made by the <ORG> of such State shall if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent prevail in that State It is likely to happen from time to time that enactment though purporting to deal with a subject in one list touches also on a subject in another list and prima facie looks as if one legislature is impinging on the legislative field of the another <ORG> This may result in large number of statutes being declared unconstitutional because the legislature enacting law may appear to have legislated in a field reserved for the other legislature To examine whether a legislation has impinged in the field of other legislatures in fact or in substance or is incidental keeping in view the true nature of the enactment the <ORG> have evolved the doctrine of pith and substance for the purpose of determining whether it is legislation with respect to matters in one list or the other Where the question for determination is whether a particular law relates to a particular subject mentioned in one list or the other the courts look into the substance of the enactment This principle came come to be established by <ORG> when it determined appeals from Canada or Australia involving the question of legislative competence of the federation or the States in those countries This doctrine came to be established in India and derives its genesis from the approach adopted by the <ORG> including <ORG> in dealing with controversies arising in other federations In the last mentioned case it was held Where a law passed by <ORG> while being substantially within the scope of the entries in the State List entrenches upon any of the Entries in the Central List the constitutionality of the law may be upheld by invoking the doctrine of pith and substance if on an analysis of the provisions of the Act it appears that by and large the law falls within the four corners of the State List and entrenchment if any is purely incidental or inconsequential It was conceded by the learned counsels appearing on both sides that this view has been accepted and reiterated by this Court in a number of judgments Though in <ORG> both before the learned Single Judge as well as <ORG> and in the special leave petition number of points were taken argued but before us the submissions were limited to three points to which reference would be made in the subsequent paragraphs Before adverting to the actual submissions made by the respective learned counsels entries in the three lists relating to generation of power electricity and acquisition may be noticed which read Entry of List I Regulation and development of inter State rivers and river valleys to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Since the <ORG> had already enacted comprehensive laws regarding the generation and supply of electricity by enacting the Indian Electricity Act hereinafter referred to Act of and the Electricity Supply Act hereinafter referred to Act of covering the entire field the field being occupied <ORG> did not have the competence to enact the laws under Entry of List III Another finding recorded by <ORG> is that even if the Act is taken to be enacted under Entry of List III even then there was no actual repugnancy as both the Acts did not operate in the same field Since there was no repugnancy it was not necessary to keep the Act for the assent of the President of India As far as generating company and licensee are concerned <ORG> has made specific provisions in the Act of and Act of for compulsory purchase of undertaking and a detailed procedure has been prescribed under Sections A and of the Act of and Sections of the Act of The impugned Act and Acts of and passed by <ORG> operate in the same field as in both the sets of Acts there are provisions for compulsory purchase of undertakings producing electricity On the other hand Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the State of Assam as well as the <ORG> contended that the impugned Act was not repugnant to the provisions of the Central Act According to him impugned Act and the Central Act in the instant case operate in two different fields without encroaching upon each others field in as much as the true nature and character of the impugned State Act is to acquire the undertaking whereas both the Central Act have made general provisions with regard to supply and use of electrical energy It was vehemently contended that there was no violation of Sections of A of the Act of by Sections and of the impugned Act as the appellants were not licensees under the Act of and the State Government had the jurisdiction and power to acquire any property for public purposes making necessary provisions for payment of compensation There is no direct conflict between the provisions of the Central Act and the State Act bringing a position where one cannot be obeyed without disobeying the other and the impugned Act and the Central Act both can stand together even though the State law may provide for certain additional supplementary provisions Learned counsel appearing for the appellants placing reliance on a <ORG> decision of this Court in <NAME> Vs State of AIR SC contended that even in the absence of direct conflict the State law would be inoperative as the Central Act of and intended to be exhaustive Codes in the field of electricity and <ORG> did not have the legislative competence to enact law in the field occupied by the Central Legislation It was observed in para <NAME> in his Australian Constitution nd Edn At page of SCR at of AIR it is stated The principle embodied in section and Article is that when there is legislation covering the same ground both by the centre and by the Province both of them being competent to enact the same the law of the <ORG> should prevail over that of the <ORG> Repugnancy between two statutes may thus be ascertained on the basis of the following three principles Whether there is direct conflict between the two provisions Whether <ORG> intended to lay down an exhaustive code in respect of the subject matter replacing the Act of <ORG> and Whether the law made by <ORG> and the law made by <ORG> occupy the same field This Court laid down three broad principles to find out whether there is any Repugnancy between the two statutes i whether there is a direct conflict between the two statutes whether the two statutes occupied the same field and as to whether the <ORG> intended to lay down an exhaustive code in respect of the subject matter In <NAME> Vs Union of India AIR SC <NAME> reviewed the authorities on repugnancy under Article and held that the following propositions emerged from decided cases That in order to decide the question of repugnancy it must be shown that the two enactments contain inconsistent and irreconcilable provisions so that they cannot stand together or operate in the same field That there can be no repeal by implication unless the inconsistency appears on the face of the two statutes That where the two statutes occupy a particular field but there is room or possibility of both the statutes operating in the same field without coming into collision with each other no repugnancy results That where there is no inconsistency but a statute occupying the same field seeks to create distinct and separate offences no question of repugnancy arises and both the statutes continue to operate in the same field Without entering into the controversy whether the State Act would fall under Entry of List II or under Entry of List III and assuming but not holding that it falls under Entry of List III we examine as to whether there is any conflict between the provisions of the Central Act and the State Act If there is no conflict at all the question of repugnancy would not arise Contention raised on behalf of the appellants is that Central Act makes specific provisions for compulsory purchase of undertaking and a detailed procedure has been prescribed and the <ORG> Act has created a parallel procedure for purchase of the undertaking thereby impinging on the Central Act and is therefore repugnant to the Central Act We do not find any substance in this submission Section makes provisions where license of a licensee is revoked Where a license has been granted to any person not being a local authority <ORG> shall a in the case of a license granted before the commencement of the Indian Electricity Amendment Act on the expiration of each such period as is specified in the license and in the case of license granted on or after the commencement of the said Act on the expiration of such period not exceeding thirty years and of every such subsequent period not exceeding twenty years as shall be specified in this behalf in the license have the option of purchasing the undertaking and such option shall be exercised by <ORG> serving upon the licensee a notice in writing of not less than one year requiring the licensee to sell the undertaking to it at the expiry of the relevant period referred to in this sub section Where neither <ORG> nor <ORG> elects to purchase the undertaking any local authority constituted for an area within which the whole of the area of supply is included shall have the like option to be exercised in the like manner of purchasing the undertaking Where a notice exercising the option of purchasing the undertaking has been served upon the licensee under this section the licensee shall deliver the undertaking to <ORG> <ORG> or the local authority as the case may be on the expiration of the relevant period referred to in sub section pending the determination and payment of the purchase price Section provides for payment of purchase price by the purchaser to the licensee determined in accordance with the provisions of Section A Under Section there is an option with the <ORG> to purchase Submission made by the learned counsel for the appellants that the State Act creates procedure parallel to the existing procedure provided under Section of the Act of or for determing the purchase price as provided under Section A cannot be accepted because the provisions of Chapter II Sections to are not applicable to the appellants as they are not licensees Subject to the provisions of this Act Sections to both inclusive of the Indian Electricity Act and clauses XIV to XVII both inclusive of the Schedule thereto shall as far as may be apply in relation to a Generating Company as they apply in relation to a licensee under that Act hereafter in this section referred to as the licensee and in particular a Generating Company may in connection with the performance of its duties exercise a all or any of the powers conferred on a licensee by sub section of Section of the Indian Electricity Act as if i the reference therein to licensee were a reference to <ORG> ii the reference to the terms and conditions of licence were a reference to the provisions of this Act and to the articles of association of <ORG> and iii the reference to the area of supply were a reference to the area specified under sub section of section A in relation to <ORG> all or any of the powers conferred on a licensee by sub section of section of the Indian Electricity Act as if i the references therein to licensee were references to <ORG> and ii <ORG> had the powers of a licensee under the said Act It is to be noted that provisions of Sections to of Act have not been made applicable to the generating company As pointed out earlier only Sections to of the Act of have been made applicable to a generating company This Section would also not apply to the present case Contention that the impugned Act is in violation of provisions of Act of or the Act of has no basis to stand on There is not even a semblance of conflict what to talk of direct conflict between the impugned State Act and the Central Act to bring about the situation where one cannot be obeyed without disobeying the others As the enactments operate in two different fields without encroaching upon each other field there is no repugnancy Since there is no repugnancy the question of the State Act being kept for the consideration of the President or receiving his assent did not arise For the reasons stated above we do not find any merit in these appeals and the same are dismissed Parties shall bear their own costs in these appeals
