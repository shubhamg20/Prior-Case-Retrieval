Appellants in these appeals by Special Leave are the Defendants in Civil Suit No of on the original side of <ORG> and assail the order dated of <ORG> of <ORG> granting in appeal and in reversal of the order dated of the learned single Judge trying the suit an injunction restraining appellants from passing off their medicinal product Cal De Ce as that of the Respondent Plaintiff Respondent claimed to have acquired a right in that Trade mark by continuous user As the considerations relevant for decision on the prayer for stay by and large conclude the subject matter of the main appeals we proceed to dispose of the main appeals themselves <ORG> first appellant claiming to be registered proprietor of the Registered Trade mark Cal De Ce entered into an agreement dated with <ORG> <ORG> the respondent under which <ORG> agreed to manufacture vitaminsed Calcium Gluconate Tablets under the said registered Trade Mark Cal De Ce and sell the entire production to the <ORG> It would appear that pursuant to and in implementation of these arrangements <ORG> applied for the requisite manufacturing license from the Drug Controller under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act in the course of the processing of which <ORG> furnished before the Drug Controller an undertaking that <ORG> would not authorize the use of its Trade Mark Cal De Ce by any other company and further not to manufacture Cal De Ce with effect from st July either by itself or under sole licenses from it The case of <ORG> is that its agreement dated with <ORG> was itself void in that its object was one forbidden by law that it would if permitted defeat and violate several statutory provisions and prohibitions that the agreement thus out of way the undertaking furnished on st June by <ORG> to the Drug Controller in Karnataka had the effect in law of and amounted to an abandonment by <ORG> of its proprietorship of the Registered Trade Mark Cal De Ce and all of such exclusive rights as <ORG> had or may have had in respect of that Trade Mark and that the subsequent continued user of the said Trade Mark by <ORG> under the Drug Controller licence amounted to an independent user of the Trade Mark by <ORG> in its own right as indeed according to <ORG> the said Trade Mark after its abandonment by <ORG> came to be in an ascent unwonted condition eligible to be picked up and used by any body The point for consideration is whether there is a prima facie case on which <ORG> could be held entitled to restrain <ORG> and <ORG> from manufacturing and marketing goods under the Trade name Cal De Ce and whether on considerations of balance of convenience and comparative hardship a temporary injunction should issue The corollary is that even if the injunction sought by <ORG> is refused that does not ipso facto entitled <ORG> and <ORG> to manufacture and market the goods if they are not otherwise entitled to do so under the relevant laws regulating the matter The court also in restraining a defendant from exercising what he considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be prevented puts into the scales as a relevant consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or whether he has already been doing so in which latter case considerations somewhat different from those that apply to a case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise are attracted The first is a misdirection in regard to the very scope and nature of the appeals before it and the limitations on the powers of <ORG> to substitute its own discretion in an appeal preferred against a discretionary order The appellate court would normally not be justified in interfering with the exercise of discretion under appeal solely on the ground that if it had considered the matter at the trial stage it would have come to a contrary conclusion If the discretion has been exercised by <ORG> reasonably and in a judicial manner the fact that the appellate court would have taken a different view may not justify interference with the trial court exercise of discretion An infringement action is available where there is violation of specific property right acquired under and recognised by the statute The tort of passing off involves a misrepresentation made by a trade to his prospective customers calculated to injure as a reasonably foreseeable consequence the business or goodwill of another which actually or probably causes damage to the business or goodwill of the other trader We accordingly allow these appeals set aside order dated of <ORG> in so far as it pertains to Civil Suit of and restore the order dated made by the learned Single Judge on Applications and of Since we are examining the matter at an interlocutory stage none of the observations contained in this order shall affect the final decision of the suit on the merits after evidence The grievance of the appellant is that its appeal before the Learned Single Judge of <ORG> preferred against an interlocutory order granting an injunction in a suit pending on the file of <ORG> was disposed of without giving opportunity to the learned Counsel for the appellant to argue the matter <NAME> for the respondent fairly consents to an order and we accordingly make that order setting aside the order under appeal and remitting the matter to <ORG> for consideration afresh of the appeal for admission after affording another opportunity to the appellant of being heard
