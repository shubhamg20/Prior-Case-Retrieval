Aggrieved the appellant who espoused the cause of the workman filed a petition under Article of the Constitution before <ORG> A learned Single Judge of <ORG> dismissed the writ petition A letters patent appeal filed by the appellant also met with the same fate SCC this <ORG> however observed that some of the decisions rendered by this <ORG> subsequent to <NAME> case supra require a relook as the same are not in consonance with the <ORG> decision Section A of the Industrial Disputes Act for short the Act confers a wide power upon <ORG> <ORG> or the National <ORG> to give appropriate relief in case of discharge or dismissal of workmen While adjudicating on a reference made to it <ORG> <ORG> or the National <ORG> as the case may be if satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified it may while setting aside the same direct reinstatement of the workman on such terms and conditions if any as it thinks fit or give such other relief to the workman including the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of discharge or dismissal as the circumstances of the case may require But once whether on the basis of the evidences brought on record in the domestic inquiry or by reason of additional evidence the employer makes out a case justifying the order of dismissal we fail to understand as to how such order of dismissal can be given effect to only from the date of the award and not from the date of passing of the order of punishment According to the learned senior counsel there is a difference between a termination which is not followed by an inquiry and where inquiry is found to be defective on account of procedural breach In such a case the employer would not have the benefit which he had in cases where domestic inquiries have been held It was pointed out that the import effect of commission to hold an enquiry was merely this that the tribunal would not have to consider only whether there was a prima fade case but would decide for itself on the evidence adduced whether the charges have really been made out no difference whether the matter comes before the tribunal for approval under or on a reference under of the Industrial Disputes Act In either case if the enquiry is defective or if no enquiry has been held as required by Standing orders the entire case would be open before the tribunal and the employer would have to justify on facts as well that its order of dismissal or discharge was proper <ORG> was on a reference under and the same principle was applied there also the only difference being that in that case there was an enquiry though it was defective A defective enquiry in our opinion stands on the same footing as no enquiry and in either case the tribunal would have jurisdiction to go into the facts and the employer would have to satisfy the tribunal that on facts the order of dismissal or discharge was proper SCR this Court while interpreting the provision of Section A of the Act held that in terms thereof the management need not necessarily rely on the materials on record as while introducing Section A of the Act the <ORG> must have been aware of the decisions of this Court which are operating in the field for long time The <ORG> gets jurisdiction to consider the evidence placed before it for the first time in justification of the action taken only if no enquiry has been held or after the enquiry conducted by an employer is found to be defective It has never been recognized that the <ORG> should straightaway without anything more direct reinstatement of a dismissed or discharged employee once it is found that no domestic enquiry has been held or the said enquiry is found to be defective Case supra SCR <ORG> sought to make a distinction between an approval which is required to be made under Section of the Act and a reference under Section thereof stating <ORG> was cited to support the view of relation back of the Award to the date of the employer termination orders The latter case of <ORG> supra specifically refers to <ORG> case and <NAME> case and holds that where the Management discharges a workmen by an order which is void for want of an enquiry or for blatant violation of rules of natural justice the relation back doctrine cannot be invoked The jurisprudential difference between a void order which by a subsequent judicial resuscitation comes into being de novo and an order which may suffer from some defects but is not still born or void and all that is needed in the law to make it good is a subsequent approval by a tribunal which if granted cannot be obfuscated We may however observe that although in certain contingencies an employer may in a case of grave nature of misconduct dismiss a workman without holding an enquiry but ordinarily such an enquiry will not be dispensed with For the aforesaid reasons we do not find any merit in this appeal
