Though charged with an offence under Section also the trial court acquitted him of the same Eight months prior to the date of occurrence the appellant purchased the house from his nephew PW for Rs prior to which he was living in Ashapura Nagar locality in Rajkot The existence of misunderstandings and disputes over the purchase of the house where they were residing among the appellant and the wife and daughters the purchase of five litters of petrol in a plastic can and keeping it in the kitchen though he had no vehicle for its use that the appellant alone was present in the house besides the deceased members at a when the incident had taken place that the appellant alone poured petrol on the deceased members when they were asleep and set them on fire resulting in their deaths placing in a safe place on the terrace his son to save his life that due to the highly inflammable nature of petrol five liters poured on the bodies of the deceased ladies they were engulfed in huge fire and got roasted without any chance to escape from the interior room where they were sleeping that the appellant made no attempts to save the ladies and himself alone ran away from the house and gone to the hospital where he gave also a false version that he had sustained burn injuries due to flames of kerosene stove while preparing tea that the appellant had not then informed about fire incident involving the lady members or the injuries sustained by them due to sprinkling or spilling as the appellant would like to claim of petrol on their bodies and the panchnama of the place of occurrence the details of place of incident the bowl half burnt pieces of quilt and coired thread of wooden cots on which also the presence of petrol was detected that the plea raised as in the written reply was not probable or believable and was not only false and got up and belied by the fact that no petrol was detected on his body the fact that the theory of fire taking place due to electric short circuit was also completely ruled out and found raised merely to mislead the court and that all those circumstances found amply proved only led to the inevitable conclusion that the appellant alone was the culprit The learned judges in <ORG> also gone into the merits at great length and detail and apart from affirming the incriminating circumstances found sufficiently established by the trial court also held that the false plea set up by the appellant also militated against his innocence and the absence of proper or reasonable explanation and or a false explanation given regarding the incriminating circumstances strengthened and completed the chain and further held that the prosecution has proved the charge beyond any reasonable doubt and the guilt of the accused conclusively <NAME> appearing for the appellant contended that except that the appellant was present at that time in the house no other circumstance could really incriminate the appellant and that the immediate conduct subsequent to the occurrence and the urge in him to save the others would belie the claim that he committed the offence Per contra Mrs <NAME> for the <ORG> with equal force contended that the concurrent findings recorded by the courts below are well merited and the punishment of death imposed cannot be said to uncalled for or unjustified We have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel appearing on either side The entire case against the appellant rests only on circumstantial evidence and having regard to the manner place and time of occurrence it was difficult for the prosecution to gather or produce any direct or ocular evidence for the commission of the murder The circumstances held proved in this case by cogent and convincing materials brought on record are sufficient to substantiate the homicidal crime committed by the appellant beyond reasonable doubt and bring home the guilt of the accused with reasonable and positive definiteness The false nature of the varying explanations and the narration in the written statement of events as to how the incident took place has been highlighted by the courts below more in the process of finding out the reasonableness of the explanation and plausibility of its acceptance more as an additional circumstance to reinforce the conclusions arrived at and not to use such reasoning as a substitute for the ordinary proof normally expected of the prosecution to substantiate the guilt of the accused The reliance placed by the courts below on the deposition of PW the nephew PW the brother PW living in the house opposite to the appellant PW PW the panch witnesses and the facts noticed in the panchnama relating to the place of the incident Ex It cannot also be legitimately contended that improper and wrong inferences have been drawn from the materials placed on record or facts proved Therefore we see no reason to interfere with the concurrent findings of facts recorded by the courts below on the guilt of the appellant As for the quantum of sentence we have given our careful consideration in the light of the submissions of the counsel on either side
