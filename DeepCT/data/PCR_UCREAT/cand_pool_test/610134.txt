As a result of the accident the claimant received serious injuries over several parts of his body and remained as an indoor patient at <ORG> He alleged that he became invalid and members of his family have been deprived of his earnings as a rickshaw puller This appeal under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act hereinafter referred to as the Act has been filed by the insurer When the appeal came up for hearing before a learned single Judge on behalf of the claimant it was contended that the appeal did not lie at the instance of the insurer in view of the provision of Section of the Act which restricts the grounds upon which a claim is open to challenge On behalf of the insurer it was contended that it was a term in policy of insurance that the insurer could take any defence available to the insured in the name of the insured and the insured having not preferred any appeal and the entire liability for payment of compensation awarded by the <ORG> having come on the shoulders of the insurer the insurer must be held eligible to challenge the quantum of compensation as also its basis The learned single Judge was of the view that the contention made on behalf of the appellant was correct but in view of the observations made by this Court in the two decisions referred to above he was not in a position to dispose of the matter by overruling the respondents contention and asked the matter to be referred to <ORG> for disposal As already indicated the appeal has been filed under Section of the Act The view expressed by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> Section of the Act provides No sum shall be payable by an insurer under Sub section in respect of any judgment unless before or after the commencement of the proceedings in which the judgment is given the insurer had notice through the court of the bringing of the proceedings or in respect of any judgment so long as execution is stayed thereon pending an appeal and an insurer to whom notice of the bringing of any such proceedings is so given shall be entitled to be made a party thereto and to defend the action on any of the following grounds namely a that the policy was cancelled by mutual consent or by virtue of any provision contained therein before the accident giving rise to the liability and that either the certificate of insurance was surrendered to the insurer or that the person to whom the certificate was issued has made an affidavit stating that the certificate has been lost or destroyed or that either before or not later than fourteen days after the happening of the accident the insurer has commenced proceedings for cancellation of the certificate after compliance with the provision of Section or that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the Policy being one of the following conditions namely i a condition excluding the use of vehicle a for hire or reward where the vehicle is on the date of the contract of insurance a vehicle not covered by a permit to ply for hire or reward or for organised racing and speed testing or for a purpose not allowed by the permit under which the vehicle is used where the vehicle is a transport vehicle or without side car being attached where the vehicle is a motor cycle or ii a condition excluding driving by a named person or persons or by any person who is not duly licenced or by any person who has been disqualified for holding or obtaining a driving licence during the period of disqualification or iii a condition excluding liability for injury caused or contributed to by conditions of war civil war riot or civil commotion or that the policy is void on the ground that it was obtained by the nondisclosure of a material fact or by a representation of fact which was false in some material particular The statutory provision is clear that an insurer who has been made a party to a proceeding for recovery of compensation can resist the claim only on those grounds mentioned in Sub section and it is not open to it to raise any other plea Reliance has been placed on the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <NAME> <ORG> in support of the contention that under the terms of the policy the right to defend the claim proceeding has been reserved to the insurer One of the express conditions being condition No therein runs thus No admission offer promise payment or indemnity shall be made or given by or on behalf of the insured without the written consent of the Company which shall be entitled if it so desires to take over and conduct in the name of the insured the defence or settlement of any claim or to prosecute in the name of the Insured for its own benefit any claim for indemnity or otherwise and shall have full discretion in the conduct of any proceedings or in the settlement of any claim and the insured shall give all such information and assistance as the Company may require that the object of giving the notice to the insurance company was obviously to enable it to defend the action through the defendant but that no right had been given to the insurance company to defend the action in all cases in its own right or in its own name One is to enable it to defend the action in its own right and in its own name if it is challenging the claim on any of the grounds mentioned in Section We may now refer to the decision of <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <NAME> AIR SC <NAME> This was a case where in the policy bond there was a condition as in this case First dealing with the provision of Section of the Act the <ORG> observed To start with it is necessary to remember that apart from the statute an insurer has no right to be made a party to the action by the injured person against the insured causing the injury Sub section of Section however gives him the right to be made a party to the suit and to defend it The right therefore is created by statute and its content necessarily depends on the provisions of the statute It would follow that an insurer is entitled to defend on any of the grounds enumerated and no others To do that would be adding words to the statute Clause gives him the right to defend the action on the ground that the policy is void as having been obtained by non disclosure of a material fact or a material false representation of fact Therefore it cannot be said that in enacting Sub section the legislature was contemplating only those defences which were based on the conditions of the policy It also seems to us that even if Sub section and Sub section were confined only to defences based on the conditions of the policy that would not have led to the conclusion that the legislature thought that other defences not based on such conditions would be open to an insurer If that was what the legislature intended then there was nothing to prevent it from expressing its intention What the legislature has done is to enumerate in Sub section the defences available to an insurer and to provide by Sub section that he cannot avoid his liability excepting by means of such defences In order that Sub section may be interpreted in the way the learned Solicitor General suggests we have to add words to it The addition suggested will in our view make the language used unhappy and further effect a complete change in the meaning of the words used in the sub section The Statute has no doubt created a liability in the insurer to the injured person but the statute has also expressly confined the right to avoid that liability to certain grounds specified in it It is not for us to add to those grounds and therefore to the statute for reasons of hardship We are furthermore not convinced that the statute causes any hardship First the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge He can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and this he has full liberty to do From this decision of <ORG> three propitions seem to have become settled i an insurer is not entitled to resist a claim on a ground not enumerated under Section of the Act ii Section of the Act deals with defences other than those based on conditions of a policy and iii where conditions of the policy so provide an insurer has the right to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by the insurer the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him On a plain reading of the lines quoted above from the judgment of <ORG> it appears to us that the <ORG> has said that the insurer must have reserved to it by the policy the right to defend the action in the name of the assured and the insurer must defend in the name of the assured in order that the restriction put under Section of the Act goes and all the defences available to the assured are available to the insurer The phrase if he does so does not have the narrow interpretation as given to it by Counsel in support of the appeal namely that the insurer has reserved to it the right to defend in the name of the assured If that was the real meaning intended to be given to the phrase after it has already been said that the insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured there was no necessity to add The Claims <ORG> has restricted the rights of the insurance company to cross examine the claimant and his witnesses on its construction of Section of the Act Section was introduced in order to enforce the duty of insurers to satisfy judgments against persons insured in respect of third party risk by giving them notice after judgment obtained by third party against persons insured in respect of third party risk It contemplates notice being given to the insurer which may be before or after judgment is obtained against the person who had effected insurance for third party risk It has been rightly pointed out in those decisions that apart from the statute an insurer has no right to be made a party to the action by the injured person against the insured causing the injury and that the rights open to the insurer are therefore governed by those provided in the section The decisions do not relate to proceedings before a Claims <ORG> where the insurers are made parties and the scope of the defences which they were to put forward has not in any way been restricted But the obvious answer is that it is only after a Claims <ORG> is constituted by the State Government by a notification in the Official Gazette the Civil <ORG> jurisdiction would be barred In our opinion the insurance companies who are mainly responsible to satisfy the claims of third parties and who are parties to the proceedings before the Claims <ORG> sic and who are entitled to cross examine cannot be restricted to the defences specified in Section of the Act On behalf of the respondents it has been claimed that <ORG> took notice of the judicial opinion expressed by different Courts and while amending the Motor Vehicles Act by Central Act of incorporated into Section a sub section numbered as A running thus Where in the course of any inquiry <ORG> is satisfied that i there is collusion between the person making the claim and the person against whom the claim is made or ii the person against whom the claim is made has failed to contest the claim it may for reasons to be recorded by it in writing direct that the insurer who may be liable in respect of such claim shall be impleaded as a party to the proceeding and the insurer so impleaded shall thereupon have the right to contest the claim on all or any of the grounds that are available to the person against whom the claim has been made Sub section A is more in accord with the view indicated by <NAME> in the decision dealt with earlier in our judgment The power under Section A of the Act can be exercised even when the insured has entered contest and while giving an appearance of contest is actually colluding with the claimant In the Bench decision of this Court the question now posed did not arise for consideration and all that was taken note of was the restriction imposed under Section of the Act The learned Single Judge in the subsequent decision ACJ Orissa was indeed not dealing with the term of the policy bond reserving the right to defend to the insurer in the name of the insured but was considering the scope and ambit of Section A of the Act As the facts of this case show the insured had entered contest and there is no reason to hold in the absence of any allegation and something more that the insured has been colluding with the claimant Leave of the <ORG> had admittedly not been taken under Section A of the Act There exists a clause in the policy bond authorising the insurer to defend in the name of the insured As we have already noted the insured and the insurer simultaneously wanted to defend the insured defending in his own name and the insurer in its own name The term in the policy bond did not authorise such defence by the insurer In the instant case therefore to the insurer the restriction under Section of the Act applies and he could not travel beyond the restriction imposed by the Statute either before the <ORG> or in appeal before this Court None of the Grounds in the memorandum of appeal appertains to a defence raised within Section of the Act and what is being mainly challenged is the quantum and liability on a ground not covered by Section of the Act On these grounds the insurer was not entitled to contest the claim nor the award The appeal filed on its behalf therefore is not maintainable We accordingly dismiss the appeal The interests of justice in our view would be adequately satisfied if parties are directed to bear their own costs
