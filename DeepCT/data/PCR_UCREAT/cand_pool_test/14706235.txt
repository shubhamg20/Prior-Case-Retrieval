In the appeals arising out of SLP Nos of of and of the appellants have impugned the common judgment and order of <ORG> dated February disposing of Civil Writ Petition Nos of of and of A few broad facts may be noticed at the threshold to appreciate the contentions urged on behalf of the parties in these appeals A declaration under Section of the Act was made with respect to the said lands on July It also appears from the record that the notice issued under Section of the Act on June was challenged in several writ petitions filed before <ORG> in which an interim order was passed directing maintenance of status quo with regard to possession of the lands but permitted the acquisition proceeding to continue Reliance has been placed on the correspondence exchanged between the various statutory authorities to indicate that it was really for the purpose of <ORG> that the lands were being utilised On December a Notification was issued under Section of the Act for acquisition of land for a public purpose namely for rehabilitation of the persons displaced or affected due to the expansion development of the Palam Airport Since the challenge to the acquisition failed and the appellants were not provided alternative sites under the rehabilitation package they approached <ORG> for relief which as noticed earlier has been refused by <ORG> The lands in question in village Mahipalpur measuring bighas and biswas approximately acres devolved upon the appellants after the death of their father <NAME> had constructed a factory over the lands in question in the year which went into production later after obtaining registration on July On January the aforesaid lands of the appellants were notified for acquisition under Section of the Act for the public purpose of planned development of Delhi According to the appellants when the factory was established and became functional there was no Master Plan of Delhi which came into existence only in the year in which the lands were shown as green area During the pendency of the writ petition the award was announced on September which was followed by notices under Sections and of the Act No appeal was preferred against the order dismissing the review petition and hence the proceeding initiated by filing of No of challenging the acquisition proceeding got a quietus by dismissal of the review petition by <ORG> However the petitioners filed another writ petition being Writ Petition No of again questioning the acquisition proceeding It appears from the record that the point sought to be urged in the aforesaid writ petition was that the acquisition proceeding was bad for non compliance with the provision of Chapter VII of the Act Since the <ORG> came into existence much later only on December and was vested with the power to manage the airports there was no question of the acquisition being made for the purpose of the <ORG> since that body did not exist in the year <ORG> has also rejected the submission on the ground that it was barred by the principle of constructive res judicata It is not necessary for us to express any opinion on this issue in view of our earlier finding but the appellants have themselves drawn the attention of this Court to the fact that the land was being acquired for the purpose of the <ORG> as was evident from the Resolution of <ORG> dated September It is not as if lands acquired for a particular public purpose cannot be utilized for another public purpose He contended that as long as the acquisition is not held to be mala fide the acquisition cannot be invalidated merely because the lands which at one time were proposed to be utilized for a particular public purpose were later either in whole or in part utilized for some other purpose though a public purpose He therefore submitted that some change of user of the land as long as it has a public purpose would not invalidate the acquisition proceeding which is otherwise valid and legal There is no principle of law by which a valid compulsory acquisition stands voided because long later the requiring authority diverts it to a public purpose other than the one stated in the Section declaration lands which had been acquired for public purpose of housing scheme were sought to be utilized for a commercial purpose namely for locating a district center It was contended before this Court that since the acquisition was for a housing scheme the land cannot be used for commercial purposes The submission was rejected in the following words We find no force in the contention It is conceded by the learned Counsel that the construction of the District center for commercial purpose itself is a public purpose Suffice it to state that it is a well settled law that land sought to be acquired for public purpose may be used for another public purpose The notification under Section could not have been quashed on the ground that the land is sought to be used for District center namely for commercial purpose It is obvious that the lands acquired for a public purpose should serve only the public purpose of providing facilities of commercial purpose namely District center as conceded by the learned Counsel in fairness to be a public purpose <ORG> took a decision to accord permission to the respondent as asked for and the suit was withdrawn Another application filed by the respondent was kept in abeyance which compelled the respondent to file another writ petition which was allowed by <ORG> Even the respondent filed his objections This Court set aside the judgment and order of <ORG> and observed Besides the question as to whether a particular Scheme framed in exercise of statutory provisions is in the public interest or not has to be determined according to the need of the time and a final decision for all times to come cannot be taken This Court held that the acquisition was valid but it was for the beneficiary of the acquisition to move the competent authority and obtain the sanction of the said authority for change of user wherein this Court has held that <ORG> was not right in ordering restoration of land to the respondents on the ground that the land acquired was not used for the purpose for which it was acquired It was held Page that after passing of the Award and possession taken under Section of the Act the acquired land vests with the <ORG> free from all encumbrances Even if the land is not used for the purpose for which it is acquired the landowner does not get any right to ask for restoration of possession Referring to the facts of the instant case it cannot be disputed that the planned development of Delhi for which purpose the land was acquired under Section of the Act is wide enough to include the development and expansion of an airport within the city of Delhi The only difference is that whereas initially the development work would have been undertaken by the <ORG> or any other agency employed by it after the constitution of the <ORG> the said development work had to be undertaken by the newly constituted authority All that has happened is that the development work is undertaken by another agency since constituted which is entrusted with the special task of maintenance of airports Since the said authority was constituted several years after the issuance of the Notification under Sections the acquisition cannot be invalidated only on the ground that the public purpose is sought to be achieved through another agency This as we have noticed earlier was necessitated by change of circumstances in view of the creation of the authority i <ORG> Moreover since there is no change of public purpose for which the acquired land is being utilized the acquisition cannot be invalidated on that ground Therefore the acquisition cannot be challenged on the ground that the acquired lands are not being utilized for the declared public purpose Having regard to the facts of the case it cannot be contended nor has it been contended that the Notification under Section of the Act was issued mala fide We therefore find no merit in the appeal arising out of SLP No of and the same is accordingly dismissed In this appeal the lands belonging to the appellant in village Mahipalpur were notified for acquisition under Section of the Act on January A declaration under Section followed on December It will be noticed that the appellants filed the writ petition challenging the acquisition proceeding which was initiated in as late as on September after the Award had been declared under Section of the Act In the facts and circumstances of the case no exception can be taken to the order of <ORG> dismissing the writ petition There was no good reason explaining the delay in moving <ORG> in exercise of its writ jurisdiction It is not necessary to refer to the large number of authorities on the subject since the law is so well settled that there is no need for a further reiteration We therefore find no merit in this appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed The appellant in this appeal is <ORG> whose lands were notified for acquisition under Section of the Act on December and the declaration under Section was published on July The petitioner had earlier filed a writ petition being No of It appears from the order passed in the said writ petition dated February that a prayer was made for leave to withdraw the petition The order notices the fact that in the aforesaid writ petition there was no prayer for mandamus directing the respondents to allot any alternative site It accordingly dismissed the writ petition as withdrawn but with liberty to file a fresh petition for claiming any alternative site if it had any such right Whereafter the petitioner filed the instant writ petition on March It did not entertain the challenge to the Notifications issued under Sections and of the Act since challenge to the aforesaid Notifications stood rejected by order of February It noticed the earlier common judgment delivered in the writ petitions preferred by other appellants in this batch of writ petitions and held that the inordinate delay in filing the writ petition challenging the validity of the Notifications was not condonable observed that if there was a scheme promulgated by the <ORG> to provide alternative sites to persons whose lands had been acquired the Court could give effect to the Scheme In the instant case <ORG> dismissed the writ petition in view of the fact that there was nothing on record to indicate that any application was made to the competent authority for allotting an alternative site within a reasonable period Reliance placed on the decision of the learned Single Judge of <ORG> in <NAME> and <ORG> Moreover the <ORG> had agreed to allot the plots to the land owners and there was no question of recognizing any right of the land owners to an allotment of alternative plots It related to lands located in Nangal Dewat acquired for public purpose namely the development of Palam Airport It was submitted by Mr <NAME> leaned senior counsel appearing for the appellant <NAME> in appeal arising out of SLP No of that in view of the Notification of December the appellants are entitled to the benefit of rehabilitation in view of the acquisition of their lands for the expansion development of the Palam airport He therefore submitted that regardless of the fact that their lands were acquired under a different Notification than the lands of <NAME> in view of the issuance of the Notification dated December it made no difference since all of them were displaced or affected due to the expansion development of the Palam airport We shall therefore consider the material placed on record by the parties on the question of rehabilitation The first document to be considered is a letter dated December written by the Joint Director of Industries to the Deputy Commissioner Delhi informing him that the position regarding acquisition of land occupied by the industrial units in Mahipalpur Nangal Dewat area and providing of alternate plots to the land owners was to be reviewed by the Chief Secretary shortly It appears that earlier a Joint Survey Report had been submitted sometime in August with a view to assess the needs of the different ceramic industries located on the Mehrauli Mahipalpur Road which had to be shifted in view of the expansion of Palam airport It also noticed the fact that the aforesaid factories were located over an area of acres Though this letter records the willingness of the <ORG> to provide land for land subject to the condition that it shall incur no additional liability for payment of compensation for the acquired industrial structures it does not refer to any firm decision taken in this regard Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant in Punjab Potteries also placed reliance on a decision of <ORG> dated August in CWP No <NAME> supra and submitted that the aforesaid judgment supports the case of the appellants that the lands acquired in village Rangpuri were meant for rehabilitation of the persons displaced from village Nangal Dewat such as the appellants In reply counsel appearing for the respondents stated that for allotment of land to the persons whose lands had been acquired a scheme was being formulated So far as the allotment of residential site is concerned counsel appearing for the respondents submitted before us that if the appellant was eligible for allotment in terms of the scheme formulated for the purpose it could as well have asked for allotment of alternative site but the appellant was not interested in allotment of alternative plot for residence There is substance in the contention of the respondents that so far as the aforesaid decision goes it only related to allotment of alternative sites for residence of the displaced persons and not for relocation of an industry Governor directed that in the special circumstances obtaining in Delhi there was no alternative to <ORG> undertaking he responsibility for the rehabilitation of the village abadi So far as industrial structures are concerned it was clearly decided that the owners of industrial structures would not be provided any assistance beyond what they may be entitled to as compensation under the Act In law we find no justification for the claim that even in the absence of a scheme for rehabilitation of displaced industries alternative sites should be allotted to them for relocating the industrial units There is nothing in the Notification which obliges the <ORG> to provide equal alternative site to the industries for their rehabilitation We find substance in the stand of respondents It is submitted on behalf of the appellant that the award made by the Collector in the instant case was barred by limitation under Section A of the Act inasmuch as it was not made within a period of years from the date of the publication of the declaration after excluding the period during which an order of stay granted by <ORG> operated Since the facts are not in dispute we proceed to decide the question of limitation in this appeal The appellant filed the writ petition before <ORG> on September in which an order for maintenance of status quo was made on September <ORG> by the impugned judgment dismissed the writ petition filed by the petitioner on February whereafter the award was pronounced on March We may notice that the Land Acquisition Amendment Act came into force September It is not disputed that an order of status quo was made on th September which prevented <ORG> from pronouncing the award Ex facie therefore the award having not been made within the period prescribed by Section A of the Act the entire proceeding for acquisition of the land lapsed on February the last date for pronouncement of the award He submitted that the period taken by a public authority to obtain the authentic copy of the order which is evidence of the contents thereof must in all cases be excluded and the period taken to obtain a certified copy cannot cause any prejudice in the matter of calculation of the period of limitation Since the Land Acquisition Officer who is a public functionary had to look into the contents of the order passed by the court before taking any action including the pronouncement of the award the said period ought to have been excluded He submitted that since the authority had taken immediate steps in applying for certified copy and since the explanation to Section A prescribed a principle of limitation it is necessary that analogous principles contained in the Limitation Act must necessarily be applied <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the intervener also reiterated the same submission and contended that the Land Acquisition Officer could not have proceeded to make the award unless he had seen the authenticated copy of the order which had the effect of vacating the order of status quo passed as an interim measure Though it provides for exclusion of the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the declaration is stayed by an order of the court it does not exclude the time taken for obtaining a certified copy of the judgment or order vacating or having the effect of vacating the order of stay In the absence of any provision in the Land Acquisition Act for exclusion of time taken to obtain a certified copy of the judgment of <ORG> the Land Acquisition Collector ought to have proceeded to make the award having come to know that the writ petition filed by the appellant had been rejected by <ORG> In the matter of computing the period of limitation three situations may be visualized namely a where the Limitation Act applies by its own force where the provisions of the Limitation Act with or without modifications are made applicable to a special statute and where the special statue itself prescribes the period of limitation and provides for extension of time and or condonation of delay It is also clear from the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act that the provisions of the Limitation Act have not been made applicable to proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act in the matter of making an award under Section A of the Act The explanation thereto also provides for exclusion of the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the declaration is stayed by an order of a court Such being the provision there is no scope for importing into Section A of the Land Acquisition Act the provisions of Section of the Limitation Act The time taken for obtaining a certified copy of the judgment is excluded because a certified copy is required to be filed while preferring an appeal revision review etc Thus a court is not permitted to read into Section A of the Act a provision for exclusion of time taken to obtain a certified copy of the judgment and order The court has therefore no option but to compute the period of limitation for making an award in accordance with the provisions of Section A of the Act after excluding such period as can be excluded under the explanation to Section A of the Act In Section A the Act provides for a period of limitation within which an application should be made to the Collector for re determination of the amount of compensation on the basis of the award of the <ORG> The proviso to Sub section of Section A reads as follows Provided that in computing the period of three months within which an application to the Collector shall be made under this sub section the Page day on which the award was pronounced and the time requisite for obtaining a copy of the award shall be excluded It will thus be seen that the legislature wherever it considered necessary incorporated by express words the rule incorporated in Section of the Limitation Act supra the order under Section of the Land Acquisition Act dispensing with the enquiry under Section A was quashed by the court with liberty to the <ORG> to proceed further in accordance with law The limitation prescribed in Clause ii of the first proviso to Sub section of Section would apply to publication of declaration under Section afresh If it was published within one year from the date of the receipt of the order of the court by Land Acquisition Officer the declaration published under Section would be valid That is how this Court construed the order of <ORG> giving liberty to the <ORG> to proceed further in accordance with law This was done with a view to avoid further delay and ensure expeditious conclusion of the proceedings This Court found that there was nothing to indicate in the order of <ORG> stipulating or extending the time for passing the award that beyond the time so permitted Page it cannot be done at all and the authorities are disabled once and for all even to proceed in the matter in accordance with law if it is so permissible for the authorities under the law governing the matter in issue Notwithstanding the statutory period fixed further time came to be granted due to intervention of <ORG> proceedings in which a direction came to be issued to proceed in the matter afresh as directed by the <ORG> apparently applying the well settled legal maxim Actus curiae neminem gravabit an act of the <ORG> shall prejudice no man We have therefore no doubt in holding that so far as the acquisition of the lands belonging to Palam Potteries is concerned the proceedings lapsed for failure of the Collector to make an award within the prescribed period of limitation under Section A of the Act Before parting with this matter we may notice the fact that in the award made by the Collector three khasra numbers belonging to the appellant were not included However in view of the fact that we have reached the conclusion that the acquisition proceeding as against the lands of the appellant lapsed for failure to make an award within the period prescribed by Section A of the Act this aspect of the matter lose its significance Civil Appeal arising out of SLP No of is allowed and it is declared that the award made by the Collector on March was barred by limitation prescribed by Section A of the Act and as such the acquisition proceeding in relation thereto lapsed on February which was the last date for making the award Parties shall bear their own costs
