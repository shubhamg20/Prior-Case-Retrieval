The question involved in this petition is whether certain reliefs in the plaint should be valued for <ORG> fee purposes under Section iv A as for cancellation of an instrument During the lifetime of <NAME> he had executed on the th May a mortgage in favour of the fifth defendant of item in the plaint schedule He had also executed in favour of the sixth defendant on the th August a mortgage of items to It is contended by the learned Counsel for the petitioner that the principle has been well settled that where the plaintiff is not a party to an instrument he need not ask for its cancellation and where he contends that the same is not valid or binding on him he is entitled to ignore it or merely state that it is not valid and binding on him The second contention is that the mortgagee plaintiff for all practical purposes a representative in interest of the mortgagor and all the transactions binding upon him or to which he was a party are binding upon the mortgagee and hence the mortgagee should be deemed to be a party to all these transactions and in that view he must avoid these various documents by getting them cancelled before he can get any relief free from these encumbrances The plaintiff has set out the various transactions and the circumstances in which according to him they were brought about and he wanted to clear up certain clouds that may arise when at a later stage he seeks to execute the decree which he hopes to obtain in the present suit Turning to the main point in the case as to whether in the circumstances it was necessary for the plaintiff to ask for the cancellation of the various mortgages and sales referred to in the plaint and whether even in the absence of any such express relief asked for the plaint should be construed as one asking in substance for such relief the matter is covered by a series of decisions of various Courts it was held that if a person not having authority to execute a deed or having such authority under certain circumstances which did not exist executes a deed it is not necessary for persons who are not bound by it to sue to set it aside they may treat it as non existent and sue for their right as if it did not exist These two cases were referred to by a Full Bench of this Court in <NAME> <NAME> I Mad where after adverting to the observations of <ORG> referred to above the learned Chief Justice said In such cases even if the plaint contains a prayer for a declaration or cancellation there is good reason for holding it to be one for a purely incidental but unnecessary relief As I have indicated here is no such prayer in the plaint and in the light of the principles explained there is no justification for implying them and then demanding a fee for it I may point out here that in the present plaint there is no prayer for a declaration or cancellation and on the basis of the observations of the learned Chief Justice it has to be said that there is no justification for implying those prayers in the plaint and then demanding a fee for them Two more decisions of this Court may be referred to in this connection Wadsworth had to consider the case of a creditor who brought a suit under Section of the Transfer of Property Act for a declaration that an alienation made by a debtor was void against the creditors It was held that that was not a suit for the cancellation of a document securing money or property falling under Section iv A of the Court Fees Act but that it was a suit for a declaration where no consequential relief was prayed Referring to a certain part of the judgment of <NAME> it was pointed out by <NAME> that in all cases of decrees or voidable deeds it may be proper to hold that those are sought to be avoided and the suit is in substance a suit for cancellation of the decree or deeds even though it may be framed as a suit for a declaration but there is an exception to the general rule with regard to deeds which were intended to be inoperative and were not intended to be anything more than scraps of paper and as such had no legal effect The trend of decisions is therefore clearly to the effect that unless the plaintiff is a party to a particular document and he cannot get the relief he seeks without avoiding that document it being an insuperable obstacle in his way it is unnecessary for him to seek the cancellation of the document and any relief he may otherwise ask for on the basis that the document was not intended to be acted upon and was inoperative cannot in substance and in effect be treated as a relief for cancellation within the meaning of Section iv A of the Court Fees Act The costs of this petition will abide the result of the suit
