In this reference under Section of the Income tax Act at the instance of the Commissioner of Income tax the following two questions have been referred to this court for the assessment year Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the assessee can claim as deduction the provision for payment of leave salary in the year under consideration The claim of the assessee for the deduction of the said amount under Section A of the Act has been negatived by the Income tax Officer on the ground that the said loss was capital and not revenue in nature because the loss arose in making instalment payments of the purchase price of the machineries which were capital assets of the assessee There is no dispute that the loss relates to capital in the sense that in respect of certain loans which were to be repaid by the assessee they were incurred in acquiring capital assets and the loss arose The decision in <ORG> has no application as it is a case of loss on devaluation In that case the <ORG> has taken the view that foreign loans were obtained by the assessee in the course of business which were ultimately utilised for the purchase of plant and machinery It is his contention that in the instant case whatever extra payment in terms of rupees was made by the assessee must be taken to be an unavoidable expenditure in connection with the loan He has relied on various decisions in support of his contention There is no doubt that the amount of was a revenue receipt in the assessee business of commission agency But in our opinion the fact that the assessee kept the money there does not make any difference especially as we have pointed out when it was a new transaction which the assessee entered into the transaction being the first step in the acquisition of capital goods In that case the assessee entered into an agreement on December with an Italian company for the purchase of machinery at the total value working out to Rs The agreement further provided that the Italian company should draw bills of exchange on the assessee which were to be accepted by the assessee and payments of which were to be guaranteed by <ORG> The agreement also provided for payment in terms of British sterling calculated at the prevalent exchange rate between sterling and the dollar and if there should be variation in the exchange rate the same should be separately settled with credit notes in rupees or in lire in favour respectively of the Italian company or the assessee as the case may be Similarly the assessee had to pay a larger amount on account of fluctuations in exchange rate in respect of other instalments in At page the court referred to the object of the Finance Bill which introduced Section A The proposed Section A in substance secures that where an assessee had acquired any capital asset from a country outside India for the purposes of his business or profession on deferred payment terms or against a foreign loan before the date of devaluation of the rupee the additional rupee liability incurred by him in meeting the instalments of the cost of the asset or of the foreign loan as the case may be falling due for payment after the date of devaluation will be allowed to be added to the original actual cost of the asset for the purpose of calculating the allowance on account of depreciation in computing the profits for the assessment year and subsequent assessment years Similar increase in the original actual cost will be allowed to be made in respect of the capital assets acquired by the assessee to be used in scientific research related to the class of business carried on by him or patent rights or copyrights acquired from abroad or any capital asset acquired by a company for the purpose of promoting family planning amongst its employees The proposed section also secures that where there is a decrease in the rupee liability of the assessee in respect of assets acquired by him from abroad due to a change in the exchange value of the rupee the original actual cost of the asset will be correspondingly reduced Before we deal with that aspect of the matter we must refer to Section which uses a non obstante clause of STC That apart even if Article continues the pre Constitution laws of taxation that provision is expressly made subject to the other provisions of the Constitution The expression subject to conveys the idea of a provision yielding place to another provision or other provisions to which it is made subject In either view the result is the same namely that at any rate during the period covered by the agreement the States ceased to have any power to impose the tax in respect of works contracts Another significant fact has to be borne in mind that Sub section of Section A deals with the expression acquisition which deals with the situation where there is a change in the valuation of foreign currency after acquisition In the instant case we are concerned with the question whether Section was at all meant for dealing with the case where there is no question of installation involved but only acquisition was the relevant fact CIT ITR and at page observed as follows In so far as the decision took the view that in respect of all devaluation cases irrespective of whether the stipulated payment in the matter of foreign currency should be made under Section A alone with great respect we are unable to agree and we prefer to adhere to the former view of <ORG> and the other view of <ORG> as mentioned hereinbefore But since no such situation arises in the cases of development rebate which is granted once and for all the said provision has not been made applicable to the computation of development rebate Having regard to the principles laid down by the aforesaid decisions we are unable to accept the contention of Mr <NAME> There is no qualitative difference in the additional expenditure incurred due to the devaluation or fluctuation in the rate of exchange Although in that case the court was concerned with a case of devaluation the principles laid down therein will equally apply to a case like this where the additional liability arises because of fluctuation in the rate of exchange This case has no application to the facts of this case as the extra expenditure was not incurred to obtain the loan It is at the point of repayment of the loan that the assessee has to provide an extra amount in rupees by reason of the fluctuation in the rate of exchange Thus in the instant case also the extra expenditure incurred by the assessee would be towards the cost of plant and machinery and accordingly it will be on capital account We therefore answer the first question by saying that the additional expenditure incurred by reason of exchange fluctuation was capital expenditure Now we shall take up the second question Rule A further provides that without prejudice to the aforesaid general provisions for encashment of leave the management shall have the right at its sole discretion to permit encashment of any number of days of accumulated privilege leave not exceeding days in cases like marriage sickness accident or other special circumstances beyond reasonable control of the person concerned like refusal of leave by the management etc It is also an admitted position that prior to the year under consideration the assessee was claiming the deduction in the matter of payment on account of privilege leave when the same was encashed on retirement or on the termination of the services of the employees in a particular year The claim of the assessee for the deduction of the said amount had been negatived by the Income tax Officer on the ground that the liability is a contingent liability The Tribunal upheld the contention of the assessee and inter alia observed as follows No doubt in the past the assessee was claiming the deduction only to the extent to which the said privilege leave was encashed by an employee on retirement or on termination of his service yet that is not conclusive on the subject It has been contended by Mr <NAME> with reference to the leave rules that the liability accrues to the assessee for payment of leave wages as soon as leave under the rules has become due to the employees The management shall have the right at its sole discretion to permit encashment of any number of days of accumulated privilege leave not exceeding days Mr <NAME> has also drawn our attention to Rule which is in the following terms For the purpose of leave encashment the leave record will be completed immediately after the end of every calendar year or financial year of the company and the benefit of unavailed or accumulated leave if any shall be given as per these Rules in the succeeding calendar year or financial year as the case may be He has also submitted that out of the provision made leave salary would be paid to the employees If leave is due to a person he has the option either to accumulate the leave or he may avail of the leave If he does not he will be entitled to the benefit of encashment of the leave He has relied on several decisions in support of his contention being the amount set apart as a reserve fund in its balance sheet for the payments it may have to make to its workers in the next year on account of holiday wages under Section of the Factories Act It was held that the liability that rests on the employer to pay a worker wages in accordance with Section for leave period remains a contingent liability which the employer may or may not be called upon to discharge That being so any sum set apart by an employer in any year for meeting the contingency of some of his workers going on leave the next year cannot be regarded as a permissible expenditure under Section xv of the Indian Income tax Act The liability under Section of the Factories Act to pay holiday wages depends on the arising of circumstances specified therein and since they may or may not arise the liability is only a contingent and uncertain liability which may or may not have to be discharged of ITR It should be clear from what I have stated above that such statutory liability for holiday wages as the Factories Act creates is only a contingent liability which may or may not have to be discharged and secondly the measure of that liability can never be known in advance It cannot be so known because it cannot be known in advance how many employees will avail themselves of how many holidays and when and necessarily at what rate holiday wages would be payable In those circumstances it is perfectly clear that not only is the amount claimed not allowable as an item of expenditure because in fact no expenditure had been incurred and not a pica had gone out of the funds of the company but also that the amount does not even represent a certain liability which will have to be discharged in any event It may be that although a particular amount is not actually expended during the currency of a particular accounting year the assessee will still be entitled to a deduction if a certain liability for its payment has arisen so that it may be said that the expenditure is as good as made The amount claimed in the present case is certainly not even of that character and as I have already pointed out it is not an amount which was actually spent for payments it may have to make to its workers in the next year on account of holiday wages under Section of the Factories Act and claimed deduction in respect of that amount on the footing that it had incurred a liability to pay leave wages to its employees in the year of account The principles which have been laid down in those cases in our opinion would equally apply to the facts of this case It cannot be ascertained with any certainty whether in a particular year the employees would go on leave or the leave would be granted to them The liability will only arise when a person goes on leave and it is only for that particular month or months he is on leave the leave wages are payable There the assessees were partners of a firm which was engaged in the business of processing and exporting cashew kernels For the assessment year relevant to the valuation date December the assessees claimed deduction in respect of the amounts payable by the firm by way of leave with wages in calculating their interest in the firm for purposes of wealth tax Hence these were amounts in the nature of debts which could be taken into account for computation under the Wealth tax Act It is therefore clear that there is no obligation on the employer to pay the leave wages irrespective of the number of days worked by the employee as in the Kerala case <ORG> held that if the liability is properly ascertainable and if it is possible to arrive at its discounted present value even if the liability is a contingent liability it can be taken into account He will only be entitled to encash such accumulated leave when he retires or his services are terminated or determined The second question is therefore answered in the negative and in favour of the <ORG>
