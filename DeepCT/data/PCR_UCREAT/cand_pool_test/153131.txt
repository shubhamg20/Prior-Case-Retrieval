In that suit the parties entered into a compromise and based on that compromise the Court passed a decree directing the respondent herein to deliver possession of the property by th March and also to pay past and future rents The learned Judge inter alia observed as follows The right given to a tenant by Section of the Act is a substantive right and there is nothing in the Act to indicate that it is retrospective in the application Therefore there can be no question of applying the provisions of the Act so as to hold that the order of delivery passed against the appellant is wrong If that is so it is for the appellant to ask the <ORG> which is threatening to evict him to stay his hands whether it is bound to do so or not is not a matter on which I am expressing any opinion not to come in appeal against an order which is perfectly proper and legal Apparently the view taken by the learned District Judge was that Section of the Madras Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act would not make the original order for possession ipso facto invalid but it might be that the judgment debtor could object to actual eviction in pursuance of the order After the dismissal of his appeal the respondent filed an application A No of on th July for Stay of execution The ground taken by the respondent was that the Rent Control Act had been extended to the village in which the property was situated on and from th June and therefore the decree holder legal representative could not evict him Against this order of the District Munsif the respondent filed an appeal A No of which was heard and disposed of by the learned Subordinate Judge of Tiruchirapalli He dismissed the appeal on the ground that Section of the Act would not apply to pending execution proceedings that is to say to the prior execution petition wherein an order for eviction had already been passed From this order the respondent preferred an appeal to this Court A No of which came up for decision before <NAME> The only question argued before him was whether the Rent Control Act whose application had been extended to the village in which the property was situated only on th June would prevent the eviction of <NAME> except in accordance with Section of that Act The learned Judge therefore allowed the appeal and dismissed the execution petition filed by the decree holder legal representative but granted leave to file a Letters Patent Appeal Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the appellant contended relying upon the well known rule against implying retrospective operation of statutes that Section of the Act would only apply to decree passed in suits filed after the passing of the Act In this case admittedly the decree was passed long before the Act and even an execution petition had been filed before the Act came into force We cannot agree with this contention of learned Counsel for the appellant Na authority has been cited to us for this extreme position that Section would not apply except to decrees passed in suits filed after the passing of the Act that a provision similar to Section of the Act of might bar the eviction of a tenant in execution of a decree passed in a suit filed before the concerned statute On th July Clause of the Madras Non Residential Buildings Rent Control Order was amended and when so amended the clause ran as follows A tenant in possession of a non residential building shall not be evicted therefrom whether in execution of a decree or otherwise except in accordance with the provisions of this clause It was contended before <ORG> that the moment a person files a suit he obtains thereby a vested right to have applied not only to the suit but to all execution proceedings also the law relating to execution as it existed at the time of filing the suit The learned Judges had no difficulty in rejecting this contention as they were not aware of any such principle They found no reason to think that if a new law is introduced restricting the right to execute execution proceedings can nevertheless be instituted if such a right existed on the date of the filing of the suit No doubt there is a reference to pending proceedings in one part of the judgment but it was not necessary to deal with the point because they held that during the interval between the passing of the decree and the filing of the execution petition there was no pending proceeding The basis of the decision is certainly against the view that Clause would not affect pending proceedings The learned Judge took the view that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to invoke the new provision and construe it to operate retrospectively In the concluding portion of his judgment there are certain observations which really are pertinent for the disposal of this case namely If and when an application for possession comes before the Controller the Controller should apply his mind to the circumstances actually and presently before him to enable him to make or refuse an order and it would be for one side or the other to point out that the application for ejectment had lost its force owing to the fact that since the application has been made difficulties which were then not in existence had arisen or difficulties that were in existence had disappeared understood this passage thus It is seen from this passage that the learned Judge far from thinking that the landlord had by the institution of his application for possession in the Sub Court acquired an absolute right to physical possession contemplated proceedings before the rent controller in which it would be contended by the tenant that in view of the new legislation actual possession could not be given This appeal arises out of an execution petition filed on th July of by the legal representative of <NAME> There was no doubt a prior execution petition filed by <NAME> himself and an order for eviction but admittedly the respondent had not been evicted in pursuance of that order That admittedly was filed after the Rent Control Act had come into operation in the village in which the property was situated By the date of the filing of the present execution petition the Act had come into force In our opinion there is no substance in the contention of learned Counsel for the appellant Once a decree is passed we can see no difference on principle between a decree passed on a compromise and a decree passed after contest Mr <NAME> sought to raise a new point which was not raised by him in the Courts below and not even in the memorandum of appeal namely that as the respondent had obtained a stay of the order for delivery passed by the learned District Munsif of Tiruchirapalli on th April on the misrepresentation that the Rent Control Act had been extended to the suit village he was disentitled to any relief based on the provisions of the Act We do not have the order of stay passed by the learned District Judge nor a copy of the affidavit filed by the respondent in support of his application
