The appellant filed a writ petition in contending that The Consolidation Officer was not appointed till after the repartition was concluded that he could not be appointed retrospectively that he had no legal authority when he commenced the proceedings and therefore the scheme was invalid and the scheme amounted to acquisition by the <ORG> within the meaning of the second proviso to Art A the expression must have the same meaning as it has in Art But on the facts of this case the beneficiary of the modification of rights was neither the <ORG> nor the <ORG> and therefore there was no acquisition by the <ORG> within the second proviso To this protection there is an exception namely the second proviso under which land under the personal cultivation of any estate holder of any kind which is within the ceiling limit applicable to him shall not be acquired unless the market value of the land is given as compensation The word acquisition used in the proviso must take its colour from the same word used earlier in the same Article and not from the word as used in an earlier article in juxtaposition with the word requisition What is small is vague and uncertain and the safer rule is that if the land of the tenant cultivating it is below the ceiling fixed by law and if a portion of it is acquired no matter for what purpose the acquisition takes place compensation at a rate not lower than the market value must be paid to him Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated October of <ORG> in Civil Writ No of was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> dismissing a petition filed by the appellant under art Section of the Act provides for the appointment of a Consolidation Officer and the preparation of a scheme by him On March <NAME> appellant before us filed the petition under art In <ORG> as before us it was urged on behalf of the appellant that there could be no retrospective appointment of a Consolidation Officer and Compensation must be I lid to the appellant for the land reserved in the scheme for various purposes in accordance with the second proviso to art It seems to us clear that before a person can start acting as a Consolidation Officer lie must be appointed a such Before he is appointed he has no authority to exercise any of the functions of a Consolidation Officer Notwithstanding anything contained in article no law providing for a the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article article or article Provided that Provided further that where any law makes any provision for the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation it shall not be lawful for the <ORG> to acquire any portion of such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land building or structure provides for payment of compensation at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof All citizens shall have the right to acquire hold and dispose of property No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate A Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property It seems to us that there is this essential difference between acquisition by the <ORG> on the one hand and modification or extinguishment of rights on the other that in the first case the beneficiary is the <ORG> while in the latter case the beneficiary of the modification or the extinguishment is not the <ORG> For example suppose the <ORG> is the landlord of an estate and there is a lease of that property and a law provides for the extinguishment of leases held in an estate It means that the law must make a provision for the acquisition by the <ORG> of an estate A It is urged on behalf of the respondents before us that the expression acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate in art In these cases this Court had given a wide meaning to the word acquisition He further observed at I prefer to follow the view of the majority of the <ORG> because it seems to me that it is more in consonance with juridical principle that possession after all is nine tenths of ownership and once possession is taken away practically everything is taken away and that in construing the Constitution it is the substance and the practical result of the act of the <ORG> that should be considered rather than its purely legal aspect Each case must depend on its own facts Let us now see whether the other part of the second proviso throws any light on this question Secondly the proviso says that not only the land exempted from acquisition should be within the ceiling limit but it also must be under personal cultivation But the question still remains whether even if a wider meaning is given to the word acquisition what has been done by the scheme and the In other words does the scheme only modify rights or does it amount to acquisition of land The scheme is not part of the record but it appears that Pukhta of land was owned by <ORG> prior to consolidation which was used for common purposes Rule ii of the Punjab Holdings Consolidation and Prevention of Fragmentation Rules provides In an estate or estates where during consolidation proceedings there is no shamlat Deh land or such land is considered inadequate land shall be reserved for the village <ORG> and for other common purposes under section of the Act out of the common pool of the village at a scale prescribed by Government from time to time The management of such land shall be done by the <ORG> of the estate or estates concerned on behalf of the village proprietary body and the panchayat shall have the right to utilise the income derived from the land so reserved for the common needs and benefits of the estate or estates concerned The <ORG> will manage it on behalf of the proprietors and use it for common purposes it cannot use it for any other purpose On the facts of this case it seems to us that the beneficiary of the modification of rights is not the <ORG> and therefore there is no acquisition by the <ORG> within the second proviso In this view of the matter it is not necessary to deal with the fourth point raised by the learned counsel for the appellant because it does not matter whether the acquisition is complete or not as even if we hold that the acquisition is not complete and it has yet to be completed the second proviso to art Hidayatullah This is an appeal against the judgment and order of <ORG> October dismissing a petition under Arts He challenged the consolidation mainly on two grounds which alone were pressed before us in this appeal We see no reason to differ Section gives powers to appoint a Consolidation Officer It is true that the original order appointing <NAME> was not produced but there is a presumption that he must have been so appointed because he would not act without a proper appointment As we do not entertain the objection we do not consider that question As regards the second point it may be pointed out that on an earlier occasion the Consolidation Act was challenged as ultra vires the Constitution inasmuch as it sought to deprive the landholders of their property and Art The question that remains is whether the appellant who is a small landholder holding land within the ceiling and has lost some of it is entitled to compensation at market rate as required by the second proviso to Art Section of the Consolidation Act empowers <ORG> to make rules for carrying out the purposes of the Act and in particular to provide for the manner in which the area is to be reserved under section and the manner in which it is to be dealt with and also the manner in which the village abadi is to be given to proprietors and non proprietors including scheduled castes Sikh backward classes artisans and labourers on payment of compensation or otherwise In furtherance of this power two rules have been framed which are numbered i and ii The management of such land shall be done by the <ORG> of the estate or estates concerned on behalf of the village proprietary body and the <ORG> shall have the right to utilize the income derived from the land so reserved for the common needs and benefits of the estate or estates concerned The sub rule was however saved by the second amending Act which gave legal cover to the sub rule by including a definition of common purpose to the following effect bb Common purpose means any purpose in relation to any common need convenience or benefit of the village and includes the following purposes i extension of the village abadi ii provide income for the Panchayat of the village concerned for the benefit of the village community iii village roads and paths village drains village wells ponds or tanks village water courses or water channels village bus stands and waiting places manure pits hada rori public latrines cremation and burial grounds Panchayat Ghar Janj Ghar grazing grounds tanning places mela grounds public places of religious or charitable nature and iv schools and playgrounds dispensaries hospitals and institutions of like nature water works or tube wells whether such schools play grounds dispensaries hospitals institutions waterworks or tube wells may be managed and controlled by <ORG> or not As soon as a scheme comes into force the management and control of all lands assigned or reserved for common purposes of the village under section a in the case of common purposes specified in sub clause iv of clause bb of section in respect of which the management and control are to be exercised by <ORG> shall vest in <ORG> and in the case of any other common purpose shall vest in the panchayat of that village and the State Government or the <ORG> as the case may be shall be entitled to appro I Punjab Section lays down how the Panchayat is to deal with the matters and provides as follows All lands vested in a panchayat by virtue of the provisions of this Act shall be utilised or disposed of by the panchayat for the benefit of the inhabitants of the village concerned in the manner prescribed No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixed the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate A Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property Saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates etc Notwithstanding anything contained in article no law providing for a the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate or of any rights therein or the extinguishment or modification of any such rights or shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by article article or article Provided further that where any law makes any provision for the acquisition by the <ORG> of any estate and where any land comprised therein is held by a person under his personal cultivation it shall not be lawful for the <ORG> to acquire any portion of such land as is within the ceiling limit applicable to him under any law for the time being in force or any building or structure standing thereon or appurtenant thereto unless the law relating to the acquisition of such land building or structure provides for payment of compensa tion at a rate which shall not be less than the market value thereof A he is entitled to compensation because land under his personal cultivation is an estate and land within the ceiling limit cannot be acquired without payment of compensation which is less than the market value of his land notwithstanding any law enabling acquisition of land for the <ORG> It submits that by the former there is a change of ownership and by the latter a change in possession or enjoyment without a change in ownership This contrast the <ORG> seeks to establish from the way in which the words acquisition and requisition and acquired and requisitioned are used in juxtaposition in the two Articles We have therefore to examine the scheme of the two Articles to see if they throw any light upon the matter begins by laying down in clause that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law and goes on to say in cl that no property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for public purpose and save by authority of law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given This clause says that where a law does not provide for the transfer of ownership or right to possession of any property to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his property This means that property shall not be considered to be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned unless the law provides for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession to the <ORG> or to a corporation owned or controlled by the <ORG> Therefore a law providing for the transfer of ownership or right to possession to <ORG> is for the purposes of Art A and a law providing for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of the property The conclusion is thus drawn that inasmuch as the second proviso speaks of acquisition and not requisition it cannot apply to the case of the appellant and persons like him who are still regarded as owners of the lands although they may be deprived of the immediate right to possession by the handing over of land to the <ORG> for management We cannot accept this argument Article A deals with a special subject namely the saving of laws providing for acquisition of estates This article saves any law from an attack under Arts To this protection there is only one exception and that is to be found in the second proviso The word acquisition used in the proviso must take its colour from the same word used earlier and not from the word as used in the earlier article in juxtaposition with the word requisition In the present case bits of properties are being taken from the lands belonging to the appellants and others and are thrown in a common lot The only obligation thrown on the <ORG> is that the income arising from such land should be utilized for the common benefit not only of the proprietors but also of non proprietors in the <ORG> area A bymaking out a case of modification of rights when there is in realityan acquisition mainly for the sake of avoiding compensation We would therefore reject the plea that we should ignore these small bits of land especially as they will be used for the general good and will confer some benefit also upon those who will lose them We would accordingly allow the appeal with costs ORDER In accordance with the Opinion of the majority Civil Appeal No of is dismissed without costs
