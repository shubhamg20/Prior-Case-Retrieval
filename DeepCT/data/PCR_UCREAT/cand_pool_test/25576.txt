There is an essential distinction between a law and a rule of construction ii On a question of construction of a statute no rational distinction can be made between the trading and non trading activities of the <ORG> iii There is nothing in the Act to indicate that the <ORG> should be excluded from the purview of requiring the taking out of a licence on payment of the prescribed fee and providing the remedy for the recovery of fee in face of default There is no reason to hold that the rule which previously applied to the interpretation of a statute ceased to apply on the date on which the Constitution came into force This being so there is no reason to suppose that a Statute which was framed on the basis of a well settled rule of pre Constitution days which accorded the <ORG> a special treatment in the matter of interpretation There is no express reference to the <ORG> nor is there anything peculiar in the nature purpose and object or in the language used in the enactment relating to the issue of licences which may suggest that the <ORG> must by necessary implication be bound by its provision with the direction that when realized it should be paid to the <ORG> There a Bench of Judges unanimously held that there was nothing in the Constitution which prevented <ORG> from departing from a previous decision of its own if it was satisfied of its error and of its baneful effect on the general interests of the public In this case as we are satisfied that the said rule of construction is inconsistent with our republican polity and if accepted bristles with anomalies we have no hesitation to reconsider our earlier decision That was law applicable to India also as authoritatively laid down by <ORG> in the case referred to above I A it law in force under Art of the Constitution must be interpreted as including the common law of England which was adopted as the law of this country before the Constitution came into force In our country the Rule of Law prevails and our Constitution has guaranteed it by the provisions contained in Part III thereof as well as by other provisions in other Parts It is to my mind inherent in the conception of the Rule of Law that the State no less than its citizens and others is bound by the laws of the land When the King as the embodiment of all power executive legislative and judicial has disappeared and in our republican Constitution sovereign power has been distributed among various organs created thereby it seems to me that there is neither justification nor necessity for continuing the rule of construction based on the royal prerogative The conflict between the two views expressed by the learned Judges in the earlier decision mainly rests on the meaning of the expression law in force in Art While <NAME> took the view that the common law of England including the rule of construction was accepted as the law of this country and was therefore the law in force within the meaning of the said Article <NAME> took the view that whatever might be said of the substantive laws a rule of construction adopted by the common law of England and accepted by <ORG> at a time when the <ORG> was functioning in India was not the law in force within the meaning of the said Article The prerogative right can be taken away by law because the law is made by the <ORG> with the assent of the Lords and the <ORG> It can be taken away only by law to which the <ORG> is a party at page thus It is presumed that the legislature does not intend to deprive the <ORG> of any prerogative right or property unless it expresses its intention to do so in explicit terms or makes the inference irresistible There is an essential distinction between a substantive law and a rule of construction and that is well expressed by <NAME> in his book On Statute Law th <ORG> It is well known that the Common law of England was applied as such in the original sides of <ORG> Bombay and Madras and that in the mofussil courts the principles embodied in the common law were invoked in appropriate cases on the ground of justice equity and good conscience It cannot therefore be posited that either the entire body of common law of England relating to prerogatives of the King or even the rule of construction as forming part of that law was accepted as law in every part of the country In that case the question was whether the <ORG> was not bound by and of the City of Bombay Municipal Act which gave the Municipality power to carry water mains for the purposes of water supply through across or under any street and into through or under any land whatsoever within the city Ultimately setting aside the order of <ORG> <ORG> held that the rule that no statute bound the <ORG> unless the <ORG> was expressly or by necessary implication made bound thereunder applied to the <ORG> in India and that there was no such express intention or necessary implication in the said section Indeed <ORG> also accepted that principle but on the construction of the relevant provisions it came to the conclusion that there was such a necessary implication thereunder On the application of the principle there was no contest before <ORG> There was no mention of <ORG> in the said section No doubt the Court re stated the said rule of construction and came to the conclusion that by necessary implication the <ORG> was bound by the said provision What is more Act XI of empowered the Governor General in Council by order to prohibit the levy by a Municipal Corporation of any specified tax payable by the Secretary of <ORG> for India and to direct the Secretary of <ORG> for India to pay to <ORG> in lieu of such tax some definite amounts This Act was a pointer against the contention that there was a presumption in favour of the <ORG> that a statute was not binding on it It is true that there are other Acts where there are specific provisions to the effect that the provisions of the Acts shall be binding on the <ORG> see of the Arbitration Act Act of of the Oil Field Regulation and Development Act Act LIII of Subsequent to the making of the Constitution also there were Acts where such a provision was found There is no firm legislative practice based upon the said presumptive rule of construction It only shows that wherever an exemption was intended to be given to the <ORG> it was expressly mentioned and wherever there might have been any doubt of the liability of the <ORG> it was expressly made liable The suit was dismissed on the ground that the sovereign immunity in suits for injunction or for specific performance was based upon public policy But it was argued that the principle of sovereign immunity was an archaic hangover not consonant with modern morality the majority conceded that there was substance in such a viewpoint as applied to suits for damages We have already noticed the decision in another context That apart in the mofussil some principles of Common Law were invoked by courts on the ground of justice equity and good conscience One decision even questioned its correctness There is nothing to show that it was applied in other parts of the country on the ground of justice good con In Calcutta there was a conflict one Bench accepted the construction and the other rejected it Let us now proceed on the assumption that it has been accepted as a rule of construction throughout India This leads us to the question whether the said rule of construction is the law of the land after the Constitution came into force all the laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of this Constitution shall continue in force therein until altered or repealed or amended by a competent <ORG> or other competent authority it has been held by this court that the said expression includes not only enactments of the Indian <ORG>s but also the Common Law of the land which was being administered by the Courts in India There is an essential distinction between a law and a canon of construction The next question is whether this Court should adopt the rule of construction accepted by <ORG> in interpreting statute vis a vis the <ORG> There are many reasons why the said rule of construction is inconsistent with and incongruous in the present set up we have no <ORG> the archaic rule based on the prerogative and perfection of the <ORG> has no relevance to a democratic republic it is inconsistent with the rule of law based on the dictrine of equality the General Act in different ways some applying the presumption and some ignoring it There is therefore no justification for this Court to accept the English canon of construction for it brings about diverse results and conflicting decisions This natural approach avoids the archaic rule and moves with the modern trends Such an Act provided it does not infringe fundamental rights will give the necessary relief to the <ORG> It was contended that as the infringement of the said provision entailed a prosecution and on conviction imposition of fine and imprisonment and that as the <ORG> could not obviously be put in prison and as the fine imposed on the <ORG> would merge in the consolidated fund of the <ORG> it should necessarily be implied that the <ORG> was outside the scope of the section Under the Act there is a distinction between fines imposed under and under of the Act In respect of such offences it may be contended that as the fines paid reach the <ORG> itself there is an implication that the <ORG> is not bound by the sections mentioned therein for a person who receives the fine cannot be the same person who pays it But the same cannot be said in respect of the provisions covered by But it will be noticed that this section only confers a discretionary power on the court and the court is not bound to direct the imprisonment of the defaulter There are other ways of collecting the money from persons against whom an order under A is not made The Corporation contends that since India became a Republic the rule that Crown is not bound by statute unless specially named or clearly intended has no application to the interpretation of the Calcutta Municipal Act III <ORG> at Calcutta was enjoined to apply in the determination of actions against the Indian inhabitants of the town in matters of succession and inheri tance to lands rents goods and in all matters of contract and dealing between party and party their personal law if both parties belonged to the same community and by the law and usages of the defendant if they belonged to different communities By cl in respect of suits tried in exercise of the extraordinary original jurisdiction and by cl in respect of the appellate jurisdiction <ORG> were directed to apply law or equity and the rule of good conscience which the Court in which the proceeding was originally instituted would have applied <NAME> who delivered the judgment of the <ORG> after an exhaustive review of the earlier authorities observed The King by his prerogative regularly is to be preferred in payment of his duty or debt before any subject although the King debt or duty be the latter In that case the inhabitants of a village sued to establish their right of grazing their cattle on certain <ORG> land and for an injunction restraining the <ORG> from interfering with their right It was held by <ORG> that the right of free pasturage which the plaintiffs enjoyed did not necessarily confer that right on any particular piece of land and that of the Limitation Act of did not bind the Secretary of <ORG> In the first case the Secretary of <ORG> was held not bound by ss and of the Bombay City Municipal Act which deal with levelling metalling or paving sewering draining channelling and lighting of private streets and with execution of that work to the satisfaction of the Commissioner if the work be not done in accordance with the requisition and for recovery of the expenses incurred in that behalf <ORG> is it may be recalled seeking to collect the license fee by prosecuting the State of West Bengal but the primary purpose of the prosecution is to enforce compliance with the pro visions relating to the conduct of a market by compelling the State to take out a license and paying a fee in lieu of services rendered to the owners of the markets Again in considering the limited question as to the application of the rule of interpretation under discussion it would be an idle exercise to enter upon a detailed discussion of the prerogatives which have and which have not been assimilated in our system of law It excludes from the operation of statutes all public servants acting under the authority of the <ORG> When a statute expressly includes the <ORG> in its operation no difficulty arises in giving effect to the statute It was urged that in the Act there are certain provisions which expressly refer to the liability of the <ORG> and the binding character Bom This is not an unfamiliar argument but as has been said many times such provisions may often be inserted in one part of an Act or in a later general Act ex abundanti cautela and so far as the Act of is concerned it is fallacious to argue that the legislature which passed it must have had in mind the particular sections of the Act of which are not under review or that it was impliedly interpreting those sections The origin of the rule undoubtedly was in the prerogative of the <ORG> but there is even in the country of its origin authority for the view that the rule is regarded primarily as one of construction In <ORG> <NAME> in dealing with the question whether the immunity of the <ORG> from taxation depends on the construction of the statute or arises from the prerogative in some other way Lord <NAME> observed Whatever ideas may once have prevailed on the subject it is in my opinion today impossible to uphold the view that the <ORG> can find in the prerogative an immunity from tax if the statute in question according to its true construction includes the <ORG> amongst those made liable to the tax it imposes Is there any reason then to hold that on January the rule which previously applied to interpretation of statutes ceased to apply thereto on the date on which the Constitution came into force The rule of interpretation was as already stated a settled rule and was law in force in the territory of India within the meaning of Art There is no warrant for holding that a rule of interpretation which is incorporated in a statute The Indian Succession Act or the General Clauses Act is law in force and not a rule which was enunciated by the highest Court in the realm It was said by counsel for the <ORG> that it is one of the fundamental principles of our Constitution that there is equality between the <ORG> and the citizens and discrimination is not permissible in the application of a law generally expressed There is no reason however to assume that the <ORG> under a democratic Constitution would be impervious to public opinion and would merely because it is not bound by a regulatory Act perpetuate a nuisance I do not think that the guarantee of the equal protection clause of the Constitution extends to any differential treatment which may result in the application of a special rule of interpretation between the <ORG> and the citizens The political set up is indisputably changed but can it be said that our concept of a <ORG> is so fundamentally altered that the traditional view about <ORG> privileges immunities and rights must be abandoned because they had a foreign origin an on the supposed theory of equality between the <ORG> and the citizens a theory which seeks to equate common good of the people represented by the <ORG> with the rights and obligations of the individual the <ORG> should decline to give effect to the <ORG> privileges and immunities If it be granted that the <ORG> in making laws is entitled to select itself for special treatment different from the treatment accorded to the citizen and it is not denied that in order to achieve public good it can do so even if there is a differential treatment between the <ORG> and the citizen is there any reason to suppose that a statute which evidently was framed on the basis of the well settled rule of the pre Constitution days which accorded to the <ORG> a special treatment in the matter of interpretation of statutes must be deemed to have a different meaning on the supposition that the Constitution has sought to impose equality between the <ORG> and the citizen The fact that in our federal set up sovereignty is divided between the <ORG> and the <ORG>s and in the application of the rule that the <ORG> is not bound by a statute unless expressly named or clearly implied conflicts between the <ORG> enacting a law and the <ORG> or another <ORG> may arise does not give rise to any insuperable difficulty which renders the rule in applicable to the changed circumstances for it is the <ORG> which enacts a legislation in terms general which alone may claim benefit of the rule of interpretation and not any other <ORG> Where however the <ORG> is following a commercial or trading activity the rule can have no application Assuming that conducting a market in a metropolitan town may be regarded in a sense as a trading activity there is in my judgment no sufficient reason to justify any distinction in the application of the rule of interpretation to statutes concerning sovereign authority and trading activity But there is no express reference to the <ORG> nor is there anything peculiar in the nature purpose and object or in the language used in the enactment relating to the issue of licenses which may suggest that the <ORG> must by necessary implication be bound by its provisions I am therefore of the view that <ORG> was in error in holding that the <ORG> of West Bengal was bound by the provisions relating to the issue of licenses for occupation or conduct of a market It has been said that the reason of the rule is that it is inferred prima facie that the law made by the <ORG> with the assent of the Lords and the <ORG> is made for the subjects and not for the <ORG> per <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> Two rules follow from the proposition that the law is prima facie made for subjects and not for the <ORG> i the <ORG> is not bound by a statute save by express words or by necessary implication ii that the <ORG> may take advantage of a statute though not bound by it unless expressly or impliedly prohibited from doing so In spite of this modem disguise there is high authority for the view that this immunity is still based upon the prerogative and of the Report But it seems to be contended both here and below that there is something in the law incapacitating aliens which makes it so to speak of necessary application wheresoever the sovereignty of the <ORG> is established as if it were inherent in the nature of sovereign power Mines of precious metals treasuretrove royal fish are all vested in the <ORG> for the purpose of maintaining its power and enabling it to defend the State At Common law no proceedings civil or criminal were maintainable against the Sovereign in person for it was said that as the Courts were her own they could have no jurisdiction over her see Halsbury Law of England Vol When there is a failure of heirs on a person dying intestate the <ORG> had the prerogative right to take his property by escheat and this right was said to rest on grounds of general or universal law see <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> Secretary of State for India The right of the Government to take the property by escheat or lapse on the failure of heirs or as bona vacantia for want of a rightful owner is recognised by Art To appreciate these rulings it is necessary to remember that until there were constitutional restrictions on the power of the Indian legislature to affect the prerogative of the Crown see Statutes and William cap In order to invoke this doctrine the <ORG> must establish that it has some prerogative right which it claims to be outside the purview of the statute But there is high authority for the view that such an exemption is allowed to the <ORG> in England on the basis of a rule of construction <NAME> and <NAME> said If the maxim on which the counsel for the <ORG> relies applies to this country and the <ORG> is not bound by the provisions of any Act unless they are expressly declared binding on the <ORG> it may be inferred from the circumstance that this Act contains provisions prescribing a Limitation to the Government for the institution of suits and presentation of criminal appeals that the <ORG> contemplated that the <ORG> should be subject to the provisions of the Act and should enjoy a privilege to the extent expressed and no further expressum facit cessare tacitum In the last two cases the <ORG> did not apply the strict English rule that the <ORG> under the prerogative was not bound by the statute of limitation see Bank Voor Handel Hungarian Administrator In <NAME> <NAME> Sargent <NAME> was inclined to apply the English rule that the <ORG> is not included in an Act unless there are words to that effect and to hold that the Government was not bound by of the Indian Limitation Act Sir <NAME> reviewed the earlier cases and decisively rejected the general claim of immunity of the <ORG> from a statute imposing a tax on the basis of any prerogative right or supposed rule of construction They said It is contended that the maxim of English law that the <ORG> cannot be bound by any statute unless expressly named therein applies and reference is made to the cases of <NAME> Putaya <NAME> The Secretary of <ORG> for India <NAME> This decision was reversed by <ORG> on appeal in <ORG> case They held that the strict English rule of construction exempting the <ORG> from the operation of statutes applied in the case of Indian legislation <NAME> however said Had the question been res integra and had it been open to us to consider the question untrammelled by a decision of <ORG> we might have considered the reasonableness and propriety of applying the principles as enunciated by <ORG> and also how far they should be applied to Indian conditions This decision was reversed in The Director of Rationing and Distribution case and a majority of a Bench of this Court held that the law was correctly laid down in the Province of Bombay case and continued to apply in this country even after the Constitution came into force and the State was not bound by a of the Calcutta Municipal Act <NAME> dissented and held that the rule laid down by the <ORG> did not apply to the construction of Indian statutes after the Constitution came into force Before there was no settled course of decisions of <ORG> necessitating or justifying the application of this rule to the construction of Indian statutes Artificial rules of Common Law based on feudal notions had no application in India There is no compelling reason why the <ORG>s in India should not give full effect to the general words of a statute on the basis of some artificial rule of construction prevailing in England Some of these Acts are modelled on English statutes which contain similar provisions Many Acts like the Code of Civil Procedure and the Indian Contract Act make special provisions for the <ORG> in respect of particular matters on the assumption that in respect of all other matters the <ORG> will be bound by the general provisions of the Act On a question of construction of a statute no rational distinction can be made between the trading and non trading activities of the <ORG> There is no ground for presuming that the <ORG>s are excluded from the scope of a general taxing statute enacted by <ORG> or that the <ORG> is outside the purview of the general words of a taxing statute enacted by a <ORG> legislature It would be the law in force because it would limit and control the operation of the existing Indian Act But we have ample power to say that this rule was not in force in India and the Indian law was not correctly laid down by <ORG> in the Province of Bombay case and the decisions which followed it There is no presumption that the provisions of an Act do not bind the <ORG> using the expression <ORG> in a compendious sense as including the <ORG> and the <ORG>s Section exempts certain carriages and animals belonging to the <ORG> from payment of tax on carriages and animals Prima facie the two provisions apply to all persons including the <ORG> <ORG> There is no reason why the <ORG> <ORG> like any other person should not take out a license and pay the prescribed fee if it chooses to exercise or carry on a trade and why it should not be punished with fine under if it chooses to carry on a trade without taking a license The general provisions of must be read subject to the special provisions of and the fine realisable under is receivby the Municipality There is nothing to indicate that the <ORG> <ORG> should be excluded from the purview of and Section provides the remedy for the recovery of the fee in case of default in taking out the license and payment of the fee But there is no reason why should not be applied to the <ORG>
