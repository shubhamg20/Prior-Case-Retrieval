calculated on the aggregate of the total income returned and the income disclosed in the application as if such aggregate were the total income iii if the proceeding pending before <ORG> is in the nature of a proceeding for reassessment of the applicant under section or by way of appeal or revision in connection with such reassessment and the applicant has not furnished a return in respect of

Commissioner and on the basis of the materials contained in such report and having regard to the nature and circumstances of the case or the complexity of the investigation involved therein <ORG> may by order allow the application to be proceeded with or reject the application Provided that an application shall not be rejected under this sub section unless an opportunity has been given to the applicant of being heard Provided further that the Commissioner shall furnish the report within a period of forty five days of the receipt of communication from <ORG> in case of all applications made under Section on or after the st day of July and if the Commissioner fails to furnish the report within the said period <ORG> may make the order without such report If <ORG> is satisfied on an

that sub section it may extend the time for payment of the amount which remains unpaid or allow payment thereof by instalments if the assessee furnishes adequate security for the payment thereof After examination of the records and the report of the Commissioner received under sub section and the report if any of the Commissioner received under sub section and after giving an opportunity to the applicant and to the Commissioner to be heard either in person or through a representative duly authorised in this behalf and after examining such further evidence as may be placed before it or obtained by it <ORG> may in accordance with the provisions of this Act pass such order as it thinks fit on the matters covered by the application and any other matter relating to the case not covered by the application but referred to in the report of the Commissioner under sub section or sub section Every order passed under sub section shall provide for the terms of settlement including any demand by way of tax penalty or interest the manner in which any sum due under the settlement shall be paid and all other matters to make the settlement effective and shall also provide that the settlement shall be void if it is subsequently found by <ORG> that it has been obtained by fraud or misrepresentation of facts If <ORG> is of the opinion the reasons for such opinion to be recorded by it in writing that for the proper disposal of the case pending before it it is necessary or expedient to reopen any proceeding connected with the case but which has been completed under this Act by any income tax authority before the application under section was made it may with the concurrence of the applicant reopen such proceeding and pass such order thereon as it thinks fit as if the case in relation to which the application for settlement had been made by the applicant under that section covered such proceeding also Powers and procedure of <ORG> In addition to the powers conferred on <ORG> under this Chapter it shall have all the powers which are vested in an income tax authority under this Act Where an application made under section has been allowed to be proceeded with under section <ORG> shall until an order is passed under sub section of section have subject to the provisions of sub section of that section exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the powers and perform the functions of an income tax authority under this Act in relation to the case Notwithstanding anything contained in sub section and in the absence of any express direction to the contrary by <ORG> nothing contained in this section shall affect the operation of any other provision of this Act requiring the applicant to pay tax on the basis of self assessment in relation to the matters before <ORG> For the removal of doubt it is hereby declared that in the absence of any express direction by <ORG> to the contrary nothing in this Chapter shall affect the operation of the provisions of this Act in so far as they relate to any matters other than those before <ORG> Every order of settlement passed under sub section of section shall be conclusive as to the matters stated therein and no matter covered by such order shall save as otherwise provided in this Chapter be reopened in any proceeding under this Act or under any other law for the time being in force Liability to pay advance tax arises under section It requires tax to be paid during the financial year Thus section defines liability to pay advance tax in respect of incomes referred to in section However section provides that where advance tax paid is less than of the assessed tax but the assessee has paid tax under section A or otherwise before the date of completion of regular assessment then the interest shall be limited to the interest on the shortfall between the assessed tax and the advance tax paid for the period from the first April next following the financial year up to date of payment under section A plus interest on the shortfall between assessed tax and total tax paid for the period from the day following the date of such payment under section A up to the date of regular assessment Coming to section A as a result of the amendment of section A by Direct Tax Laws Amendment Act and vide Finance Act of the assessee is required to calculate the tax payable on the basis of the return to be furnished under section or under section or under section after taking into account the amount of tax paid under the Act to calculate also interest payable under section A or under section for any default or delay in payment of advance tax to pay such tax with interest before the assessee furnishes his return Prior to section A a inter alia provided that where the total income as a result of any adjustments made exceeded the total income declared in the return by any amount then it was open to the A to increase the amount of tax payable under section by additional income tax calculated at the specified rate Section deals with advance payment of taxes Section inter alia provides that every person who is liable to pay interest under Section shall of his own accord pay on each of the due dates specified in section the appropriate percentage of advance tax on his current income calculated in the manner under section Under section where in any financial year an assessee who is liable to pay advance tax under section fails to pay such tax or where the advance tax paid under section is less than of the assessed tax the assessee shall pay interest from the first day of April next following such financial year to the date of determination of total income under section or to the date of regular assessment on the amount equal to the assessed tax which has been defined in Explanation to mean tax on the total income as determined under section as reduced by the amount of tax deducted at source in accordance with Chapter XVII on income which is subject to deduction and which is taken into account in computing total income Under section A the applicant is required to pay the additional amount of income tax payable on the income disclosed in the application within days of the receipt of the copy of the order passed by <ORG> under section allowing such application to be proceeded with Under section on compliance of sections A and and on examination of relevant records and reports <ORG> may pass such orders as it thinks fit on the matters covered by the application and any other matter relating to the case referred to in the report of the Commissioner of Income Tax Section comes into operation when there is default in payment of advance tax whereas liability to pay interest under section arises when the additional amount of income tax is not paid within time specified under section A To this extent we agree with the view expressed in <ORG> case supra If one reads section with section I it becomes clear that every order of settlement passed under section shall be final and conclusive as to the matters contained therein and that the same shall not be re opened except in the case of fraud and misrepresentation Under section in addition to the powers conferred on <ORG> under Chapter XIX A it shall also have all the powers which are vested in the income tax authority under the Act Under section it is clarified that nothing in Chapter XIX A shall affect the operation of any other provision of the Act requiring the applicant to pay tax on the basis of self assessment in relation to matters before <ORG> Thus when we read the provisions of Sections and one has to keep in mind various above provisions of the Act and the concepts of self assessment assessment regular assessment and computation of total income which have been engrafted in Chapter XIX A Our detailed analysis shows that though Chapter XIX A is a self contained Code the procedure to be followed by <ORG> under sections and in the matter of computation of undisclosed income in the matter of computation of additional income tax payable on such income with interest thereon the filing of settlement application indicating the amount of income returned in the return of income and the additional income tax payable on the undisclosed income to be aggregated as total income shows that Chapter XIX A indicates aggregation of incomes so as to constitute total income which indicates that the special procedure under Chapter XIX A has inbuilt mechanism of computing total income which is nothing but assessment computation of total income Under the Act tax is payable on the total income as computed in accordance with the provisions of the Act Thus the special procedure under sections and in Chapter XIX A shows that a special type of computation of total income is engrafted in the said provisions which is nothing but assessment which takes place at section stage Similarly it is clarified vide sub section to section A that interest payable under section for default in payment of advance tax shall be computed on an amount equal to the assessed tax same words are used in section or on the amount by which the advance tax falls short of the assessed tax Under section the assessee has to mention in his settlement application the additional amount of tax payable by him on such undisclosed income Thus the two provisos to section show that Chapter XIX A which prescribes a special procedure for assessment by settlement contemplates a pre assessment collection of tax With the filing of the settlement application and after such application is allowed to be proceeded with under section intimation under section regular assessment under sections and re assessment under section lose their existence as under sections A and it is only the income disclosed in the return of income before the A alone which survives for consideration by <ORG> for settling the amount of income which is not disclosed in the return There is one more way of looking at the Act As stated above section provides for expeditious recovery of tax by way of pre assessment collection The question is what happens in cases where of the assessed tax is paid but on the basis of the <ORG> order under section the advance tax paid turns out to be less than of the assessed tax as defined in the Explanation to Section Thus there is no provision under Chapter XIX A or even under section A dealing with self assessment to charge interest beyond the date of application for settlement after the same is admitted by the <ORG> under Section Moreover as stated above under the Act there is a difference between assessment in law regular assessment or assessment under section and assessment by settlement under Chapter XIX A The jurisdiction of the <ORG> to proceed commences only after an order is passed under section Once the case stands admitted the <ORG> shall have exclusive jurisdiction to exercise the powers of <ORG> This further supports our view that there are two distinct stages under Chapter XIX A and that the <ORG> has not contemplated the levy of interest between order under section stage and section stage The point to be noted is that in computation of additional income tax payable by the assessee there is no mention of section Under section the <ORG> is given the power to rectify but no such power is given to the <ORG> The Schedule of Chapter XIX A does not contemplate invocation of section otherwise there would be no finality to the assessment by settlement which is different from assessment under Chapter XIV where there is an appeal revision etc It is only after <NAME> case that the law got settled that the nature and the character of the interest was compensatory and mandatory and that the <ORG> had no such power There is one more reason for this Reference In the case of <C<ORG>ION> ITR a Judge Bench of this Court by majority held that where upon the Order of the <ORG> under section there arises a deficit in the payment of advance tax under section the end point or the terminus of the period for which interest has to be paid under section on the deficit is the date on which the <ORG> passes the order under section On the same day the same Bench in the case of <ORG> supra held that interest charged under section becomes payable on the income disclosed in the return and the income disclosed before the <ORG> that such interest is chargeable till the <ORG> acts in terms of section and that after the <ORG> allows the application for settlement to be proceeded with there will be no further charge of interest under section Thus even on the question of terminus there was lot of controversy and in the circumstances we are of the view that invocation of section held to be inapplicable to Chapter XIX A proceedings cannot be justified
