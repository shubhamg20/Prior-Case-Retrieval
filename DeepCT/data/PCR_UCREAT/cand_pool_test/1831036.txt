Article <ORG> order for fresh poll in entire constituency If could be challenged in a writ petition HEADNOTE Article of the Constitution provides that notwithstanding anything in the Constitution no election to either <ORG> or to the <ORG> or either <ORG> of the Legislature of a State shall be called in question except by an election petition presented to such authority and in such manner as may be provided for by or under any law made by the appropriate legislature The respondents in reply urged that <ORG> had no Jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition in view of Art <ORG> dismissed the writ petition holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition On the question of application of principles of natural justice it was contended on behalf of the respondents that the tardy process of notice and hearing would thwart the conducting of elections with speed that unless civil consequences ensued hearing was not necessary and that the right accrues to a candidate only when he is declared elected and lastly the decision of the <ORG> is only provisional and that it is he the election court which is the final authority on the subject If what is impugned is an election the ban operates provided the proceeding calls it in question or puts it issue not otherwise Articles and take care of the set of laws and rules making provisions with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections The Act provides for only one remedy and that remedy being by an election petition to be presented after the election is over there is no remedy provided at any of the intermediate stages These rights can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made they do not supplant the law of the land but supplement it What particular rule of natural justice should apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that case the framework of the law under which the inquiry is held and the constitution of the tribunal or body of per sons appointed for that purpose Further even if a power is given to a body without Specifying that rules of natural justice should be observed in exercising it the nature of the power would call for its observance There might be exceptional cases where to decide a case exparte would be unfair and it would be the duty of the <ORG> to take appropriate steps to eliminate unfairness The appellant has a right to have the election conducted not according to humour or hubris but according to law and justice A The case of <NAME> in which this <ORG> held that it was not necessary to give an opportunity to the candidates for an examination as to why the whole examination should not be cancelled because the examination was vitiated by adoption of unfair means on a mass scale But the ratio of that decision has no application to this case Therefore it all depends on the circumstances and is incapable of generalisation Article vests a wide power and where some direct consequence on candidates emanates from its exercise this functional obligation must be read into it a The contention that the <ORG> had no power to make the impugned order for a repoll in the entire constituency There are no limitations under Art Since the election covers the entireprocess from the issue of the notification under to the declaration of theresult under of the Act when a poll that has already taken place has been cancelled and a fresh poll has been ordered the order is passed as an integral part of the electoral process A a There is no foundation for a grievance that the appellants will be without any remedy if their writ application is dismissed If there is any illegality in the exercise of the power under this Article or under any provision of the Act there is no reason why iv should not be attracted It will be open to <ORG> to pass any ancillary or conse quential order to enable it to grant the necessary relief provided under the Act The pre eminent position conferred by the Constitution on this <ORG> under Article of the Constitution does not envisage that this <ORG> should lay down the law in an appeal like this on any matter which is required to be decided by the election court on a full trial of the election petition without the benefit of the opinion of the Punjab and Haryana High <ORG> which has the exclusive jurisdiction under A of the Act to try the election petition It is stated by the appellant that when counting in all the assembly segments was completed at the respective segment headquarters copies of the results were given to the candidates and the local tally telephonically communicated to the returning officer respondent Later in the day the <ORG> issued an order which has been characterised by the appellant as a law less and precedentless cancellation of the whole poll acting by hasty hunch and without rational appraisal of facts Of course the <ORG> did not stop with the cancellation but followed it up a few days later with a direction to hold a fresh poll for the whole constituency involving all the nine segments although there were no complaints about the polling in any of the constituencies and the ballot papers of eight constituencies were available intact with the returning officer and only Fazilka segment ballot papers were destroyed or demanded on the way plus the postal ballots He concludes his affidavits that after taking all these circumstances and information including the oral representation of the st petitioner into account on nd Much itself I passed the order cancelling the poll in the said Parliamentary constituency ELECTION COMMISSION OF INDIA New Delhi Dated March Chaitra SAKA NOTIFICATION Whereas <ORG> has received reports from the Returning Officer of Ferozepore Parliamentary Constituency that the counting on March was seriously disturbed by violence that the ballot papers of some of the assembly segments of the Parliamentary constituency have been destroyed by violence that as a consequence it is not possible to complete the counting of the votes in the constituency and the declaration of the result cannot be made with any degree of certainty And whereas the <ORG> is satisfied that taking all circumstances into account the poll in the constituency has been vitiated to such an extent as to effect the result of the election Now therefore the <ORG> in exercise of the powers vested in it under Article of the Constitution Section of the Representation of the People Act and all other powers enabling it so to do cancels the poll already taken in the constituency and extends the time for the completion of the election up to April by amending its notification No dated February in respect of the above election as follows In clause of item i of the said notification relating to the completion of election a in the existing item i after the words State of Jammu and Kashmir the words and Ferozepur Parliamentary constituency in the State of Punjab shall be inserted and The existing item ii shall be renumbered as item iii and before the item iii as so renumbered the following item shall be inserted namely iii April Saturday as the date before which the election shall be completed in Ferozepur Parliamentary constituency in the State of Punjab He was met by the objection successfully urged by the respondents and that <ORG> had no jurisdiction in view of Article of the Constitution and the <ORG> had acted within its wide power under Article and fairly Holding that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition The doubly damnified appellant has come up to this Court in appeal by special leave We may here draw attention to the observations of <NAME> in <NAME> Public orders publicly made in exercise of a statutory authority cannot be construed in the light of explanations subsequently given by the officer making the order of what he meant or of what was in Ms mind or what he intended to do Public orders made by public authorities are meant to have public effect and are intended to effect the actings and conduct of those to whom they are addressed and must be construed objectively with reference to the language used in the order itself Moreover the scope of any actual investigation in the event of controversion in any petition under Article is ordinarily limited and we have before us an appeal from <ORG> dismissing a petition under Article on the score that such a proceeding is constitutionally out of bounds for any court having regard to the mandatory embargo Indeed we should have expected <ORG> to have considered the basic jurisdictional issue first and not last as it did and avoided sallying forth into a discussion and decision on the merits self contra dicting its own holding that it had no jurisdiction even to entertain the petition And before an election machinery can be brought into operation there are three requisites which require to be attended to namely there should be a set of laws and rules making provisions with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections and it should be decided as to how these laws and rules are to be made there should be an executive charged with the duty of securing the due conduct of elections and there should be a judicial tribunal to deal with disputes arising out of or in connection with elections And when a dispute is raised as regards the validity of the election of a particular candidate the authority entrusted with the task of resolving the dispute must necessarily exercise a judicial function for the process consists of ascertaining the facts relating to the election and applying the law to the facts so ascertained We may therefore have to study the scheme of Therefore it is essential that courts adjudicating upon election controversies must play a verily active role conscious all the time that every decision rendered by the Judge transcends private rights and defends the constituency and the democracy of the country So we have to adopt the law and develop its latent capabilities if novel situations as here are encountered If what is impugned is an election the ban operates provided the proceeding calls it in question or puts it in issue not otherwise also may be extracted at this star At the conclusion of the trial of an election petition <ORG> shall make an order a dismissing the election petition or declaring the election all or any of the returned candidates to be void or declaring the election of all or any of the returned candidates to be void and the petitioner or any other candidate to have been duly elected So we will address ourselves to the meaning of meanings the values within the words and the project unfolded And if this act or step were to be shielded by the constitutional provision what is an aggrieved party to do This takes us to the enquiry about the ambit of of the Act and the object of Art The appellant nomination for election to <ORG> was rejected by the Returning Officer and so he hurried to <ORG> praying for a writ of certiorari to quash the order of rejection without waiting for the entire elective process to run its full course and at the end of it when the results also were declared to move the election tribunal for setting aside the result of the election conducted without his participation be that any matter which has the effect of vitiating an election should be brought up only at the appropriate stage in an appropriate manner before a special tribunal and should not be brought up at an intermediate stage before any court It seems to me that under the election law the only significance which the rejection of a nomination paper has consists in the fact that it can be used as a ground to Call the election in question If the grounds on which an election can be called in question could be raised at an earlier stage and errors if any are rectified there will be no meaning in enacting a provision like Article and in setting up a special tribunal Any other meaning ascribed to the words used in the article would lead to anomalies which the Constitution could not have contemplated one of them being that conflicting views may be expressed by <ORG> at the pre polling stage and by the election tribunal which is to be an independent body at the stage when the matter is brought before it Election disputes were also to be provided for by laws made under Article The scheme of the Act enacted by <ORG> was also set out by <NAME> Part VI deals with disputes regarding elections and provides for the manner of presentation of election petitions the constitution of election tribunals and the trial of election petitions part VII outlines the various corrupt and illegal practises which may affect the elections and electoral offences Obviously the Act is self contained enactment so far as elections are concerned which means that whenever we have to ascertain the true position in regard to any matter connected made thereunder Section provides that no civil court shall have jurisdiction to question the legality of any action taken or of any decision given by the Returning Officer or by any other person appointed under this Act in connection with an election After pointing out that the Act in section and the Constitution in article speak substantially the same language and inhibit other remedies for election grievances except through the election tribunal the <ORG> observed That being so I think it will be a fair inference from the provisions of the Representation of the People Act to state that the Act provides for only one remedy that remedy being by an election petition to be presented after the election is over and there is no remedy provided at any intermediate stage There is a non obstante clause in Article and therefore Article stands pushed out where the dispute takes the form of calling in question an election except in special situations pointed out but left unexplored in Ponnuswami In conformity with this principle the scheme of the election law in this country as well as in England is that no significance should be attached to anything which does not affect the election and if any irregularities are committed while it is in progress and they belong to the category or class which under the law by which elections are governed would have the effect of vitiating the election and enable the person effected to call it in question they should be brought so before a special tribunal by means of an election petition and not be made the subject of a dispute before any court while the election is in progress After elaborately setting out the history in England and in India election legislation vis a vis dispute resolution <NAME> stated If the language used in article is considered against this historical background it should not be difficult to see why the framers of the Constitution framed that provi sion in its present form and chose the language which had been consistently used in certain earlier legislative provisions and which bad stood the test of time it seems to me that the word election has been used in Part XV of the Constitution in the wide sense that to say to connote the entire procedure to be gone through to return a candidate to the legislature That the word election bears this wide meaning wheneverwe talk of elections in a democratic country is borne out bythe fact that in most of the books on the subject and in several cases dealing with the matter one of the questions mooted is when the election begins The rainbow of operations covered by the compendious expression election thus commences from the initial notification and culminates in the declaration of the return of a candidate One interesting argument urged without success in <NAME> elicited a reasoning from the <ORG> which has some bearing on the question in the present appeal This meant that the Returning Officer could have no jurisdiction to decide the validity of a nomination although section of the Act conferred on him that jurisdiction The decision of this appeal however turns not on the construction of the single word election but on the construction of the compendious expression no election shall be called in question in this context and setting with due regard to the scheme of Part XV of the Constitution and the Representation of the People Act Evidently the argument has no bearing on this method of approach to the question posed in this appeal which appears to me the only correct method What emerges from this perspicacious reasoning if we may say so with great respect is that any decision sought and rendered will not amount to calling in question an election if it subserves the progress of the election and facilitates the completion of the election Thus there are two types of decisions two types of challenges The question immediately arises as to whether the relief sought in the writ petition by the present appellant amounted to calling in question the election We proceed on the footing that re poll in one polling station or it many polling stations for good reasons is lawful <NAME> contended that the <ORG> should not deny relief to a party in the area of elections which are the life breath of democracy and people power Article in our view operates in areas left unoccupied by legislation and the words superintendence direction and control as well as conduct of all elections are the broadest terms was a plenary power which enabled the <ORG> to act even in the absence of specific legislation though not contrary to valid legislation Indeed natural justice is a pervasive facet of secular law where a spiritual touch enlivens legislation administration and adjudication to make fairness a creed of life It has many colours and shades many forms and shapes and save where valid law excludes it applies when people are affected by acts of Authority It is the bone of healthy government recognised from earliest times and not a mystic testament of judge made law Indeed from the legendary days of <NAME> and of <NAME> Arthasastra the rule of law has had this stamp of natural justice which makes it social justice We need not go into these deeps for the present except to indicate that the roots of natural justice and its foliage are noble and not newfangled Today its application must be sustained by current legislation case law or other extant principle not the hoary chords of legend and history Our jurisprudence has sanctioned its prevalence even like the Anglo American system <NAME> speaking for a bench of five judges observed quoting for support Lord <NAME> in In re <NAME> an infant It is not necessary to examine these decisions as there is a great deal of fresh thinking on the subject These rules can operate only in areas not covered by any law validly made In other words they do not supplant the law of the land but supplement it What particular rule of natural justice should apply to a given case must depend to a great extent on the facts and circumstances of that case the framework of the law under which the enquiry is held and the constitution of the <ORG> or body of persons appointed for that purpose It is no table that <NAME> observed in <NAME> supra If the amending body really exercised judicial power that power was exercised in violation of the principles of natural justice of audi alteram partem Even if a power is given to a body without specifying that the rules of natural justice should be observed in exercising it the nature of the power would call for its observance Lord Morris of Borthy Gest in his address before the <NAME> club concluded We can I think take pride in what has been done in recent periods and particularly in the field of administrative law by invoking and by applying those principles which we broadly classify under the designation of natural justice Does natural justice qualify to be described as a majestic conception I believe it does Is it just a rhetorical but vague phrase which can I be employed when needed to give a gloss of assurance I believe that it is very much more If it can be summarised as being fair play in action who could wish that it would ever be out of action It denotes that the law is not only to be guided by reason and by logic but that its purpose will not be fulfilled if it lacks more exalted inspiration Once we understand the soul of the rule as fairplay in action and it is so We must hold that it extends to both the fields After all administrative power in a democratic set up is not allergic to fairness in action and discretionary executive justice cannot degenerate into unilateral injustice Nor is there ground to be frightened of delay inconvenience and expense if natural justice gains access The exceptions to the rules of natural justice are a misnomer or rather are but a shorthand form of expressing the idea that in those exclusionary cases nothing unfair can be inferred by not affording an opportunity to present or meet a case Text book excerpts and ratios from rulings can be heaped but they all converge to the same point that audi alteram partem is the justice of the law without of course making law lifeless absurd stultifying self defeating or plainly contrary to the commonsense of the situation We proceed on the assumption that even if the cancellation of the poll in this case were an administrative act that per se does not repel the application of the natural justice principle He pointed out what we have earlier mentioned that an election litigation is one in which the whole constituency of several lakhs of people is involved and if the Election <ORG> were under an obligation to hear affected parties it may logically have to give notice to lakhs of people and not merely to candidates It has been said that no army can be commanded by a debating society but it is also true that <ORG> did debate during the days of debacle and disaster agony and crisis of the Second World War the life and death aspects of the supreme command by the then British Prime Minister to the distress of all our friends and to the delight of all our foes too historic to be lost on jurisprudence emphasised that whatever standard of natural justice is adopted one A essential is that the person concerned should have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case <NAME> drove home this point when he observed in the Duke of Norfolk case supra There are no words which are of universal application to very kind of inquiry The requirements of natural justice must depend on the circumstances of the case the nature of the inquiry the rules under which the tribunal is acting the subject matter that is being dealth with and so forth But in the end the investigating body itself must come to its own decision and make its own report Secondly be submitted that there was no final determination to the prejudice of any party by directing a re poll since <ORG> had the last word on every objectionable order and so the <ORG> order was more or less provi sional Thirdly he took up the position that no candidate could claim anything more than an expectation or apes and no right having crystallised till official declaration of the result there was no room for complaint of civil consequence Even in <NAME> where all that was sought to be done was to see if there was a prima facie case to proceed with a tax case where inevitably a fuller bearing would be extended at a later stage of the proceedings Lord <NAME> We express no opinion on the factum or adequacy of the hearing but hold that where a candidate has reached the end of the battle and the whole poll is upset he has a right to notice and to be heard the quantum and quality being conditioned by the concatenation of circumstances Even he if punished has procedural rights in the zone of natural justice but not when the contract of employment is legally extinguished the <ORG> give an opportunity to all the candidates to represent their cases We think not It cannot hold a detailed quasi judicial inquiry with a right to its alumni to plead and lead evidence etc If there is sufficient material on which it can be demonstrated that the university was right in its conclusion that the examinations ought to be cancelled than academic standards require that the university appreciation of the problem must be respected Supposing wrong ballot papers in large numbers have been supplied or it has come to the notice of the <ORG> that in the constituency counterfeit ballots had been copiously current and used on a large scale then without reference to who among the candidates was more prejudiced the poll might have been set aside It all depends on the circumstances and is incapable of natural justice to argue that the whole constituency must be given a hearing Lastly it was contended by the learned Additional Solicitor General taking his cue from <NAME> that <ORG> direction for a re poll has only a provisional consequence since the election court was the ultimate matter of the destiny of the poll having power to review the decision of the <ORG> It is true that <NAME> deals with the assessment of the evidence at a preliminary state merely to ascertain whether there is a prima facie case Lord <NAME> said plainly that there was a difference It is very unusual for there to be a judicial determination of the question whether there is a prima facie case there is nothing inherently unjust in reaching such a decision i a prima facie decision in the absence of the other party Lord <NAME> however took the view that there was a residual duty of fairness in determining whether there is a prima facie case is itself the custodian of fairness nevertheless its discretion is open to review I do not forget the fact that it has been said that the rules of natural justice may apply to cases where the act in question is more properly described as administrative than or quasi judicial See <NAME> Baldwin and Secretary of <ORG> for Home Affairs The present case stands on a totally different footing For Lord <NAME> luminously illustrates the effect I would go so far with him as to say that in reaching a prima facie decision there is a duty on any tribunal to act fairly but fairness depends on the task in hand If the matter is so urgent that an order should be made forthwith before hearing the other side as in the case of an interim injunction or a stay of execution the court will make the order straight away We do it every day we are always ready of course to hear the other side if they apply to discharge the order It simply enables the inspector to raise an assessment by satisfying the commissioner that there are reasonable grounds for suspecting loss of tax resulting from neglect fraud or wilful default that is A that there is a prima facie probability that there has been neglect etc But at the same time they have taken an increasingly sophisticated view of what it requires in individual cases Lord <NAME> comment ran thus A tribunal to whom judicial or quasi judicial functions are entrusted is held to be required to apply those principles in performing those functions unless there is a provision to the contrary But where some person or body is entrusted by <ORG> with administrative or executive functions there is no presumption that compliance with the principles of natural justice is required although as <ORG> not to be presumed to act unfairly the courts may be able in suitable cases perhaps always to imply an obligation to act with fairness We consider it a valid point to insist on observance of natural justice in the area of administrative decision making so as to avoid devaluation of this principle by administrators already alarmingly insensitive to the rationale of audi alteram partem In his lecture on The Mission of the Law Professor <NAME> takes the principle that no man should suffer without being given a hearing as a cardinal example of a principle recognised as being indispensable to justice but which has not yet won complete recognition in the world of administration The goal of administrative justice can never be attained by necessarily sporadic and ex post facto judicial review A measure of the importance of resisting the incipient abnegation by the courts of the firm rule that branch of <ORG> invalidates is that if it gains ground the mission of the law is doomed to fail to the detriment of all But at the same time they have taken an increasingly sophisticated view of what is required in individual cases We have been told that wherever the <ORG> has intended a hearing it has said so in the Act and the rules and inferentially where it has not specificated it is otiose There was much argument about the guidelines in and A being applicable to an order for constituency wide repoll is a bar for intermediate legal proceedings calling in question the steps in the election outside the machinery for deciding election disputes He says that the Commissioner has no power to cancel the election to a whole constituency It is argued on behalf of the respondent that the expression non compliance as used in sub section would suggest the idea of not acting according to any rule or command and that the expression is not quite appropriate in describing a mere lack of qualification There is no material difference between non compliance and non observance or breach and this item in clause of sub section may be taken as a residuary provision contemplating cases where there has been infraction of the provisions of the Constitution or of the Act but which have not been specifically enumerated in the other portions of the clause We hold that it is perfectly permissible for <ORG> to decide the question as one falling under iv A presumatic view of the Act and Art We have given careful thought to this tragic possibility and are convincedindeed the learned Solicitor General has argued for upholding not subverting the rule of law and agrees that <ORG> has all the powers necessary to grant all or any of the reliefs set out in sec There is no dispute there cannot be If anything integrally linked up with and necessitated by the obligation to grant full relief has to be undertaken or ordered to be done by the election machinery all that is within the orbit of the Election <ORG> power Where a statute confers powers or duties in general terms all powers and duties incidental and necessary to make such legislation effective are included by implication Thus it has been stated An express statutory grant of power or the imposition of a definite duty carries with it by implication in the absence of a limitation authority to employ all the means that are usually employed and that are necessary to the exercise of the power or the performance of the duty A country school superintendent who was by statute given general supervisory power over a special election was permitted to issue absentee ballots The power to arrest has been held to include the power to take finger prints and take into custody non residents who were exempted from the provisions of a licensing statute The <ORG> may if necessary after setting aside the election of if there are good grounds therefore keep the case pending issue directions for getting available votes order recount and or partial re poll keep the election petition pending and pass final orders holding the appellant elected if only if valid grounds are established Firstly when <ORG> or any State <ORG> has made valid law relating to or in connection with elections the <ORG> shall act in conformity with not in violation of such provisions but where such law is silent Art The conspectus of provisions bearing on the subject of elections clearly expresses the rule that there is a remedy for every wrong done during the election in progress although it is postponed to the post election stage and procedure as predicated in Art <ORG> has under the various provisions of the Act large enough powers to give relief to an injured candidates if he makes out a case and such processual amplitude of power extends to directions to <ORG> or other appropriate agency to hold a poll to bring up the ballots or do other thing necessary for fulfilment of the jurisdiction to undo illegality and injustice and do complete justice within the parameters set by the existing law In the light of and conditioned by the law we have laid down we dismiss the appeal Each party Will bear his own costs We record our appreciation to the bar whose help goes a long way for the bench to do justice <ORG> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> dismissing the writ application of the appellant under Article of the Constitution He was made to sign a written report about the happenings to the Chief Election Commissioner respondent No There were complaints and allegations against him and after being apprised of the same the Chief <ORG>er of respondent No appointed <NAME> Under Secretary <ORG> as an Observer to be present at Ferozepore from March till March on which date the result was expected to be declared It may even be appropriate to quote the same <ORG> New Delhi Dated March <NAME> SAKA NOTIFICATION Whereas <ORG> has received reports from the Returning Officer of Ferozepur Parliamentary Constituency that the counting on March was seriously disturbed by violence that the ballot papers of some of the assembly segments of the parliamentary constituency have been destroyed by violence that as a consequence it is not possible to complete the counting of the votes in the constituency and the declaration of the result cannot be made with any degree of certainty And whereas the <ORG> is satisfied that taking all circum stances into account the poll in the constituency has been vitiated to such an extent as to effect the result of the election Now therefore the <ORG> in exercise of the powers vested in it under article of the Constitution Section of the Representation of the People Act and all other powers enabling it so That led to the writ application in <ORG> with prayer to issue a writ of certiorari calling forth the records for the purpose of quashing the impugned order and a writ of mandamus directing the Chief Election Commissioner and the Returning Officer to declare the result of the election alternatively a writ of mandamus directing the Chief Election Commissioner to act strictly in accordance with the provision of section A thus confining its directions in regard to postal ballot papers only Secondly the impugned order was violative of the principles of natural justice as no opportunity of a hearing was afforded to the appellant before passing the order <ORG> held that Article confers plenary executive powers on <ORG> and there were no limitations on the functions contemplated in Article <ORG> observed that the law framed under Article or Article was in aid of the plenary powers already conferred on <ORG> under Article and where the law so made under Article or Article omitted to provide for a contingency or a situation the said plenary executive power relating to conduct of elections conferred upon <ORG> by Article of the Constitution would become available to it and the <ORG> would be entitled to pass necessary orders in the interest of free and fair elections The <ORG> who is vested with the power of conducting the elections has still to hold the elections in accordance with the Act and the Rules as well as under the Constitution <ORG> also held that it bad no jurisdiction to entertain the writ petition in view This appeal has come up for hearing before this <ORG> on a reference by <ORG> as substantial questions of law have arisen as to the interpretation of the Constitution in particular Article and Article of the Constitution Originally there were only six articles in this Part opening with Article This Court observed Broadly speaking before an election machinery can be brought into operation there are three requisites which require to be attended to namely there should be a set of laws and rules making provisions with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections and it should be decided as to how these laws and rules are to be made there should be an executive charged with the duty of securing the due conduct of elections and there should be a judical tribunal to deal with disputes arising out of or in connection with elections Further below this Court observed as follows Obviously the Act is a self contained enactment so far as elections are concerned which means that whenever we have to ascertain the true position in regard to any matter connected with elections we have only to look at the Act and the rules made thereunder Lower down this Court further observed It is now well recognised that there a right or liability is created by a statute which gives a special remedy for enforcing it the remedy provided by that statute only must be availed of the Representation of the People Act to state that the Act provides for only one remedy that remedy being by an election petition to be presented after the election is over and there is no remedy provided at any intermediate stage In conformity with this principle the scheme of the election law in this country as well as in England is that no significance should be attached to anything which does not affect the election and if any irregu larities are committed while it is in progress and they belong to the category or class which under the law by which elections are governed would have the effect of vitiating the election and enable the person affected to call it in question they should be brought up before a special tribunal by means of an election petition and not be made the subject of a dispute before any court while the election is in progress This Court also explained the connotation of the word election in very wide terms as follows It seems to me that the word election has been used in Part XV of the Constitution in the wide sense that is to say to connote the entire procedure to be gone through to return a candidate to the legislature some of which may have an important bearing on the result of the process If the grounds on which an election can be called in question could be raised at an earlier stage and efforts if any are rectified there will be no meaning in enacting a provision like article and in setting up a special tribunal Any other meaning ascribed to the words used in the article would lead to anomalies which the Constitution could not have contemplated one of them being that conflicting views may be expressed by <ORG> at the pre polling stage and by the election tribunal which is to be an independent body at the stage when the matter is brought up before it The important question that arises for consideration is as to the amplitude of powers and the width of the functions which <ORG> may exercise under Article of the Constitution According to Mr <NAME> appearing on behalf of the appellants there is no question of exercising any powers under Article of the Constitution which in terms refers to functions under sub Article When appropriate laws are made under Article by <ORG> as well as under Article by the State <ORG>s the <ORG> has to act in conformity with those laws and the other legal provisions made thereunder That is why there is no hedging in Article There is however no doubt whatsoever that <ORG> will have to conform to the existing laws and rules in exercising its powers and performing its manifold duties for the conduct of free and fair elections He must lawfully exercise his power independently in all matters relating to the conduct of elections and see that the election process is completed properly in a free and fair manner The Chief Election commissioner has thus to pass appropriate orders on receipt of reports from the returning officer with regard to any situation arising in the course of an election and power cannot be denied to him to pass appropriate orders arbitrary or is otherwise invalid relates to the mode of exercising the power and does not touch upon the existence of the power in him if it is there either under the Act or the rules made in that behalf or under Article Whether the power is exercised in an arbitrary or capricious manner is a completely different question He points out that there is a clear provision under section of the Act for reordering of poll at a polling station Similarly under section A there is provision for declaring the poll at a polling station void when <ORG> is satisfied that there is destruction or loss etc It is therefore has argued that this is a case of complete lack of power of the <ORG> to pass the impugned order It is therefore not possible to accept the contention that the Election <ORG> has no power to make the impugned order for a repoll in the entire constituency Mr <NAME> submits that once the Presidential notification has been made it is left to the President alone to amend or alter the notification and power in an appropriate case may be exercised by the President in which case the action of the President wilt be on the advice of the <ORG> which will be responsible to the <ORG> He further submits that in an appropriate case the President may also promulgate an ordinance under Article i of the Constitution cancelling the poll in the entire constituency It is true that in exercise of powers under Article <ORG> cannot do something impinging upon the power of the President in making the notification under section of the Act We do not find any limitation in Article from which it can be held that where the law made under Article or the relevant rules made thereunder do not provide for the mechanism of dealing with a certain extraordinary situation the hands of <ORG> are tied and it cannot independently decide for itself what to do in a matter relating to an election it will be an exercise of power within the ambit of its functions tinder Article The submission that there is complete lack of power to make the impugned order under Article is devoid of substance The ancillary question which arises for consideration is that when <ORG> amended its notification and extended the time for completion of the election by ordering a fresh poll is it an order during the course of the process of election as that term is understood As already pointed out it is well settled that election covers the entire process from the issue of the notification under section to the declaration of the result under section of the Act When a Poll that has already taken place has been cancelled and a fresh poll has been ordered the order therefor with the amended date is passed as an integral part of the electoral process Even if it is a wrong order it does not cease to be an order passed by a competent authority charged with the conduct of elections with the aim and object of completing the elections Although that is not always decisive the impugned order itself shows that it has been passed in the exercise of power under Article and section of the Act This is nothing short of seeking to establish the validity of a very important stage in the election process namely the poll which has taken place and which was countermanded by the impugned order If for example the election court comes to the conclusion that the earlier poll has been wrongly cancelled or the impugned order of <ORG> is otherwise invalid it will be entitled to set aside the election on the basis of the fresh Poll and will have power to breathe life into the countermanded poll and to make appropriate directions and orders in accordance with law There is therefore no foundation for a grievance that the appellants will be without any remedy if their writ application is dismissed It has in fact been fairly conceded by counsel for the other side that the election court will be able to grant all appropriate reliefs and that the dismissal of the writ petition will not prejudice the appellants Indeed it has been brought to our notice that an election petition has been filed by the appellants ex abundanti cautela in <ORG> and Haryana challenging the election which has since been completed on the basis of a fresh poll ordered by the Election Commis sion Counsel submits that the only ground which can be said to be raised in the election petition in the present case is section iv namely non compliance with the provisions of the Constitution or of the Representation of the People Act or of any rules or orders made under that Act Ac cording to counsel there is no non compliance with Article of the Constitution as <ORG> has no power whatsoever to pass the impugned order under Article of the Constitution necessarily follows that if there is any illegality intile exercise of the power under Article or under any provision ofthe Act there is no reason why section iv should not be attracted to it Article provides that In doing so it will be open to <ORG> to pass any ancillary or consequential order to enable it to grant the necessary relief provided under the Act The pre eminent position conferred by the Constitution on this <ORG> under Article of the Constitution does not envisage that this <ORG> should lay down the law in an appeal like this on any matter which is required to be decided by the election court on a full trial of the election petition without the benefit of the opinion of the Punjab and Haryana High <ORG> which has the exclusive jurisdiction under section A of the Act to try the election petition But it has to be remembered that even for the purpose of deciding that question the parties may choose to produce evidence oral or documentary in the trial court We would also like to make it quite clear with all respect to the learned Judges who have delivered a separate judgment that we may not be taken to have agreed with the views expressed therein about the applicability of audi alteram partem or on the applicability of the guidelines in sections and A to the facts and circumstances of this case or the desirabi lity of ordering a repoll in the whole constituency or the ordering of a repoll of postal ballots etc The aggrieved party had all along a statutory right to call the entire election in question including the <ORG> order by an election petition under section of the Act for the trial of which an elaborate procedure has been laid down in the Act Then as has been stated there is also a right of appeal under the scales in considering at the trial of the election petition whether there may not be sufficient justification to negative the existence of any implied duty on the part of the <ORG> at that stage to hear any party before taking its decision to order or not to order a report As we find no merit in this appeal it is dismissed but in the circumstances of the case there will be no order as to the costs in this <ORG>
