This is an appeal under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act hereinafter called the Act from an award of <ORG> Indore In the meantime a passenger bus belonging to <NAME> appellant and driven by <NAME> respondent No came on the wrong side of the road and ran over the boy causing severe injuries to him which resulted in his instantaneous death The insurer with whom the owner was insured against third party risks also resisted the claim by a separate written statement Accordingly he made an award for Rs After stating the provisions contained in Sections and he says No motor vehicle can be used in a public place unless there is in force in relation to that use of that vehicle a policy of insurance complying with the requirements of Section These provisions ensure that third parties who suffer on account of the use of the motor vehicle would be able to get compensation for injuries suffered The emphasis is on compensation in respect of accidents of the nature specified in Sub section of Section arising out of the use of the motor vehicles The <ORG> is not concerned in any way with accidents arising out of the use of motor vehicles in relation to which there is no insurance policy against third party risks The expression the Claims <ORG> shall specify the amount which shall be paid by the insurer occurring in Section abundantly shows that in proceedings before the Claims <ORG> it is only the liability of the insurer that is determined and there is no question of determining the liability of any other person for payment of compensation This liability to pay compensation is independent of any negligence or wrongful act in the use of vehicle It is well settled that actions for money payable by terms of contract actions in quasi contract actions in equity and actions under statute are not actions for damages and are independent of any tort The total amount of compensation that an insured person can get is dependent not on the degree of negligence in the use of the vehicle or on the part of the person who has received an injury but is really dependent on the suffering caused to him the expenses incurred by him in treatment and on the loss of earning capacity after the accident Section does not in terms say that it is only when negligence on the part of the driver is established that compensation can be awarded The liability to pay compensation being thus absolute and statutory all that the claimant who has right to compensation has to establish is that the use of the vehicle insured against third party risks resulted in the death of or injuries to the person concerned Under Section of the Act an insurance company cannot raise a dispute about the quantum of compensation If the main contesting party before <ORG> is the insurance company and it can contest the claim only on the grounds specified in Section then it follows that the question of negligence in the use of the vehicle in no way enters in the determination or award of compensation by <ORG> It seems to us quite clear that the problem referred is solved as soon as the fundamental concept and incidents of motor vehicles insurance particularly insurance against third party risks are first borne in mind and then the provisions of the statute are examined to ascertain their object purpose and effect Even so the third party had no right under the law to obtain the benefit of the insurance For the sake of brevity we shall hereinafter use the word claimant for a third party injured in an accident arising out of a motor accident or his legal representative in the case of his death Section casts a duty on a person against whom the claim is made to give information as to insurance Section sets out the effect of a certificate of insurance Section is a substantive provision which declares the liability of the insurer to pay the claimant directly Secondly the section prescribes the limit of the insurer liability which does not exceed the sum assured payable under the policy as read with Section But if the sum specified in the insurance policy as payable thereunder exceeds the sum as fixed under Section the maximum liability shall be the sum specified in the policy One thing to be particularly noted is that the provisions of Section relate to the liability of the insurer which arises only when the insured has incurred liability but not independent of it It is thus seen from the above provisions that A claimant is entitled to recover from the insurer the amount of compensation which he is in law entitled to obtain from the insured subject to the statutory limits of liability of the insurer Prior to their enactment in every case a claimant had to sue the insured in <ORG> and notice had to be given to the insurer if the claimant desired to avail himself of the benefits of Section of the Act Section provides for the constitution of <ORG> and confers jurisdiction on it to adjudicate upon claims for compensation in respect of accidents involving death or bodily injuries to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles Section A provides for the procedure for setting up a claim for compensation Section relates to an award of <ORG> after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard and after enquiry into the claim Section deals with the procedure and powers of <ORG> Subject to any rules that may be made in that behalf the <ORG> may follow such summary procedure as it thinks fit Section provides for an appeal from the award made by <ORG> Section provides for recovery from the insurer of compensation money awarded by the <ORG> as arrears of land revenue Section excludes where <ORG> has been constituted for any area the jurisdiction of <ORG> to entertain any question relating to any claim for compensation which may be adjudicated upon <ORG> for that area <ORG> is debarred from issuing any injunction in respect of any action taken or to be taken by or before <ORG> in respect of a claim for compensation An award under Section has three components It determines the amount of compensation which appears to the <ORG> to be just it specifies the person or persons to whom compensation is to be paid and it specifies the amount which shall be paid by the insurer Now to specify the limit of liability of the insurer the <ORG> will have to go back to the substantive provisions contained in Section These provisions do not lay down the criteria or ingredients of liability which will entitle the claimant to compensation From the above resume of all the sections contained in Chapter VIII of the Motor Vehicles Act it must be said in short that Sections to provide for compulsory insurance of a motor vehicle before it can be used on a public road lay down the liability of the insurer to pay to the claimant directly when there is a decree or judgment of the <ORG> and also fix the limits of pecuniary liability of the insurer in certain cases Sections to lay down the procedure for enforcement of the substantive rights of the claimant as enlarged and circumscribed by Section As provided in Section <ORG> shall in its award determine the total amount of compensation and then specify the sum which shall be paid by the insurer Now the liability direct or vicarious of the owner of a motor vehicle involved in an accident resulting in injury to or death of a third party to pay damages arises from the law of torts In the former case the claimant has to obtain a decree for damages against the insured from <ORG> to be able to recover the amount from the insurer such a decree can be passed only if the insured is found liable directly or vicariously on the ground of negligence but not otherwise The insurer may resist the claim against him in two ways That the insurer is not liable although the insured may be liable and that the insurer is not liable because the insured is not liable Under the first head the insurer is entitled to escape liability by saying that the policy is void because it was obtained by the insured on a false representation or non disclosure of a material fact or that the policy was cancelled before the accident or that there has been a breach of a specified condition of the policy being one of the conditions enumerated in the section The insurer is debarred from raising any other ground of defence to avoid his liability if the insured is found to have incurred the liability Under the second head the insurer can plead that there was no negligence on the part of the insured to show that the insured incurred no liability so that the insurer liability under the contract of indemnity does not arise Section has nothing to do with the second head of defences All that Section does is that it debars the insurer from taking up any defence other than those enumerated in it to show that the insurer is not liable although the insured has incurred liability This position is plain enough and is fully supported by the following observations in AIR SC supra The insurer has the right provided he has reserved it by the policy to defend the action in the name of the assured and if he does so all defences open to the assured can then be urged by him and there is no other defence that he claims to be entitled to urge He can thus avoid all hardship if any by providing for a right to defend the action in the name of the assured and this he has full liberty to do The provisions contained in Sections to enact complete procedure for the trial of claims and determination of compensation The owner the driver and the insurer have to be impleaded as opposite party and notice has to be issued to them under Rule Similar provisions are made in the Rules made for instance in Delhi Bihar and Bengal But if the amount specified which shall be paid by the insurer is less than the amount of compensation so determined then necessarily it is the insured who has to pay the balance and no one else conceivably And if the only purpose was to determine such compensation as was payable by the insurer then the words determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just in Section would be otiose because then the only requirements of the award would have been to specify the person or persons to whom compensation shall be paid and to specify the amount which shall be paid by the insurer We have not the slightest doubt after a close examination of the scheme and the provisions of Chapter VIII that all claims by third parties against the insured as well as the insurer must be settled by <ORG> If <ORG> is not to determine the liability of the insured it must necessarily follow that the third party will have to sue the owner in the civil Court for that portion of the compensation money awarded by the <ORG> which the insurer is not liable to pay The object of introducing the provisions contained in Sections to was to provide a speedy and summary remedy to the third party It may be mentioned here that in introducing Bill No of of the Motor Vehicles Amendment Act No of in <ORG> <NAME> rendered the following Statement of Objects and Reasons The State Governments are being empowered to set up tribunals to determine and award damages in cases of accidents involving the death of or bodily injury to persons arising out of the use of motor vehicles and also to adjudicate on the liability of the insurer in respect of payment of damages awarded At present a <ORG> decree has to be obtained before the obligation of the insurance company to meet the claims can be enforced Sections and In a number of instances the Courts have given statutes an extended operation without express or clear authorization from the letter of the statute It will be observed that the effect of the statutes in those cases is closely related to the situations where a statute is extended or restricted by its equity or spirit This rule has become firmly established that an express grant of statutory power carries with it by necessary implication authority to use all reasonable means to make such grant effective Where a statute confers powers and duties in general terms all powers and duties incidental and necessary to make such legislation effective are included by implication The conclusions we have reached so far may now be stated Under the policy of insurance the insurer contracts to indemnify the insured against third party risks in case the insured is found liable to pay damages to a third party On the other hand if the insured is not liable to pay damages to the claimant there is no liability of the insurer to pay any compensation either in law or in equity There is no privity of contract between the insurer and the third party Nor is there any statutory liability of the insurer to pay compensation to the claimant merely because of use of the motor vehicle of the insured There are no provisions in the Motor Vehicles Act to hold the insurer liable to pay to the third party independent of the liability of the insured Sections to of the Act provide for compulsory insurance the right of the third party to claim directly from the insurer limits of liability of the insurer and the defences open to him to avoid liability even if the insured has incurred liability The insurer can in the name of the insured raise every such defence as the insured can raise including that there was no negligence provided he has reserved by the policy that right The claimant has the right to claim compensation not only from the insurer but also from the insured in a claim proceeding under Chapter VIII of the Act In that case the insured is bound by the award made under Section and is liable to pay the total amount of compensation determined in the award which for practical purposes means the total amount minus the amount specified as payable by the insurer The ultimate result is that there must be a finding of negligence of the insured which makes him liable in torts before compensation can be awarded to the claimant from the insurer under Section of the Motor Vehicles Act As this appeal itself not only the question has been referred to us we shall now proceed to decide it on merits There is no reason not to believe the ocular evidence of the claimant three witnesses Negligence is omission to do something which a reasonable man guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs would do or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do The principle is that there are certain happenings which do not occur normally unless there is negligence But where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care it affords reasonable evidence in the absence of explanation by the defendants that the accident arose from want of care What then must the defendant do to discharge this burden This question is answered in Winfield on <ORG> in these words This is a problem which has given rise to difference of opinion and even now the Law cannot be regarded as settled Even if he cannot explain the accident if the defendant shows that there was no lack of reasonable care on his part or on the part of the person for whose negligence he is responsible then he has again exonerated himself from the liability The position as to onus of proof in this case seems to me to be fairly summarised in the following short propositions i If the defendants omnibus leaves the road and falls down an embankment and this without more is proved then res ipsa loquitur there is a presumption that the event is caused by negligence on the part of the defendants and the plaintiff succeeds unless the defendants can rebut this presumption ii It is no rebuttal for the defendants to show against without more that the immediate cause of the omnibus leaving the road is a tyre burst since a tyre burst per se is a natural event consistent and equally consistent with negligence or due diligence on the part of the defendants We are firmly of the view that having regard to the local conditions in this country the principle of QB supra which is the authority for the view that the defendant in case of res ipsa loquitur cannot discharge the burden cast upon him by preferring hypothetical explanations however plausible must be applied and that any view taken to the contrary in English decisions should not guide the decision of cases in this country We are emphatically of the view that for the above reasons as wide an amplitude and as long a rope as possible must be given to the principle res ipsa loquitur in its application to the case of a motor accident Having regard to the local conditions prevailing in this country when res ipsa loquitur is attracted it should be given as wide an amplitude and as long a rope as possible in its application to the case of a motor accident Parties shall bear their own costs in this appeal as incurred
