The present appeal arises out of a suit brought by the plaintiffs as zemindars of plot <ORG> against the defendants Nos and the putnidars of mouzahs included in that towzi The Subordinate Judge however held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover from the defendants a fair and equitable rent and he fixed the same at Rs It has not been seriously contested before us that the lower Court is not right in its conclusion that the putnidars under the terms of the lease are entitled to a settlement of the resumed chaukidari chakran lands but the points which have been urged in support of the appeal are i that the plaintiffs are not entitled to demand a higher rent from the putnidars than the amount assessed by the Collector under Section of Bengal Act VI of and ii that even if the plaintiffs are entitled to more the amount assessed by the lower Court is excessive On behalf of the appellants it has been contended that the meaning of this passage is that if the putnidar refused to take settlement of the chaukidari chakran lands from the zemindar at the same jama as that at which settlement of the same was made with the zemindar by the Government then the zimindar would be entitled to settle the lands with other persons and it has been argued that from this clause it is clear that the putnidars are entitled to a settlement from the landlords at the same rent as the amount which was fixed by the Collector under Section We have given our best consideration to the passage in question in the <ORG> and we think that the view taken by the lower Court is correct and that it does not bind the landlords to settle the resumed chaukidari chakran lands with putnidars at the same amount at which the assessment for the purpose of the chaukidari tax has been made on the land under the provisions of Section of Bengal Act VI of In particular we referred to the decisions of this Court in the cases of <NAME> <NAME> It seems to us perfectly clear that at the time the lease was granted it was well known that the nominal rents did not represent the actual profits of the <ORG>dars and this indeed is supported by the evidence given by the plaintiffs to prove that no less than Rs We have already noticed that that sum exceeds by Rs only the rental arrived at on the basis of the principle suggested in the case of <NAME> <NAME> and in the circumstances of the case we see no reason to differ from the lower <ORG> that Rs We therefore confirm the judgment and decree of the lower Court and dismiss the appeal with costs
