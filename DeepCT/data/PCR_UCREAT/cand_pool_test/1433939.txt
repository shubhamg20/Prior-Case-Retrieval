For the sake of convenience we hereby refer to the facts concerning assessment year For the assessment year the assessee made a provision for warranty at Rs at the rate of of the turnover This provision was made by the assessee on account of warranty claims likely to arise on the sales effected by the appellant and to cover up that expenditure Consequently the assessee claimed deduction in respect of the net provision of Rs which was disallowed by the A on the ground that the liability was merely a contingent liability not allowable as a deduction under Section of the Income tax Act the Act for short The matter was carried in appeal to the <ORG> by the appellant From that year onwards it has been consistently held that looking to the nature of the business and the nature of the product manufactured and sold it was necessary for warranty clause to be attached to the sales effected by the appellant and that the warranty obligations constituted an integral part of the sales effected during the year During the assessment year to assessment year there was one instance when the <ORG> disallowed the warranty claim that was in the assessment year By common judgment dated <ORG> held that the assessee was not entitled to deduction in respect of the provision made for warranty claims It was held that no obligation was ever cast on the date of the sale and consequently there was no accrued liability The case of the <ORG> was accepted by <ORG> hence these civil appeals are filed by the assessee Learned counsel submitted that in each case one has to find out whether there is an element of certainty that the liability would occur In each case one has to ascertain whether there is any scientific data or material produced by the assessee about the liability incurred in the past and in the absence of such a data assessee was not entitled to deduction for warranty provision in its books of accounts According to learned counsel merely because the assessee is maintaining its account on mercantile basis it cannot claim that the provision made towards warranty is an accrued liability Since in the relevant year there was no claim for replacement of the defective pieces the assessee could not have claimed deduction by merely making an entry in its books of accounts or by making a mere provision in its books of accounts Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the assessee submitted that in this case <ORG> had erred in not following the Rule of Consistency In this connection it was urged that right from assessment year upto assessment year the <ORG> had come to the conclusion that Valve Actuators were sophisticated items that the appellant has been following scientific method of accounting which included the concept of reversal that looking to the nature of business and the nature of the product the appellant was entitled under the Commercial Accounting Principles to create provisions for warranty and accordingly the appellant was entitled to deduction under Section of the Act In other words there was reversal to the extent of Rs in the second year According to learned counsel if one applies the concept of reversal which has been applied in the present case there is no escapement of income from assessment and the entire exercise would be revenue neutral Learned counsel placed reliance on the judgment of <ORG> in the case of Commissioner of Inland Revenue <ORG> ITR PC According to learned counsel there is no finding in the order of the A for the assessment years in question saying that the method of accounting of the appellant was incapable of income determination In the circumstances learned counsel submitted that <ORG> had erred in reversing the decision of the <ORG> We quote herinbelow relevant provisions of the Income tax Act as it stood at the material time General a Subject to the provisions of Clause no deduction shall be allowed in respect of any provision whether called as such or by any other name made by the assessee for the payment of gratuity to his employees on their retirement or on termination of their employment for any reason Nothing in Clause a shall apply in relation to i any provision made by the assessee for the purpose of payment of a sum by way of any contribution towards an approved gratuity fund or for the purpose of payment of any gratuity that has become payable during the previous year ii any provision made by the assessee for the previous year relevant to any assessment year commencing on or after the st day of April but before the st day of April to the extent the amount of such provision does not exceed the admissible amount if the following conditions are fulfilled namely the provision is made in accordance with an actuarial valuation of the ascertainable liability of the assessee for payment of gratuity to his employees on their retirement or on termination of their employment for any reason the assessee creates an approved gratuity fund for the exclusive benefit of his employees under an irrevocable trust the application for the approval of the fund having been made before the st day of January and a sum equal to at least fifty per cent of the admissible amount or where any amount has been utilised out of such provision for the purpose of payment of any gratuity before the creation of the approved gratuity fund a sum equal to at least fifty per cent of the admissible amount as reduced by the amount so utilised is paid by the assessee by way of contribution to the approved gratuity fund before the st day of April and the balance of the admissible amount or as the case may be the balance of the admissible amount as reduced by the amount so utilised is paid by the assessee by way of such contribution before the st day of April For the purposes of sub clause ii of clause of this sub section admissible amount means the amount of the provision made by the assessee for the payment of gratuity to his employees on their retirement or on termination of their employment for any reason to the extent such amount does not exceed an amount calculated at the rate of eight and one third per cent of the salary as defined in clause of rule of Part A of the Fourth Schedule of each employee entitled to the payment of such gratuity for each year of his service in respect of which such provision is made For the removal of doubts it is hereby declared that where any provision made by the assessee for the payment of gratuity to his employees on their retirement or on termination of their employment for any reason has been allowed as a deduction in computing the income of the assessee for any assessment year any sum paid out of such provision by way of contribution towards an approved gratuity fund or by way of gratuity to any employee shall not be allowed as a deduction in computing the income of the assessee of the previous year in which the sum is so paid Where there are a number of obligations product warranties or similar contracts the probability that an outflow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the said obligations as a whole However when there is manufacture and sale of an army of items running into thousands of units of sophisticated goods the past event of defects being detected in some of such items leads to a present obligation which results in an enterprise having no alternative to settling that obligation The said company considers following options a account for warranty expense in the year in which it is incurred it makes a provision for warranty only when the customer makes a claim and it provides for warranty at of turnover of the company based on past experience historical trend It is important to note that there are four important aspects of provisioning In this case <ORG> has principally gone by the judgment of <ORG> in the case of <NAME> supra In appeal by the <ORG> <ORG> held that the assessee was not entitled to deduction without complying with the provisions of Section A of the Act It was held that Section A which stood inserted by Finance Act has been given an overriding effect over Section as well as Section of the Act Consequently the deduction allowable on general principles was ruled out as Section A made it clear that Section A had effect notwithstanding anything contained in Sections to of the Act As stated above it would depend on the nature of business the nature of sales the nature of the product manufactured and sold and the scientific method of accounting being adopted by the assessee In the present case we have the situation of large number of items being produced In the circumstances we hold that the principle laid down by this <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra will apply It may be stated that the principles of commercial accounting mentioned above formed the basis of the judgment of this <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra and those principles are affirmed by the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> supra upto In respect of warranty claims during the relevant assessment years in question there is no provision similar to Section A of the Act Before concluding we may refer to the judgment of this <ORG> in the case of <ORG> supra There was it appears an agreement by which the company was under an obligation to provide a pension to <NAME> after his retirement It was also provided in the deed that notwithstanding the main clause the trustees would if so desired by the assessee company take out instead a deferred longest life policy with the said insurance company in their names but in favour of <NAME> and Mrs <NAME> for an annuity of Pound per annum payable during their joint lives from the date of <NAME> superannuation and during the lifetime of the survivor provided further that if <NAME> died before he attained the age of years the annuity payable to Mrs <NAME> would be Pound during her life There was a special provision which must be reproduced Provided the contract is in force and unreduced the grantees i the trustees shall be entitled to surrender the annuity on the option anniversary i September for the capital sum of Pound subject to written notice of the intention to surrender being received by the directors of the society within the thirty day preceding the option anniversary In the assessment years and it claimed a deduction of these sums from its profits or gains under section xv of the Indian Income tax Act hereinafter called the Act which provides Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely any expenditure not being in the nature of capital expenditure or personal expenses of the assessee laid out or expended wholly and exclusively for the purposes of such business profession or vocation The reason why the <ORG> held this way may be stated in its own words Clauses I and II do not contain any provision having a material bearing upon clause III Therefore if it happens that both Mr and Mrs <NAME> die before th September all the payments till then made through the trustees to <ORG> will come back to the trustees and as there is not the slightest trace of any indication anywhere that the trustees should have any beneficial interest in these moneys there would be a resultant trust in favour of the company in respect of the moneys thus far paid out Such a provision can hardly be treated as payment to an employee whether of remuneration or pension or gratuity and cannot be a proper deduction against the incomings of the business of the company for the purpose of computing its taxable profits The question which arose for determination was whether during the assessment years and the assessee company was entitled to claim deduction of the yearly premium from its profits under Section xv of the Income tax Act It was held that putting aside of money which may become expenditure on the happening of an event is not an expenditure under Section xv of the Act Therefore it was a case of setting apart of the money and consequently the assessee was not entitled to deduction under the said section As stated above in the present case we are concerned with an army of items of sophisticated specialiased goods manufactured and sold by the assessee whereas the case of <ORG> supra was restricted to an individual retiree It had made provision for such liability spread over to a number of years In such a case it was held by this Court that the provision made by the assessee company for meeting the liability incurred by it under the gratuity scheme would be entitled to deduction out of the gross receipts for the accounting year during which the provision is made for the liability It was held following the judgment in <ORG> supra that the provision made by the assessee for meeting the liability incurred under leave encashment scheme proportionate with the entitlement earned by the employees was entitled to deduction out of gross receipts for the accounting year during which the provision is made for that liability For the above reasons we set aside the impugned judgment of <ORG> dated and accordingly the civil appeals stand allowed in favour of the assessee with no order as to costs <ORG> Commissioner of Income Tax Chennai the civil appeals filed by the <ORG> stand dismissed with no order as to costs
