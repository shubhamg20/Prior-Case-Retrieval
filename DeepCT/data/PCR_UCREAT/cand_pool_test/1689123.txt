The suit which has given rise to these con Khanam solidated appeals from a decree and judgment of <ORG> was instituted by the plaintiff respondent in <ORG> for the redemption of a mortgage executed so long ago as the th of January The mortgage deed is not forthcoming but both the Courts in India have found that the contract between the parties to the transaction is for all material purposes substantially set forth in the proceeding of <ORG> dated the th of September on an application for mutation of names in <ORG> The form it usually takes is for the mortgagor to execute a deed of sale in respect of the mortgaged property in favour of the mortgagee who on his side executes an agreement covenanting that on the liquidation of the debt according to the terms of the contract the sale would be cancelled and he would re convey the property to the mortgagor The period of limitation under the Indian Statute for suits for redemption or for recovery of possession of mortgaged property is sixty years from the date of the accrual of the right to redeem or to recover possession Article Schedule II Act XV of The Subordinate Judge was of opinion that limitation began to run from the date of the contract and accordingly held that the suit was barred The learned Judges dealing with this point give expression to their opinion in the flowing passage in their judgment If the moaning of this contemporaneous agreement was that the mort gagors might redeem at any time within the period of nine years the plaintiffs claim is barred by limitation But there is nothing in law to prevent the parties from making a provision that the mortgagor may discharge the debt within the specified period and take back the property It is a distinct allegation of fact on which the right to recover possession is founded If the fact be as the plaintiffs allege that the mortgage debt <ORG> became satisfied under the contract in the right to recover possession accrued then and the suit is clearly barred As regards the other parties their Lordships think that the plaintiffs should bear the costs decreed against them in <ORG> but that each of the parties should bear their respective costs of these appeals and of the appeals to <ORG> including the costs incurred in the proceedings on remand And their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly
