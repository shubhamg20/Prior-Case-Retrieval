PETITIONER <NAME> Vs RESPONDENT THE STATE OF PUNJAB and connected petition DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> SYED JAFFER BENCH <NAME> SYED JAFFER SINHA BHUVNESHWAR CJ KAPUR <NAME> GUPTA DAS CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC RF SC SC SC RF SC ACT Criminal Trial Joinder of charges and Persons in a single trial Person charged with three offences of cheating tried jointly with abettor Legality Place of trial Sanction to Prosecute Public servant requirement of Minimum fine Prescribed by subsequent Ordinance if violates constitutional Protection Code of Criminal Procedure Act of ss Indian Penal Code Act XLV of Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance XXIX of as amended by the Criminal Law Amendment Amending Ordinance XII of Constitution of India Art The <ORG> of Burma sent these claims for verification to Major <NAME> at Jhansi in March and May as he was the officer who had knowledge of these matters In default of payment of the ordinary fines it directed the appellant to undergo further imprisonment for certain periods but there was no such direction with respect to the compulsory fines It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the offences having been committed at Kolhapur then outside British India the trial at Simla in the absence of any certificate or sanction given under of the Code of Criminal Procedure was illegal the joint trial of the appellant and <NAME> at Simla was also illegal SS and of the Code could not be combined to try a person charged with three offences of cheating with another charged with abetment in respect thereof in a single trial and sanction under of the Code was necessary for the prosecution of <NAME> and the absence of such sanction vitiated the joint trial Held that before the provisions of of the Code of Criminal Procedure could apply to a case it was necessary to establish that the crime was committed outside British India In the instant case the misrepresentation by the appellant the false certification by <NAME> and the resulting payment having been made respectively at Simla Jhansi and Lahore then in British India no part of the offence could be said to have taken place outside British India The words an offence in of the Code which is singular must by virtue of of the General Clauses Act include the plural and therefore a person accused of several offences of the same kind can be tried in a single trial with another accused of abetment thereof The concluding words of of the Code obviously mean that in framing charges against each of the several persons mentioned in its different clauses not only the provisions relating to the form of charges but also those in respect of joinder of charges should apply There was therefore no illegality in trying the appellant and <NAME> together at Simla As of the Ordinance prescribed a minimum fine no question as to its excessive character could arise and the order of <ORG> setting aside the compulsory fines must therefore be set aside and the orders of the Special <ORG> restored As there was no evidence in the instant case to show that <NAME> was an officer as contemplated by of the Code and that in verifying the appellant claims he was discharging his official duty could not apply Although in these appeals only questions of law have been urged it is necessary to set out briefly some of the facts which led to the prosecution and conviction of <NAME> These claims were sent by <ORG> to Major <NAME> at Jhansi in March and May for verification as he was the officer who had knowledge of these matters A police investigation followed which revealed that a large number of claims made by various persons including <NAME> in respect of works done for the benefit of the army were false There was no such direction with respect to the compulsory fines The charge framed against the appellant stated that he had committed the offence of cheating at Simla and Kolhapur Secondly it was urged that the appellant committed the offence at Kolhapur and <NAME> at Jhansi Accordingly cheques on <ORG> Lahore Branch were sent to the appellant by post in Lahore and the appellant encashed them there As the offence committed by the appellant was not at a place beyond British India there was no need for the existence of a certificate of a Political Agent or in the absence of such a person a sanction of <ORG> On the other hand it was urged by Mr <NAME> that in <ORG> the objection had been taken but it had been overruled on the ground that there was in fact a sanction in existence If it is being urged now that <NAME> was not such a person then the appellant should be given an opportunity to show that he was a public servant so removable Under no <ORG> shall take cognizance of an offence committed by a public servant who is removable from his office by <ORG> or a Provincial Government save upon a sanction by one or the other as the case may be when such offence is committed by him while acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty <NAME> was charged with intentionally aiding the appellant in the commission of an offence punishable under of the Indian Penal Code by falsely stating as a fact in his reports that the appellants claims were true and that statement bad been made knowing all the while that the claims in question were false and fraudulent and that he had accordingly committed an offence under Indian Penal Code We have no hesitation in saying that where a public servant commits the offence of cheating or abets another so to cheat the offence committed by him is not one while he is acting or purporting to act in the discharge of his official duty as such offences have no necessary connection between them and the performance of the duties of a public servant the official status furnishing only the occasion or opportunity for the commission of the offences vide <NAME> case Elaborate arguments were advanced in support of the contention that the provisions of of the Code were not inconsistent with the Ordinance and therefore had to be complied with before <ORG> could try <NAME> It was pointed out that under of the Ordinance <ORG> was specifically authorized to take cognizance of an offence without the accused being committed to it for trial and sub of that section stated that Save as provided in sub the Code of Criminal Procedure of except the provisions of section A and of Chapter XXXIII shall so far as they are not inconsistent with this Ordinance apply to proceedings of <ORG> and for the purposes of the said provisions <ORG> shall be deemed to be <ORG> trying cases without a jury and a person conducting a prosecution before <ORG> shall be deemed to be a Public Prosecutor It was urged that by virtue of this sub section the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure would be applicable except the provisions of A and Chapter XXXIII which had been expressly excluded Coming now to the nd and rd submissions made on behalf of the appellant we have to consider whether the appellant and <NAME> could at all be jointly tried having regard to the fact that they were jointly tried up to a certain stage in some of the trials and to the conclusion of the trial concerning cases Nos and It was pointed out that under the provisions of of the Code for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately except in the cases mentioned in ss and The only provision by which a person accused of an offence and a person accused of abetment of that offence can be tried together in a single trial is under which permits persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment to be charged and tried together Under the terms of these provisions any number of persons accused of commuting a single offence could be tried together with any number of persons who had abetted that offence But cl did not permit the trial of persons accused of several offences and persons accused of abetment of those offences in one trial and to try a person accused of three offences along with a person accused of abetment of those offences would be contrary to the provisions of cl The plain words of make it quite clear that persons who had committed a single offence and those who abetted it only could be tried together If the joinder of charges was within the terms of the section then the provisions of had no application Although in cl of the section the words used are persons accused of an offence and persons accused of abetment or of an attempt to commit such offence a reasonable construction of these words could not lead to the conclusion that the words an offence meant a single offence because under of the General Clauses Act Central Act of words in the singular shall include the plural and vice versa Under cl therefore persons accused of several offences and persons accused of abetment thereof could be tried together in a single trial The concluding words of and the provisions contained in the former part of this Chapter shall so far as it may be apply to all such charges permitted a court to apply that part of Chapter XIX which preceded It also permitted that if the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished the person accused of them may be charged with and tried at one trial for each of such offences It also provided that if several acts of which one or more than one would by or them selves constitute an offence constitute when combined a different offence the person accused of them may be charged with and tried at one trial for the offence constituted by such acts when combined and for any offence constituted by any one or more of such acts Under cl a persons accused of the same offence committed in the course of the same transaction can be tried together Under cl persons accused of more than one offence of the same kind within the meaning of committed by them jointly within the period of months can also be tried together Under cl persons accused of different offences committed in the course of the same transaction can be tried together and It is clear therefore that the general rule that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately has no application to these clauses There is no apparent reason why cl should be construed in the way suggested by Mr <NAME> according to whom in one trial any number of persons could be tried for a single offence along with any number of persons accused of abetment of that offence Having regard to the providers of of the General Clauses Act the singular includes the plural and it would not be straining the language of the clause if the same was construed also to mean that persons accused of several offences and persons accused of abetment thereof could be tried together at one trial Furthermore the concluding words of the section make it clear that the provisions contained in the former part of Chapter XIX i previous to as a far as may be shall apply to all charges framed at the trial The reason for these words appearing in of theCode appears to be that this section permits persons to be charged and tried together There is no good reason for thinking that when cl of permitted the joinder of the appellant and <NAME> in a single trial for the commission of the offence of cheating and abetment thereof the same was confined to one offence of cheating and one offence of abetment It was pointed out that <NAME> sentence was reduced to month imprisonment and a small fine the proceedings against the appellant had been going oil since the appellant had already served some three months imprisonment and that there was also a substantial fine In these appeals the State of Punjab has appealed against that part of the judgment of <ORG> which set aside the order of <ORG> imposing what has been described as compulsory fines In other words the section imposed a minimum fine in any event whether a sentence of imprisonment was or was not imposed could not apply as the conviction in that case was recorded on the th of January before the Constitution came into force Mr <NAME> on the other hand drew our attention to of the Indian Penal Code and submitted that a sentence of fine could at no time be excessive and therefore the sentence of fine which could be imposed under was not entirely unlimited as it could not be excessive The prohibition under the Article was not confined to the passing or the validity of the law but extended to the conviction or the sentence and was based on its character as ex post facto law and therefore fullest effect must be given to the actual words used in the Article of the Constitution had been contravened was rejected and it was held that the criminal law relating to offences charged against the accused at the time of their commission was substantially the same as obtained at the time of the conviction and sentence under the Indian Penal Code It assumed that <NAME> case supported the contention of the first appellant in that case In the present case even if it be assumed that of the Ordinance as an ex post facto law ill that in the matter of penalty a minimum sentence of fine was directed to be imposed by a court whereas at the time that the appellant committed the offence contained no such provision what is prohibited under Art A law which provides for a minimum sentence of fine on conviction cannot be read as one which imposes a greater penalty than that which might have been inflicted under the law at the time of the commission of the offence where for such an offence there was no limit as to the extent of fine which might be imposed Whether a fine was excessive or not would be a question of fact in each particular case but no such question can arise in a case where the law imposes a minimum sentence of fine These appeals are accordingly allowed and the order of <ORG> setting aside the compulsory fines imposed by <ORG> is set aside and the orders of <ORG> imposing the compulsory fines are restored <NAME> <NAME> I have read the judgment prepared by my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> I agree to the order proposed and the reasons therefor except that I would base the inapplicability of Criminal Procedure Code to the facts of the present case on different grounds The contention raised on behalf of the appellant was that his case was prejudiced because of a joint trial with <NAME> who it is contended was a Major in <ORG> and who was charged for abetting the offence of cheating committed by the appellants The argument raised was that <NAME> having been commissioned to and in <ORG> was not removable from his office except with the sanction of <ORG> i the then Governor General in Council and as there was no such sanction he could not validly be tried for the offence he was charged with The question then is whether the facts which are alleged to constitute the offence of abetment of cheating under read with Indian Penal Code fall within Criminal Procedure Code Even in regard to cases of misappropriation this <ORG> in <NAME> case was of the opinion that if the act complained of is so integrally connected with the duties attaching to the office as to be inseparable from them then sanction would be necessary but if there is no connection between them and the performance of those duties the official status furnishing I A In this view of the law we have to decide whether sanction was necessary or not and it is a matter for investigation as to whether an <ORG> officer situated as <NAME> was so removable even if there was evidence to show that he was attached to the Indian <ORG> There is evidence neither in support of one nor of the other In this particular case if it was desired to raise such a question that should have been done at the earliest moment in the trial Court when the facts could have been established by evidence
