Detention under Plea of mala fide whether can be raised Detenue whether entitled to inspect file containing order of detention No mala fides alleged against Chief Minister who passed order His affidavit not necessary In appeal before this Court by special leave it was urged on behalf of the appellant that i the order of detention was mala fide ii <ORG> in not calling for the file of the case and permitting the appellant to inspect the material on the basis of which the order of detention was made community an error of law iii <ORG> should have asked for an affidavit from the Chief Minister of the State who passed the order of detention ii The satisfaction of the Government which justifies the order of detention under is a subjective satisfaction However if the order of detention itself suffers from any lacuna it is open to a court to call for an affidavit from the Chief Minister or other Minister concerned or to call for the relevant file from <ORG> in order to satisfy itself as to the accuracy of the recital made in the order of detention iii As there was no allegation of mala fides or lack of bona fides with regard to the Chief Minister it was not necessary for <ORG> to call for his affidavit The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal is brought by special leave against the judgment of <ORG> dated February we expressed the view that this appeal should be dismissed and the reasons will be stated later The case of the appellant is that he was carrying on business of purchasing and selling goods like cloves cinnamon dye stuff etc The order of detention being No of <ORG> Home Department Special Section reads as follows Whereas the Governor is satisfied that with a view to preventing <NAME> son of <NAME> of Decres Lane Calcutta from acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of Public Order it is necessary to make an order directing that he be detained In response to the notice an affidavit was filed on behalf of the State of West Bengal denying the allegations of the appellant It was pointed out that on August the appellant had sent a representation to the Chief Minister of West Bengal and other higher authorities saying that the police had been creating fictitious records for putting the appellant under detention under the Defence of India Rules The contention of the appellant is that the order of detention was made on September by the Chief Minister West Bengal not because of any material suggesting that the appellant was acting in any manner prejudicial to the maintenance of public order but because of the false reports made by the police and <ORG> officers The next contention of the appellant is that there is no affidavit filed on behalf of the Chief Minister West Bengal showing that he applied his mind to the case of the appellant and that he had the requisite satisfaction as required by the statutory rule this Court had occasion to consider the legal effect of the proclamation of Emergency issued by the President on October and two orders of the Presidentone dated November and the other dated November issued in exercise of the powers conferred by cl of Art It was held by this Court that the scope of Art and the Presidential Order issued under it is wide enough to include all claims made by citizens in any Court of competent Jurisdiction when it is shown that the said claims cannot be effectively adjudicated upon without examining the question as to whether the citizen is in substance seeking to enforce fundamental rights under Arts But the appellant can challenge the validity of the order on a ground other than those covered by Art For instance a citizen will not be deprived of the right to move an appropriate Court for a writ of habeas corpus on the ground that his detention has been ordered mala fide Similarly it will be open to the citizen to challenge the order of detention on the ground that any of the grounds given in the order of detention is irrelevant and there is no real and proximate connection between the ground given and the object which the legislature has in view It only means that the statutory power is exercised for purposes foreign to those for which it is in law intended In other words the power confer red by the statute has been utilised for some indirect purpose not connected with the object of the statute or the mischief it seeks to remedy It is contended in the first place on behalf of the appellant that the order of detention is bad because the Chief Minister had taken into account the reports from the police and <ORG> officers falsely made against the appellant It is argued by Mr <NAME> that the order of detention is bad because the statutory power has been exercised mala fide that is to say it has been utilised for some indirect purpose not connected with the object of the statute or the mischief which it seeks to remedy There is also an affidavit by Mr <NAME> denying the allegations made by the appellant On perusal of the various affidavits filed in the case <ORG> reached the conclusion that the allegation of mala fide made by the appellant had not been substantiated and the order of detention made by <ORG> could not be held to be legally invalid on this account We see no reason to take a view different from that of <ORG> on this point It was next contended on behalf of the appellant that <ORG> should have called upon <ORG> to produce the file concerning detention of the appellant in order to determine for itself whether the Chief Minister had sufficient material before him for satisfying himself as to the necessity for the detention of the appellant The satisfaction of the Government which justifies the order of detention under is a subjective satisfaction The legal position has been explained by <ORG> in King Emperor <NAME> as follows It is quite a different thing to question the accuracy of a recital contained in a duly authenticated order particularly here the recital purports to state as a fact the carrying out of what I regard as a condition necessary to the valid making of that order The presence of the recital in the order will place a difficult burden on the detenu to produce admissible evidence sufficient to establish even a prima faciea case that the recital is not accurate Reference may be made in this connection to <NAME> Sir John Anderson and <NAME> Secretary of <ORG> for Home Affairs It was held that the matter was one for the executive discretion of the Secretary of <ORG> and that the <ORG> was not entitled to investigate the grounds on which the Secretary of <ORG> came to believe the persons concerned to be of I A at I deny that I have done anything wrong that does not require an answer because it in no way shows that the Secretary of <ORG> had not reasonable cause to believe or did not believe otherwise But the order for production of the file and for affidavit from the Minister or the Secretary concerned was made in that case because the appellant alleged that the order of review had not been reduced to writing under A and the relevant conditions prescribed by the rule had not been complied with and that it had not been communicated to him It follows therefore that <ORG> was justified in not making an order for discovery or production of the original departmental file containing the activities of the appellant by <ORG> Lastly it was contended for the appellant that <ORG> should have asked the Chief Minister to file an affidavit and rejected the affidavit filed by the Deputy Secretary Mr <NAME> as insufficient to controvert the allegations of the appellant We do not think there is any substance in this point There is no allegation made by the appellant that the Chief Minister himselfwas acting mala fide As there is no allegation of mala fides or lack of bona fideswith regard to the Chief Minister of West Bengal who is the authority for deciding as to the necessity for detention of the appellant it <NAME> was not necessary for <ORG> to call for an affidavit from the Chief Minister and the affidavit filed by Mr <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> was rightly considered by <ORG> as sufficient in the circumstances of the case For these reasons we hold that there is no merit in this appeal and that it should be dismissed
