Held per <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> dissenting that inasmuch as authorised the imposition of restrictions on the fundamental right of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by art a of the Consti tution for the purpose of preventing activities prejudicial to public safety and maintenance of public order it was not a law relating to a matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> within the meaning of the saving provisions contained in cl Per <NAME> The expression public safety has as a result of a long course of legislative practice acquired a well recognised meaning and may be taken to denote safety or security of the <ORG> and though the expression public order is wide enough to cover small disturbances of the peace which do not jeopardise the security of the <ORG> yet prominence given in the Act to public safety the fact that the Act is a piece of special legislation providing for special measures and the aim and scope of the Act in gener al show that preservation of public safety is the dominant purpose of the Act and public order may well be para phrased in the context as public tranquillity The facts are stated in the judgment The judgment of <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> was deliv ered by <NAME> <NAME> delivered a separate dissenting judgment <NAME> is an application under arti cle of the Constitution praying for the issue of writs of certiorari and prohibition to the respondent the Chief Commissioner of Delhi with a view to examine the legality of and quash the order made by him in regard to an English weekly of Delhi called the <ORG> of which the first applicant is the printer and publisher and the second is the editor On nd March the respondent in exercise of powers conferred on him by section of the East Punjab Public Safety Act which has been extended to the Delhi Province and is hereinafter referred to as the impugned Act issued the following order Whereas the Chief Commissioner Delhi is satisfied that <ORG> an English weekly of Delhi has been pub lishing highly objectionable matter constituting a threat to public law and order and that action as is hereinafter mentioned is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order Now there more in exercise of the powers conferred by section of the East Punjab Public Safety Act as extended to the Delhi Province I <NAME> Chief Commissioner Delhi do by this order require you <NAME> Printer and Publisher and <NAME> Editor of the aforesaid paper to submit for scrutiny in duplicate before publication till further orders all communal matter and news and views about Pakistan including photographs and cartoons other than those derived from official sources or supplied by the news agencies viz The only point argued before us relates to the consti tutional validity of section of the impugned Act which as appears from its preamble was passed to provide special measures to ensure public safety and maintenance of public order The petitioners claim that this provision infringes the fundamental right to the freedom of speech and expression conferred upon them by article a of the Constitu tion inasmuch as it authorises the imposition of a restric tion on the publication of the journal which is not justi fied under clause of that article Accordingly for the reasons indicated in that judgment we allow this petition and hereby quash the impugned order of <ORG> er Delhi dated the nd March <NAME> question raised in this case relates to the validity of section of the East Punjab Public Safety Act as extended to the Province of Delhi which runs as follows <ORG> or any authority authorised by it in this behalf if satisfied that such action is neces sary for the purpose of preventing or combating any activity prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order may by order in writing addressed to a print er publisher or editor require that any matter relating to a particular subject or class of subjects shall before publication be submitted for scrutiny It should be noted that the provisions of sub clause arc not in general terms but are confined to a particular subject or class of subjects and that having regard to the context in which these words are used they must be connect ed with public safety or the maintenance of public order The petitioners on whose behalf this provision is assailed are respectively the printer and publisher and editor of an English weekly of Delhi called <ORG> and they pray for the issue of writs of certiorari and prohibi tion to the Chief Commissioner Delhi with a view to examine and review the legality of and restrain the operation of and quash the order made by him on the nd March under the impugned section directing them to submit for scrutiny in duplicate before publication till further orders all communal matter and news and views about Pakistan including photographs and cartoons other than those derived from official sources or supplied by the news agencies The order in question recites among other things that the Chief Commissioner is satisfied that the <ORG> has been publishing highly objectionable matter constituting a threat to public law and order and that action to which reference has been made is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order It is contended on behalf of the petitioners that notwithstanding these recitals the order complained against is liable to be quashed because it amounts to an infringement of the right of freedom of speech and expres sion guaranteed by article a of the Constitution Articles a and which are to be read together run as follows All citizens shall have the right a to freedom of speech and expression Nothing in sub clause a of clause shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it relates to or prevent the <ORG> from making any law relating to libel slander defamation contempt of <ORG> or any matter which offends against decency or morality or which under mines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> It is contended that section of the Act under which the impugned order has been made cannot be saved by clause of article of the Constitution because it does not relate to any matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> There can be no doubt that to impose pre censorship on a journal such as has been ordered by the Chief Commissioner in this case is a restriction on the liberty of the press which is included in the right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article a of the Constitu tion and the only question which we have therefore to decide is whether clause of article stands in the way of the petitioners The East Punjab Public Safety Act of which sec tion is a part was passed by <ORG> in exercise of the power conferred upon it by section of the Government of India Act is read with Entry of List II of the Seventh Schedule to that Act which includes among other matters public order This expression in the general sense may be construed to have reference to the maintenance of what is generally known as law and order in the Province and this is confirmed by the words which follow it in Entry of List II and which have been put within brackets viz It is clear that anything which affects public tranquillity within the <ORG> or the Province will also affect public order and the <ORG> Legislature is therefore competent to frame laws on matters relating to public tranquillity and public order The headnote of this case runs as follows By section of the Defence of the Realm Consolidation Act power was given to His Majesty in Council during the continuance of the present war to issue regula tions for securing the public safety and the de fence of the realm The prominence thus given to public safety strongly suggests that the Act was intended to deal with serious cases of public disorder which affect public safety or the security of the <ORG> or cases in which owing to some kind of emergency or a grave situation having arisen even public disorders of comparatively small dimensions may have far reaching effects on the security of the <ORG> It is concerned with special measures which would presumably be required for special cases or special situations The line of argument advanced on behalf of the petitioners is that since the Act has been passed in exercise of the power granted by the expression public order used in the Government of India Act which is a general term of wide import and since it purports to provide for the maintenance of public order its provisions are intended or are liable to be used for all cases of breaches of public order be they small or insig nificant breaches or those of a grave or serious nature It was argued that public safety and maintenance of public order are used in the Act disjunctively and they are separated by the word or and not and and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility of the Act providing for ordinary as well as serious cases of disturbance of public order and tranquillity We therefore cannot ignore the fact that preservation of public safety is the dominant purpose of the Act and that it is a special Act providing for special measures and therefore it should not be confused with an Act which is applicable to ordinary situations and to any and every trivial case of breach of public order In my opinion the word or is used here not so much to separate two wholly different concepts as to show that they are closely allied concepts and can be used almost inter changeably in the context I will now advert once more to clause of article and state what I consider to be the reason for inserting in it the words matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> It is well recognized in all systems of law that the right to freedom of speech and expression or freedom of the press means that any person may write or say what he pleases so long as he does not infringe the law relating to libel or slander or to blasphemous obscene or seditious words or writings see Halsbury Laws of England nd Edition Vol There is no doubt that what <NAME> has stated in that case represents the view of a number of Judges and authors and was also the view of Sir <NAME> in regard to whom <NAME> in his charge to the jury in a case relating to the law of sedition <NAME> Burns said The law upon the question of what is seditious and what is not is to be found stated very clearly in a book by <NAME> who has undoubtedly a greater knowledge of crimi nal law than any other Judge who sits upon the Bench and what he has said upon the subject of sedition was submitted to the other Judges who sometime back were engaged with him in drafting a criminal code and upon their report the Commissioners say that his statement of law appears to them to be stated accurately as it exists at present In England there is no statutory definition of sedition its meaning and content have been laid down in many decisions some of which are referred to by the Chief Justice but these decisions are not relevant when you have a statutory definition of that which is termed sedition as we have in the present case On the one hand they must have had before their mind the very widely accepted view supported by numerous authorities that sedition was essentially an offence against public tranquil lity and was connected in some way or other with public disorder and on the other hand there was the pronounce ment of <ORG> that sedition as defined in the Indian Penal Code did not necessarily imply any inten tion or tendency to incite disorder Therefore it is difficult to hold that public disorder or disturbance of public tranquillity are not matters which undermine the security of the <ORG> Unlawful assemblies riots insurrections rebellions levying of war are offences which run into each other and are not capable of being marked off by perfectly definite boundaries All of them have in common one feature namely that the normal tranquillity of a civilised society is in each of the cases mentioned disturbed either by actual force or at least by the show and threat of it It shows firstly that sedition is essentially an offence against public tranquillity and secondly that broadly speaking there are two classes of offences against public tranquillity a those accompanied by violence including disorders which affect tranquillity of a considerable number of persons or an extensive local area and those not accompanied by violence but tending to cause it such as seditious utter ances seditious conspiracies etc Both these classes of offences are such as will undermine the security of the <ORG> or tend to overthrow it if left unchecked and as I have tried to point out there is a good deal of authorita tive opinion in favour of the view that the gravity ascribed to sedition is due to the fact that it tends to seriously affect the tranquillity and security of the <ORG> That clause clearly states that nothing in clause a shall affect the operation of any existing law relating to any matter which undermines the security of or tends to overthrow the <ORG> It must be recognized that freedom of speech and expres sion is one of the most valuable rights guaranteed to a citizen by the Constitution and should be jealously guard ed by the <ORG> As has been stated already the order which is impugned in this case recites that the weekly <ORG> has been publishing highly objectionable matter constituting a threat to public law and order and that the action which it is proposed to take against the petitioners is necessary for the purpose of preventing or combating activities prejudi cial to public safety or the maintenance of public order
