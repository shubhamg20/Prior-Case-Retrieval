Whether a first mortgagee who has purchased the mortgaged property in execution of a decree on his mortgage and sues for possession or in the alternative for the recovery of his money is entitled to a decree for possession subject to redemption by a puisne mortgagee with possession who was not a party to the suit by the first mortgagee There are conflicting decisions of this and the other Indian <ORG> on the question which it is impossible to reconcile Section of the Transfer of Property Act lays down the right of the mortgagor to redeem the mortgage Section of the Act gives every second or other subsequent mortgagee the same rights as against the prior mortgagee as the mortgagor has against him as regards the redemption foreclosure or sale of the mortgaged property But what are the rights of the puisne mortgagee against his mortgagor over and above his right of redemption of the prior mortgage Has he the right to bring to sale the equity of redemption of his mortgagor and has he the right of foreclosure Discussing the rights of mortgagees <NAME> says in his Roman Law page If the same thing has been hypothecated successively to several persons only the first of them has the power of sale unless a subsequent creditor has put himself in the place of the first But otherwise he has no independent right of sale of the equity of redemption of his mortgagor He said it appears to me that under the recent Act of Parliament and Victoria Chapter Section it is within the discretion of the <ORG> in a mortgage suit whether a foreclosure or sale shall be ordered The statement in Jones Sections and that after foreclosure or sale by the first mortgagee the second mortgagee who had not been joined in the suit of the first has only the right to redeem is only explicable with reference to the English and American practice of not decreeing sale of the equity of redemption at the suit of the second mortgagee This section distinctly recognizes the right of a second mortgagee to sue for sale but even this does not seem to warrant the sale of his mortgagor mere right of redemption Section which speaks of a sale subject to a prior mortgage contemplates a suit for sale by the second mortgagee without his being confined to the mere right to redeem the first mortgage Whatever doubts there may arise on this question under the Transfer of Property Act Order XXXIV of the present Code of Civil Procedure sets the matter at rest by the explanation to Rule which runs as follows A puisne mortgagee may sue for foreclosure or for sale without making the prior mortgagee a party to the suit It was also held by the Bombay High <ORG> in a series of cases that a sale under a decree on the first mortgage carried with it all rights of the mortgagor as at the date of the mortgage even though the second mortgagee was no party to the suit see Jones on Mortgages Sections and These two principles are the foundation for many of the later judgments of those <ORG>s as regards the rights of a puisne incumbrancer with reference to the prior mortgagee who had sold in execution of a decree the property of the mortgagor without having made the puisne incumbrancer a party to the suit The Full Bench of the Calcutta High <ORG> has also taken the same view See <NAME> <NAME> On general principles it seems impossible to understand how a person can be affected by proceedings to which he was not a party or in which he was not in some way represented But their Lordships consider that the right view on this point has been taken in both the Courts below Again in <NAME> <NAME> I A Lord <NAME> says at page As regards the plaintiffs title to sue the learned Counsel for the appellant pointed out that the plaint on the face of it showed that the property on which the plaintiffs claimed to have a charge had been sold before the date of the Government sale under a decree obtained by a prior mortgagee against the mortgagor and they insisted that such a sale has the effect of displacing puisne mortgagees and leaving them with nothing but a claim against the surplus proceeds if any That however in their Lordships opinion is not the necessary consequence of a sale under a decree obtained by a prior mortgagee against the mortgagor in a suit to which the puisne incumbrancers are not parties He has also the right to redeem the prior mortgage if it has not been extinguished by merger in the equity of redemption It cannot in any sense cut down the rights of the second mortgagee as they stood at the date of the second mortgage Whatever effect the non inclusion of the second mortgagee as a party to the suit on the first mortgage might be deemed to have on the maintainability of that suit in case he had notice it is difficult to see how the second mortgagee could in any wise be affected We have also to remember the fact that in particular cases the decision has depended upon the circumstance sometimes expressly noticed and sometimes not that the prior or subsequent mortgage was a mortgage with possession and that the right to possession was attached to the mortgage and did not accompany the purchase of the equity of redemption Oftentimes the form of the decree has had reference to the pleadings of the parties the second mortgagee who was not a party to the first mortgagee suit being content to redeem the first instead of insisting on his right to bring the equity of redemption to sale Bearing the foregoing considerations in mind let us proceed to examine the decided cases With the exception of the first the remaining cases will be found to have no bearing on the question under consideration and the judgment in that case vitiated by the erroneous view that a subsequent mortgagee has only the limited right to redeem the first mortgage as laid down in the <ORG> case in <NAME> <NAME> The purchaser and first mortgagee did not sue for foreclosure assuming he had the right to it The second mortgagee entitled to possession under his mortgage had the right to continue in possession until redeemed by the purchaser and could not be ejected by the first mortgagee or compelled to redeem him Passing on to Bombay we find that although it is not in terms anywhere stated that a second mortgagee is only entitled to sue for redemption but not for foreclosure or sale it is repeatedly affirmed that the first mortgagee is entitled to sell the property as it stood at the date of his mortgage free from all subsequent encumbrances even if the Subsequent mortgagee was not made a party to his suit on the first mortgage In both the cases above cited possession was given to the purchaser under the decree on the first mortgage setting aside the right of the second mortgagee to possession under his mortgage and reserving to him a mere liberty to redeem within a time fixed This case therefore is an authority which supports the view indicated in our answer to the reference They support his contention that the first mortgagee who has bought the property in a suit upon the mortgage to which the second mortgagee was not a party is entitled to possession as against him though he the second mortgagee had previously obtained possession by a sale under his mortgage and that the second mortgagee is merely entitled to redeem the prior mortgage The Court further held that the right of the second mortgagee was not affected though effect could not be given to it in that suit having regard to its particular frame In <NAME> <NAME> there was no sale under the first mortgage and the second mortgage was one with possession The case has no bearing on the particular question now under consideration though the remarks of <ORG> on the rights of a second mortgagee to sue for sale are instructive It was held that the suit was liable to be dismissed but as the second mortgagee who was respondent in the appeal did not object to the direction of the lower Court to redeem the prior mortgage or be for ever foreclosed that was not disturbed See page There are a few more cases which however require a more minute examination The first mortgagee having sued and obtained a decree for sale and sold the equity of redemption was clearly entitled to possession when he sued the second mortgagee in ejectment apart from the question dealt with in the case as to the effect of the order rejecting his claim under Section It is however observed at page that all that he defendant can ask as puisne mortgagee is that he shall be allowed an opportunity of redeeming and the decisions in <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> Galabsing and <NAME> <NAME> are cited in support of the observation It may be the second mortgagee had no right of sale under the terms of his mortgage and as a usufructuary mortgagee he could only seek redemption the right to possession having gone with the first mortgagee It is authority for the position that no interest of his in which must be included his right to bring the equity of redemption to sale passes by the sale under the decree of the first mortgagee As regards the first if the facts are carefully examined there is nothing in the decision which can be invoked in support of the respondent though certain observations are not reconcilable with the principle that the second mortgagee who was not a party to the first mortgagee suit remained unaffected in every respect The second mortgagee had apparently no right of sale under his mortgage The first mortgagee had the right to possession and it could not there fore pass to the second The suit itself was by the second mortgagee and a person who had acquired the rights of the first mortgagee and the mortgagor equity of redemption behind the back of the second was the defendant in the suit There was no reason why that prayer should have been refused when the first mortgagee was not suing the second for foreclosure or sale A second mortgagee is entitled to the same rights as the first mortgagee with reference to his security having regard to the nature of his mortgage
