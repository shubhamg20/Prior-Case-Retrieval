During the hearing of this appeal it was pointed out by learned counsel for the appellants that the appellants had been seriously prejudiced as the learned Sessions Judge during the trial had disallowed a certain question being put to one of the Important witnesses named <NAME> According to the prosecution the murder of <NAME> took place in a ghar while he was sleeping on a cot and only other two persons who were in the ghar at the time of the murder were <NAME> and <NAME> who were also sleeping on two different cots a few paces away from the cot of <NAME> There is note by the learned Sessions Judge that this question was disallowed as it referred merely to an omission In that case there was a difference of opinion between two learned Judges of this <ORG> and the case was thereupon referred for the opinion of a third Judge At that stage it came up before one of us and it was held as follows When examined in Court <NAME> stated that he went to the spot on hearing the uproar and heard <NAME> inciting Subedar to give a blow with the spade to <NAME> whereupon Subedar gave a blow on <NAME> head and <NAME> fell down In the statement before the police there was therefore omission to mention that he had seen the beginning of the fight It is true that all omissions do not amount to contradictions and the statements given before the police cannot be used in evidence at all for any purpose except for the purpose of bringing out a contradiction There are however certain omissions which amount to contradictions and have been treated as such by this Court as well as other Courts in this country Those are omissions relating to facts which are expected to be included in the statement before the police by a person who is giving a narrative of what he saw on the ground that they relate to important features of the incident about which the deposition is made In a case of this nature where <NAME> was stating what he saw he would certainly have stated to the police also the incitement by <NAME> to <NAME> to give a blow to <NAME> and the actual infliction of that blow by <NAME> if he had really witnessed that part of the incident He could not have begun his statement to the police by saying that he saw <NAME> lying on the ground unless it was true that at the time when he reached the place of the incident <NAME> had already been injured and had fallen down The omission in this respect Is therefore an omission of a very material part of the Incident which amounts to a contradiction so that the statement before the police under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure was admissible in evidence and could be relied upon to bring out that contradiction during the trial so as to show that the statement made by <NAME> in Court was not reliable in this respect Such an omission would certainly amount to a contradiction Having looked at the judgment delivered by the two learned Judges in that case We are unable to accept the contention of the learned Deputy Government Advocate that the interpretation placed on Section in that case represents the view of the Bench as a whole Even <NAME> in that decision conceded that in some cases the omission in the statement under Section may amount to contradiction of the deposition in <ORG> He proceeded further to hold that these are cases where what is actually stated is irreconcilable with what is omitted and impliedly negatives its existence It is of course correct that if the omission is such that what is actually stated is irreconcilable with what is omitted and impliedly negatives its existence such an omission does amount to contradiction There can be other omissions also on material points which should have found place in the statement made under Section Cr When he was examined by the Investigating Officer he stated that he came on the scene of occurrence and then omitting part of the incident put forward by the prosecution began his deposition by relating a later part of the incident It was held that the omission in his statement to the investigating Officer about the earlier part of the incident amounted to contradiction and could be used for the purpose of disbelieving his deposition in Court that he had seen that earlier part of the incident It was held and in our opinion rightly that the omission in the statement to the Investigating officer in these circumstances amounted to contradiction and could be brought out in the cross examination of the witness under Section Cr can be reconciled with the deposition in <ORG> and can stand with it then there is absolutely no contradiction but when it is put to the witness he may give an explanation which may reconcile them whereupon the contradiction may cease to be a contradiction In these circumstances it appears to us that the appellants were deprived of a valuable right of properly cross examining <NAME> witness and this defect in trial has to be cured When <NAME> is cross examined on this point it may also become necessary to examine the investigating officer in order to prove the statement or part of the statement made by <NAME> to him under Section Cr
