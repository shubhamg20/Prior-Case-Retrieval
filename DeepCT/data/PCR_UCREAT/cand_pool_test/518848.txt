There was an agreement on whereby the assessee agreed to transfer its industrial undertaking and business activity known as <ORG> which was its unit There were some other changes made in the payment terms It was proposed by this letter firstly Rs crores approx was decided to be accepted by the assessee and a Resolution to that effect was passed in the meeting of <ORG> It further filed the returns on declaring the total income of Rs for the Assessment Year Insofar as the Assessment Year is concerned the assessee filed the returns on declaring a loss of Rs The Assessing Officer passed an assessment order dt determining the total income to be Rs which included the amount of interest accrued on deferred sale consideration receivable from <ORG> Replies were given to this Notice the Assessing Officer imposed a penalty of Rs lakhs upon the respondent assessee under Section a of the Act for knowingly furnishing wrong estimate of advance tax on which it had reason to believe to be untrue In Income Tax Reference No of insofar as it pertains to Assessment Year <ORG> held in favour of <ORG> and since there is no appeal by the assessee we need not go into that aspect Again we need not go into that question in this appeal We would have to deal with that issue in this appeal The learned Senior Counsel urged that considering the whole transaction and the relations between the assessee Company and the transferee Company the assessee Company tried to wriggle out the liability to pay the tax The Learned Senior Counsel secondly argued that at any rate the <ORG> and <ORG> had erred in absolving the assessee of the penalty when it was clear that the assessee had failed to furnish the true returns and also failed to pay the due advance tax The learned Counsel therefore supported the impugned judgment and also note that the letter was complied with by <ORG> in providing adequate security of the payable amounts there is nothing to dispute or suspect the genuineness of the transaction There is also no dispute that the assessee was following <ORG> and that the Accounting Year for the Assessment Year was to Thus there was a full scope to the assessee to adjust the interest or as the case may be to defer the same which it did We therefore do not see any justification for a Show Cause Notice under Section read with Section a of the Act on the ground that the assessee had deliberately filed an untrue estimate of the advance tax which he had known or reason to believe to be untrue We also agree with the further finding of <ORG> that the Resolution could not be given any retrospective effect so as to facilitate evasion of tax liability that had already arisen for the Assessment Year We further confirm the finding that since no interest had accrued in the Accounting Year to there could arise no question of relinquishment of interest for any commercial expediency There was no such question because a party cannot relinquish income that has not accrued at all This takes us to the finding of <ORG> insofar as the Reference No of is concerned In this case the authorities below and the <ORG> had held that while filing the Nil estimate of advance tax on the appellant had full knowledge of the interest income of Rs which had accrued and though all this was known to the assessee he had filed the Nil estimate knowingly or it had reason to believe that the Nil estimate was untrue <ORG> while dealing with the issue took the view that the burden was on <ORG> to establish under Section a of the Act that the assessee when it filed the Nil estimate knew or had reason to believe that it was not genuine and was spurious <ORG> therefore took the view that in the background of the said Resolution by which the assessee intended to shift the accrual of interest to it is difficult to accept that the assessee had reason to believe that the Nil estimate was untrue Merely because on assessment the assessee stand that the Resolution which was passed on the last day of its Accounting Year i on was not accepted on the ground that the interest that had already accrued during the Accounting Year on the strength of the contractual terms cannot be made not to accrue after its actual accrual it cannot be inferred with any certainty that the assessee had reason to believe that its Nil estimate was untrue We must clarify here that insofar as Assessment Year is concerned there will be no question of any penalty whatsoever and it had to go as it has been found on facts and law that the Resolution dt had become effective and under the same the interest was already deferred and therefore there was no accrual of interest in that year Assessee had therefore furnished its estimate for the advance tax as Nil as it claimed that it had the income of only about Rs In the subsequent year the assessee claimed the loss of about Rs Though the attempt on the part of the assessee was to give up the accrued interest in the name of commercial expediency there was no valid justification to relinquish the same as has been found by <ORG> <ORG> has also specifically found that the only aim was to avoid payment of tax which had become due on the basis of the accrual of interest and commercial expediency was only a dignified guard in which the arrangement made to evade the tax was sought to be covered We have no hesitation to accept this view of <ORG> Indeed while the levy of interest under Section of the Act is automatic that is not the case with the penalty under Section a of the Act where the mensrea on the part of the assessee would have to be shown to the extent it has been indicated in the language of the Section where therefore there was some scope for the assessee to justify the estimate given by it and that the penalty could not be inflicted We accept the finding of <ORG> which is in the following words no definite conclusion can be drawn that the assesse had reason to belive that the <NAME> estimate filed by it was untrue
