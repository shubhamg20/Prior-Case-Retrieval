This appeal is directed against the judgment of <ORG> whereby <ORG> has allowed the second appeal preferred by the defendants respondents and dismissed the suit brought by the appellants herein The case of <NAME> was that the land in dispute was given to him on patta for consideration of a premium of Rs <NAME> also filed a cross objection against the order of the Tehsildar directing delivery of possession to <NAME> It was held by <ORG> that <NAME> and <NAME> were already in possession of the land since and they planted trees and also constructed two houses over the said plot of land Defendant <NAME> filed a written statement wherein it was pleaded that the suit brought by plaintiff was barred by limitation The trial court framed various issues and one of the issues framed was whether the suit laid by the plaintiff was barred by limitation In view of the matter the trial court held that the suit was filed within the period of limitation The first submission is that the remedy of filing the suit for recovery of possession of the land under Section of the Act is available to a pakka tenant only after exhausting remedy provided under Sections and of the Act and therefore the suit brought by the plaintiff was not barred by limitation In nut shell the argument is that the filing of the suit is not envisaged only after the recourse had been taken under Sections and of the Act and in view of the matter the suit brought by the plaintiff was barred by limitation On the arguments of learned counsel for the parties the questions that arise for consideration are whether the proceedings under Section of the Act is summary in nature and secondly whether it was permissible under law to file a suit for recovery of possession without resorting to remedy available under Section of the Act In order to appreciate the arguments of learned counsel appearing for the parties it is necessary to reproduce Sections and of the Act which run as under Re instatement of pakka tenant improperly dispossessed If a pakka tenant has been dispossessed of the whole or any part of his holding otherwise than in due course of law he or his successor in interest may apply to the Tehsildar within three years from the date of dispossession for the restoration of the possession If the order passed under sub section is in favour of the applicant the Tehsildar shall also award a reasonable compensation to be paid to the applicant by the opposite party The compensation awarded under this section shall be recoverable as arrears of land revenue When final order has been passed under sub section the Tehsildar may require the opposite party to execute a bond for such sum as the Tehsildar may deem fit for abstaining from taking possession of the land in contravention of the order Reinstatement of ordinary tenant or sub tenant improperly dispossessed If an ordinary tenant or a sub tenant has been dispossessed of the whole or any part of his holding otherwise than in due course of law he or his successor in interest may apply to the Tehsildar within two years from the date of dispossession for the restoration of the possession The Tehsildar shall after making necessary enquiry in accordance with the provisions of section pass such orders as he thinks fit Civil Courts jurisdiction in regard to sections and No order passed under section and shall preclude any person from establishing such rights as he may claim in the whole or any part of the holding and from obtaining possession of such holding or part thereof by means of a regular suit in a competent civil court Under Section of the Specific Relief Act a person who has been dispossessed otherwise than in due course of law can claim restoration of possession without proving his title to the land Learned counsel appearing for the respondent then pointed out that Section is in pari materia to Section of Land Revenue Code and a Full Bench of High <ORG> while interpreting Section of the Code has held that proceedings under Section of the Code is summary in nature and therefore in view of the said decision the proceedings under Section of the Act has to be held as summary in nature It is true that the courts while construing a provision of an enactment often follow the decisions by the courts construing similar provision of an enactment in pari materia The object behind the application of the said rule of construction is to avoid contradiction between the two statutes dealing with the same subject But in the present case what we find is that the Madhya Bharat Land Revenue and Tenancy Act contains one integrated scheme providing for remedy to a pakka tenant claiming restoration of possession under sections and of the Act In repealing Act i Land Revenue Code we do not find any provision like Section of the Act It is not sound principle of construction to interpret a provision of an enactment following the decisions rendered on similar provision of an enactment when two statutes are not in pari materia Coming to the next question whether the plaintiff could have brought a suit for restoration of possession under Section of the Act without resorting to remedy provided under Section of the Act it is necessary to look into the relevant provisions of the Act An analysis of Section read with Section shows that the recourse to a civil court is not available to a pakka tenant who has been dispossessed unless he exhausts the remedy under Section of the Act Section of the Code of Civil Procedure provides that the civil courts shall have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature except suits of which their cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred Exclusive jurisdiction of <ORG> Except as otherwise provided in this Act <ORG> shall entertain any suit instituted or application made to obtain a decision or order on any matter which the Government are or a Revenue Officer is by this Act empowered to determine decide or dispose of The provisions of the Act besides conferring right on a pakka tenant for restoration of possession of the land from which he has been dispossessed provides for complete procedure and machinery for getting the relief of restoration of possession The scheme envisaged under the Act which comprises of Sections and of the Act shows that where a pakka tenant who has been dispossessed without due course of law and such a pakka tenant wants restoration of possession there is implied exclusion of the jurisdiction of the civil court to grant relief to a pakka tenant In view of the matter it cannot be said that remedy available under Section of the Act is discretionary and it is open to a pakka tenant either to take recourse to Section of the Act or file suit under Section of the Act The third question that arises for consideration in this case is whether once a remedy available under Section of the Act is resorted to the period of limitation for adverse possession is arrested Law Journal it was held as under It is true that in instant case no suit for recovery of possession was filed but only proceedings under Section of the Code were filed We accordingly set aside the judgment under challenge
