JUDGMENT This is a suit filed for challenging the validity of certain orders passed under the provisions of the foreign exchange Regulation Act and the Sea Customs act and for recovering baci tolas of gold confiscated in accordance with these orders By its order dated the central <ORG> held that it saw no reason to interfere with the order passed by the collector of customs Bombay By his advocates letter dated December th the plaintiff served anotice under section of the Code of Civil Procedure in connection with this suit on the Union of India and the collector of customs and ultimately on February th the plaintiff filed this suit once again to challenge the aforesaid orders By their written statement the defendants have raised contentions tehcnical as well as on merits Whether this Hoble court has jurisdiction to entertain and try this suit Whether the suit is barred by the rule of res judicata as stated in para of the written statement Such authority or officer may thereupon make such further enquiry and pass such order as he thinks fit Xx xx Every order passed in appeal under this section shall subject to the power of revision conferred by section of final of the Act the order of <ORG> must be held to be final except when it is found to be patently arbitray or perverse or where it is found that fundamental principles of natural justice have been violated a the proceedings wherein the orders were made Even if jurisdiction is to excluded the <ORG> courts have jurisdiction to examine into cases where the provisions of the Act have not been complied with or the statutory tribunal was not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure An order passed in appeal under Section of the Sea customs Act excludes the jurisdiction of the civil courts to entertain a challenge of the merits of that decision In my view there is no allegation made in the plaint that either the collector of customs or the central <ORG> had no power to make theorder which they made that the provision of the Act had not been complied with or that the tribunal had not acted in conformity with the fundamental principles of judicial procedure I cannot accept the contention of Mr <NAME> that the plaint does not disclose any cause of action of any kind against the defendants or that in this case the court has no jurisdiction by reason of the provisions of section of the sea customs Act He has also pointed out that it is absolutely essential for the plaintiff to challenge the order made in appeal by <ORG> and that amittedly that order was made by the central <ORG> at Delhi Mr <NAME> says that since a material part of the cause of action arose outside Bombay this court could not have jurisdiction without plaintiff having obtained leave under Clause XII of the Letters Patent in the first instance As the order of <ORG> was that it saw no reason to interfere with the order passed by the collector of customs Bombay and the order in revision was zalso that the government of India saw no reason to interfere with the order in appeal passed by <ORG> it was not necessary for the plaintiff to challenge the order in appeal and the order in revision and that the effective and subsisting order was the order of the collector of customs which was made in Bombay Now in my view it is well settled that where the Statute provides for an appeal and an appeal is filed the subsisting and effective order must be held to be the order and or decision of the appellate court and not of the first court or the trial court It provides that such authority or officer which refers to the appellate authority may thereupon make such further enquiry and pass such order as he thinks fit confirming altering or annulling the decision or order appealed against The wording of the order made by <ORG> or <ORG> viz that it saw no reason to interfere with th order passed by the collector of customs Bombay does not in any manner detract from the position that the order which gtoverns the rights of the parties is the order of the Central <ORG> and not of the collector of customs I hold that it was necessary for the plaintiff to apply for and obtain leave under cl XII of the Letters Patent before this court could have jurisdiction to try and entertain this suti The plaintiff having failed to obtain such leave I also hold that this court has no jurisdiction to try this suit He further held that the final authorityy to determine whether in a given case there was import was vested in the customs collector and that this court was not entitled to set aside a finding made by the customs collector in that connection Against that decision on merits by <NAME> the petitioner plaintiff did not file any appeal Putting it in another form it may be said that ever suit must be sustained by a cause of action and there is no cause of action to sustasin the second suit of the same party it being merged in the judgment in the first If <NAME> had not gone into the merits of the contentions of the plaintiff there might have been some scope for argument that there is no question of finally findings having been made and that in spite of a writ petition having been dismissed the plaintiff was entitled to file this suit of the constitution is not a civil proceeding within the meaning of Art of the constitution and that the petitioner had no right of appeal to the supreme court under that Article He has a right an independent right to appraoch the <ORG> court under Art Apart from that there is a right of appeal given to the citizen from an order of refusal of the High court to enforce his fundamental righhts He has the right to ask <ORG> to grant him special leave to appeal under Art The result therefore is that this suit is dismissed with costs
