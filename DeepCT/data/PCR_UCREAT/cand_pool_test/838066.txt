The Senior Electric Inspector issued a notice to the first res pondent to show cause as to why an order under of the Indian Electricity Act requiring discontinuance of the operation of the electric motors in the said factory should not be made The first respondent challenged the said order by a writ petition contending inter alia that there was no Telegraph Line in the Posts and Telegraphs Wireless Station within the meaning of of the Act In a modern progressive society it would be unreasonable to confine the intention of a <ORG> to the meaning attributable to the word used at the time the law was made and unless a contrary intention appeared an interpretation should be given to the words used to take in new facts and situations if the words are capable of comprehending them The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal raises the question of construction of the expression telegraph line in of the Indian Electricity Act Act of hereinafter called the Act The first respondent <NAME> carries on business as motor coach builder under the name and style of <ORG> having his factory at Regent Park Tollygunge in the suburbs of Calcutta Within a distance of feet of the said factory there is a Post and Telegraph Wireless Station which besides functioning as a coast station communicating with ships at sea handles public messages in large volume from Darjeeling Shillong Gauhati Agartala and New Delhi On January the first respondent filed a petition in <ORG> at Calcutta under Art It was contended interalia that there was no telegraph line in the Post and Telegraph Wireless Station within the meaning of of the Act and therefore the notice issued by the Senior Electric Inspector was without jurisdiction The present appeal is directed against the said order It is not disputed that in the said factory a number of <ORG> are operated for the purpose of working electric drills and it is also established that the interference with the reception of messages at the Telegraph Wireless Station is attributable to local induction from the said factory <NAME> observed at Of course no one supposes that the legislature intended to refer specifically to telephones many years before they were invented but it is highly probable that they would and it seems to us clear that they actually did use language embracing future discoveries as to the use of electricity for the purpose of conveying intelligence There is a good reason for this change in the mode of interpretation But in a modem progressive society it would be unreasonable to confine the intention of a <ORG> to the meaning attributable to the word used at the time the law was made for a modern <ORG> making laws to govern a society which is fast moving must be presumed to be aware Indeed unless a contrary intention appears an interpretation should be given to the words used to take in new facts and situations if the words are capable of comprehending them In the result we set aside the order of <ORG> and dismiss the petition filed by the first respondent
