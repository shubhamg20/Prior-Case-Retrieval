RAJENDRA BABU This petition is filed against the judgment passed by <ORG> affirming a decree passed by the learned Single Judge of <ORG> for a sum of Rs lakhs on application of the respondent for judgment upon admission as provided under Order XII Rule of the Code of Civil Procedure Certain disputes having arisen petitioner filed suits against the respondent Banks that the debits raised are illegal etc A copy of the aforesaid resolution was sent to the plaintiff with the following note as indicated in the letter dated th June a We do not confirm the debit entry of Rs representing your share of the invoked guarantee with interest upto which has been effected by you unauthorisedly against the illegal payment made by <ORG> We are enclosing a copy of the reply given to the Legal Notice received by us from them At their request a copy of the <ORG> circular was given to them and had also been sent to you The petitioners filed an affidavit in opposition to contend that That the defendant No suit is barred by limitation That the resolution dated was passed subject to a condition that the inland guarantee limit would be resumed and that as the condition was not fulfilled the resolution was no binding It is categorically denied that there is any admission of liability by the first respondent to the Petitioner to the extent of Rs as on th March or that since the said alleged admission of the liability the claim of the Petitioner has increased and it is now more than Rs crores as wrongly alleged if at all It was stated that <ORG> has filed a suit against the defendants for recovery of all the amounts advanced by the consortium to the defendant No and that suit was still pending therefore they were estopped from filing that suit and making an independent claim against the defendant No That several claims have been included in the suit in respect of which another suit has been filed in <ORG> and therefore the amount could not be recovered That the defendants in the suit had filed a separate suit in which he had claimed for certain reliefs which would nullify the claim made by the plaintiff in the suit The learned trial judge found that there is an unequivocal admission of the contents of the documents and what is denied is the extent of admission and the increase of the liability admitted Learned Counsel for the appellant contended that Order XII Rule comes under the heading admissions and a judgment on admission could be given only after due opportunity to the other side to explain the admission if any made that such admission should have been made only in the course of the pleadings or else the other side will not have an opportunity to explain such admission that even though the provision reads that the court may at any stage of the suit make such order as it thinks fit effect of admission if any can be considered only at the time of trial that the admission even in pleadings will have to be read along with order VIII Rule of <ORG> and <ORG> need not necessarily proceed to pass an order or a judgment on the basis of such admission but call upon the party relying upon such admission to prove its case independently that during pendency of other suits and the nature of contentions raised in the case it would not be permissible at all to grant the relief before trial as has been done in the present case that the expression admissions made in the course of the pleadings or otherwise will have to be read together and the expression otherwise will have to be interpreted ejusdem generis In the objects and reasons set out while amending the said rule it is stated that where a claim is admitted the court has jurisdiction to enter a judgment for the plaintiff and to pass a decree on admitted claim Where other party has made a plain admission entitling the former to succeed it should apply and also wherever there is a clear admission of facts in the face of which it is impossible for the party making such admission to succeed The next contention convassed is that the resolutions or minutes of meeting of the <ORG> resolution passed thereon and the letter sending the said resolution to the respondent bank cannot amount to a pleading or come within the scope of the Rule as such statements are not made in the course of the pleadings or otherwise Statements had been made in the course of the Minutes of the Board of Directors held on th May to which we have already adverted to in detail In the pleadings raised before the Court there is a clear statement made by the respondent as to the undisputed part of the claim made by them The denial is evasive and the learned judge is perfectly justified in holding that there is an unequivocal admission of the contents of the documents and what is denied is extent of the admission but the increase in the liability is admitted The learned counsel for the appellant relied on a decision of this Court in <NAME> Vs <NAME> Others as to when an admission becomes relevant In <NAME> supra which is locus classicus on the subject states that merely because a written admission made in a different context such admission may not become relevant if the party making it has a reasonable explanation of that SCC in which the court was concerned with a case of the effect of not filing a written statement and whether a decree could be passed only on that basis In that case what was noticed was that in cases governed by Section and Section of Specific Relief Act the court is not bound to grant declaration prayed for on the mere admission of the claim by the defendant if the court has reason to insist upon a clear proof apart from admission We are not impressed with the contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that there is no admission for the purpose of Order XII Rule at all nor that the admission if any is conditional because we cannot spell out any conditions stated therein nor the dismissal of application filed by <ORG> in the suit has any relevance
