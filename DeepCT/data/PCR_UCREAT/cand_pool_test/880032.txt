HEADNOTE The appellants filed a suit for an injunction restraining the respondents from infringing their registered trade mark used on packets of biscuits manufactured by them The suit was dismissed by the trial court and <ORG> Allowing the appeal to this <ORG> HELD Under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who uses in the course of trade a mark which is identical with or deceptively similar to the trade mark in relation to any goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered and the expression deceptively similar means a mark which so nearly resembles another mark as likely to deceive or cause confusion They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This is an appeal by special leave from a judgment of <ORG> confirming the dismissal of a suit for an injunction restraining the respondent from infringing the registered trade mark of the plaintiffs used on packets of biscuits The plaintiffs claim that they have been selling their biscuits on an extensive scale for many years past under the said trade mark which acquired great reputation and goodwill among As in spite of lawyer notice the defendants persisted in manufacturing selling and using the wrappers complained of with regard to their biscuits the plaintiffs filed the suit claiming injunction as already mentioned They pleaded further that there was a good deal of difference in the design of their wrapper from that of the plaintiffs and relied on certain features of their design which were said to be quite dissimilar to those of the plaintiffs wrapper inasmuch as the defendant wrapper contained the picture of a girl supporting with one band a bundle of hay on her head and carrying a sickle and a bundle of food in the other the cow and hens being unlike those of the plaintiffs wrappers The trial court meticulously examined the features found on the two wrappers and the packets of biscuits produced before it and took the view that there were greater points of dissimilarity than of similarity between the two and as such it was unlikely that the defendants goods could be passed off as and for the goods of the plaintiffs After pointing out the distinguishing features of the wrappers the trial court concluded that there was no chance of a seller committing fraud on a customer and an ordinary purchaser would certainly refuse to purchase the defendants goods if he was offered them as and for the plaintiffs goods Accordingly the trial court held that the plaintiffs had failed to establish their case Although <ORG> held that in such a case it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to adduce evidence that any particular individual had been deceived by the defendants wrapper and it was undeniable that the general get up of the two wrappers was more or less similar it went on to observe that the court had to bear in mind that it was dealing with packets of biscuits which were generally used by people of the upper classes and a purchaser desirous of getting a packet of <ORG> biscuits would go and ask for the same as such in which case there could be no scope for deception again the plaintiffs could have no cause for grievance if a purchaser was content to buy any biscuits which were offered to him by the shopkeeper <ORG> also took the view that there were several distinguishing features between the two wrappers and these could be noticed even from a distance Even if we take the broad features of the two wrappers into consideration we do not think that they are similar Under of the Act of the registration of a person in the register as proprietor of a trade mark in respect of any goods gave to that person the exclusive right to the use of the Trade mark in relation to those goods and that right was to be deemed to be infringed by any person who not being the proprietor of the trade mark or a registered user thereof using by way of the permitted use used a mark identical with it or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion in the course of trade in relation to any goods in respect of which it was registered deceptively similar has now been defined under of the Act of thus A mark shall be deemed to be deceptively similar to another mark if it so nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion It is to be noted that although there was no such provision in the definition section of the Act of of the said Act was to the same effect The action for infringement is a statutory remedy conferred on the registered proprietor of a registered trade mark for the vindication of the exclusive right to the use of he trade mark in relation to those goods vide of the Act In the above case the Court further pointed out In an action for infringement the plaintiff must no doubt make out that the use of the defendant mark is likely to deceive but where the similarity between the plaintiff and the defendant mark is so close either visually phonetically or otherwise and the court reaches the conclusion that there is an imitation no further evidence is required to establish that the plaintiff rights are violated Expressed in another way if the essential features of the trade mark of the plaintiff have been adopted by the defendant the fact that the get up packing and other writing or marks on the goods or on the packets hi which he offers his goods for sale show marked differences or indicate clearly a trade or in different from that of the regis tered proprietor of the mark would be material whereas in the case of passing off the defendant may escape liability if he can show that the added matter is sufficient to distinguish his goods from those of the plaintiff According to <NAME> Law of Trade Marks and Trade th edition paragraph Two marks when placed side by side may exhibit many and various differences vet the main idea left on the mind by both may be the same A person acquainted with one mark and not having the two side by side for comparison might well be deceived if the goods were allowed to be impressed with the second mark into a belief that he was dealing with goods which Thus for example a mark may represent a game of football another mark may show players in a different dress and in very different positions and yet the idea conveyed by each might be simply a game of football It would be too much to expect that persons dealing with trade marked goods and relying as they frequently do upon marks should be able to remember the exact details of the marks upon the goods with which they are in the habit of dealing Marks are remembered rat her by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole Moreover variations in detail might well be supposed by customers to have been made by the owners of the trade mark they are already acquainted with for reasons of their own They should not be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other It would be enough if the impugned mark bears such an overall similarity to the registered mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him After all an ordinary purchaser is not gifted with the powers of observation of <NAME> We have therefore no doubt that the defendants wrapper is deceptively similar to the plaintiffs which was registered We do not think it necessary to refer to the decisions referred to at the Bar as in our view each case will have to be judged on its own features and it would be of no use to note on how many points there was similarity and in how many others there was absence of it The appellants will be entitled to their costs throughout
