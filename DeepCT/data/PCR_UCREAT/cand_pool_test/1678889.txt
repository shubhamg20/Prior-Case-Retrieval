The <ORG> rejected the contention of the assessee and held that the cash credits in question were unexplained cash credits that they represented the income of the assessee from undisclosed source and accordingly made an addition of Rs Act cannot be construed as conferring any benefit concession or immunity on any person other than the person making the declaration under the provisions of the Act The scheme of the Act makes it abundantly clear that it was to protect only those who preferred to disclose the income they themselves had earned in The past and which they had failed to disclose at the proper time Act by virtue of which the amount declared by the declarant had to be charged to income tax as if such amount were the total income of the declarant was limited in scope and it cannot be invoked in assessment proceedings relating to any person other than the person making the declaration and did not take away the power vested in the <ORG> under section of the Income Tax Act to reject the explanation of an assessee for a cash credit on the ground that the explanation was not satisfactory in the case of such other person There was therefore nothing to prevent an investigation into the true nature and source of the cash credits In a case of this description there was no question of double taxation which was a situation of assessee own making in getting false declarations made in the names of the creditors with a view to avoid higher slab of taxation once it was found that the income declared by the creditors did not belong to them there was nothing to prevent the same being taxed in the hands of the assessee to which it actually belonged Consequently the general principles which apply to assessments made under the Income Tax Act would except for provision to the contrary be applicable to assessments made under section of the Finance No Accordingly when the assessment to income tax is made under the latter enactment it will be governed by the general principle that a finding recorded therein governs only the particular person assessed Accordingly when the assessment to income tax is made under the latter enactment it will be governed by the general principle that a finding recorded therein governs only the particular person assessed I would answer the first question in the affirmative in favour of the <ORG> and against the assessee The firm consists of partners namely <NAME> and his major sons <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> with his minor son <NAME> admitted to the benefits of the partnership credited in the books of account of the assessee in the names of the creditors who had no income of their own must be treated as the assessee income from undisclosed sources He accordingly held that the acceptance of the voluntary disclosures made by the creditors in question to the Commissioner and the payment of tax thereon precluded the <ORG> from disputing that the income belonged to the said creditors and as the same income cannot be taxed twice once in the hands of the creditors and again in the hands of the assessee the order passed by the <ORG> in that behalf was unsustainable It was of the opinion that the <ORG> was justified in treating the cash credits appearing in the books of account of the assessee in the names of the creditors as unexplained cash credits since it was found that the A income declared by the creditors did not belong to them and there was nothing to prevent the same being taxed in the hands of the assessee to which it actually belonged According to the <ORG> the immunity under of the Act was conferred on the declarant only and there was nothing to preclude an investigation into the true nature and source of the credits The question in fact is whether the provisions of of the Act can be construed as conferring any benefit concession or immunity on any person other than the person making the declaration under the provisions of the Act It may be mentioned that to avoid any room for doubt the legislature has introduced in the Voluntary Disclosures of Income and Wealth Act Act No of which specifically provides that save as otherwise provided in the Act nothing contained in the Act shall be construed as conferring any benefit concession or immunity on any person other than the person making the declaration under the provisions of the Act The question for consideration is whether the absence of such a provision as is found in Act No of leads to the consequence that acceptance of a declaration under of the Act confers a benefit which is not provided by the Act on a person other than the declarants and takes away the power of the <ORG> under of the Income Tax Act to make an investigation as to the nature and source of a cash credit appearing in the books of the assesssee to reject the explanation offered by the assessee as unsatisfactory and to treat it as his income from undisclosed sources Act provided for the making of voluntary disclosures in respect of amounts representing income chargeable to tax under the Income Tax Act or the Income tax Act for any assessment year commencing on or before April On such disclosure being made under sub I thereof in the manner provided by sub the amount was to be charged to Income tax in accordance with sub which provided by a legal fiction that income tax shall be charged on the amounts of voluntarily disclosed income at certain specified rates as if such amount were the total income of the declarant There was a safeguard provided in sub that the benefit under the scheme would be available only in respect of the voluntarily disclosed income and not in respect of the amount detected or deemed to have been detected by the <ORG> before the date of declaration When the Commissioner of Income Tax passed an order under sub there was an appeal provided to <ORG> under sub and the <ORG> was empowered under sub to pass such orders thereon as it deemed fit Secondly it is urged that sub I read with sub of of the Act has a overriding effect over of the Income Tax Act and therefore the <ORG> could not make any investigation as to the nature and source of the cash credits and thirdly it is submitted that there cannot be double taxation of the same income once in the hands of the creditors and again in the hands of the assessee These submissions proceed on a wrongful assumption that there is a finality attached under sub to the legal fiction created by sub for which there is no basis whatever Subject to the provisions of this section where any person makes on or after the th day of August and before the st day of April a declaration in accordance with sub section in respect of the amount representing income chargeable to tax under the Indian Income tax Act or the Income tax Act for assessment year commencing on or before the st day of April a for which he has failed to furnish a return within the time allowed under section of the Indian Income tax Act or section of the Income tax Act or which he has failed to disclose in a return of in come filed by him on or before the th day of August under the Indian Income Tax Act or the Income Tax Act or which has escaped assessment by reason of the omission or failure on the part of such person to make a return under either of the said Acts to the Income tax officer or to disclose fully and truly material facts necessary for his assessment he shall notwithstanding anything contained in the said Acts be charged income tax in accordance with sub section in respect of the amount so declared or it more than one declaration has been made by a person the aggregate of the amounts declared therein as reduced by any amount specified in any order made under sub section or if such amount is altered by an order of the <ORG> under sub section then such altered amount Sub containing the legal fiction reads as follows Income tax shall be charged on the amount of the voluntarily disclosed income a where the declarant is a person other than a company at the rates specified in paragraph A and where the declarant is a company at the rates specified in Paragraph of Part I of First Schedule to the Finance Act of as if such amount were the total income of the declarant Sub on which strong reliance is placed runs thus An order under sub section shall be final and shall not be called in question before any Court of law or any other authority The crux of the matter is whether the provisions of of the Act can be construed as conferring any benefit concession or immunity on any person other than the person making the declaration under the provisions of the Act Under sub I of a person was required to make a voluntary disclosure in respect of the amount representing the income chargeable to tax under the Indian Income Tax Act or the Income Tax Act for any assessment year commencing on or before April If a person made a declaration the Commissioner was under an obligation to assess him to tax Further facilities were allowed to payment of tax in appropriate instalments extending over a period not exceeding four years subject to a down payment of not less than of the tax due and furnishing a security in respect of the balance The scheme of the Act makes it abundantly clear that it was to protect only those who preferred to disclose the income they themselves had earned in the past and which they had failed to disclose at the appropriate time But there is no warrant for the proposition that by enacting the same the legislature intended to permit or connive at any fraud sought to be committed by making benami declarations That takes us to the contention based on the legal fiction contained in sub of of the Act and the finality of the assessment by virtue of sub thereof If therefore a person made a false declaration with regard to income not earned by him it is difficult to comprehend how the <ORG> could be prevented from proceeding against the person to whom the income actually belonged and during the course of whose assessment the concealed income is detected The immunity under of the Act was conferred on the declarant only and there was nothing to preclude an investigation into the true nature and source of the credits If therefore a person made a false declaration with respect to an amount which was not his income but was the income of somebody else then there was nothing to prevent an investigation into the true nature and sources of the said amount There was nothing in of the Act which prevented the ITO if he was not satisfied with the explanation of an assessee about the genuineness or source of an amount found credited in his books in spite of its having already been made the subject of a declaration by the creditor and then taxed under the scheme We find no warrant for the submission that had an overriding effect over of the Income Tax Act insofar as the persons other than the declarants were concerned In our judgment the legal fiction created by sub of of the Act by virtue of which the amount declared by the declarant was to be charged to income tax as if such amount were the total income of the declarant was limited in its scope and it cannot be invoked in assessment proceedings relating to any person other than the person making the declaration under the Act so as to rule out the applicability of of the Income Tax Act In a case of this description there is no question of double taxation Once it was found that the income declared by the creditors did not belong to them there was nothing to prevent the same being taxed in the hands of the assessee to which it actually belonged There was therefore nothing which prevented the <ORG> officer from investigating into the nature and source of the sums credited in the books of account of an assessee and reject his explanation to the effect that the sums belonged to the persons who had made declarations about them under of the Act On the construction placed on sub of of the Act it must also be held that the ITO was justified in treating the cash credits appearing in the books of account of the assessee amounting to Rs
