For the purpose of convenience we shall refer to the facts of the case as found in A Nos of Being aggrieved by the said order of disallowing some of the deductions claimed by it the respondent preferred appeals before the Commissioner of Appeals who allowed most of the deductions sought by the respondent except three items out of which discount damages was one of the items Having failed in the appeal before the Appellate <ORG> the respondent approached the <ORG> once again and the <ORG> by the impugned order allowed the appeal of the respondent once again solely relying on its judgments in <ORG> and <ORG> cases supra and held that discount should be allowed in regard to the value of compensation paid to the buyers in lieu of damages caused to goods during transit depending on the nature and extent of damage <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing for the respondent firstly contended that the appellants should not be permitted to question the finding of the <ORG> as to the deductibility of the damage discount because this question was finally adjudicated and decided by the <ORG> in the first round of litigation between the parties and the appellants did not at that stage question the finding of the <ORG> which remanded the matter back to the original <ORG> to decide certain other questions He also defended the impugned order of the <ORG> on the ground that the deductions permissible under Section ii are not confined only to deductions available at the time of removal of the goods from the factory gate but are also available to such of those deductions whose existence in practice has been established even though they get computed subsequent to the removal of the goods from the factory gate It is true that this issue was decided by the <ORG> in the earlier round of litigation primarily relying upon two orders to which we have already made reference the correctness of that finding was not challenged in this <ORG> because the matter stood remanded to the original <ORG> Inspite of this finding of the <ORG> the parties again joined issue before the original <ORG> on this issue by producing materials like affidavits and made their submissions based on which the original <ORG> gave a finding against the respondent who took the matter in appeal before the Appellate Commissioner and having lost before the Appellate Commissioner the respondent once again took the matter before the <ORG> From the materials on record we do not find any argument based on finality of the decision having been urged before the <ORG> nor the <ORG> having decided this issue on that basis He also relied upon a subsequent decision of this Court in <ORG> case reported in at page wherein this Court after referring to the judgment in the earlier case of supra held As rightly pointed out by <NAME> in the order dated what is really relevant is the nature of the transaction SCC para The learned Chief Justice pointed out further that the warranty is not a discount on the tyre already sold but relates to the goods which are being subsequently sold to the same customers It is in the nature of a benefit given to the customers by way of compensation for the loss suffered by them in the previous sale SCC para He further contended that the affidavits of the buyers filed by the respondents which are contrary to the terms of the agreement are neither admissible nor can be relied upon <NAME> per contra contends that the deductions contemplated under Section ii of the Act are not confined only to deductions that could be attributable to a stage prior to the removal of the goods from the factory gate only He laid special emphasis on deduction allowed on account of insurance The <ORG> was of the view that the said decisions fully covered the issue that arose for its consideration in the impugned order In <ORG> the <ORG> at para of its order held thus In Appeal No A there is an additional point of dispute In the appeal before us it is contended that there was reduction of upto in some cases From a perusal of this part of the order we are unable to deduce any principle either in law or in facts decided by the <ORG> so as to make it applicable to the issue that arose before it in the case with which we are concerned After carefully considering the said order we are unable to agree with the <ORG> that those cases either wholly or in part cover the issue involved in the present case Following the above order we direct the <ORG> to verify the nature and quantum of discount for damage caused to the goods in the transit and allow the same It is seen that this order of the <ORG> is based on certain admissions made by the parties and reliance was once again placed on the order in Assam Valley which according to us does not lay down any principle in law When the original <ORG> took up the matter for consideration after remand the respondent filed certain affidavits of its buyers who in their own words have stated that some trade practice was existing whereby the respondent company was reimbursing the loss suffered by the buyers due to the damages caused to the goods Even though this document was produced only at the first appellate stage we find it has direct bearing on the question in issue in view of the contents of clause of the said agreement Based on this clause it is contended for the appellant that no trade practice in regard to damage deduction is in existence the respondent places reliance on clause of the said agreement which according to the respondent creates an obligation on the respondent to compensate the buyers for the loss suffered by them due to damage to the goods We feel this raises primarily a question of fact and is a matter which goes to the root of the claim therefore it should be decided in the first instance by the original <ORG> We make it clear that we have not expressed any opinion with reference to the various arguments addressed before us and referred to in this order of ours except to the extent of the finding delivered by us in regard to the finality of the decision rendered by the <ORG> in the earlier round of proceedings and in regard to the correctness of the reliance placed by the <ORG> on the two orders of its own while allowing the appeal of the respondent which according to us is unsustainable
