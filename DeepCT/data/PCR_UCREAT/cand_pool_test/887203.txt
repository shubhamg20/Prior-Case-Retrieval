The assessee maintained that by the conversion of pineapple fruit into its products no new commodity was created and it was erroneous to say that there was a consumption of pineapple fruit in the manufacture of these goods When pineapple fruit is processed into pineapple slices for the purpose of being sold in sealed cans there is no consumption of the original pineapple fruit for the purpose of manufacture within the meaning of Section A a of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act There are several criteria for determining whether a commodity is consumed in the manufacture of another The nature and extent of processing may vary from one case to another and indeed there may be several stages of processing and perhaps a different kind of processing at each stage But it is only when the change or a series of changes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but instead is recognised as a new and distinct article that a manufacture can be said to take place Where there is no essential difference in identity between the original commodity and the processed article it is not possible to say that one commodity has been consumed in the manufacture of another Although it has undergone a degree of processing it must be regarded as still retaining its original identity A In the present case there is no essential difference between pineapple fruit and the canned pineapple slices The fact that the pineapple slices appeal to a different sector of the trade and that when a customer asks for a can of pineapple slices he has in mind something very different from fresh pineapple fruit does not give to the canned pineapple slices a separate identity either The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> holding that the turnover of pineapple fruit purchased for preparing pineapple slices for sale in sealed cans is not covered by A a of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act <ORG> the assessee carries on the business of manufacturing and selling canned fruit besides other products Levy of purchase tax Every dealer who in the course of his business purchases from a registered dealer or from any other person any goods the sale or purchase of which is liable to tax under this Act in circumstances in which no tax is payable under section and either a consumes such goods in the manufacture of other goods for sale or otherwise or shall whatever be the quantum of the turnover relating to such purchase for a year pay tax on the taxable turnover relating to such purchase for the year at the rates mentioned in section The assessee maintained that by the conversion of pineapple fruit into its products no new commodity was created and it was erroneous to say that there was a consumption of pineapple fruit in the manufacture of those goods There are several criteria for determining whether a commodity is consumed in the manufacture of another The nature and extent of processing may vary from one case to another and indeed there may be several stages of processing and perhaps a different kind of processing at each stage But it is only when the change or a series of changes take the commodity to the point where commercially it can no longer be regarded as the original commodity but instead is recognised as a new and distinct article that a manufacture can be said to take place Where there is no essential difference in identity between the original commodity and the processed article it is not possible to say that one commodity has been consumed in the manufacture of another Although it has undergone a degree of processing it must be regarded as still retaining its original identity A large number of cases has been placed before us by the parties and in each of them the same principle has been applied Does the processing of the original commodity bring into existence a commercially different and distinct article In the present case there is no essential difference between pineapple fruit and the canned pineapple slices But it is no more drastic a change than the change which takes place in milk from pasturising homogenizing adding vitamin concentrates standardising and bottling It was also observed there is hardly less difference between cotton in the field and cotton at the gin or in the bale or between cottonseed in the field and cottonseed at the gin than between a chicken in the pen and one that is dressed Referring to <ORG> United States the Court said Manufacture implies a change but every change is not manufacture and yet every change in an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation But something more is necessary There must be transformation a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use But where the commodity retains a continuing substantial identity through the processing stage we cannot say that it has been manufactured It is said that pineapple slices appeal to a different sector of the trade and that when a customer asks for a can of pineapple slices he has in mind something very different from fresh pineapple fruit Learned counsel for the <ORG> contends that even if no manufacturing process is involved the case still falls within A a of the Kerala General Sales Tax Act because the statutory provision speaks not only of goods consumed in the manufacture of other goods for sale but also goods consumed otherwise There is a fallacy in the submission
