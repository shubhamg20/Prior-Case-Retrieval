The first defendant pleaded in substance that appellant and his uncle the respondent formed a joint Hindu family that the bond was taken on behalf of the joint family and that he had made a part payment to the respondent The respondent supporting the statement made by the first defendant sought to intervene He had also brought suit upon the same bond against the first defendant The decision of the objection to the order of the <ORG> below turns on the meaning of the words in Section of the Code of Civil Procedure whose presence before the <ORG> may be necessary to enable the <ORG> effectually and completely to adjudicate upon and settle all the questions involved in the suit Is it meant by these words that a person not originally impleaded is to be made a party only if the questions raised in the suit cannot otherwise be completely and effectually determined between the parties to the suit or is it meant completely and effectually determined so that they shall not be again raised in that or in any other suit between the parties to the suit or any of them and third parties To accept the more restricted interpretation involves the addition of words which we do not find in the section namely between the parties to the suit and there can be few if any questions which cannot be determined between the parties to the suit one way or the other and of which the determination if they be material will as between the parties to the suit not be final Reading the whole of the rules under Order XVI of the Judicature Act together it seems clear that Rule should be interpreted in the larger sense To secure this result the <ORG> has a discretion to add parties which it should exercise unless by the addition of new parties either of the parties already on the record would be prejudiced or hindered of their remedies The appeal is dismissed with costs
