Vs RESPONDENT THE MANAGEMENT OF <ORG> OTHERS DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH Mohapatra Venkatarama Reddi JUDGMENT <NAME> Leave granted and appeal taken up for hearing The Writ Petition out of which the appeal arises was filed by the second appellant herein challenging the award passed by <ORG> on The st appellant sought leave of this <ORG> to file the SLP as it was not a party in the Writ Petition out of which this SLP arises The following dispute between <ORG> Basudevpur Munger and their workmen represented by <ORG> which is a recognised union was referred for adjudication by <ORG> Whether to enforce Platinum Jubilee Scheme Pension Plan for the workers who retired from service on or after and to enforce other pension scheme for the workers retired before the and to give two types of benefits to both types of workers by the Management of I Ltd <ORG> is legal and justified If not whether the workers who retired before from I Ltd While so pursuant to discussions and negotiations held in the course of conciliation proceedings there was a settlement under Section of Industrial Disputes Act on Under the Trust Deed dated <ORG> constituted the ITC Platinum Jubilee Pension Fund to be administered by the trustees who are required to hold the fund in trust for the benefit of the members or other persons set forth in the Rules The Fund shall be vested in the trustees who shall have the entire control of the funds Under the heading Contribution it is provided that the <ORG> may pay to the trustees in respect of the members an initial contribution as may be certified by the Actuary subject to Rule of the Income Tax Rules Under clause of Rule it is enjoined that the <ORG> shall pay to the trustee in respect of each member an ordinary annual contribution as may be certified by the Actuary subject to I Rules and While accepting that Article as such has no application because <ORG> is not a State or other <ORG> the counsel however urged that on the analogy of Article the relevant clauses in the settlement are to be held to be arbitrary unjust and irrational that the prescription of cut off date i which has the effect of denying greater benefits under the scheme to the workmen who retired before that date is equally arbitrary discriminatory and unjust and therefore the settlement entered into on cannot defeat the legitimate rights of the workmen who retired before It is further submitted that all the workmen drawing pension under the Company Rules settlements belong to one class and there cannot be sub classification amongst them by treating the workmen who retired between and as a different class It is argued that when the benefit is given to the workmen who retired within the two dates afore mentioned the same benefit ought to have been extended at least to those who retired after the date of the settlement of i The learned Senior counsel for the respondent Company while drawing support from the reasoning and conclusions of <ORG> in the case reported in PLJR has laid considerable stress on the fact that the employees of the Company existing or retired cannot invoke Article and they as well as the Management and other workmen are only governed by the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act He was not even the person who filed the Writ Petition in <ORG> On the facts of the case highlighted by the <ORG> there is no basis to hold that settlement is ex facie unjust or arbitrary To complete the narration it is necessary to refer to the views expressed by the <ORG> in that case In reaching such conclusion <ORG> inter alia took into account the fact that the scheme emanating from the settlement dated was entirely a new scheme and therefore the ratio of the decision in Nakara case has no application A settlement which belongs to the first category has limited application in that it merely binds the parties to the agreement The next principle to be borne in mind is that in a case where the validity of the settlement is assailed the limited scope of enquiry would be whether the settlement arrived at in accordance with sub section to of is on the whole just and fair and reached bonafide Once cordiality is established between the employer and labour in arriving at a settlement which operates well for the period that is in force there is always a likelihood of further advances in the shape of improved emoluments by voluntary settlement avoiding friction and unhealthy litigation The line of enquiry whether settlement was unfair and unjust in <ORG> Vs Presiding Officer and others SCC was adopted by a three Judge Bench of this Court speaking through <NAME> It was observed at paragraph that under these circumstances respondents to also would be ordinarily bound by this settlement entered into by their representative <ORG> unless it is shown that the said settlement was ex facie unfair unjust or mala fide The Court came to the conclusion that the settlement cannot be characterised to be unfair or unjust It was reiterated in the case of <ORG> Vs Their Workmen AIR SC that a settlement cannot be weighed in any golden scales and the question whether it is just and fair has to be answered on the basis of principles different from those which come into play when an industrial dispute is under adjudication Earlier it was observed If the settlement had been arrived at by a vast majority of the concerned workers with their eyes open and was also accepted by them in its totality it must be presumed to be just and fair and not liable to be ignored while deciding the reference merely because a small number of workers in this case i per cent were not parties to it or refused to accept it or because the <ORG> was of the opinion that the workers deserved marginally higher emoluments than they themselves thought they did This proposition laid down in <NAME> case was reiterated in <ORG> case supra approvingly citing the said decision <ORG> approached the issue more from the angle of Article and referred to the decisions in which the State action in making the classification for the purpose of extending the pensionary benefits or additional benefits fell for consideration of this Court On this there is practically no dispute There may be some overlapping and there may be some facets which apply in common to determine the crucial issue whether the settlement on the whole is just and fair but that is not to say that the settlement is liable to be tested on the touchstone of Article more so when it has no application in the instant case Firstly it is to be borne in mind that there was no challenge at any time to any of the terms of the settlement other than the clause relating to pension in so far as it confines the benefit of life long pension only to those who retire on or after Secondly we must give due weight to the fact that the settlement was reached as a result of collective bargaining and with the assistance of <ORG> officer The learned senior counsel for the petitioners argued that there was no justification in making a sub classification amongst the retired employees by giving the benefit to those who retired only between and the date of settlement The argument that either all the retired employees should be given the benefit or none at all cannot cut ice if the principles of collective bargaining and justness of the settlement viewed as a whole is kept in view There is nothing which is palpably unjust or irrational in giving the benefit only to those who retired during and after the platinum jubilee year Though there was some dispute as to the correctness of the date on which the platinum jubilee falls no material has been placed before us excepting the date of incorporation of the <ORG> to establish the version of the appellants in this regard Another factor to be taken into account is that the recognised union of workmen which espoused the cause of the retired employees and contested the issue before <ORG> did not pursue the matter further obviously because they felt that in the larger interests of maintaining industrial harmony and peace the matter should be left off at that stage In the view we have taken it is not necessary to dwell on the contention raised by the learned senior counsel for the respondent regarding the maintainability of the writ petition and SLP at the instance of the appellants We see no merit in the appeal and it is hereby dismissed
