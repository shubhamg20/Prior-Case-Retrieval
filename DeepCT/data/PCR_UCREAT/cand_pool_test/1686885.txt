Paragraph states that the question of disqualification shall be referred for decision of the chairmen Speaker of the <ORG> and his decision shall be final It further provides that such question in respect of Chairman Speaker shall be referred for decision of such Member of the <ORG> as the <ORG> may elect in this behalf Paragraph states that no court shall have jurisdiction in respect of any matter connected with the disqualification of a Member of a <ORG> The respondents contended that the Tenth Schedule created a nonjusticiable constitutional area dealing with certain complex political issues which have no strict adjudicatory disposition and the exclusion of this area is constitutionally preserved by imparting a finality to the decision of the Speakers Chairmen by deeming whole proceedings as those within <ORG> <ORG> of legislature envisaged in Articles and and further excluding the <ORG> Jurisdiction under Paragraph that no question of ouster of judicial review would at all arise inasmuch as the Speaker chairman exercising power under Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule function not as a statutory tribunal but as a part of state Legislative department and that having regard to the political issues the subject matter is itself not amenable to judicial power but pertains to the constitution of the <ORG> and the legislature is entitled to deal with it exclusively Jayachandra Reddy JUDGMENT i Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule contains a provision which is independent of and stands apart from the main provisions of the Tenth Schedule which are intended to provide a remedy for the evil of unprincipled and unethical political defection and therefore is a severable part ii There is nothing in the proviso to Article which detracts from the severability of a provision on account of the inclusion of which the Bill containing the amendment requires ratification from the rest of the provisions of such Bill which do not attract and require such ratification It does not violate their freedom of speech freedom of vote and conscience nor does it violate any rights or freedom under Article and of the Constitution Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule gives effect to this principle and sentiment by imposing a disqualification on a Member who votes or abstains from voting contrary to any directions issued by the political party If in effect these Articles are rendered ineffective and made inapplicable where these articles could otherwise have been invoked or would but for Paragraph have operated there is in effect a change in those provisions attracting the proviso Though the Amendment does not bring in any change directly in the language of Articles and of the constitution however in effect Paragraph curtails the operation of those Articles respecting matter falling under the Tenth Schedule There is a change in the effect in Articles and within the meaning of clause of the proviso to Article The criterion for determining the constitutional validity of a law is the competence of the law making authority which would depend on the ambit of the Legislative power and the limitations imposed thereon as also on mode of exercise of the power Though the amending power in a constitution is in the nature of a constituent power and differs in content from the Legislative power the limitations imposed on the constituent power may be substantive as well as procedural Substantive limitations are those which restrict the field of exercise of the amending power and exclude some areas from its ambit Procedural limitations are those which impose restrictions with regard to the mode of exercise of the amending power the limitation requiring a special majority under Article of the constitution is a procedural one Although there is no specific enumerated substantive limitation on the power in Article but as arising from very limitation in the word amend a substantive limitation is inherent on the amending power so that the amendment does not alter the basic structure or destroy the basic features of the Constitution There is really no difference in principle between the condition requiring passing of the Bill by a special majority before its presentation to the President for assent contained in Article and the condition for ratification of the amendment by the legislatures of not less than one half of the States before the Bill is presented to the President for assent contained in the proviso The test of severability requires the <ORG> to ascertain whether the legislature would at all have enacted the law if the severed part was not the part of the law and whether after severance what survives can stand independently and is workable It cannot be said that the constituent body would not have enacted the other provisions in the Tenth Schedule if it had known that Paragraph was not valid Nor can it be said that the rest of the provisions of the Tenth schedule cannot stand on their own even if Paragraph is found to be unconstitutional Whenever there is an infringement of a right or an injury the <ORG> are there to restore the vinculum juris which is disturbed Where there is a lis an affirmation by one party and denial by another and the dispute necessarily involves a decision on the rights and obligations of the parties to it and the authority is called upon to decide it there is an exercise of judicial power A finality clause is not a legislative magical incantation which has the effect of telling off <ORG> The principle that is applied by the courts is that in spite of a finality clause it is open to the court to examine whether the action of the authority under challenge is ultra vires the powers conferred on the said authority An action can be ultra vires for the reason that it is in contravention of a mandatory provision of the law conferring on the authority the power to take such an action It will also be ultra vires the powers conferred on the authority if it is vitiated by mala fides or is colourable exercise of power based on extraneous and irrelevant consideration But it does have the effect of limiting the scope of the jurisdiction An ouster clause confines judicial review in respect of actions falling outside the jurisdiction of the authority taking such action but precludes challenge to such action on the ground of an error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction vested in the authority because such an action cannot be said to be an action without jurisdiction There is no justification to give the words the wider meaning Under the Constitution of India which delineates the spheres of jurisdiction of the legislature and the judiciary the power to construe the meaning of the provisions in the Constitution and the laws is entrusted to the judiciary with finality attached to the decision of this <ORG> inter alia by Article about the true meaning of any enacted provision and Article obliges all authorities in the country to act in aid of this <ORG> A The legal fiction in sub paragraph of para of the Tenth Schedule serves a limited purpose and brings the proceedings under sub paragraph thereof within the ambit of clause of Article or Clause of Article and therefore there is no occasion to enlarge its scope by reading into it words which are not there and extending it also to clause of these Articles A matter falling within the ambit of clause of either of the two Article or is justiciable on the ground of illegality or perversity in spite of the immunity it enjoys to a challenge on the ground of irregularity of procedure The decision relating to disqualification of a member does not relate to regulating procedure or the conduct of business of the <ORG> provided for in clause of Articles and and taking that view would amount to extending the fiction beyond its language and importing another fiction for this purpose which is not permissible That being so the matter falls within the ambit of clause only of Article and as a result of which it would be vulnerable on the ground of illegality and perversity and therefore justiciable to that extent Further the expression in respect of any matter connected with the disqualification of a Member of a <ORG> under this Schedule is wide enough to include not merely the intermediate stage of the proceedings relating to disqualification but also the final order on the question of disqualification made under paragraph If there is an abridgment of extinction of the right which results in the disappearance of the cause of action which enables invoking the remedy and in the absence of which there is no occasion to make a grievance and invoke the subsisting remedy then the change brought about is in the right and not the remedy But for para which deals with the remedy and not the right the jurisdiction of <ORG> under Article and that of <ORG> under Article and would remain unimpaired to challenge the decision under para as in the case of decisions relating to other disqualification specified in clause of Articles and which remedy continues to subsist The consequence of the Constitution standing amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill on assent by the President which is the substantive part of Article results only when the Bill has been presented to the President for his assent in conformity with the special procedure after performance of the conditions precedent namely passing of the Bill by each <ORG> by the requisite majority in the case of all Bills and in the case of Bills governed by the proviso after the Bill has been passed by the requisite majority in each <ORG> and it has also been ratified by the legislature by not less than one half of the States Non compliance of the special procedure prescribed in Article cannot bring about the result of the Constitution standing amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill this doctrine has no application where the legislation is not validly enacted due to non compliance of the mandatory legislative procedure such as the mandatory special procedure prescribed for exercise of the constituent power This aura of the office was even greater when the Constitution was framed and yet the framed and yet the farmers of the Constitution did not choose to vest the authority of adjudicating disputes as to disqualification of Members to the Speaker and provision was made in Article and for decision of disputes by the President Governor in accordance with the opinion of <ORG> The Transfer Petition is allowed and the aforesaid Writ Petition is withdrawn to this Court for the purpose of deciding the constitutional issues and of declaring the law on the matter That there is nothing in the said proviso to Article which detracts from the severability of a provision on account of the inclusion of which the Bill containing the Amendment requires ratification from the rest of the provisions of such Bill Which do not attract and require such ratification There is no justification for the view that even the rest of the provisions of the constitution nd Amendment Act excluding Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule become constitutionally infirm by reason alone of the fact that one of its severable provisions which attracted and required ratification under the proviso to Article was not so ratified That Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule contains a provision which is independent of and stands apart from the main provisions of the Tenth Schedule which are intended to provide a remedy for the evil of unprincipled and unethical political defections and therefore is a severable part The deeming provision having regard to the words be deemed to be proceedings in <ORG> or proceedings in <ORG> confines the scope of the fiction accordingly For the reasons to be given in our detailed judgment to follow our operative conclusions in the minority opinion on the various constitutional issues are as follows Para of the Tenth Schedule in clear terms and in effect excludes the jurisdiction of all courts including <ORG> under Article and <ORG> under Articles and to entertain any challenge to the decision under para on any ground even of illegality or perveristy not only at an interim stage but also after the final decision on the question of disqualification on the ground of defection In view of para in the Bill resulting in the Constitution Fifty Second Amendment Act it was required to be ratified by the <ORG> of not less than one half of the States as a condition precedent before the Bill could be presented to the President for assent in accordance with the mandatory special procedure prescribed in the Proviso to clause of Article for exercise of the constituent power ORDER The Transfer Petition is allowed and the Writ Petition Rule No of on the file of <ORG> is withdrawn to this Court for the purpose of deciding the constitutional issues and of declaring the law on the matter In accordance with the majority opinion the factual controversies raised in the Writ Petition will however have to be decided by <ORG> Applying the principles declared and laid down by the majority On we made an order pronouncing our findings and conclusions upholding the constitutional validity of the amendment and of the provisions of the Tenth Schedule except for Paragraph which was declared invalid for want of ratification in terms of and as required by the proviso to Article of the Constitution In the order dated our conclusions were set out and we indicated that the reasons for the conclusions would follow later emphasis supplied <ORG> recommended that a defector should be debarred for a period of one year or till such time as he resigned his seat and got himself re elected from appointment to the office of a Minister including Deputy Minister or Speaker or Deputy Speaker or any post carrying salaries or allowances to be paid from <ORG> or of the <ORG> or from the funds of Government Undertakings in public sector in addition to those to which the defector might be entitled as legislator It provided for disqualifying a Member from continuing as a Member of either <ORG> or <ORG> on his voluntarily giving up his membership of the political party by which he was set up as a candidate at such election or of which he became a Member after such election or on his voting or abstaining from voting in such <ORG> contrary to any direction issued by such political party or by any person or authority authorised by it in this behalf without obtaining prior permission of such party person or authority Thereafter the Constitution Forty eight Amendment Bill was introduced in <ORG> which also contained similar provisions for disqualification on the ground of defection This brings to the fore the object underlying the provisions in the Tenth Schedule This sub para would also apply to a nominated member who is a Member of a political party on the date of his nomination as such Member or who joins a political party within six months of his taking oath These provisions in the Tenth Schedule give recognition to the role of political parties in the political process Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule reads If any question arises as to whether a Member of a <ORG> has become subject to disqualification under this Schedule the question shall be referred for the decision of the Chairman or as the case may be the Speaker of such <ORG> and his decision shall be final Provided that where the question which has arisen is as to whether the Chairman or the Speaker of a <ORG> has become subject to such disqualification the question shall be referred for the decision of such Member of the <ORG> as the <ORG> may elect in this behalf and his decision shall be final Bar of jurisdiction of courts Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution no court shall have any jurisdiction in respect of any matter connected with the disqualification of a Member of a <ORG> under this Schedule There are certain other contentions which upon a closer examination raise issues more of construction than constitutionality Then again it was urged that under Paragraph the expression any direction is so wide that even a direction which if given effect to and implemented might bring about a result which may itself be obnoxious to and violative of constitutional ideals and values would be a source of disqualification Indeed in constitutional and legal theory it is urged there is really no ouster of jurisdiction of <ORG> or of <ORG> as the subject matter itself by its inherent character and complexities is not amenable to but outside judicial power and that the ouster of jurisdiction under Paragraph is merely a consequential constitutional recognition of the non amenability of the subject matter to the judicial power of the <ORG> the corollary of which is that the Speaker or the Chairman as the case may be exercising powers under Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule function not as a statutory <ORG> but as a part of the <ORG> <ORG> It is urged that the question in the last analyses pertains to the constitution of the <ORG> and the <ORG> is entitled to deal with it exclusively On the contentions raised and urged at the hearing the questions that fall for consideration are the following A The Constitution Fifty Second Amendment Act in so far as it seeks to introduce the Tenth Schedule is destructive of the basic structure of the constitution as it is violative of the fundamental principles of <ORG> democracy a basic feature of the Indian constitutionalism and is destructive of the freedom of speech right to dissent and freedom of conscience as the provisions of the Tenth Schedule seek to penalise and disqualify elected representatives for the exercise of these rights and freedoms which are essential to the sustenance of the system of <ORG> democracy The observations of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> lawyer Edition at page are worthy of note to read its language in connection with the known condition of affairs out of which the occasion for its adoption may have arisen and then to construe it if there be therein any doubtful expressions in a way so far as is reasonably possible to forward the known purpose or object for which the amendment was adopted It is urged that unprincipled political defections may be an evil but it will be the beginning of much greater evils if the remedies graver than the disease itself are adopted It also framed a rule requiring all such candidates to sign and accept the conditions of <ORG> and be subject to its whip The observations in the case relied upon by learned counsel are those of Lord <NAME> of Dunfermline who observed Take the testing instance should his view as to right and wrong on a public issue as to the true line of service to the realm as to the real interests of the constituency which has elected him or even of the society which pays him differ from the decision of the parliamentary party and the maintenance by it of its policy he has come under a contract to place his vote and action into subjection not to his own convictions but to their decisions On the one hand there is the real and imminent threat to the very fabric of Indian democracy posed by certain levels of political behavior conspicuous by their utter and total disregard of well recognised political proprieties and morality there is the legislative determination through experimental constitutional processes to combat that evil There are at least two objections to the acceptability of this contention Outside of statute there is no right to elect no right to be elected and no right to dispute an election emphasis supplied Clause of sub para of Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule gives effect to this principle and sentiment by imposing a disqualification on a Member who votes or abstains from voting contrary to any directions Issued by the political party We shall deal with this aspect separately There are of course larger issues of theoretical and philosophical objections to the legitimacy of a representative Government which might achieve a majority of the seats but obtains only minority of the electoral votes He must have no regard to the political leanings of his constituents for the represents those who voted against him or who did not vote at all as much as those who voted for him But as one prominent critic of government has said there is nothing inherently contradictory in a Member sustaining the <ORG> in its power or helping it to overcome opposition at the same time as scrutinising the work of the executive in order both to improve it and to see that power is being exercised in a proper and legitimate fashion But the question is whether the balance of a Member obligations has tilted too far in favour of the requirements of party The nonsense that a Whip even a three line whip is no more than a summons to attend the <ORG> and that once there the Member is completely free to speak and vote as he thinks fit was still being put about by the Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister as recently as The presumptive impropriety of motives progressively weakens according as the numbers sharing the action and there is nothing capricious and arbitrary in this legislative perception of the distinction between defection and split We find no substance in the attack on the statutory distinction between defection and split The Provisions of Paragraph do not violate any rights or freedom under Articles and of the Constitution In an avowedly democratic polity statutory provisions ensuring the security of fundamental human rights including the right to property will unless the contrary mandate be precise and unqualified be construed liberally so as to uphold the right But it was urged that no question of change in Articles and of the Constitution within the meaning of clause of the proviso to Article arises at all in view of the fact that the area of these rights and obligations being constitutionally rendered non justiciable there is no judicial review under Articles and at all in the first instance so as to admit of any idea of its exclusion Article A aims at saving laws providing for the compulsory acquisition by the <ORG> of certain kind of property from the operation of articles read with other relevant articles in Part III while article purports to validate certain specified Acts and Regulations already passed which but for such a provision would be liable to be impugned under Article It is not correct to say that the powers of <ORG> under Article to issue writs for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III or of this Court under Articles and to entertain appeals from orders issuing or refusing such writs are in any way affected This Court noticed the question thus The question which calls for our decision is what would be the requirement about making an amendment in a constitutional provision contained in Part III if as a result of the said amendment the powers conferred on <ORG> under Article are likely to be affected The impugned Act does not purport to change the provisions of Article and it cannot be said even to have that effect directly or in any appreciable measure The propositions that fell for consideration is <NAME> and <NAME> cases are indeed different The result was that there was no area for the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to operate upon If in effect these Articles are rendered ineffective and made inapplicable where these articles could otherwise have been invoked or would but for Paragraph have operated there is in effect a change in those provisions attracting the proviso In the present cases though the amendment does not bring in any change directly in the language of Article and of the Constitution however in effect paragraph curtails the operation of those Articles respecting matters falling under the Tenth Schedule There is a change in the effect in Article and within the meaning of clause of the proviso to Article Re Contentions and The criterion for determining the validity of a law is the competence of law making authority The competence of the law making authority would depend on the ambit of the legislative power and the limitations imposed thereon as also the limitations on mode of exercise of the power Though the amending power in a constitution is in the nature of a constituent power and differs in content from the Legislative power the limitations imposed on the constituent power my be substantive as well as procedural Substantive limitations are those which restrict the field of exercise of the amending power and exclude some areas fro its ambit Procedural limitations are those which impose restrictions with regard to the mode of the exercise of the amending power Both these limitations however touch and affect the constituent power itself disregard of which invalidates its exercise Article makes provisions for amendment of the First and the Fourth Schedules Article provides for amendment in the provision of the Constitution which may be necessary for abolition or creation of Legislative Councils in States paragraph of the Fifth Schedule provides for amendment of the Fifth Schedule and paragraph of Sixth Schedule provides for amendment of the Sixth Schedule All these provisions prescribe that the said amendments can be made by a law made by <ORG> which can be passed like any other law by a simple majority in the <ORG> of <ORG> Article confers the power to amend the rest of the provisions of the Constitution Although there is no specific enumerated substantive limitation on the power in Article but as arising from very limitation in the word amend a substantive limitation is inherent on the amending power so that the amendment does not alter the basic structure or destroy the basic features of the Constitution When a legislature whose authority is subject to limitations aforesaid enacts a law which is wholly in excess of its powers it is entirely void and must be completely ignored But where the legislation falls in part within the area allotted to it and in part outside it it is undoubtedly void as to the latter but does it on that account become necessarily void in its entirety The answer to this question must depend on whether what is valid could be separated from what is invalid and that is a question which has to be decided by the court on a consideration of the provisions of the Act Such an Amendment Act is within the competence of <ORG> insofar as it relates to provisions other than those mentioned in clauses a to of proviso to Article but in respect of the amendments introduced in provisions referred to in clauses a to of proviso to Article <ORG> alone is not competent to make such amendments on account of some constitutionally recognised federal principle being invoked In the matter of amendment of provisions specified in clauses a to relating to legislative and executive powers of the States vis a vis the <ORG> the <ORG> the election of the President and the amending power itself which have a bearing on the States the proviso imposes an additional requirement of ratification of the amendment which seeks to effect a change in those provisions before the Bill is presented for the assent of the President During the arguments reliance was placed on the words before the Bill making provision for such amendment is presented to the President for assent to sustain the argument that these words imply that the ratification of the Bill by not less than one half of the States is a condition precedent for the presentation of the Bill for the assent of the President Clause of section of the said Order in council contained the amending power in the following terms In the exercise of its powers under this section <ORG> may amend or repeal any of the provisions of this Order or of any other Order of Her Majesty in council in its application to the Island Provided that no Bill for the amendment or repeal of any of the provisions of this Order shall be presented for the Royal Assent unless it has endorsed on it a certificate under the hand of the speaker that the number of votes cast in favour thereof in <ORG> amounted to not less than two thirds of the whole number of members of the <ORG> including those not present In that case it was found that section of the Bribery Amendment Act made a provision for appointment of a panel by the Governor General on the advice of <NAME> for selecting members of <ORG> while section of the constitution vested the appointment transfer dismissal and disciplinary control of judicial officers in <ORG> It was held that the legislature had purported to pass a law which being in conflict with section of the Order in Council must be treated if it is to be valid as an implied alteration of the Constitutional provisions about the appointment of judicial officers and could only be made by laws which comply with the special legislative procedure laid down in section Since there was nothing to show that the Bribery Amendment Act was passed by the necessary two thirds majority it was held that any Bill which does not comply with the condition precedent of the proviso is and remains even though it receives the Royal Assent invalid and ultra vires Disregard of such a condition precedent for presenting a Bill for assent did not result in the entire enactment being vitiated and the law being declared invalid in its entirety but it only had the effect of invalidation of a particular provision which offended against the limitation on the amending power A comparison of the language used in clause of section with that of Article would show that both the provisions bear a general similarity of purpose and both the provisions require the passing of the Bill by special majority before it was presented for assent There is really no difference in principle between the condition requiring passing of the Bill by a special majority before its presentation to the President for assent contained in Article and the condition for ratification of the amendment by the legislatures of not less than one half of the States before the Bill is presented to the President for assent contained in the proviso The test of severability requires the <ORG> to ascertain whether the legislature would at all have enacted the law if the severed part was not the part of the law and whether after severance what survives can stand independently and is workable We accordingly hold on contentions and That there is nothing in the said proviso to Article which detracts from the severability of a provision on account of the inclusion of which the Bill containing the Amendment requires ratification from the rest of the provisions of such Bill which do not attract and require such ratification There is no justification for the view that even the rest of the provisions of the constitution nd Amendment Act excluding Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule become constitutionally infirm by reason alone of the fact that one of its severable provisions which attracted and required ratification under the proviso to Article was not so ratified That Paragraph of the Tenth Schedule contains a provision which is independent of and stands apart from the main provisions of the Tenth Schedule which are intended to provide a remedy for the evil of unprincipled and unethical political defections and therefore is a severable part Does the word final render the decision of the Speaker immune from <ORG> It is now well accepted that a finality clause is not a legislative magical incantation which has that effect of telling of <ORG> If a statute says that the decision shall be final or shall be final and conclusive to all intents and purposes this is held to mean merely that there is no appeal judicial control of legality is unimpaired There is no right of appeal in any case unless it is given by statute But where there is general provision for appeals for example from quarter session to <ORG> by case stated a subsequent Act making the decision of quarter session final on some specific matter will prevent an appeal but once it is held that it is a judicial tribunal empowered and obliged to deal judicially with disputes arising out of or in connection with election the overriding power of this <ORG> to grant special leave in proper cases would certainly be attracted and this power cannot be excluded by any parliamentary legislation The powers given by Article of the Constitution however are in the nature of special or residuary powers which are exercisable outside the purview of ordinary law in cases where the needs of justice demand interference by <ORG> of the land Section of the Representation of the People Act certainly give finality to the decision of <ORG> so far as that Act is concerned and does not provide for any further appeal but that cannot in any way cut down or effect the overriding powers which this court can exercise in the matter of granting special leave under Art Notwithstanding the declared finality of the order of the president the <ORG> has jurisdiction in appropriate cases to set aside the order if it appears that it was passed on collateral considerations or the rules of natural justice were not observed or that the President judgment was coloured by the advice or representation made by the executive or it was founded on no evidence In examining the relevance of the reasons the court will consider the situation which according to the disciplinary authority made it come to the conclusion that it was not reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry If the court finds that the reasons are irrelevant then the recording of its satisfaction by the disciplinary authority would be an abuse of power conferred upon it by clause SCR in spite of finality attached by Article to the decision of the Governor in respect of disqualification incurred by a member of <ORG> subsequent to the election the matter was examined by this Court on an appeal by special leave under Article of the Constitution against the decision of <ORG> dismissing the writ petition filed under Article of the Constitution There is authority against the acceptability of the argument that the word final occurring in Paragraph has the effect of excluding the jurisdiction of the <ORG> in Articles and <ORG> contains this statement Privilege of <ORG> in relation to its constitution In addition to possessing a complete control over the regulation of its own proceedings and the conduct of its members <ORG> claims the exclusive right of providing as it may deem fit for its own proper constitution And <ORG> had certainly not exercised a judicial power as a successor to the one time jurisdiction of the King in <ORG> with the possible exception of the power to punish for its contempts And before an election machinery can be brought into operation there are three requisites which require to be attended to namely there should be a set of laws and rules making provisions with respect to all matters relating to or in connection with elections and it should be decided as to how these laws and rules are to be made there should be an executive charged with the duty of securing the due conduct of elections and there should be a judicial tribunal to deal with disputes arising out of or in connection with elections This court has held that in adjudicating an election dispute an authority is performing a judicial function and a petition for leave to appeal under Article of the Constitution would lie to this Court against the decision nothwithstanding the provisions of Article In other words the inquiry which is prescribed by this clause is is the power in question shown or proved to have subsisted in the <ORG> of Commons at the relevant time See page This question is answered by <NAME> <NAME> in <NAME> case I think at the time our Constitution was framed the decision of an election dispute had ceased to be a privilege of <ORG> in England and therefore under Article it could not be a privilege of <ORG> in this country If again there are neither present rights asserted nor a future rule of conduct prescribed but merely a fact ascertained necessary for the practical effectuation of admitted rights the proceeding though called an arbitration is rather in the nature of an appraisement or ministerial act Whenever there is an infringement of a right or an injury the <ORG> are there to restore the vinculum juris which is disturbed Broadly speaking certain special matters go before tribunals and the residue goes before the ordinary courts of civil judicature Where there is a lis an affirmation by one party and denial by another and the dispute necessarily involves a decision on the rights and obligations of the parties to it and the authority is called upon to decide it there is a exercise of judicial power The main and the basic test however is whether the adjudicating power which a particular authority is empowered to exercise has been conferred on it by a statute and can be described as a part of the <ORG> inherent power exercised in discharging its judicial function Applying this test there can be no doubt that the power which the <ORG> Government exercises under and is a part of the <ORG> judicial power There is in that sense a lis there is affirmation by one party and denial by another and the dispute necessarily involves the rights and obligations of the parties to it But it does have the effect of limiting the scope of the jurisdiction The principle that is applied by the courts is that in spite of a finality clause it is open to the court to examine whether the action of the authority under challenge is ultra vires the powers conferred on the said authority Such an action can be ultra vires for the reason that it is in contravention of a mandatory provision of the law conferring on the authority the power to take such an action It will also be ultra vires the powers conferred on the authority if it is vitiated by mala fides or is colourable exercise of power based on extraneous and irrelevant considerations While exercising their certiorari jurisdiction the courts have applied the test whether the impugned action falls within the jurisdiction of the authority taking the action or it falls outside such jurisdiction An ouster clause confines judicial review in respect of actions falling outside the jurisdiction of the authority taking such action but precludes challenge to such action on the ground of an error committed in the exercise of jurisdiction vested in the authority because such an action cannot be said to be an action without jurisdiction An ouster clause attaching finality to a determination therefore does oust certiorari to some extent and it will be effective in ousting the power of the court to review the decision of an inferior tribunal by certiorari if the inferior tribunal has not acted without jurisdiction and has merely made an error of law which does not affect its jurisdiction and if its decision is not a nullity for some reason such as breach of rule of natural justice All the learned judges have expressed the view that the proclamation could be open to challenge if it is vitiated by mala fides Take for example a case where the President gives the reason for taking action under Art But then what did I mean by saying that situation may arise in a given case where the jurisdiction of the <ORG> is not completely ousted I mean this Similarly <NAME> has held Even if an issue is not justiciable if the circumstances relied upon by the executive authority are absolutely extraneous and irrelevant the <ORG> have the undoubted power to scrutinise such an exercise of the executive power Such a judicial scrutiny is one which comes into operation when the exercise of the executive power is colourable or mala fide and based on extraneous or irrelevant considerations the <ORG> have a limited sphere of operation in that on the reasons given by the President in his order if the <ORG> find that they are absolutely extraneous and irrelevant and based on personal and illegal consideration the <ORG> are not powerless to strike down the order on the ground of mala fide if proved supra this <ORG> was dealing with Article of the constitution which attaches finality to the order of the disciplinary authority on the question whether it was reasonably practicable to hold an inquiry The power to resolve such disputes vested in the Speaker or chairman is a judicial power The deeming provision having regard to the words be deemed to be proceedings in <ORG> or proceedings in <ORG> confines the scope of the fiction accordingly There are many reasons for this He holds the scales of justice evenly irrespective of party or person though no one expects that he will do absolute justice in all matters because as a human being he has his human drawbacks and shortcomings We may now notice one other contention as to the construction of the expression any direction occurring in paragraph There is no justification to give the words the wider meaning While construing Paragraph it cannot be ignored that under the Constitution members of <ORG> as well as of the State legislature enjoy freedom of speech in the <ORG> though this freedom is subject to the provisions of the constitution and the rules and standing orders regulating the Procedure of the <ORG> Art and art For this purpose the direction given by the political party to a member belonging to it the violation of which may entail disqualification under paragraph would have to be limited to a vote on motion of confidence or no confidence in the Government or where the motion under consideration relates to a matter which was an integral policy and programme of the political party on the basis of which it approached the elaborate There are some submissions as to the exact import of a split whether it is to be understood an instantaneous one time event or whether a split can be said to occur over a period of time The meaning to be given to split must necessarily be examined in a case in which the question arises in the context of its particular facts We accordingly leave this question open to be decided in an appropriate case It was submitted that when the very question of jurisdiction of the <ORG> to deal with the matter was raised and even before the constitutionality of Paragraph had been pronounced upon self restraint required that no interlocutory orders in a sensitive area of the relationship between the legislature and the <ORG>s should been made VERMA This matter relating to disqualification on the ground of defection of some members of <ORG> under the Tenth Schedule inserted by the Constitution Fifty Second Amendment Act was heard along with some other similar matters relating to several Legislative Assemblies including those of Manipur Meghalaya Madhya Pradesh Gujarat and Goa since all of them involved the decision of certain constitutional questions relating to the constitutional validity of para of the Tenth Schedule and consequently the validity of the Constitution Fifty Second Amendment Act itself At the hearing several learned counsel addressed us on account of which the hearing obviously took some time The unanimous opinion according to the majority as well as the minority is that para of the tenth Schedule enacts a provision for complete exclusion of judicial review including the jurisdiction of <ORG> under Article and of <ORG> under Articles and of the Constitution and therefore it makes in terms and in effect a change in Articles and of the Constitution which attracts the proviso to clause of Article of the Constitution and therefore ratification by the specified number of State Legislatures before the Bill was presented to the President for his assent was necessary in accordance therewith as under For the reasons to be given in our detailed judgment to follow our operative conclusions in the minority opinion on the various constitutional issues are as follows Pare of the Tenth Schedule in clear terms and in effect excludes the jurisdiction of all courts including <ORG> under Article and <ORG> under Articles and to entertain any challenge to the decision under para on any ground even of illegality or perversity not only at an interim stage but also after the final decision on the question of disqualification on the ground of defection In view of para in the Bill resulting in the constitution Fifty Second Amendment Act it was required to be ratified by the <ORG> of not less than one half of the States as a condition precedent before the Bill could be presented to the President for assent in accordance with the mandatory special procedure prescribed in the proviso to clause of Article for exercise of the constituent power it is unnecessary in this judgment to detail the facts giving rise to the debate on the constitutional issues relating to the validity of the Tenth Schedule more particularly para therein introduced by the Constitution Fifty second Amendment Act Arguments on these questions were addressed to us by several learned counsel namely the learned Attorney General <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The points involved in the decision of the constitutional issues for the purpose of our opinion may be summarised broadly as under A Construction of para of the Tenth Schedule As indicated by us in our operative conclusions pronounced earlier we need not express our concluded opinion on the points argued before us which are not necessary for supporting the conclusion reached by us that the entire Tenth Schedule and consequently the Constitution Fifty Second Amendment Act is unconstitutional on the view we have taken on the other points This is best done by quoting Chief Justice <NAME> in <NAME> Virginia Wheat Ed wherein he said It is most true that this Court will not take Jurisdiction if it should not but it is equally true that it must take jurisdiction if it should We have no more right to decline the exercise of jurisdiction which is given than to usurp that which is not given In doing this on the present occasion we find this tribunal invested with appellate jurisdiction in all cases arising under the constitution and laws of the United States XXX XXX XXX If the question cannot be brought in a court then there is no case in law or equity and no jurisdiction is given by the words of the article at spoke thus Before proceeding to consider this question we think it right to point out what is sometimes overlooked that our constitution contains express provisions for judicial review of legislation as to its conformity with the Constitution unlike as in America where the Supreme <ORG> has assumed extensive powers of reviewing legislative acts under cover of the widely interpreted due process clause in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments emphasis supplied We are in respectful agreement with the above statement of <NAME> CJ and wish to add that even though such an obvious statement may have been necessary soon after the Constitution came into force and may not be a necessary reminder four decades later at this juncture yet it appears apposite in the present context to clear the lingering doubts in some minds We have no hesitation in adding further that while we have no desire to clutch at jurisdiction at the same time we would not be deterred in the performance of this constitutional duty whenever the need arises We would also like to observe the unlike England where there is no written Constitution and <ORG> is supreme in our country there is a written Constitution delineating the spheres of jurisdiction of the legislature and the judiciary whereunder the power to construe the meaning of the provisions in the Constitution and the laws is entrusted to the judiciary with finality attached to the decision of this <ORG> inter alia by Article about the true meaning of any enacted provision and Article obliges all authorities in the country to act in aid of this <ORG> We have no doubt that the Speakers and all others sharing their views are alive to this constitutional scheme which is as much the source of their jurisdiction as it is of this <ORG> and also conscious that the power given to each wing is for the performance of a public duty as a constitutional obligation and not for self aggrandisement The Tenth Schedule was inserted in the Constitution of India by the Constitution Fifty Second Amendment Act which came into force with effect from and is popularly known as the Anti Defection Law The Statement of Objects and Reasons says that this amendment in the Constitution was made to combat the evil of political defections which has become a matter of national concern and unless combated is likely to undermine the very foundations of our democratic system and the principles which sustained it If any question arises as to whether a member of a <ORG> has become subject to disqualification under this Schedule the question shall be referred for the decision of the Chairman or as the case may be the Speaker of such <ORG> and his decision shall be final Provided that where the question which has arisen is as to whether the Chairman or the Speaker of a <ORG> has become subject to such disqualification the question shall be referred for the decision of such member of the <ORG> as the <ORG> may elect in this behalf and his decision shall be final Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution no court shall have any jurisdiction in respect of any matter connected with the disqualification of a member of a <ORG> under this Schedule We shall now deal with the points involved enumerated earlier Points A Paras of Tenth Schedule In support of the objection raised to the jurisdiction of this Court and the justiciability of the Speaker decision relating to disqualification of a member it has been urged that sub paragraph of para clearly lays down that the decision of the Chairman or as the case may be the Speaker of such <ORG> shall be final and sub paragraph proceeds to say that all proceedings under sub paragraph shall be deemed to the proceedings in <ORG> or It was urged that the clear provision in para that the decision of the Chairman Speaker on the subject of disqualification under this Schedule shall be final and the further provision that all such proceedings shall be deemed to be proceedings in <ORG> or proceedings in the Legislature of as State within the meaning of Article or Article as the case may be clearly manifests the intention that the jurisdiction of all courts including <ORG> is ousted in such matters and the decision on this question is not justiciable Further argument is that para in clear words thereafter reiterates that position by saying that notwithstanding anything in this Constitution no court shall have any jurisdiction in respect of any matter connected with the disqualification of a member of a <ORG> under this Schedule In other words the argument is that para by itself provides for ouster of the jurisdiction of all courts including <ORG> and para is a remanifestation of that clear intent in case of any doubt arising from para alone In reply it was urged that finality Clause in sub paragraph of para does not exclude the jurisdiction of the high <ORG> under Articles and and of this <ORG> under Article It was also argued that the Speaker Chairman while deciding the question of disqualification of member under para exercises a judicial function of the <ORG> which otherwise would be vested in the courts and therefore in this capacity he acts as Tribunal amenable to the jurisdiction under Articles and of the Constitution The legal fiction in sub paragraph of para can only bring the proceedings under sub paragraph thereof within the ambit of clause of Article or clause as the case may be since the expressions used in sub paragraph of para of the tenth Schedule are shall be deemed to be proceedings in <ORG> or proceedings in <ORG> and such expressions find place both in Articles and only in clause and not clause thereof It is also settled that a matter falling within the ambit of clause of either of these two Article is justiciable on the ground of illegality or perversity in spite of the immunity it enjoys to a challenge on the ground of irregularity of procedures To overcome this result it was argued that such matter would fall within the ambit of Clause of both Articles and because the consequence of the order of disqualification by the Speaker Chairman would relate to the conduct of business of the <ORG> The fiction in para is a limited one which serves its purpose by confining it to clause alone of Articles and and therefore there is no occasion to enlarge its scope by reading into it words which are not there and extending it also to clause of these Articles Moreover it does appear to us that the decision relating to disqualification of a member does not relate to regulating procedure or the conduct of business of the <ORG> provided for in clause of Articles and and taking that view would amount to extending the fiction beyond its language and importing another fiction for this purpose which is not permissible That being so the matter falls within the ambit of Clause only of Articles and as a result of which it would be vulnerable on the ground of illegality and perversity and therefore justiciable to that extent It was suggested that this construction would be in line with the construction made by this <ORG> in its several decisions relating to exclusion of <ORG>s jurisdiction in election disputes at the intermediate state under Article of the Constitution There is thus express exclusion of all courts jurisdiction even in respect of the final order As earlier indicated by virtue of the finality clause and the deeming provision in para there is exclusion of all courts jurisdiction to a considerable extent leaving out only the area of justiciability on the ground of illegality or perversity which obviously is relatable only to the final order under para Moreover the speech of the Law Minister who piloted the Bill in <ORG> and that of the Prime Minister in <ORG> as well as the debate on this subject clearly show that these provisions were enacted to keep the entire matter relating to disqualification including the Speakers final decision under para on the question of disqualification wholly outside the purview of of all courts including <ORG> and <ORG> In the face of this clear language there is no rule of construction which permits the reading of para in any different manner since there is no ambiguity in the language which is capable of only one construction namely total exclusion of the Jurisdiction of all courts including that of <ORG> and <ORG> under Articles and of the Constitution in respect of every matter connected with the disqualification of a member of a <ORG> under the Tenth Schedule including the final decision rendered by the Speaker Chairman as the case may be Point Applicability of Article Proviso The above construction of para of the Tenth Schedule gives rise to the question whether it thereby makes a change in Article which is in Chapter IV of part and Articles and which are in Chapter of Part VI of the Constitution Article A aims at saving laws providing for the compulsory acquisition by the <ORG> of a certain kind of property from the operation of article read with other relevant articles in Part III while article purports to validate certain specified Acts and Regulations already passed which but for such a provision would be liable to be impugned under article It is not correct to say that the powers of <ORG> under article to issue writs for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III or of this <ORG> under articles and to entertain appeals from orders issuing or refusing such writs are in any way affected The ground for rejection of the argument therein was that the remedy in the courts remained unimpaired and unaffected by the change and the change was really by extinction of the right to seek the remedy In other words the change was in the right and not the remedy of approaching the court since there was no occasion to invoke the remedy the right itself being taken away To the same effect is the decision in <NAME> wherein <NAME> was followed stating clearly that there was no justification for reconsidering <NAME> If there is an abridgement or extinction of the right which results in the disappearance of the cause of action which enables invoking the remedy and in the absence of which there is no occasion to make a grievance and invoke the subsisting remedy then the change brought about is in the right and not the remedy This is clear from the above quoted passage in <NAME> which clearly brings out this distinction between a change in the right and a change in the remedy But for para which deals with the remedy and not the right the jurisdiction of <ORG> under Article and that of <ORG> under Articles and would remain unimpaired to challenge the decision under para as in the case of decisions relating to other disqualifications specified in clause of Articles and which remedy continues to subsist It logically follows that the consequence of the Constitution standing amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill on assent by the President which is the substantive part of Article results only when the Bill has been presented to the President for his assent in conformity with the special procedure after performance of the conditions precedent namely passing of the Bill by each <ORG> by the requisite majority in the case of all Bills and in the case of Bills governed by the proviso after the Bill has been passed by the requisite majority in each <ORG> and it has also been ratified by the legislature of not less than one half of the States The constituent power cannot therefore be exercised in any other manner and non compliance of the special procedure so prescribed in Article cannot bring about the result of the Constitution standing amended in accordance with the terms of the Bill since that result ensues only at the end of the prescribed mandatory procedure and not otherwise It follows from the special provision made in Article for the amendment of the Constitution that our Constitution is a rigid or controlled constitution because <ORG> has left a special direction as to how the constitution is to be changed XXX XXX XXX But when it comes to the amendment of the Constitution a special procedure has been prescribed in Article Since the result of following the special procedure under the Article is the amendment of the constitution the process which brings about the result is known as the exercise of constituent power by the bodies associated in the task of the amending the constitution XXX XXX XXX The true position is that the alchemy of the special procedure prescribed in Article produces the constituent power which transport the proposed amendment into the constitution and gives it equal status with the other parts of the constitution If this be the correct constructions of Article with the proviso as we think it is then there is no escape from the logical conclusion that a Bill to which the proviso applies does not result in amending the Constitution in accordance with its terms on assent of the President if it was presented to the President for his assent and the President gave his assent to the Bill without prior ratification by the specified number of the State <ORG> If the route chosen is for construing the language of clause with the proviso merely a part of it the requirement or prior ratification is a condition precedent forming part of the special mandatory procedure providing that the constituent power in case of such a Bill can be exercised in this manner alone the mode prescribed for other Bills being forbidden There can thus be no doubt that para of the Tenth Schedule which seeks to make a change in Article which is a part of Chapter IV of Part and Articles and which form part of Chapter of Part VI of the Constitution has not been enacted by incorporation in a Bill seeking to make the constitutional Amendment in the manner prescribed by clause read with the proviso therein of Article This doctrine has no application where the legislation is not validly enacted due to non compliance of the mandatory legislative procedure such as the mandatory special procedure prescribed for exercise of the constituent power <ORG> affirmed that view and in this context held that section could be severed from rest of the Amending Act <ORG> was not a case of a Bill passed in exercise of the constituent power without following the special procedure of section but of a Bill passed in exercise of the ordinary legislative power containing other provisions which could be so enacted and including therein section which could be made only in accordance with the special procedure of section of the Constitution The Bribery Amendment Act in <NAME> was enacted in exercise of the ordinary legislative power and therein was inserted section which could be made only in exercise of the constituent power according to the special procedure prescribed in section of the Ceylon Constitutions Order The question therefore is whether there is violation of any of the basic features of the Constitution by the remaining part of the Tenth Schedule even assuming the absence of ratification in accordance with the proviso to clause of Article results in invalidation of para alone This appears to be the underlying principle adopted by the framers of the Constitution in not designating the Speaker as the authority to decide election disputes and questions as to disqualification of members under Articles and and opting for an independent authority outside the <ORG> There is nothing unusual in this scheme if we bear in mind that the final authority for removal of a Judge of <ORG> and <ORG> its outside the judiciary in the <ORG> under Article On the same principle the authority to decide the question of disqualification of a member of legislature is outside the <ORG> as envisaged by Articles and Since the conferment of authority is on the Speaker and that provision cannot be sustained for the reason given even without para the entire Tenth Schedule is rendered invalid in the absence of any valid authority for decision of the dispute Point Other contentions We have reached the conclusion that para of the Tenth Schedule is unconstitutional that the entire Tenth Schedule is constitutionally invalid in the absence of prior ratification in accordance with the proviso to clause of Article that the Doctrine of Severability does not apply in the present case of a constitutional amendment which suffers from the defect of absence of ratification as required by the proviso to clause of Article that the remaining part of the Tenth Schedule minus para is also unconstitutional for violation of a basic feature of the Constitution and that the entire Tenth Schedule is therefore constitutionally invalid rendering the Constitution Fifty Second Amendment Act still born and an abortive attempt to amend the constitution In view of this conclusion it is not necessary for us to express our concluded opinion on the other grounds of challenge to the constitutional validity of the entire Tenth Schedule urged at the hearing on the basis of alleged violation of certain other basic features of the Constitution including the right of members based on Article of the Constitution
