This is a Rule issued upon the opposite parties the Superintendent of Police in the district of Burdwan the Deputy Inspector General of Police district Hooghly and the State of West Bengal to show cause why a Writ in the nature of Certiorari should not be Issued quashing the order of the first respondent dated and the order in appeal therefrom passed by the second respondent dated and why a Writ in the nature of Mandamus should not issue directing the opposite parties to forbear from giving effect to the said orders and or findings and why such other order or orders should not be made as to this Court may seem fit and proper The petitioner was investigating into the <NAME> dacoity case which took place on According to the petitioner he had reasonable grounds for suspicion that this holster belonged to <NAME> he approached <NAME> for the production of his holster and as it could not he produced his house was searched Upon this complaint being made there were certain investigations and on the Inspector General Respondent No ordered that the Superintendent of Police Burdwan should draw up proceedings against the petitioner and other persons with whom we are not concerned in this case In view of that I am inclined to show certain amount of consideration and order that he be permanently reverted to his substantive rank of <ORG> from the date of this order being communicated Prom this order the petitioner preferred an appeal before the second respondent which appeal has been rejected Eight charges were formulated and he was asked to show cause why he should not be dismissed or removed or reduced or subjected to such other disciplinary action as the competent authority may think fit to enforce for breach of Government Rules End conduct unbecoming to <ORG> <ORG> upheld the decision of <ORG> and quoted a portion of the decision of the Chief Justice of <ORG> which ran as follows It does however seem to us that the sub section requires that as and when an authority is definitely proposing to dismiss or reduce in rank a member of <ORG> he shall be so told and he shall be given an opportunity of putting his case against the proposed action and as that opportunity has to be a reasonable opportunity It seems to us that the section requires not only notification of the action proposed but of the grounds on which the authority is proposing that the action should be taken and that the person concerned must then be given a reasonable time to make his representations against the proposed action and the grounds on which it is proposed to be taken In our judgment each case will have to turn on its own facts but the real point of the subsection is in our judgment that the person who is to be dismissed or reduced must know that that punishment is proposed as the punishment for certain acts or omissions on his part and must be told the grounds on which it is proposed to take such action and must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause why such punishment should not be imposed It is on that stage being reached that the statute gives the civil servant the opportunity for which Sub section makes provision to the petition which states as follows The undersigned is directed to invite a reference to Sub section of Section <ORG> of India Act which requires that no <ORG> servant shall be dismissed or reduced in rank until he has been given an opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him It has been held that the provisions of the above section are mandatory and contemplate that after the enquiry against an accused officer has been completed he should be given a further opportunity of showing cause against the particular penalty proposed to be inflicted when such penalty is dismissal removal or reduction in rank Any representation in this behalf should be duly taken into consideration before final orders are passed In the case of a person officiating in a higher post if he is reverted to his original post in the normal course for example for inefficiency there is no question of a punishment or penalty being imposed Mr <NAME> has drawn my attention to the Police Regulations and it appears that Assistant Sub Inspectors are in some cases permitted to act as Sub Inspectors in an officiating capacity The second point of Mr <NAME> was that the Police Regulation by which the petitioner is governed is saved by Article and therefore Article has no application There is no substance in this argument A Rules the petitioner is entitled to have a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Where there is an enquiry not only must he have an opportunity of contesting his case before the enquiry but before the punishment is imposed upon him he must be told about the result of the enquiry and the exact punishment which is proposed to be inflicted for a particular charge which has been proved For example if there was a single charge and the proposed punishment was a single punishment and the civil servant had the amplest opportunity at the enquiry stage to meet the whole case a second opportunity may not be necessary There were several charges framed against the petitioner interpolating a entry interpolating a seizure list and implicating the owner of the holster He was asked to show cause why he should not be dismissed discharged or degraded or otherwise dealt with He has come to the conclusion that the seizure list was interpolated but there is no distinct finding as to whether the entry was interpolated The punishment which he imposed was as follows He be permanently reverted to his substantive rank of A I from the date of this order being communicated Thus no opportunity was given to the petitioner to make any representation against the order of his punishment Against this order the petitioner preferred an appeal to the second respondent But as I have mentioned above the reverting to the original post itself required a further opportunity to be given to the petitioner to show cause against it The point for my determination is whether before the order dated can be upheld the petitioner should have an opportunity to show cause why the punishment inflicted by that order should not be passed Clearly he should have that opportunity The Rule must therefore be made absolute and the orders complained of as mentioned above must be quashed and or set aside There will be a Writ in the nature of Mandamus directing the respondents to give the petitioner such an opportunity in the light of the observations made above and not to give effect to the same without hearing the petitioner
