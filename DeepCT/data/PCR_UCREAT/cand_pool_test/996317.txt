The appellant challenged the levy of the tax for the further periods byway of a writ petition before the High <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh on grounds distinct and separate from those which had been rejected by this <ORG> The appellants in the first batch of appeals came by special leave and also filed writ petitions challenging the validity of the levy The judgment of the Court was delivered by GAJENDRAGADKAR These ten appeals and two writ petitions have been placed for hearing together in a group because they raise common questions of law The respondent <ORG> Chhindwara has issued notices against them calling upon them to pay coal tax for coal manufactured at the mines sold for export by rail or sold otherwise than for export by rail within the jurisdiction of the original <ORG> for the said area It appears that the mining area in question was within the territorial limits of <ORG> which had the status and powers of <ORG> under the Central Provinces Local Self Government Act hereinafter called the Act This notification came into force from January On August notices were served on the two appellants calling upon them to pay Rs On September and March two notices of demand were served on the appellants calling upon them to pay Rs The appellants challenged the validity of these notices by a Writ Petition filed by them in <ORG> on April No Whilst the said writ petition was pending before <ORG> the appellants filed another writ Petition in the same <ORG> No By this writ petition the appellants challenged the validity of notices issued against them on June by which coal tax was demanded from them for a period between April to December this <ORG> on April and it is by special leave thus granted to them that they have come to this <ORG> in Civil Appeals of The appellants have also filed two Writ Petitions Nos under Art By these writ petitions the two appellants challenged the validity of the notices served on them on Julie as well as on September The other appeals arise from the writ petitions filed in <ORG> by the respective appellants which were tried along with the writ petitions filed by <ORG> <ORG> In dealing with these writ petitions <ORG> has held that the decision of this Court is the case of <ORG> concludes the points raised by them in challenging the validity of the notices and so following the said decision the <ORG> has dismissed all the said petitions The appellants applied for and obtained special leave to come to this Court against the said decisions and it is with the special leave thus granted to them that these appellants have come before us Civil Appeal No arises from the decision of <ORG> dismissing the writ petition filed before it by the appellant <ORG> By its writ petition the appellant had challenged the validity of the notice served by the respondent calling upon it to pay arrears of the tax amounting to Rs Civil Appeal No of arises from a writ petition filed by the appellants Private Ltd in <ORG> in which the validity of the notice issued by the respondent calling upon the appellants to pay the coal tax amounting to Rs Civil Appeals Nos to of similarly arise out of six writ petitions filed by the appellants <ORG> five others in <ORG> challenging the validity of the notices of demand served on them to recover by way of arrears coal tax for the periods mentioned in the notices in regard to coal sent by them outside the State of Madhya Pradesh for export whereas the said appeals and writ petitions as well as the other appeals raise an additional question about the validity of the notices issued against the respective appellants The High <ORG> has held that the challenge made by the appellants against the validity of the demand notices issued against them by the respondent is barred by res judicata by virtue of the decision of this <ORG> in the earlier case brought by the appellants themselves before this <ORG> In that case the validity of the impugned notices was challenged on two grounds it was urged that the levy of the tax by <ORG> was invalid at the date of its initial imposition in and so the respondent <ORG> which was the successor of the said Mining Board could claim no authority to continue the said tax This <ORG> held that the Act having received the assent of the Governor General its validity cannot be challenged in view of the saving clauses in the proviso to section A and of the Government of India Act This argument was not considered by the <ORG> because it was not even hinted in the petition filed by the appellants and the <ORG> thought that it would not be proper to permit the appellants to raise that point at that stage That is how the appellants challenge to the validity of the impugned notices served on them on August was repelled and the writ petition filed by them in that behalf was dismissed Having realised that the relevant provision did not save future imposts an amending Act was passed in by which the said saving was extended to include the right of <ORG>s to continue the levy of the impugned tax and this amendment was made retrospective from June when the parent Act had come into force These conditions required that the tax should be one which was lawfully levied by a local authority for the purposes of a local area at the commencement of Part III of the Government of India Act that the identity of the body that collects the tax the area for whose benefit the tax is to be utilised and the purposes for which it is to be utilised continue to be the same and that the rate of the tax is not enhanced nor is its incidence materially altered so that in substance it continues to be the same tax Chief justice <NAME> who delivered the unanimous opinion of the <ORG> has answered this question in the affirmative Then the points raised on behalf of the petitioner <NAME> were considered and it was noticed that in substance they were the same points which had been agitated before this <ORG> on an earlier occasion and had been rejected does not in any way impair or affect the content of the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens of India The notices which are challenged by the appellants in the present proceedings are in respect of the tax levied for a period different from the period covered by the notices issued on August which were the subject matter of the earlier writ proceedings <ORG> Where the liability of a tax for a particular year is considered and decided does the decision for that particular year operate as res judicata in respect of the liability for a subsequent year In a sense the liability to pay tax from year to year is a separate and distinct liability it is based on a different cause of action from year to year and if any points of fact or law are considered in determining the liability for a given year they can generally be deemed to have been considered and decided in a collateral and incidental way The basis for this view is that generally questions of liability to pay tax are determined by Tribunals with limited jurisdiction and so it would not be inappropriate to assume that if they decide any other questions incidental to the determination of the liability for the specific period the decisions of those incidental questions need not create a bar of res judicata while similar questions of liability for subsequent years are being examined The present case relates to a new question viz In that case the question which arose for decision was about the deduction claimable under ther elevant provision of the Land Tax Assessment Act Aust It would thus be seen that this decision applied the principle of res judicata even where there was no express decision on the point but the point had been conceded in the earlier proceedings In <ORG> had occasion to consider this question in the case of <ORG> In that case the main reason given for repelling the application of the principle of res judicata in rating cases was that the jurisdiction of the <ORG> which deals with those cases is limited in that its function begins with and ends with deciding the assessment or liability of a person for a terminable period This decision purported to approve of the view taken in the case of <ORG> and to distinguish the view taken in the <NAME> case In considering this question it may be necessary to distinguish between decision on questions of law which directly and substantially arise in any dispute about the liability for a particular year and questions of law which arise incidentally or in a collateral manner as Lord <NAME> himself has observed in the case of <ORG> that the effect of legal decisions establishing the law would be a different matter In this connection it would be relevant to add that even if a direct decision of this <ORG> on a point of law does not operate as res judicata in a dispute for a subsequent year such a decision would under Art In the present appeals the question which arises directly for our decision is does the principle A We would be reluctant to apply this principle to the present appeals all the more because we are dealing with cases where the impugned tax liability is for different years But when we are considering the question as to whether any law has been declared by this Court by implication such implied declaration though binding must be held to be subject to revision by this Court on a proper occasion where the point in question is directly and expressly raised by any party before this Court ground urged by the appellants on the merits is that the levy authorised to be imposed by the Act and the Rules framed thereunder violates the fundamental rights guaranteed to the citizens under Art In that case the impugned Act was struck down because it suffered from several serious infirmities it was confiscatory in character and its provisions in regard to the levy of the impost were so arbitrary and unreasonable that the <ORG> took the view that the <ORG> had completely ignored the legal position that the assessment of a tax on person or property was at least of a quasi judicial character Section of the Act which in substance corresponds to section of the Act of reads thus Then we go to section which confers power on <ORG> to make Rules It provides that <ORG> may make rules consistant with this Act and with reference if necessary to the varying circumstances of different local areas as to the assessment and collection of the cases and rates specified in sections and of any tax toll or rate imposed under section as to the maximum amounts or rates at which any of them may be imposed as to the prevention of evasion of assessment or payment thereof as to the agency by which they shall be assessed and collected and as to the manner in which account thereof shall be rendered by District Councils In pursuance of the powers conferred on the local Government by rules have been framed on December When this notification was cited before us the appellants conceded that the argument based on the construction of Rule was not available to them It is then argued that the impost of the tax at the rate of pies per ton is not valid because it does not comply with the requirements of of the Act and that raises the question of the construction of the said section The appellants contend that in the context the first im position means not only the first imposition in the sense of an initial imposition but it includes every fresh imposition levied at an increased rate In this connection it is relevant to remember that sub section was added by the same Amending Act by which XV was amended and so it would not be unreasonable to assume that when the legislature gave power to the local <ORG> to prescribe by rules the maximum rates permissible to be levied it introduced sub section in because it was thought necessary that whenever the rates were changed the imposition of the tax at the increased rates should receive the previous sanction of the <ORG> Therefore the argument that the imposition pies per ton has received the sanction of the <ORG> must fail and so the impugned notices which seek to recover the tax from the appellants pies per ton must be held to be invalid The respondent is entitled to levy tax only pies per ton because that levy has received the sanction of the <ORG> but if the respondent intends to increase the rate of the said tax it must follow the procedure prescribed by provided of course it is open to the respondent to increase the said tax There is yet another point on which the appellants are entitled to succeed and that has reference to the fact that the respondent is seeking to reopen some of the assessments made by it against the appellants The argument is that once an assessment is made for a specific period it becomes final and it is not open to the respondent to demand additional amount by way of tax in respect of the said period But after the Constitution came into force doubts arose as to whether Art That is how the respondent has issued notices against the appellants in respect of coal exported by rail out of the State of Madhya Pradesh in regard to the years for which assessment has already been levied against the appellants for the coal not so exported and the contention of the appellants is that this reopening of the assessment is not permissible under the Rules There is no other provision for reopening assessment as we have under sections of the Indian Income Tax Act and so The appellants will be entitled to their costs but one set of bearing fees will be taxed
