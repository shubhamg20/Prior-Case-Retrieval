The suit which gives rise to these consolidated appeals was brought in <ORG> in its original civil jurisdiction under the provisions of section of Act XIV of for the appointment of trustees and the settlement of a scheme of management in respect of a moique situated in the city of Rangoon It is however conceded now that it is a public mosque dedicated to the performance of religious worship by all Sunni Mahommedans without restriction as to place of origin and that it is commonly known as <ORG> Although there is some dispute with regard to the contributions of the general body of Sunnis apart from the Randerias it may be taken as fairly uncontroverted that the bulk of the fund was subscribed by the Randeria section of the worshippers The five persons in whose names the conveyance stood and who had executed the trust deed appear to have carried on the management for several years in course of time some dropped out and others came in as trustees How these men were placed in charge of the management of the mosque is not clear for apparently no meeting of <ORG> was held until and none between and nor in fact had the Randerias any organised association with written rules for the purpose of giving effect to the wishes of their section of the community On the institution of the suit notices were issued by the <ORG> under section of the Civil Procedure Code to all persons entitled to worship at the mosque He accordingly came to the conclusion that the Randeria party were exclusively entitled to the management of the mosque On appeal by the respondents in the first and second appeals respectively the learned Judges of <ORG> differing from the Trial Judge held in substance that the lands which were purchased by or in the names of the five persons in were acquired by them as trustees for the purposes of the existing mosque and subject to the trust therefor and that nothing that took place in or had the effect of cancelling or could in law cancel the original trust and that as the original trust was for the benefit of all persons professing the Sunni sect of the Mahommedan religion they thought that all Sunni Mahommedans were entitled to a voice and control of <ORG> of Rangoon The plaintiffs and the trustee defendants have appealed to His Majesty in Council and the same contention that was put forward in the <ORG> below based on the document of has been urged on their behalf It has further been contended that under the Mahommedan law the <ORG> has no discretion in the matter and that it must give effect to the rule laid down by the founder in all matters relating to the appointment and succession of trustees or mutwallees Their Lordships agree with <ORG> that the transactions which took place in and in no way affected the existing trust and that the trust deed of did not create a new dedication the mosque remained as heretofore a public mosque dedicated to the performance of worship by all Sunni Mahommedans as originally founded It declares omitting the parts not material to this case that whenever the direction of the <ORG> is deemed necessary for the administration of any express or constructive trust created for public charitable or religious purposes the Advocate General acting ex officio or two or more persons having a direct interest in the trust and having obtained the consent in writing of the Advocate General may institute a suit in the High <ORG> or the District <ORG> within the local limits of whose civil jurisdiction the whole or any part of the subject matter of the trust is situate to obtain a decree a appointing new trustees under the trust settling a scheme for its management or granting such further or other relief as the nature of the case may require It has also the power of giving any directions and laying down any rules which might facilitate the work of management and if necessary the appointment of trustees in the future In these circumstances it seems to their Lordships in the exercise of the discretion which the <NAME> law vests in the Kazi that the <ORG>ia section of the worshippers all other conditions being equal are preferably entitled to the mutwalleeship of the <ORG> With regard to the case of <NAME> <NAME> I A which has been relied upon on behalf of the respondents their Lordships deem it sufficient to say that the facts to which they have referred differentiate it widely from the present case The present case however in their Lordships opinion illustrates the mischief of leaving the power of appointing or electing trustees in the hands of an indeterminate and necessarily fluctuating body of people whether they call themselves Punchayet or Jamaet In order to avoid so far as possible a recurrence of the trouble that has brought about this long drawn litigation their Lordships think it desirable in the interests of the institution which form the primary matter for consideration that the appointment of future trustees should be entrusted to a committee of the worshippers the composition of which should be in the discretion of the Judge with due regard to local conditions and needs subject to the provision that so long as circumstances do not vary a majority of such committee should be Randerias and that in settling the scheme the Judge should lay down rules for their guidance in the discharge of any supervisitorial functions that it may appear necessary to confide to them and for filling up vacancies on their body subject to his control The parties will bear their own costs of these appeals And their Lordships will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly
