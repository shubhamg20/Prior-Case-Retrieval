In all the four cases similar question has been referred by <ORG> hereinafter to be referred to as the <ORG> under Section of the I Act hereinafter to be referred to as the Act for the opinion of this court and as such they are being disposed of by a common order In Taxation Cases Nos and of the question referred to this court for opinion is as follows Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the <ORG> was correct in cancelling the orders under Section of the Income tax Act for the assessment years and Same question has been referred in the other two taxation cases for the other two assessment years Later on this file was transferred to the ITO <ORG> who passed the assessment order aforesaid on May This order was passed because the ITO Ward had no jurisdiction over the asssessee at the relevant time and the assessment order could have been passed only by the ITO Ward Against that order the assessee filed an appeal before the <ORG> On an application being filed on behalf of the <ORG> reference has been made to this court as already stated above Learned standing counsel for the <ORG> Mr <NAME> submitted that when the <ORG> has found that on the relevant date the <ORG> Ward had no jurisdiction over the assessee in question then there was no occasion for the <ORG> to cancel the order passed by the Addl Commissioner under Section cancelling the order of assessment of the <ORG> Sub section of Section says that within the limits of the area assigned to him the <ORG> shall have jurisdiction in respect of any person carrying on a business or profession if the place at which such person carries on his business or profession is situate within the area Sub section thereof is a provision under which if there is any dispute on the question as to whether an <ORG> has jurisdiction to assess any person it can be decided by the Commissioner Sub section of Section which is relevant is as follows No person shall be entitled to call in question the jurisdiction of an Income tax Officer a after the expiry of one month from the date on which he has made a return under Sub section of Section or after the completion of the assessment whichever is earlier where he has made no such return after the expiry of the time allowed by the notice under Sub section of Section or under Section for the making of the return The counsel for the assessee has placed reliance on Sub section of Section aforesaid in support of his contention that an order passed by an <ORG> in respect of an assessee over whom he had no jurisdiction shall not be a nullity in the sense that in the eye of law it does not exist According to the learned counsel if an order passed by an <ORG> in respect of an assessee who is carrying on business at a place which is beyond the area allotted to such an <ORG> was to be a nullity then there was no occasion to make a provision like Sub section saying that no person shall be entitled to call in question the jurisdiction of an <ORG> after the period prescribed under that sub section because an order or a proceeding which is a nullity can be challenged at any time However the learned counsel for the assessee submitted that for the purpose of the present case even if it is assumed that an order passed by an <ORG> in respect of the assessee who is not within his jurisdiction is an illegal order still on that ground itself the Commissioner cannot set aside the order in question in exercise of the power conferred on him by Section of the Act unless the Commissioner is also satisfied that the assessment order of the <ORG> is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> The Commissioner may call for and examine the record of any proceeding under this Act and if he considers that any order passed therein by the Income tax Officer is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> he may after giving the assessee an opportunity of being heard and after making or causing to be made such inquiry as he deems necessary pass such order thereon as the circumstances of the case justify including an order enhancing or modifying the assessment or cancelling the assessment and directing a fresh assessment On a plain reading this sub section vests a supervisory power in the Commissioner to enable him to call for and examine the record of any proceeding under the Act and to pass any order which the circumstances of the case may justify including cancellation of the assessment order In other words can the Commissioner exercise the power under Section in cases where on examination he is satisfied that the assessment order has been properly made so far as the assessee in question is concerned but the <ORG> who made the assessment had no jurisdiction over the assessee in question The primary object of the section is to vest a supervisory power in the Commissioner to modify or cancel any order including an assessment order made by an <ORG> if he is of the opinion that such an order is erroneous in so far as it is prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> The <ORG> has pointed out that the Addl Commissioner having held that the <ORG> concerned had no jurisdiction over the assesses during the relevant year of assessment has not pointed out as to how the order of assessment was prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> Learned counsel for the assessee has drawn our attention to that part of the order of the Addl Commissioner It appears to me that the Addl Commissioner never examined the assessment order in the light as to whether the assessment order was prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> of the order he has simply observed that there was question of underassessment and or wrong computation of income in the case The <ORG> has pointed out that there was nothing in the order or on the record of the case on the basis of which the Commissioner could have exercised the power tinder that section It was necessary for the Commissioner to state in what manner he considered that the order of the Income tax Officer was erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> and what the basis was for such a conclusion The <ORG> was therefore justified in setting aside the order of the Income tax Commissioner there must be material before the Commissioner before he passes the order to come to the conclusion that the order sought to be rectified was erroneous in so far as it was prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> To such a conclusion the Commissioner can come on relevant material facts in respect of which reasonable opportunity must be given to the person sought to be affected and such reasonable opportunity again on the principles of natural justice requires that the person to be affected should be given intimation of the materials On behalf of the <ORG> it was submitted that once it is established that the <ORG> in question had no jurisdiction to pass the assessment order on the relevant date that itself shall make the assessment order erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> It was further pointed out by the Commissioner in that case that the <ORG> was not justified in accepting the initial capital the gift received and the sale of jewelleries the income from business etc That writ was dismissed by <ORG> taking the view that sufficient opportunity had been given to the assessee to show cause against the proposed order of cancellation and there were materials on which the Commissioner could have proceeded under Section <ORG> while affirming the order of <ORG> observed that the order of the Commissioner was a detailed order in which it had also been pointed out that the <ORG> who passed the assessment order had no jurisdiction over the assessee because the assessee never resided nor carried on any business at the place mentioned in the return On the basis of all the aforesaid reasons given by the Commissioner and <ORG> <ORG> approved the order passed under Section aforesaid In that case also it had been found that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to make the order as it related to an area which was not within his jurisdiction <ORG> while considering the question as to whether the Commissioner could have exercised the power under Section of the old Act held that the order was erroneous and it was prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> If so and we think it is so the Commissioner under Section has ample jurisdiction to cancel the assessment and may initiate proceedings for assessment under the provisions of the Act against some other assessee who according to the income tax authorities is liable for the income thereof In my opinion <ORG> in the said case did not hold the order of assessment erroneous and prejudicial to the interests of the <ORG> merely on the ground that the <ORG> had no jurisdiction to make the order It is true that while setting aside an order of assessment and directing a subordinate authority to reconsider the matter afresh the appellate or revisional authority should not record conclusive findings on the questions involved but at the same time it cannot be held that the orders passed by the subordinate authorities should be set aside without indicating the reasons in exercise of the power which is circumscribed by the conditions mentioned in the very section
