The prosecution examined specific witnesses with reference to the allegations supporting the draft charges and documents were also produced to support the allegations The appellant aggrieved by the order refusing to frame charges on heads by the Trial Judge filed the present Criminal Appeal by Special Leave The appeal is allowed to that extent Under the trial Judge is required to discharge the accused if he considers that there is no sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused The power to discharge is exercisable under i when the Magistrate considers for reasons to be recorded that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction Notwithstanding this difference in the position there is no scope for doubt that the stage at which the Magistrate is required to consider the question of framing of charge under is a preliminary one and that the test of prima facie case has to be applied A Under i of the Code the requirement is that the evidence must be such which if not rebutted would warrant conviction of the accused For an offence under IPC the essential ingredients are i the accused was a public servant ii he accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or obtain a valuable thing without consideration or for an inadequate consideration knowing it to be inadequate iii the person giving the thing must be a person concerned or interested in or related to the person concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by the government servant or having any connection with the official of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate and iv the accused must have knowledge that the person giving the thing is so concerned or interested or related The difference between the acceptance of a bribe made punishable under and IPC is that under the former section the present is taken as a motive or reward for abuse of office under the latter section the question of motive or reward is wholly immaterial and the acceptance of a valuable thing without consideration or with inadequate consideration from a person who has or is likely to have any business to be transacted is forbidden because though not taken as a motive or reward for showing any official favour it is likely to influence the public servant to show official favour to the person giving such valuable thing Before a person can be said to put any person to fear of any injury to that person it must appear that he has held out some threat to do or omit to do what he is legally bound to do in future In the instant case there is no evidence at all to show that the managements of the sugar co operatives had been put in any fear and the contributions had been paid in response to threats Merely because the respondent was Chief Minister at the relevant time and the sugar co operatives had some of their grievances pending consideration before the <ORG> and pressure was brought about to make the donations promising consideration of such grievances possibly by way of recipro city there is no justification that the ingredients of the offence of extortion have been made out The evidence led by the prosecution falls short of the requirements of law in regard to the alleged offence of extortion Cheating is defined in of the and the ingredients for that offence are i there should be fraudulent or dishonest inducement of a person by deceiving him ii the person so induced should be intentionally induced to deliver any property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property or iii the person so induced should be intentionally induced to do or to omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not so deceived and iv in cases covered by the second part of the act or omission should be one which caused or is likely to cause damage or harm to the person induced in body mind reputation or property Section actually consists of two parts each part dealing with one way of cheating i Where by deception practised upon a person the accused dishonestly or fraudulently induced that person to deliver property to any person or to consent that any person shall retain any property ii Where by deception practised upon a person the accused intentionally induces that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body mind reputation or property Per Bhagwati <NAME> concurring When the court is considering under sub of the Code of Criminal Procedure whether any case has been made out against the accused which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction it is difficult to understand as to how the court can brush aside the presumption under of the Prevention of Corruption Act When the <ORG> is called upon to consider whether a charge should be framed or not the question to which the <ORG> has to address itself is whether the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution is such that if unrebutted it would justify the conviction of the accused and the court has therefore to examine the evidence as it stands without rebuttal and come to a conclusion whether on the basis of such evidence the court would convict the accused and where the offence charged against the accused is under or or cl a or clause or sub or envisages is that any gratification other than legal remuneration should have been accepted or obtained or agreed to be accepted or attempted to be obtained by the accused for himself or for any other person as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his official function favour or disfavour to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person while does not require taking of gratification as a motive or reward for any specific official action favour or service but strikes at obtaining by a public servant of any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been or to be or likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by such public servant or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate or from whom any person whom he knows to be interested in or related to the person so concerned Whereas under it is necessary to establish that the taking of gratification must be connected with any specific official action favour or service by way of motive or reward no such connection is necessary to be proved in order to bring home an offence under and all that is necessary to establish is that a valuable thing is accepted or obtained or agreed to be accepted or attempted to be obtained by a public servant from any person whom he knows to have been or to be likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by such public servant or having any connection with the official function of such public servant and such valuable thing has been accepted or obtained without consideration or for a consideration which such public servant knows to be inadequate The following Judgments of the Court were delivered <NAME> <NAME> I agree with the judgment about to be delivered by my learned brother <NAME> but there are some two or three charges in regard to which I should like to make more detailed observations since they have not been dealt fully by my learned brother and he has left it to me to consider them in some detail The first point arises out of a contention raised by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent hereinafter referred to as the respondent that the presumption under Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act applies only after a charge is framed against an accused and has no application at the stage when the court is considering the question whether a charge should be framed or not It is said in geometry that a point has position but no magnitude but we are constrained to observe that this point raised on behalf of the first respondent has not only no magnitude but has even no position It is wholly without substance and indeed it is surprising that it should have been raised by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent When the court is considering under Section sub section of the Code of Criminal Procedure whether any case has been made out against the accused which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction it is difficult to understand as to how the court can brush aside the presumption under Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act Sub section of Section of that Act provided that where in any trial of an offence punishable under Section or Section of the Indian Penal Code or of an offence referred to in clause a or clause of sub section of Section of that Act it is proved that an accused has accepted or obtained or has agreed to accept or admitted to obtain for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration or any valuable thing from any person it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that he accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or submitted to obtain that gratification or that valuable thing as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in Section or as the case may be without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate When the court is called upon to consider whether a charge should be framed or not the question to which the court has to address itself is whether the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution is such that if unrebutted it would justify the conviction of the accused and the <ORG> has therefore to examine the evidence as it stands without rebuttal and come to a conclusion whether on the basis of such evidence the court would convict the accused and where the offence charged against the accused is under Section or Section or clause a or clause of sub section of Section the <ORG> must necessarily apply the presumption under Section while considering whether on the basis of the unrebutted evidence which is before it the court would convict the accused We do not therefore see any substance in the contention raised on behalf of the first respondent and we must proceed to dispose of this appeal on the basis that even for the purpose of considering whether a charge should be framed or not the presumption under Section must be taken into account I agree with my learned brother that it may not be desirable at this stage to define the precise ambit and coverage of Section because that is a matter which will have to be considered by <ORG> in depth when the case goes back before <ORG> and the first respondent is called upon to face his trial on the charges framed against him We may usefully quote here the following pertinent observations made by this Court in Re Special Courts Bill which came by way of Presidential Reference and which is reported in As I read it this measure is the embryonic expression of a necessitous legislative project which if full fledged will work a relentless break through towards catching through the compulsive criminal process the higher inhabitants of Indian public and political decks who have in practice remained untouchable and unapproachable to the rule of law The pathology of our public law with its class slant is that an unmincing ombudsman or sentinel on the qui vive with power to act against those in power now or before and offering legal access to the informed citizen to complain with immunity does not exist despite all the bruited umbrage of political performers against peculations and perversions by higher echelons There are a few decisions of ancient vintage which have dealt with the interpretation of Section but since we are not finally laying down the true scope and ambit of Section we do not propose to discuss these decisions Suffice it to point out at the present stage that on its plain terms Section is wider than Section and that an act of corruption not falling within Section may yet come within the wide terms of Section What Section envisages is that any gratification other than legal remuneration should have been accepted or obtained or agreed to be accepted or attempted to be obtained by the accused for himself or for any other person as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing to do any official act or for showing or forbearing to show in the exercise of his official function favour or disfavour to any person or for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any person while Section does not require taking of gratification as a motive or reward for any specific official action favour or service but strikes at obtaining by a public servant of any valuable thing without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate from any person whom he knows to have been or to be or likely to be concerned in any proceeding or business transacted or about to be transacted by such public servant or having any connection with the official functions of himself or of any public servant to whom he is subordinate or from whom any person whom he knows to be interested in or related to the person so concerned Moreover it is clear from illustration to Section that money or currency is regarded by the <ORG> as a valuable thing and if it is accepted or obtained by a public servant without consideration or for inadequate consideration in the circumstances set out in Section such public servant would be guilty of an offence under that Section Having said this much on the interpretation of Section we now proceed to examine the facts on the basis of which the High <ORG> has declined to frame certain charges against the first respondent The facts giving rise to these charges in so far as relevant may be briefly stated as follows There were various changes in the constitution on this firm from time to time but we are not concerned with these changes in the present appeal The partners of this firm therefore made an application to the Controller of Accommodation on th January pointing out that <ORG> had approached them with a request to allow them to use the premises for the purpose of opening their branch office in Bombay and that it would be advantageous to the country to make it possible for the <ORG> to open a branch office and requesting the Controller of Accommodation to grant the necessary permission Though this application was dated th January it appears from the endorsement made on the application that it was received in the office of the Controller of Accommodation on th February Further inquiry was thereupon made for the purpose of determining whether there was a suppressed vacancy in respect of the premises and after such inquiry was completed a further noting was made on nd March recommending that in view of the facts set out in that noting it is for orders whether we may consider the request and grant the no objection certificate in this case <NAME> who was an Accommodation Officer made an endorsement on the foot of his further noting pointing out that according to the inquiry made by the office no vacancy had actually occurred at any time in the premises and there was accordingly no suppressed vacancy and moreover only a part of the premises was proposed to be sub let by the firm of <ORG> and hence the premises could not be requisitioned as a suppressed vacancy and consequently no objection certificate might be granted The date below the signature of the Additional Chief Secretary is a little doubtful but we can safely take it to be nd March since there is an endorsement at the bottom of the page showing that the file was received in the Secretariat of the Additional Chief Secretary on th March and obviously it must have gone to the Secretariat to the Chief Minister after making of the endorsement by the Additional Chief Secretary We shall revert to this endorsement of the first respondent a little later when we examine the arguments urged on behalf of the parties <NAME> stated in his evidence that he told the first respondent about the application for permission made on behalf of the firm of <ORG> and requested the first respondent to sanction grant of no objection certificate stating that he and his father were partners in that firm <NAME> thereupon pointed out to the first respondent that there was a registered agreement between <ORG> and the Government of France whereunder the Government of France had permitted the State <ORG> of India to open its Branch at Paris and <ORG> had consequently permitted Indo Suez <ORG> to open its Branch at Bombay and he accordingly requested the first respondent to name a reasonable amount for donation <NAME> was at this stage in his evidence asked the following question by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant <NAME> reiterated in cross examination by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the first respondent After I handed over the cheque the accused stated that he will do the needful in the matter On these facts the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant submitted that offences under Section of the Indian Penal Code and Section read with Section of the Prevention of Corruption Act were clearly made out on behalf of the prosecution so as to warrant the framing of charges for the said offences against the first respondent We do not see any reason why for the purpose of considering whether a charge should be framed or not we should disbelieve the evidence of <NAME> and <NAME> What we have to consider is whether the evidence led on behalf of the complainant in regard to this transaction is such that if unrebutted that would warrant the conviction of the first respondent This is not the stage to come to any definite finding on this question because after the charges are framed evidence may have to be led on behalf of the prosecution for the purpose of establishing overwriting of the figure by the figure and the first respondent may also lead the evidence to show that there is no overwriting and the original figure always was But while we are considering the prima facie case made out against the first respondent we cannot help observing that it does appear from the original endorsement in red ink made by the first respondent at the bottom of the relevant page in the file Ex which says Secretary has seen it and it bears the date And if that be so it lends considerable support to the oral testimony of <NAME> and <NAME> There is no reason to disbelieve the evidence given by <NAME> to this effect It is significant to note that the Order sanctioning the grant of no objection certificate was made by the first respondent on the file on th April i on the same date on which the cheque for Rs What altruistic motive could have inspired them to have made such a handsome donation when they themselves were incurring losses Prima Facie the inference to be drawn from these circumstances is irresistible and unless the first respondent can rebut this evidence it is difficult to reject the contention of the prosecution that a prima facie case has been made out against the first respondent in respect of this transaction We are therefore of the view that a prima facie case was made out on behalf of the prosecution against the first respondent in respect of the transaction of no objection certificate and th th and th charges should have been framed against the first respondent That takes us to draft charges and arising out of the donations made by <ORG> <ORG> and <ORG> to <NAME> Pratibha Pratishthan It is necessary to state briefly the facts relating to this transaction in order to be able to decide whether a prima facie case has been made out on behalf of the prosecution against the respondent in regard to this transaction and evidence led on behalf of the prosecution is such that if unrebutted it would warrant the conviction of the respondent on these charges We are not concerned with this company in the present appeal Since the concerns of <NAME> were starved of cement and they could not proceed with the construction works undertaken by them without cement they made applications to the respondent from time to time for allotment of quota of cement It will thus be seen that in the case of these four concerns namely <NAME> Construction Private Limited <ORG> <ORG> and <NAME> Enterprises only metric tonns of cement could be obtained prior to th July and it was admitted by <NAME> in the course of his evidence that it was correct that till th June that he had not received more than metric tonns of cement against the four applications dated th April Exs It was only when as a result of further representations made to the respondent new orders of allotment were issued on rd July that some quantities of cement could be obtained by these four concerns of <NAME> We have already referred to the fact that <ORG> had undertaken construction work under the agreement with <ORG> <ORG> had also not been able to obtain any quantity of cement in respect of the other construction work undertaken by them at Villa Parle East despite the application dated th April made by them to the respondent The two applications were accordingly made to the respondent on th June one by <ORG> marked as Ex in consideration of the grant of the two permits in favour of <ORG> and <ORG> the first respondent had committed offences under sections and of the Indian Penal Code sub sections and of section of the Prevention of Corruption Act It seems that <ORG> has started a new project at <ORG> in May and they needed cement for this project and they accordingly made an application dated th June Ex Now according to the evidence of <NAME> was at the relevant time Secretary <ORG> the respondent mentioned to him on th June that one <NAME> would be giving to him i to <NAME> on th June a set of applications for cement indicating the quantity to be sanctioned and that these proposals had his approval and therefore the <ORG> should take action on these cases and thereafter report to the first respondent for confirmation In all there are applications and the total quantity to be sanctioned comes to metric tonns But even on the material on record there is reason to believe that the three statements which accompanied the note Ex This was disputed on behalf of the respondent who contended that these two donations had been made by <NAME> Construction Private Limited and <ORG> voluntarily and they had nothing to do with the allotment of cement to the concerns of <NAME> Now there are certain salient features in regard to this transaction which in our opinion go to show prima facie that these two donations were connected with the allotment of cement to the concerns of <NAME> In the first place there is no reason why any of the concerns of <NAME> should have made such large donations to <NAME> It was admitted by <NAME> that none of his concerns had made any profit and in fact he conceded in evidence that the donations made by his two concerns to the <NAME> had no connection with the profits of the two concerns or of any of his other concerns When <NAME> was asked to explain how it was that for the permit of metric tonns that is bags he made a payment of Rs which worked out to Rs per bag and for the permit of metric tonns that is bags he made payment of Rs We therefore reach the conclusion that on the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution a prima facie case must be held to have been made out against the respondent in respect of the transaction of the donations of Rs It was provided that <ORG> will construct on the plot necessary buildings and structures for carrying out its performances including residential quarters for essential staff working in the <ORG> and for visiting artists and students provided the <ORG> would be at liberty to make available these facilities to outside parties at such compensation as it may deem fit so long as the income from the land and buildings was appropriated for the objects of the <ORG> and further a sum equal to of the net annual profits of the <ORG> was credited to <ORG> Subsequently with a view to enabling it to meet its operating expenses <ORG> made an application to <ORG> by its letter dated th March requesting the <ORG> for permission to utilise upto one fourth of the area granted to it for the purpose of putting up high grade shops and offices But to the great dismay and consternation of the Directors of <ORG> a Government resolution was passed an rd March providing that since two separate leases were given to <ORG> in respect of sq These developments which took place in jeopardized the very existence of <ORG> Though <NAME> did not hold any official position in <ORG> he took an active part in the negotiations with the various officers of <ORG> in for the purpose of obtaining relaxation of the <ORG> notification dated th June and <ORG> resolution dated rd March so as to enable <ORG> to construct a commercial building of net rentable area of sq He was appointed by the respondent as Chairman of <ORG> to deal with the problem of slums and dilapidated houses and he was given an office in Mantralaya Some reliance was placed on behalf of the respondent on the fact that this note did not make any reference to donations to be made to <NAME> and it was sought to be argued that there was in fact no such talk prior to the date of this note was handed over by <NAME> to <NAME> on th March and following upon this note there was discussion between <NAME> and <NAME> in the presence of <NAME> on th March when the scheme put forward by <NAME> was discussed It was agreed between <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> and <NAME> on behalf of <ORG> that the entire plot of acres would be covered under one lease on condition that the mortgage in respect of th area of the plot is redeemed the commercial development of the plot would be confined to th area of the plot and full FSI at the rate of in respect of the entire area of the plot would be available to <ORG> and this would give almost sq The respondent approved and confirmed the agreement but it was made clear to <NAME> and it was agreed by him that the donations made to <NAME> would not be deductible as expenses of <ORG> while computing its net income The argument urged on behalf of the respondent which found favour with the learned Trial Judge was that when the respondent declined the request of <NAME> to permit deductibility of the donations made to <NAME> the entire scheme foundered and thereafter there was no question of making any donations to <NAME> where it has been clearly recorded by him It needs to be recorded that in the meeting held first by <NAME> with <NAME> and latter when <NAME> and <NAME> explained the agreement reached to both on it was clearly stated and agreed that the payments to <NAME> would be after <ORG> net income was computed and were not to be considered as <ORG> expenses while computing net income <NAME> of course disputed that any such agreement was arrived at between him on the one hand and Gavai <NAME> and the respondent on the other but prima facie we are inclined to accept the testimony of <NAME> to this effect because we would prefer documentary evidence to oral evidence in case of conflict between the two There was no particular reason why the figure of Rs There is another circumstance which is of a baffling character indeed it defies any rational conduct and this circumstance is that the four cheques representing the aggregate donation of Rs <ORG> would then have to return the amount of the donation but if this amount was already spent by <ORG> for purchasing land for the purpose of building a hospital how would <ORG> be able to return the amount of the donation and even if the amount of the donation were returned it would be without interest because there was admittedly no provision for payment of interest and a <ORG> concern making the donation would lose interest on the amount of the donation for the period during which the amount remained with <ORG> Obviously and here again we are expressing our prima facie view this donation of Rs This note which is dated th April and which is part of Ex He went on to say that the respondent had sent to him one <NAME> who was a labour leader in <ORG> in Bombay and he heard from <NAME> that <ORG> intended to make donations before st March lakhs to <NAME> and cheques were paid to <NAME> on behalf of these three trusts lakhs were also connected with the negotiations which took place on th March between <NAME> on the one hand and <NAME> and the respondent on the other Before we close we may make it clear that we have examined the evidence on record merely for the purpose of deciding whether the evidence is of such a nature that if unrebutted it would warrant the conviction of the respondent RANGANATH MISRA This appeal by special leave is directed against the order of a learned Single Judge of <ORG> dated April refusing to frame charges on heads while framing charges under other heads This litigation has had a chequered career The appellant <NAME> filed a petition of complaint on September in <ORG> Esplanade Bombay alleging commission of several offences by the respondent and some other persons This complaint came to be registered as Special Case No This Court directed Therefore Special Case No and Special Case No held When cognizance is taken on a private complaint or to be precise otherwise than on a police report the Special Judge has to try the case according to the procedure prescribed for trial of warrant cases instituted otherwise than on police report by a Magistrate sections to of Code of Criminal Procedure Section requires that when accused is brought before a <ORG> the <ORG> shall proceed to hear the complainant and take all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution Accused has a right to cross examine complainant and his witnesses If upon considering the evidence so produced the <ORG> finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction the <ORG> shall discharge the accused section ibid If on the other hand <ORG> is of the opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence which the <ORG> is competent to try a charge shall be framed in writing against the accused He alleged in the petition of complaint that between August and September when respondent was functioning as Chief Minister he retained to himself the power to deal with the following matters The allotment of cement quota and distribution of cement Supply and sale of industrial alcohol issue of licenses for wholesalers and retailers dealing in country liquor and Indian made foreign liquor Control of co operatives and in particular the sugar co operatives Administration of urban land ceiling law restriction of I and exemptions therefrom and in fact he himself exercised these powers of the <ORG> <NAME> AP It is the prosecution case and there is no dispute that Srivardhan located in the District of Raigad was the Assembly Constituency of the respondent These representations were made with a view to creating an appropriate impact on the mind of the people at large The prosecution examined specific witnesses with reference to the allegations supporting the draft charges Section provides If upon taking of the evidence referred to in the Magistrate considers for reasons to be recovered that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction the Magistrate shall discharge him While section on the other hand requires If when such evidence has been taken or at any previous stage of the case the Magistrate is of opinion that there is ground for presuming that the accused has committed an offence triable under this Chapter which such Magistrate is competent to try and which in his opinion should be adequately punished by him he shall frame in writing a charge against the accused The Code contemplates discharge of the accused by <ORG> under in a case triable by it cases instituted upon a police report are covered by and cases instituted otherwise than on police report are dealt with in Under the trial Judge is required to discharge the accused if he considers that there is not sufficient ground for proceeding against the accused The power to discharge is exercisable under when the Magistrate considers for reasons to be recorded that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction It is a fact that ss and provide for discharge being ordered before the recording of evidence and the consideration as to whether charge has to be framed or not is required to be made on the basis of the record of the case including documents and oral hearing of the accused and the prosecution or the police report the documents sent along with it and examination of the accused and after affording an opportunity to the two parties to be heard Not withstanding this difference in the position there is no scope for doubt that the stage at which the Magistrate is required to consider the question of framing of charge under is a preliminary one and the test of prima facie case has to be applied It was further observed If the evidence which the prosecution proposes to adduce to prove the guilt of the accused even if fully accepted before it is challenged in cross examination or rebutted by the defence evidence if any cannot show that the accused committed the offence then there will be no sufficient ground for proceeding with the trial <NAME> indicated that the <ORG> has power to sift and weigh the evidence for the limited purpose of finding out whether or not a prima facie case against the accused has been made out At this stage even a very strong suspicion founded upon materials before the Magistrate which leads him to form a presumptive opinion as to the existence of the factual ingredients constituting the offence alleged may justify the framing of charge The use of the words if upon taking of the evidence referred to in in sub of is suggestive of the statutory intention that until all such evidence as may be produced in support of the prosecution is taken the stage for judicial consideration as to whether charge is to be framed is not reached Admittedly the witnesses examined for the prosecution have been cross examined and in the case of some at great length There is no scope for doubt that the rebuttal case envisaged in of the Code is fairly clear from the cross examination of prosecution witnesses as also from the documents exhibited before the <ORG> apart from direct evidence being led by the defence independently Under the scheme of the Code there is no scope for the accused to lead defence evidence until the prosecution is closed and the examination of the accused under of the Code is over Lengthy arguments were advanced both by Mr <NAME> for the appellant and Mr <NAME> for the respondent with reference to the evidence In view of these observations made in course of the hearing a written statement on behalf of the respondent was filed on November signed by the respondent and his counsel The relevant portion of the said statement reads thus Since some charges have already been framed by learned Trial Judge with respect to offences under ss and I But it cannot be disputed that in order to decide whether the order of discharge should be sustained or set aside we have to consider whether on the material on record a prima facie case has been made out on behalf of the prosecution He also suggested that the matter should be left to be argued and the learned Trial Judge should be free to come to his conclusion in law with reference to the facts of the case about the scope and ambit of that provision that if any party was aggrieved by the decision it would still be open to be corrected in the appellate forum But before doing so we would briefly refer to the evidence in support of the charges which the respondent has agreed to be framed for the purpose of showing that the learned Trial Judge had prima facie taken a wrong view and it was a fit case where these charges should have also been framed There is considerable evidence in regard to allotment of cement under instructions of the respondent In regard to the <ORG> there is contemporaneous documentary evidence as also oral evidence to show that certain concessions were extended by <ORG> and payments had been received which have gone into the Trust funds While the prosecution has alleged that the payments of money were a consideration for the favour shown to <ORG> the defence has A come out with the version that the payments made and stipulated were unconnected and the large sum of money agreed to be paid was for the purpose of improving the lot of the people of Konkan region Similarly in regard to the grant of No Objection Certificate in respect of the premises of <ORG> there is evidence from the side of the prosecution to support its allegation that the power of the <ORG> was exercised for a consideration while there is no denial regarding receipt of the payment but the link is denied and disputed Similarly in regard to industrial alcohol at least so far as <ORG> are concerned there is the evidence of PW It may be pointed out that there is substance in Mr <NAME> submission that the learned Trial Judge adopted two different standards in the matter of weighing the same evidence when he agreed to frame charges which were inter linked and inter connected with the rest of the prosecution story with reference to which the draft charges had been given It is appropriate at this stage to take note of the fact that under of the Code the requirement is that the evidence must be such which if not rebutted would warrant conviction of the accused There is another aspect which has also to be noticed here Section of that Act provides Where in any trial of an offence punishable under or section of the Indian Penal Code or of an offence referred to in clause a or clause of sub of of this Act punishable under sub section thereof it is proved that an accused person has accepted or obtained or has agreed to accept or attempted to obtain for himself or for any other person any gratification other than legal remuneration or any valuable thing from any person it shall be presumed unless the contrary is proved that he accepted or obtained or agreed to accept or attempted to obtain that gratification or that valuable thing as the case may be as a motive or reward such as is mentioned in the said section or as the case may be without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate It has been pointed out by this <ORG> in <NAME> case <ORG> that is so worded as to cover cases of corruption which do not come within ss or The difference between the acceptance of a bribe made punishable under and IPC is this under the former section the present is taken as a motive or reward for abuse of office under the latter section the question of motive or reward is wholly immaterial and the acceptance of a valuable thing without consideration or with inadequate consideration from a person who has or is likely to have any business to be transacted is forbidden because though not taken as a motive or reward for showing any official favour it is likely to influence the public servant to show official favour to the person giving such valuable thing Mr <NAME> next contended that the following features which had been established should have led the learned Judge to hold that there was material for the view that a case in respect of the charge had been made out by the prosecution Before a person can be said to put any person to fear of any injury to that person it must appear that he has held out some threat to do or omit to do what he is legally bound to do in future We agree with this view which has been indicated in <NAME> King Emperor A I All There is no evidence at all in this case that the managements of the sugar co operatives had been put in any fear and the contributions had been paid in response to threats The evidence led by the prosecution falls short of the requirements of law in regard to the alleged offence of extortion The only other allegation in respect of which there is an order of discharge is relating to cheating Therein there is reference to <ORG> and a reading of it prima facie shows that the establishment of <ORG> was the decision of <ORG> Similarly there is another <ORG> of Maharashtra publication known as Maharashtra Marches Ahead Ext and it clearly shows that it is not a <ORG> <ORG> nor was it created by the <ORG> <NAME> was specifically questioned as to whether there was a <ORG> decision in respect of creation of <ORG> as a Govt Respondent made a similar statement on the floor of <ORG> on September wherein apart from endorsing the statement in <ORG> he took the responsibility on himself of assuming Mrs <NAME> consent He ultimately took the view that the material placed on record did not justify a charge under of
