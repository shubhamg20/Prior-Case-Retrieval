The only question for decision in this second appeal is whether the application for execution is barred by limitation The expression general power of attorney has not been defined either in the Civil Procedure Code or in any other statute nor has any case been brought to our notice which could be regarded as giving an authoritative decision on the question Story in his work on Agency Section says a special agency properly exists where there is a delegation of authority to do a single act a general agency properly exists where there is a delegation to do all acts connected with a particular trade business or employment Thus a person who is authorised by his principal to execute a particular deed or to sign a particular contract or to purchase a particular parcel or merchandise is a special agent But a person who is authorized by his principal to execute all deeds sign all contracts or to purchase all goods required in a particular trade business or employment is a general agent in that particular trade business or employment A general agent is one who has authority arising out of and in the ordinary course of his business or profession to do some act or acts on behalf of his principal in relation thereto or one who is authorised to act on behalf of the principal generally in transactions of a particular kind or incident to a particular business the statement is a general power authoriseS an agent to act generally on behalf of the principal and a special power is one limited to particular acts According to this view when a power of attorney authorises a person to do all things and take all steps which may be necessary to complete the execution of a decree it must in our opinion be regarded as a general power of attorney persons holding powers of attorney authorising them to make and do such appearances applications and acts on behalf of such parties We hold that the previous application for execution in this case was presented by an agent having a general power of attorney and it was therefore one presented in accordance with law It follows that the present application is not barred by limitation The Costs in this and in the lower appellate Court will abide the result
