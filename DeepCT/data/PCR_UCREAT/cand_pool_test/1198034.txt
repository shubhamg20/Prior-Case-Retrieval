In a petition under Article of the Constitution the respondent impugned the order of termination of his services on the ground that he was appointed permanently to the post of Ammunition Repair Labourer Grade II and that the termination of his services when juniors were retained in service was discriminatory and was in contravention of Article of the Constitution A single Judge of <ORG> rejected the respondent claim that he was appointed permanently to the post but held that since persons junior to him had been retained in service termination of his services without assigning any reason was discriminatory and therefore the order was bad in law The well settled position in law in this regard is that i if the services of a temporary government servant are terminated in accordance with the conditions of his service on the ground of unsatisfactory conduct or his un suitability for the job and or for his work being unsatisfactory or for a like reason which marks him off in a class apart from other temporary servants who have been retained in service there is no question of the applicability of Article ii where the services of a temporary government servant or a probationer government servant are terminated by an order which does not ex facie disclose any stigma or penal consequences against the government servant and is merely a termination order simpliciter there is no case ordinarily for assuming that it is anything but what it purports to be iii before Article is held to have been violated by some action there must be a clear demonstration of discrimination between one government servant and another similarly placed which cannot be reasonably explained except on an assumption or demonstration of malice in law or malice in fact The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> in Writ Appeal No of which had been filed by the appellant against the judgment of the learned Single Judge of that High Court allowing No of Thereafter his services were terminated by Order dated Ex on two grounds namely that he was appointed permanently to the post of A Grade II by the Order Ex In the counter affidavit filed in the Writ Petition the appellant contended that the phraseology regular cadre does not imply as it may in some other instances in the employment of government a substantive post that the post in the regular cadre is also a purely temporary one and that the post of Ammunition Repair Labourer Grade II to which the respondent was promoted and appointed was also on a temporary basis The appellant denied that there was any discrimination in the termination of the services of the respondent on the ground that there is nothing in the order to show that the respondent had been appointed permanently to the post The learned Judge observed that there is no denial of the fact that persons junior to the respondent have been retained in service and that there is nothing in the order Ex or in the counter affidavit filed by the respondent in the Writ Appeal to show that the respondent was guilty of any misconduct or was otherwise unfit to hold the post The learned Judge further observed that in paragraph of the counter affidavit it has only been stated that the fact other persons who are junior to the respondent are retained in service would not confer any right on the respondent to continue in service The learned Judges observed in their judgment that no reason at all was either alleged or proved as to why appellant chose to terminate the respondent services under rule of the Central Services Temporary Services Rules such as that it was administratively convenient to do so or that the respondent work or conduct was unsatisfactory or that it was a case of retrenchment and the respondent was chosen as the junior most person Beliappa where it has been observed thus The principle that can be deduced from the above analysis is that if the services of a temporary Government servant are terminated in accordance with the conditions of his service on the ground of unsatisfactory conduct or his unsuitability for the job and or for his work being unsatisfactory or for a like reason which marks him off in a class apart from other temporary servants who have been retained in service there is no question of the applicability of Article Conversely if the services of a temporary Government servant are terminated arbitrarily and not on the ground of his unsuitability unsatisfactory conduct or the like which would put him in a class apart from his juniors in the same service a question of unfair discrimination may arise notwithstanding the fact that in terminating his service the appointing authority was purporting to act in accordance with the terms of the employment Where a charge of unfair discrimination is levelled with specificity or improper motives are imputed to the authority making the impugned order of termination of the service it is the duty of the authority to dispel that charge by disclosing to the <ORG> the reason or motives which impelled it to take the impugned action Excepting perhaps in cases analogous to those covered by Article Proviso the authority cannot withhold such information from the <ORG> the lame excuse that impugned order is purely administrative and not judicial having been passed in exercise of its adminis trative discretion under the rules governing the conditions of the service a similar observation has been made by <NAME> at page The law it seems to me is that where the services of a temporary <ORG> servant or a probationer <ORG> servant are terminated by an order which does not ex facie disclose any stigma or penal consequences against the <ORG> servant and is merely a termination order simpliciter there is no case ordinarily for assuming that it is anything but what it purports to be In such a case if the <ORG> servant is able to establish by material on the record that the order is in fact passed by way of punishment the innocence of the language in which the order is framed will not protect it if the procedural safeguards contemplated by Article of the Constitution have not been satisfied For unless there is material on the record before the <ORG> in support of that allegation an attempt by the <ORG> to find out from the record whether the termination of service is based on the unsuitability of the <ORG> servant in relation to the post held by him or is in reality an order by way of punishment will in effect be an unwarranted attempt to delve into the official records for the purpose of determining the nature of the order on the basis of a mere allegation of the <ORG> servant In these circumstances therefore it is obvious that as the respondent was merely a probationer the appointing authority did not consider it necessary to continue the enquiry but decided to terminate the services of the respondent as he was not found suitable for the job It is well settled by a long course of decisions of this Court that in the case of a probationer or a temporary employee who has no right to the post such a termination of his service is valid and does not attract the provisions of Article of the Constitution In these circumstances we allow this appeal and set aside the judgment of <ORG> and confirm the appellant order Ex
