How this increase in liability has to be a accounted for in the books of account of the businessman and taken into account for purposes of certain allowances available under the Income tax Act are the two issues that have to be considered in this appeal Let us consider the case of an income tax assessee whose previous year ended on who had placed an order for plant and machinery costing on at a time when the rupee exchange rate of a dollar was say ten rupees to the dollar Let us suppose that he had eventually to pay Rs Before dealing with these questions it may be useful to refer to certain accountancy principles and statutory provisions that have a bearing on the issues raised It reads A Notwithstanding anything contained in any other provision of this Act where an assessee has acquired any asset from a country outside India for the purposes of his business or profession and in consequence of a change in the rate of exchange at any time after the acquisition of such asset there is an increase or reduction in the liability of the assessee as expressed in Indian currency for making payment towers the whole or a part of the cost of the asset or for repayment of the whole or a part of the moneys borrowed by him from any person directly or indirectly in any foreign currency specifically for the purpose of acquiring the asset being in either case the liability existing immediately before the date on which the change in the rate of exchange takes effect the amount by which the liability aforesaid is so increased or reduced during the previous year shall be added to or as the case may be deducted from the actual cost of the asset as defined in Clause of Section or the amount of expenditure of a capital nature referred to in Clause iv of Sub section of Section or in Section A or in Clause ix of Sub section of Section or in the case of a capital asset not being a capital asset referred to in Section the cost of acquisition thereof for the purposes of Section and the amount arrived at after such addition or deduction shall be taken to be the actual cost of the asset or the amount of expenditure of a capital nature or as the case may be the cost of acquisition of the capital asset as aforesaid xxxx xxxx xxxxx The provisions of Sub section shall not be taken into account in computing the actual cost of an asset for the purpose of the deduction on account of development rebate under Section It read Where the original cost aforesaid and additions and deductions thereto relate to any fixed asset which has been acquired from a country outside India and in consequence of a change in the rate of exchange at any time after the acquisition of such asset there has been an increase or reduction in the liability of the company as expressed in Indian currency for making payment towards the whole or a part of the cost of the asset or for repayment of the whole or a part of moneys borrowed by the company from any person directly or indirectly in any foreign currency specifically for the purpose of acquiring the asset being in either case the liability existing immediately before the date on which the change in the rate of exchange takes effect the amount by which the liability is so increased during the year shall be added to or as the case may be deducted from the cost and the amount arrived at after such addition or deduction shall be taken to be the cost of the fixed asset Under the definitions contained in Section read with Section and of the Income tax Act the depreciation is to be allowed on the actual cost of the asset less all depreciation actually allowed in respect thereof in earlier years If the actual cost has already been determined at the original price and development rebate has been granted on that footing to the assessee and an increase in liability arises later it is possible for the <ORG> to contend that since the actual cost has already been determined and development rebate fixed on that footing there is no possibility or necessity for re considering the issue though it may perhaps contend to the contrary if the fluctuation in exchange rate had resulted in a decrease in liability He also refers to the principle that a special provision here the one regarding development rebate contained in Section A should override a general provision regarding allowance of depreciation and development rebate on the actual cost of the assets in question The proposed Section A in substance secures that where an assessee had acquired any capital asset from a country outside India for the purposes of his business or profession on deferred payment terms or against a foreign loan before the date of devaluation of the rupee the additional rupee liability incurred by him in meeting the instalments of the cost of the asset or of the foreign loan as the case may be falling due for payment after the date of devaluation will be allowed to be added to the original actual cost of the asset for the purpose of calculating he allowance on account of depreciation in computing the profits for the assessment year and subsequent assessment years Similarly increase in the original actual cost will be allowed to be made in respect of capital assets acquired by the assessee to be used in scientific research related to the class of business carried on by him or patent rights or copyrights acquired from abroad or any capital asset acquired by a company for the purpose of promoting family planning amongst its employees Further in computing the capital gains arising to the assessee on the sale or transfer of a capital asset acquired by him from abroad on deferred payment terms or against a foreign loan the additional rupee liability incurred by him in repaying the instalments of the cost or the foreign loan as the case may be after the date of devaluation of the rupee will be added to the original actual cost of the asset The proposed section also secures that where there is a decrease in the rupee liability of the assessee in respect of assets acquired by him from abroad due to a change in the exchange value of the rupee the original actual cost of the asset will be correspondingly reduced The additional rupee liability incurred on imported capital assets or as the case may be any decrease in such liability in the circumstances stated in the earlier paragraph will not however be taken into account in computing the actual cost of the asset for the purpose of deduction on account of development rebate Reference must also be made to a circular issued by <ORG> on which reliance was placed by both counsel The par value of the rupee was lowered by per cent with effect from June Such assessees would have suffered a hardship if the additional rupee liability referred to above were not to be taken into account for the purpose of granting depreciation allowance in respect of the imported assets or for other purposes amortisation against the profits of the capital cost of imported assets consisting of patent rights and copyrights or of imported assets used by the assessee for scientific research related to his business or for computing the amount of capital gain or loss arising from the subsequent sale or transfer of the imported capital assets In order to avoid such hardship and also to provide for the converse situation where due to any devaluation of the currency of a foreign country or revaluation of the Indian currency in the future there is a reduction in the liability of an assessee for payment of instalments of the cost of assets imported by him from abroad or repayment of foreign loans against which assets are required the Finance No The substance of these provisions which take effect from April i for and from the assessment year is explained in the following paragraphs The provisions of the new Section A apply in a case where an assessee has acquired any capital asset from abroad for the purpose of his business or profession on credit or on deferred payment terms or against a loan in foreign currency and the whole or a part of the cost of such asset or of the loan in foreign currency is outstanding as on the date on which there is a change in the rate of exchange of currency In such a case where in consequence of the change in the rate of exchange of currency there is an increase or reduction in the assessee liability as expressed in Indian currency for payment of the whole or a part of the cost of the assets or of the loan in foreign currency the original actual cost to the assessee of the machinery or plant or other capital asset is required to be increased or as the case may be reduced correspondingly for the following purposes xxxx xxxx xxxxx The above mentioned adjustment to the original actual cost of the assessee to the imported capital asset is to be made in respect of the previous year in which there is an increase or reduction in the assessee liability in terms of Indian currency for payment of the whole or part of the cost of this asset or for repayment of the foreign loan against which the asset has been acquired There is no difficulty about this and there is no provision in the Act which stands in the way of the application of this principle where the previous year in which the increase in liability arises is the same as that in which the asset is acquired installed or put to use In fact this is what has happened in this case That is the actual cost on which the assessee is entitled to development rebate and depreciation The non obstante clause at the commencement of Section A suggests that the sub section operates only where there is some provision in the There being none Section A has no application to this type of a case On normal accountancy principles the assessee can perhaps claim that he has a right to rewrite the books of the earlier year open or closed to show the increased cost as the actual cost The provision can have no relevance in respect of an allowance like development rebate which has already been granted in an earlier year once and for all vii If the department contention were the correct one the non obstante clause would have been inserted in Sub section and not in Sub section and Sub section would have read such increase or decrease in liability as is referred to in Sub section shall not be taken into account and not the provisions of Sub section will not be taken into account as at present The assessee has acquired for the purposes of its business a capital asset from a country outside India by making payment in foreign currency He submits that where as in the present case the increase in liability occurs in the same year it has automatically to be given effect to in the accounts of the previous year irrespective of the language of Sub section We find no merit in the contention of Sri <NAME> that Sub section will come into operation only in respect of a year subsequent to the year in which the asset is acquired There is nothing in the present language of the sub section which makes it inapplicable to a case where the change in the magnitude of the liability consequent on a change in the rate of exchange occurs during the very previous year in which the asset has been acquired It could have been contended that the actual cost can only be the original purchase price in the year of acquisition of the asset and that even if there is any subsequent increase in the liability it cannot be added to the actual cost at any stage and that for the purposes of all the statutory allowances the amount of actual cost once determined would be final and conclusive Also Section A provides for a case in which as in the present case the assessee has completely paid for the plant or machinery in foreign currency prior to the date of devaluation but the variation of exchange rate affects the liability of the assessee as expressed in Indian currency for repayment of the whole or part of the monies borrowed by him from any person directly or indirectly in any foreign currency specifically for the purposes of acquiring the asset This is also a situation which is specifically provided for in the section As we said earlier there is no need to speculate on all the problems that might have arisen if Section A had not been there because the statute had resolved these problems The anxiety of the <ORG> which has been given effect to by the legislature was only that in the absence of a proper statutory provision the assessee should not suffer by even normal allowances like depreciation and amortisation being denied to him for one reason or another There is no basis for an assumption that increased development rebate was also intended to be provided and that an interpretation which would result in its non availability would be unfair as it would result in the curtailment of an intended benefit But even the interpretation suggested on behalf of the assessee would create an anomaly for according to the learned Counsel if the fluctuation in the rate of exchange occurs in the same previous year as that of the acquisition of the asset development rebate would be admissible on the increased cost but where the fluctuation occurs in a subsequent year it will not be so available As we have discussed above the provisions of Sub section apply to the present case and the increased liability should be taken as actual cost within the meaning of Section A Read thus there is no difficulty in the application of the language of the section to the present case It may be that the legislature intended to give a different treatment to development rebate from depreciation and other allowances because the allowance of development rebate can result in an assessee claiming allowances exceeding the original cost It may be that the legislature thought that though development rebate was intended to promote development of industries this could not be allowed at the cost of the foreign exchange resources of the country which are also depleted when there is an increase in liability due to devaluation of the currency We therefore allow the appeal and uphold the action of the assessing officer granting development rebate to the assessee only in respect of a sum of Rs Having regard however to the fact that the assessees had succeeded before all the <ORG> we make no order regarding costs
