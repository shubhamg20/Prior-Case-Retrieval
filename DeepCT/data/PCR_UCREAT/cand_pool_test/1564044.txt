A No opportunity was available to the appellant to file objection On December a notification was issued under Sections and of the Acquisition Act in respect of an area of acres This was followed by other notifications and on February by another notification under was issued by modifying the earlier notification dated July By this notification the said acres was reduced to acres On July the appellant made an application to the Land Acquisition Officer for supplying a copy of the scheme in order to file objection under A of the Acquisition Act Thereafter the appellants filed a writ petition in <ORG> challenging the validity of the aforesaid notification This Court in <ORG> <ORG> upheld the validity of the The counsel for the appellants confined his arguments mainly to one question Further the appellant did not get a reasonable opportunity of objecting under A since the purpose shown was extremely vague and there was no definite scheme before <ORG> at the material time to show bow the land would be developed and to what use it will be put Every ob jection under Sub Section shall be made to the Collector in writing and the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard The Collector after hearing all such objections may make a report to the appropriate Government ii A embodies a very just and wholesome principle that a person who is deprived of his property is given a reasonable opportunity to be heard The right to file objection under A is a substantial right when a person property is being threatened with acquisition and that right cannot be taken away as if by sidewind In the present case the notification under all that was stated was that the land was required for planned development of the area There was no indication whatsoever whether the development was to be of residential and building sites or commercial and industrial class nor was it possible for any one to find out that kind of planned development was under contemplation But after the insertion of A the position has completely changed and it cannot be said that the owner wishes are not relevant and he does not need an opportunity to file his objections A person whose land is likely to be acquired must have an opportunity to submit his objections and that he can do only if the notification tinder while mentioning the public purpose gives some definite indica tion or particulars of the said purpose which would enable the persons concerned to object effectively if so desired In the absence of such specific or particular purpose the objector cannot file any proper or cogent objections under A which he has a right to do under that provision In the present case owing to the vaguness and indefiniteness of the public purpose stated in the notifications under and in the absence of any proof that the appellants were either aware of or were shown this scheme or Master Plan in respect of the planned development of the area in question the appellants were wholly unable to object effectively and exercise their right under A of the Acquisition Act The Regulation of Building Operations Act received the assent of the President on October On July a notification was issued under of the Land Acquisition Act by <ORG> declaring its intention to acquire land measuring about acres in fifty villages of Ghaziabad for planned development of the area This was followed by successive piecemeal notifications on various dates in and On July the appellants made an application to the Special Land Acquisition Officer Ghaziabad for supplying a copy of the scheme of the planned development for which notification under had been issued to enable them to make representations at the hearing of the objections filed under A of the Acquisition Act It was mentioned inter alia in that application that the Government had not published the scheme of the planned development and without a copy of the scheme for which the notification had been published no forceful arguments could be submitted On Sept ember a writ petition was filed by the appellants in <ORG> challenging the validity of the aforesaid notifications Several other writ petitions were also filed by other petitioners The provisions of the Act were also challenged before <ORG> by necessary amendment in the writ petitions filed by the appellants Reference has been made to the notification dated July issued under as also to subsequent notification dated February amending the earlier notification to notify for general information that the land mentioned in the schedule is likely to he needed for a public purpose In the writ petition a specific plea was taken in paras and that no proper reasonable or effective opportunity was available to the appellants to file any objections under A of the Acquisition Act inasmuch as the notification gave no indication that different pieces of land would be acquired for different authorities in different circumstances and for different purposes Accord ing to para the appellants did not get any effective or reasonable opportunity of objecting under A of the Acquisition Act inasmuch as the purpose shown was extremely vague and there was no definite scheme before <ORG> at the material time to show how the land would be developed and to what use it would be put In the return which was filed Para contained the reply to Para and this is what was stated That the allegations made in paragraph of the petition are denied We may also refer to paragraph of the petition in which the order of the Special Land Acquisition Officer was reproduced in respect of the applications filed by the appellants for supplying the copy of the scheme of the planned development It is urged that the scheme of the Acquisition Act shows that public purpose for which the land is needed or is likely to be needed should be stated with sufficient particularity and in such a manner that a land owner should be able to file an objection under A By the Land Acquisition Amendment Act was amended and for clause in the Central Act the following clause was substituted the expression public purpose includes provision for or in connection with i ii the laying out of village sites townships or the extension planned development or improvement of existing village sites or townships iii Section provides for a notification to be issued and public notice of the same to be Riven whenever it appears to the appropriate Government that land in any locality is needed or is likely to be needed for any public purpose Sub is in these terms Thereupon it shall be lawful for any officer either generally or specially authorised by such Government in this behalf and for his servants and workmen to enter upon and survey and take levels of any land in such locality to dig or bore into the sub soil to do all other acts necessary to ascertain whether the land is adopted for such purpose to set out the boundaries of the land proposed to be taken and the intended line of the work if any proposed to be made thereon to mark such levels boundaries and line by placing marks and cutting trenches and where otherwise the survey cannot be completed and the levels taken and the boundaries and line marked to cut down and clear away any part of any standing crop fence or jungle Provided that Sub sections and of A being material for purposes of the present appeal may be set out in extenso Any person interested in any land which has been notified under section sub as being needed or likely to be needed for a public purpose or for a <ORG> may within thirty days after the issue of the notification object to the acquisition of the land or of any land in the locality as the case may be Every objection under subsection shall be made to the Collector in writing and the Collector shall give the objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by pleader and shall after hearing all such objections and after making such further enquiry if any as he thinks necessary either make a report in respect of the land which has been notified under section sub section or make different reports in respect of different parcels of such land to the appropriate <ORG> containing his recommendations on the objections together with the record of the proceedings held by him for the decision of that <ORG> Section says inter alia that when the appropriate Government is satisfied after considering the report made under A that any particular land is needed for a public purpose or for company a declaration shall be made to that effect by the authority mentioned therein According to sub such a declaration shall be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose or for a company as the case may be If the public purpose stated in is planned development of the area without anything more it is extremely difficult to comprehend how all the matters set out in sub can be carried out by the officer specially authorised in this behalf and by his servants and workmen We may refer to the observation of this Court in <NAME> The State of Others that the right to file objections under A is a substantial right when a person property is being threatened with acquisition and that right cannot be taken away as if by a side wind After hearing all objections and making further inquiry he is to make a report to the appropriate <ORG> containing his recommendation on the objections The legislature has therefore made complete provisions for the persons interested to file objections against the proposed acquisition and for the disposal of their objections As already noticed in the notifications under all that was stated was that the land was required for planned development of the area There was no indication whatsoever whether the If the Master Plan which came to be sanctioned on September had been available for inspection by the persons interested in filing objections or even if the knowledge of its existence on the part of the appellants had been satisfactorily proved the position may have been different On behalf of the <ORG> it has been pointed out that the appellants had themselves filed a copy of the Master Plan which was sanctioned on September and that it was a matter of common knowledge that the Master Plan was under preparation In view of the peculiar circumstances of these cases we gave an opportunity to the <ORG> to apply for amendment of its return since nothing had been said about these matters therein and to produce additional evidence in support of its allegations Once it was stated that the land will be utilised for the aforesaid purpose the persons interested could certainly object effectively A challenge was made against the validity of that notification on the ground that it was not stated that the land was required for a public purpose This Court said that the purpose of the notification under was to carry out a preliminary investigation with a view to find out after the necessary survey and taking of levels and if necessary digging or boring into sub soil whether the land was adapted for the purposes for which it was sought to be acquired It was only under that a firm declaration had to be made by the <ORG> that land with proper description and area was needed for a public purpose or a company It relates to the notification under in the light of A with a view to giving full effect to that section and not simply wiping it out Up to that time the view was that the wishes of the owners of the land were wholly irrelevant but after the insertion of A the position has completely change and it cannot be said that the owner wishes are not relevant and that he does not need an opportunity to file his objections If it has any purpose and if it has to be given its full effect the person interested in the land proposed to be acquired must have an opportunity to submit his objections and that he can do only if the notification under while mentioning the public pur pose gives some definite indication or particulars of the said purpose which would enable the persons concerned to object effectively if so desired In the absence of such specific or particular purpose being stated the objector cannot file any proper or cogent objections under A which he has a right to do under that provision We would accordingly hold that owing to the vagueness and indefiniteness of the public purpose stated in the notifications under and in the absence of any proof that the appellants were either aware of or were shown the scheme or <ORG> in respect of the planned development of the area in question the appellants were wholly unable to object effectively and exercise their right under A of the Acquisition Act In matters of this nature we would have taken due notice of laches on the part of the appellants while granting the above relief but we are satisfied that so far as the present appellants are concerned they have not been guilty of laches delay or acquiescence at any stage The appellants shall be entitled to costs in this Court
