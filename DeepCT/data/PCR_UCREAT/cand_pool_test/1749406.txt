may grant under rule a no objection certificate to the appellants for the location of a cinema theatre under his jurisdiction or in case of his not granting the certificate he must refer under of the Rules the matter to <ORG> with his reasons therefor On the directions of <ORG> which did not agree with the report submitted by him the District Magistrate granted the certificate to the respondents The appellant being a rival in the cinema trade though he did not prefer any objections at the time when they were called for filed a writ petition in <ORG> alleging that i the impugned certificate issued by the District Magistrate was not in the exercise of his own discretion and with due regard to the principles in the Bombay Cinematographic Act and the Rules and ii Since as <ORG> the power has not be objectively exercised in a quasi judicial manner the grant of the certificate suffered from lack of jurisdiction On appeal by special leave to this <ORG> the appellant contended that i apart from a right in common with the general public to object to the grant before the District Magistrate the appellant being a rival in the same trade had a particular commercial interest to see that the permission was not granted to another in contravention of law to start the same business entitling him to a writ of certiorari ex debito justitiae and ii The concept of aggrieved person being wide any one who is personally interested and genuinely grieved by an act of usurpation of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction on the part of an administrative tribunal or body would fall within the category of an aggrieved person even if such usurpation or lack of jurisdiction had not resulted in infringement of a legal right or legal interest vested in him nor would such a person be denied locus standi for me purpose of certiorari merely because he had not lodged any objection or joined the proceedings before the tribunal In a sense the scope and nature of the power conferred by the Article is wider than that exercised by the writ courts in England The adoption of the nomenclature of English writs with the prefix nature of superadded indicates that the general principles grown over the years in the English courts can shorn of unnecessary technical procedural restrictions and adapted to the special conditions of this vast country in so far as they do met conflict with any provision of the Constitution or the law declared by this court be usefully considered in directing the exercise of this discretionary jurisdiction in accordance with well recognised rules of practice an applicant should ordinarily be one who has a personal or individual right in the subject matter of the application though in the case of some of the writs like habeas corpus or quo warranto this rule is relaxed or modified That apart in exceptional cases even a stranger or a person who was not a party to the proceedings before the authority but has a substantial and genuine interest in the subject matter of the proceedings will be covered by this rule These are Whether the applicant is a person whose legal right has been infringed Has he suffered a legal wrong or injury in the sense that his interest recognised by law has been prejudicially and directly affected by the act or omission of the authority complained of Is he a person who has suffered a legal grievance a person against whom a decision has been pronounced which has wrongfully deprived him of something or wrongfully refused him something or wrongfully affected his title to something Has he a special and substantial grievance of his own beyond some grievance or inconvenience suffered by him in common with the rest of the public Was he entitled to object and be heard by the authority before it took the impugned action If so was he prejudicially affected in the exercise of that right by the act of usurpation of jurisdiction on the part of the authority Is the statute in the context of which the scope of the words person aggrieved is being considered a special welfare measure designed to lay down ethical or professional standards of conduct for the community or is it a statute dealing with private rights of particular individuals A <NAME> Taunton St The Act and the Rules do not confer any substantive justiciable right on a rival in cinema trade apart from the option in common with the rest of the public to lodge an objection in response to the notice published under Rule Section A of the Act confers a right of appeal to <ORG> only on any person aggrieved by an order of a licensing authority refusing to grant a licence or revoking or suspending any licence under Section of the Act provides that <ORG> may either of its A own motion or upon an application made by an aggrieved person call for and examine the record of any order made by a licensing authority under this Act and passes such order thereon as it thinks just and proper juridically harm of this typed is called damnum sine injuria the term injuria being here used in its true sense of an act contrary to law The reason why the law suffers a person knowingly to inflict harm of this description on mother without holding him accountable for it is that such harm done to an individual is a gain to society at large He has not sustained injury to any legally protected interest Assuming that the appellant is a stranger and not a busybody then also there are no exceptional circumstances in the present case which would justify the issue of a writ of certiorari at his instance It will eliminate healthy competition in business which is so essential to raise commercial morality it will tend to perpetuate the appellant monopoly of cinema business in the town and above all it will seriously injure the fundamental rights of respondents and which they have under Article of the Constitution to carry on trade or business subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law While a Procrustean approach should be avoided as a rule the court should not interfere at the instance of a stranger unless there are exceptional circumstance involving a grave miscarriage of justice having an adverse impact on public interests The Judgment of the Court was delivered by SARKARIA Whether the proprietor of a cinema theatre holding a licence for exhibiting cinematograph films is entitled to invoke the certiorari jurisdiction ex debito justitiae to get a No objection Certificate granted under Rule of the Bombay Cinema Rules for short the Rules by the District Magistrate in favour of a rival in the trade brought up and quashed on the ground that it suffers from a defect of jurisdiction is the principal question that falls to be determined in this appeal by special leave The circumstances giving rise to this appeal are as follows Respondents and are owners of a site bearing Survey No in the town of Mehmadabad They made an application under Rule of the Rules to the District Magistrate Kaira for the grant of a Certificate that there was no objection to the location of a cinema theatre at this site The District Magistrate then notified in the prescribed Form the substance of the application by publication in newspapers inviting objections to the grant of a No objection Certificate These three authorities opined that they had no objection to the grant of the Certificate applied for The District Magistrate visited the site on Thereafter he submitted a report to <ORG> Res On the appellants filed a writ petition in <ORG> under Articles of the Constitution praying for the issuance of a writ of certiorari mandamus or any other appropriate writ or order directing the Respondents to treat the No objection Certificate granted to Respondents and as illegal void and ineffectual They further asked for an injunction restraining Respondents and from utilising the certificate for the purpose of building a cinema theatre In the affidavit filed in reply by the District Magistrate on behalf of Respondents and a preliminary objection was taken that the appellants had no locus standi to file the writ petition because their It was admitted that on receipt of the order of <ORG> he granted the No Objection Certificate to Respondents and in compliance with the Government directive The burden of his arguments is that apart from a right in common with the general public to object to the grant before the District Magistrate the appellant was a rival in the same trade and as such had a particular interest to see that permission was not granted to another in contravention of law to start the same business consequently the illegal grant of the No objection Certificate had prejudicially affected the commercial interest of the appellant who stood in the ll Article of the Constitution empowers <ORG> to issue to any person or authority including the <ORG> within its territorial jurisdiction directions orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari for the enforcement of fundamental rights and for any other purpose In a sense the scope and nature of the power conferred by the Article is wider than that exercised by the writ courts in England This takes us to the further question Who is an aggrieved per son and what are the qualifications requisite for such a status The expression aggrieved person denotes an elastic and to an extent an elusive concept We will first take up that line of cases in which an aggrieved person has been held to be one who has a more particular or peculiar interest of his own beyond that of the general public in seeing that the law is properly administered He had a right to object to the grant of the Certificate It was held that the applicants had a sufficient interest in the matter to enable them to invoke certiorari jurisdiction It is significant that in coming to the conclusion that the applicant was a person aggrieved Earl of Reading laid stress on the fact that he had appeared and objected before the Justices and joined issue with them though unsuccessfully in the sense that they said they had jurisdiction when he said they had not The court held that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal Thus it could be said that they had suffered a legal wrong The writs of prohibition and certiorari lie on behalf of any person who is a person aggrieved and that includes any person whose interests may be pre judicially affected by what is taking place Emphasising the very special circumstances of the case the court read into the statute a duty to act fairly in accordance with the principles of natural justice Thus a corresponding right to be treated fairly was also imported by implication in favour of the applicants Viewed from this standpoint the applicants had an interest recognised in law which was adversely affected by the impugned action They had suffered a wrong as a result of the unfair treatment on the part of the corporation The meaning of the words a person aggrieved is sometimes given a restricted meaning in certain statutes which provide remedies for the protection of private legal rights It was held that the expression person aggrieved in a statute meant a person who had suffered a legal grievance anyone given the right under of the Act of to have his representation considered by the Minister was a person aggrieved thus section applied if those rights were infringed but the applicants had no right under the statute and Ex Parte Stott is another illustration of a person who had no legal grievance nor had he sufficient interest in the matter The licence was subject to the condition that the licensee should not exhibit any film if he had notice that the licensing authority objected to it It was held that whether the condition was unreasonable or not the applicants were not persons who were aggrieved by the notice and had no locus standi to maintain the application Similarly King Middlesex Justices it was held that the words person who shall think himself aggrieved appearing in the statute governing the grant of licences to innkeepers mean a person immediately aggrieved as by refusal of a licence to himself and not one who is consequently aggrieved and that though the Justices had granted a licence to a party to open a public house not before licensed within a very short distance of a licensed public house the occupier of the latter house could not appeal against such grant This Court has laid down in a number of decisions that in order to have the locus standi to invoke the extraordinary jurisdiction under Article an applicant should ordinarily be one who has a personal or individual right in the subject matter of the application though the case of some of the writs like habeas corpus or quo warranto this rule is relaxed or modified It is flexible enough to take in those cases where the applicant has been prejudicially affected by an act or omission of an authority even though he has no proprietary or even a fiduciary interest in the subject matter That apart in exceptional cases even a stranger or a person who was not a party to the proceedings before the authority but has a substantial and genuine interest in the subject matter of the proceedings will be covered by this rule The principles enunciated in the English cases noticed above are not inconsistent with it No matter how seriously infringement of the Constitution may be called into question said Justice <NAME> in <NAME> Miller this is not the tribunal for its challenge except by those who have some specialized interest of their own to vindicate apart from a political concern which belongs to all These are Whether the applicant is a person whose legal right has been infringed Has he suffered a legal wrong or injury in the sense that his interest recognised by law a social welfare measure designed to lay down ethical or professional standards of conduct for the community or is it a statute dealing with private rights of particular individuals Now let us apply these tests to the case in hand Did the appellant have a Legal right under the statutory provisions or under the general law which has been subjected to or threatened with injury The Act and the Rules do not confer any substantive justiciable right on a rival in cinema trade apart from the option in common with the rest of the public to lodge an objection in response to the notice published under Rule Section A of the Act confers a right of appeal to the State <ORG> only on any person aggrieved by an order of a licensing authority refusing to grant a license or revoking or suspending any licence under section Obviously the appellant was not a person aggrieved within the contemplation of Section A Section of the Act provides that the State <ORG> may either of its own motion or upon an application made by an aggrieved person call for and examine the record of any order made by a licensing authority under this Act and pass such order thereon as it thinks just and proper The appellant does not fall within the category of such persons having a special interest in the locality It is not his case that his cinema house is situated anywhere near the site in question or that he has any peculiar interest in his personal fiduciary or representative capacity in any school temple etc he owns a cinema theatre in Mehmadabad which has about a small population of persons as stated above and there is no scope for more than one cinema theatre in the town He has there fore a commercial interest in seeing to it that other persons are not granted a no objection certificate in violation of law Juridically harm of this description is called demnum sine injuria the term injuria being here used in its true sense of an act contrary to law The reason why the law suffers a person knowingly to inflict harm of this description on another without holding him accountable for it is that such harm done to an individual is a gain to society at large He has not sustained injury to any legally protected interest While a Procrustean approach should be avoided as a rule the <ORG> should not interfere at the instance of a stranger unless there are exceptional circumstances involving a grave miscarriage of justice having an adverse impact on public interests Assuming that the appellant is a stranger and not a busybody then also there are no exceptional circumstances in the present case which would justify the issue of a writ of certiorari at his instance It will eliminate healthy competition in this business which is so essential to raise commercial morality it will tend to perpetuate the appellant monopoly of cinema business in the town and above all it will in effect seriously injure the fundamental rights of respondents and which they have under article of the Constitution to carry on trade or business subject to reasonable restrictions imposed by law Accordingly we answer the question posed at the commencement of this judgment in the negative and on that ground without entering upon the merits of the case dismiss this appeal with costs
