The facts which are material for the purpose of deciding this appeal may be briefly stated as follows The respondent Messrs The <ORG> however at the instance of the company referred the following question to <ORG> for its opinion Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of this case the <ORG> was right in holding that the unabsorbed depreciation at the end of the year which was not given effect to in the subsequent years could not be treated as part of the allowable depreciation for the relevant assessment years which are assessment years and Before stating the precise point which arises for determination in this appeal it will be convenient to set out Section vi of the Income tax Act both as it originally stood and as it now stands after being amended in in parallel columns SECTION vi A BEFORE AMENDMENT AFTER AMENDMENT IN Such profits or gains shall be computed after making the following allowances namely in respect of depreciation of such buildings machinery plant or furniture being the property of the assessee a sum equivalent to such percentage on the original cost thereof to the assessee as may in any case or class of cases be prescribed Provided that a the prescribed particulars have been duly furnished where full effect cannot be given to any such allowance in any year owing to there being no profits or gains chargeable for the year or owing to the profits or gains chargeable being less than the allowance the allowance or part of the allowance to which effect has not been given as the case may be shall be added to the amount of the allowance for depreciation for the following year and deemed to be the allowance for that year and so on for succeeding years and the aggregate of all such allowances made under this Act or any Act repealed hereby or under the Indian Income tax Act shall in no case exceed the original cost to the assessee of the buildings machinnery plant or furniture as the case may be The decision of this appeal largely turns upon the effect of the following words Where full effect cannot be given to any such allowance in any year not being a year which ended prior to the st day of April owing to there being no profits or gins chargeable for that year the allowance or part of the allowance to which effect has not been given Firstly he pointed out that in the course of the assessment for the year the question whether the unabsorbed depreciation remaining at the end of the year could or could not be carried forward and allowed in subsequent years had come up for consideration before the Income tax Officer but he had decided that it could not be so carried forward In this appeal we are not concerned with the first ground because as has been pointed out by the learned Chief Justice in the order granting leave to appeal the Income tax authorities appear to have accepted the view of the <ORG> on the first point since they did not ask the <ORG> to state a case giving rise to the contention which had found favour with the Appellate Assistant Commissioner but had been rejected by the <ORG> In our opinion this question has been rightly answered by <ORG> in favour of the assessee It will be observed that we are concerned with two datum lines the st April when the Act came into force and the st of April which is the date mentioned in the amended proviso They must be held to apply to the assessment year because in income tax matters the law to be applied is the law in force in the assessment year unless otherwise stated or implied The Income tax Officer refused to allow that amount but for the reasons already stated we have to disregard that fact and therefore for the purpose of the present reference must treat the unabsorbed depreciation which was carried forward from the assessment year into the accounts of the assessment year as the unabsorbed depreciation in the assessment year and treat it as unabsorbed for the reason that the profits in that year were not sufficient to absorb this sum that being the position which would have resulted had the Income tax Officer not disallowed the sum In other words in answering the reference we have to accept the position which the accounts would have revealed had the Income tax Officer not wrongly refused to allow the unabsorbed depreciation of to be carried forward to It was argued on behalf of the appellant that in the present case full effect could not be given to the unabsorbed depreciation not for the reasons stated in the section but on account of the failure of the assessee to take the matter in appeal against the assessment for The words used in the section are where full effect cannot be given and not where full effect has not been given In our opinion the view taken by <ORG> on the limited question referred to it is correct and a we accordingly dismiss this appeal with <ORG>
