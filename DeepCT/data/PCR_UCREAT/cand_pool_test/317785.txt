This appeal is directed against the judgment of the learned trial judge discharging the rule nisi obtained by the appellant on his petition under Article of the Constitution He was served with a notice under Section of the Income tax Act on May whereby he was called upon by the Income tax Officer to appear and produce the relevant evidence in support of the returns filed by him No order of assessment was however passed and no notice of demand was sent to the appellant On June the appellant made an application for income tax clearance certificate On June a certificate was given to the appellant by one <NAME> Income tax Officer Project Circle North Bengal Siliguri Further it was stated by him in the said letter that he was not given any opportunity of being heard as to the alleged invalidity of the returns and requested the Income tax Officer to issue to him a fresh income tax clearance certificate without any such remark The appellant did not receive any reply to his said letter dated August but on March he was served with three notices under Section of the Income tax Act all dated March and issued by the said <NAME> wherein it was alleged that the said Income tax Officer had reasons to believe that the income of the appellant chargeable to tax for the nssessment years and had escaped assessment within the meaning of Section of the Act and the appellant was called upon to file returns for the said assessment years within days of the date of the receipt of the said notices Immediately on receipt of the aforesaid notices on March the appellant wrote to the Income tax Officer contending inter alia that since the returns for the said assessment years were already submitted by him and the assessment proceedings were pending the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to issue notices under Section of the Act It was the case of the appellant that there was absolutely no material before the Income fax Officer on which he could form a reasonable belief that the appellant income had escaped assessment for the said assessment years or that the alleged escapement of income was on account of any omission or failure on the part of the appellant to file his returns for the assessment years in question The respondents filed an affidavit in opposition which was sworn by the Income tax Officer the respondent No Power of High Courts to issue certain writs Notwithstanding anything in Article but subject to the provisions of Article A and Article A every High Court shall have power throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction to issue to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any <ORG> within those territories directions orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari or any of them a for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by the provisions of Part III or for the redress of any injury of a substantial nature by reason of the contravention of any other provision of this Constitution or any provision of any enactment or Ordinance or any order rule regulation bye law or other instrument made thereunder or for the redress of any injury by reason of any illegality in any proceedings by or before any authority under any provision referred to in Sub clause where such illegality has resulted in substantial failure of justice Section provides as follows In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of Sub section every pending petition before a High Court which would not have been admitted by the High Court under the provisions of Article as substituted by Section if such petition had been made after the appointed day shall abate and any interim order whether by way of injunction or stay or in any other manner made on or in any proceedings relating to such petition shall stand vacated Provided that nothing contained in this Sub section shall affect the right of the petitioner to seek relief under any other law for the time being in force in respect of the matters to which such petition relates and in computing the period of limitation if any for seeking such relief the period during which the proceedings relating to such petition were pending in <ORG> shall be excluded The said Act does not contain any provision providing for any remedy for the redress of which the appellant sought by the petition under Article It was however argued on behalf of the respondents that although the said Act did not contain any such provision still if the assessment had been reopened and an order making the assessment passed the appellant could have preferred an appeal against the order of assessment and in such appeal he could also challenge the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to issue the impugned notices under Section In other words he challenged the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to issue the impugned notices under Section The appellant has prayed for restraining the respondents from reopening the assess ments on the ground that the Income tax Officer has no jurisdiction to reopen the assessments There is however no provision in the Income tax Act providing for any remedy for the redress of the injury that might be caused to the appellant if the assessments are allowed to be reopened Even under the unamended Article the provision for appeal against an order of assessment was not considered as an alternative remedy which would bar a writ petition challenging the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to issue a notice under Section It was however contended on behalf of the respondents that in spite of the absence of any provision in the Income tax Act the appellant could still get redress against the injury complained of by instituting a suit in a civil court There can be no doubt that a suit may be instituted by the appellant challenging the jurisdiction of the Income tax Officer to issue the impugned notices under Section but in our view when the challenge is against the action of the Income tax Officer purporting to act under the provisions of the Income tax Act Clause of Article will be applicable only if the said Act provides for remedy against the illegal act of the Income tax Officer The remedy for the redress sought for by the appellant not having been provided for by or under the Income tax Act it would be unreasonable to drive the appellant to a separate suit which is not in the facts and circumstances of the case contemplated by Clause There is hardly any matter or any dispute which cannot be decided or any relief which cannot be granted in a suit of a civil nature and if in all cases the suit is considered to be a remedy for redress against the injury as mentioned in Clauses and of Article we are afraid no petition under Article would be maintainable for the redress of any injury under Clauses and In our opinion by amending Article the legislature never intended to take away in an indirect way the jurisdiction of <ORG> to issue writs We may now consider the case on merits It was contended by Mr <NAME> learned advocate appearing on behalf of the appellant that the returns were not invalid as alleged by the respondents and as found by the learned judge and that when the appellant had filed returns the Income tax Officer had no jurisdiction to ignore the same and to proceed to issue notices under Section of the Act without completing the assessments On the other hand it was urged by Mr <NAME> that as the returns did not include the prescribed particulars the same were invalid and could not be regarded as returns of income and so the Income tax Officer had jurisdiction to issue notices under Section There can be no doubt that when there is no question as to the validity of a return filed by an assessee the Income tax Officer has to complete the assessment in accordance with Section of the Act and before such completion he would not have any jurisdiction to ignore the return and to issue a notice under Section Under section a of the Act one of the grounds which enables the Income tax Officer to assess or reassess the income of an assessee by issuing a notice under Section is that the Income tax Officer has reason to believe that by reason of the omission or failure on the part of assessee to make a return under Section of the Act for any assessment year income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment for that year Section provides inter alia that the assessee shall furnish a return of his income during the previous year in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and setting forth such other particulars as may be prescribed Section of the Act as it stood before its amendment in runs as follows Where a return has been made under Section and the Income tax Officer is satisfied without requiring the presence of the assessee or the production by him of any evidence that the return is correct and complete he shall assess the total income or loss of the assessee and shall determine the sum payable by him or refundable to him on the basis of such return Where a return has been made under Section but the Income tax Officer is not satisfied without requiring the presence of the assessee or the production of evidence that the return is correct and complete he shall serve on the assessee a notice requiring him on a date to be therein specified either to attend at the Income tax Officer office or to produce or to cause to be there produced any evidence on which the assessee may rely in support of the return It obviously refers to Section of the Act for a return is not correct and complete if it does not conform to the provisions of that section Section lays down the procedure to be followed by the Income tax Officer when a return filed by an assessee is not correct and complete or when it is so as the case may be There is a distinction between the case of non filing of a return and the case of filing an incorrect and incomplete return But the Act does not contain any provision for the rejection of an invalid return on the contrary under Section a duty is cast on the Income tax Officer to assess the total income or loss of the assessee after serving on him a notice under Section and after hearing such evidence as the assessee may produce or the Income tax Officer may gather We should not however be understood to lay down this proposition that whenever a return is filed the Income tax Officer must proceed in accordance with Section no matter whether or not the return conforms to the provision of Section If that was the intention of the legislature there would not have been any necessity for it to provide for the procedure which the Income tax Officer is to follow when a return is not correct and complete Subsequently another notice was issued under Section of the said Act and the Income tax Officer made the assessment assessing the assessee to tax It was held by <ORG> that although the first notice under Section was invalid the return submitted by the assessee pursuant to that notice was a return within the meaning of Section of the said Act and the Income tax Officer could not ignore or disregard that return and issue another notice under Section on the assumption that there had been an omission or failure on the part of the assessee to make a return of his income under Section of the said Act Further it was observed that it could not be regarded as a case where no return had been filed by the assessee or that his income had escaped assessment We are unable to agree with the view expressed by <ORG> in <NAME> case ITR It has been held in that case that when a return was not signed and verified there was no valid return at all and the Income tax Officer would be justified in making an assessment to the best judgment under Sec tion of the Indian Income tax Act It thus appears to be well settled that when a return has been filed by an assessee it cannot be ignored by the Income tax Officer and he will have no jurisdiction to issue a notice under Section without completing the assessment on the return filed by the assessee For the reasons aforesaid we set aside the judgment of the learned judge and make the rule absolute The appeal is allowed but in view of the facts and circumstances of the case there will be no order for costs
