In the above writ petitions and civil appeal members of <ORG> have sought for directions from this <ORG> to the respondents to encadre all the <ORG> posts Ex cadre posts and Temporary posts hitherto manned by the members of <ORG> for short <ORG> for a continuous period exceeding three years in the <ORG> cadre A perusal of the pleadings in the petitions appeal filed prior to the amendment shows that under Rule of the Recruitment Rules as it stood before the amendment the number of persons to be recruited to the <ORG> from the <ORG> Civil Service was restricted to per cent of the number of posts found at items and to the concerned schedule of the Cadre Strength Regulations The petitioners contend that the process of selection invariably takes considerably long time consequent to which timely selection has become impossible by excluding the anticipated vacancies it is contended there will be further delay in selecting the petitioners to the <ORG> which might deprive many of them their chance to be selected for the <ORG> It is stated that it has become practically impossible to make selections to anticipated vacancies for want of necessary information and some other practical reasons From the above contentions of the parties and taking into account the subsequent events that have taken place after the filing of the original petitions appeal the following questions arise for our consideration Are the amendments brought about to Regulation of the <ORG> Appointment by Promotion Regulations ultra vires and liable to be struck down Before we proceed to consider the arguments advanced in support of their respective contentions in the above cases it is necessary to note that similar grievances were made by the <ORG> Service Officers of <ORG>s of Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal before <ORG> Jabalpur and Calcutta benches The Chandigarh bench of <ORG> as per the order dated December from which the above noted Civil Appeal No of arising out of No of arose took the view that the temporary ex cadre posts which have continued for long number of years cannot be allowed to be continued as such hence it directed the <ORG> and the <ORG> <ORG> to take necessary steps to discharge their legal and constitutional duties by examining the question whether such temporary and ex cadre posts which are in existence for a number of years and are likely to continue indefinitely should be either abolished or should form part of the cadre of the <ORG> of Haryana The proviso to this Rule empowers the <ORG> <ORG> concerned to temporarily add to its cadre one or more post for a period not exceeding one year on its own and with approval of <ORG> for a further period not exceeding two years This argument proceeds on the basis that as per the Cadre Rules no temporary or ex cadre posts are permitted to be created by the <ORG> <ORG>s for a period exceeding years See Rule of the Cadre Rules They further contend that if they are so encadred they are entitled to be promoted to the extent of of the so enhanced posts <ORG> per contra contends that during the triennial review as it used to be they have taken into consideration the necessity to encadre such ex cadre and temporary posts in consultation with the <ORG> <ORG>s and after finding out the need to encadre such posts and wherever it was found necessary such encadrement was done They also contend that by virtue of the amendments of the posts earmarked for <ORG> deputation reserve and training reserve have already been included in the cadre strength of the respective <ORG>s and if there is any further need to encadre any more post the same will be done during the course of next periodic review of the cadre strength of the <ORG>s The basis of the petitioners right to be selected for <ORG> service is traceable in case of <ORG> Civil Service officers to Rule of the Recruitment Rules which says that <ORG> may recruit to the <ORG> persons by promotion from amongst the members of the <ORG> civil service This Rule itself puts a ceiling on the number of posts that could be filled in the <ORG> from such promotions which is limited to not more than of the posts enumerated therein The question then arises whether there is any such right in the petitioners to seek such creation of additional posts It is a well settled principle in service jurisprudence that even when there is a vacancy the <ORG> is not bound to fill up such vacancy nor is there any corresponding right vested in an eligible employee to demand that such post be filled up This is because the decision to fill up a vacancy or not vests with the employer who for good reasons be it administrative economical or policy decide not to fill up such post This principle applies with all the more force in regard to the creation of new vacancies like by encadrement of new posts more so when such encadrement or creation of new posts is statutorily controlled In para of the said judgment this <ORG> held thus As to the merits of the matter it is necessary to state that every civil servant has a right to have his case considered for promotion according to his turn and it is a guarantee flowing from Articles and of the Constitution In our opinion that decision does not help the contention of the petitioners to seek a mandamus to encadre the ex cadre temporary posts as contended in their petition The above judgment only lays down that a civil servant has a right under Articles and of the Constitution to be considered for promotion and such consideration cannot be postponed on unreasonable grounds <ORG> further said But where a vacancy arises on account of the incumbent going on deputation for a reasonably long period and there is no reasonable likelihood of the person promoted to fill such vacancy having to revert the vacancy would be subject to the quota rule Here the petitioners are not yet promoted much less there is any threat of reversion However reliance is placed on paras and of this judgment wherein this <ORG> while considering the inter se seniority dispute between the direct recruits and promotees held at para thus In such a situation the seniority of direct recruits and promotees appointed under those Rules must be determined according to the dates on which direct recruits were appointed to their respective posts and the dates from which the promotees have been officiating continuously either in temporary posts created in the service or in the substantive vacancies to which they were appointed in a temporary capacity The petitioners next contend that though there is a statutory obligation on the part of <ORG> to make a periodical review which it has failed to do so By this failure the promotees promotion got inordinately delayed and they have lost their seniority in the promoted cadre therefore they are entitled to their seniority being fixed with retrospective effect We have already referred to the earlier two cases It would subserve the object of the Act and the rules and afford an equal opportunity to the promotee officers to reach higher echelons of the service The dereliction of the statutory duty must satisfactorily be accounted for by the <ORG> Government concerned and this Court takes serious note of wanton infraction The petitioners further contend that similar relief was granted in the case of applicants who filed original applications before the Jabalpur and Calcutta Benches of <ORG> and there is no reason why the petitioners should be denied such benefits Therefore such right to be considered for promotion in our considered view would arise only from the date of encadrement which having been done with effect from only we do not think that as a matter of right the petitioners are entitled for retrospective seniority This however does not mean that there is no obligation on the part of <ORG> to consider the requirement of encadring the ex cadre temporary posts which are existing in those <ORG>s in regard to which the complaint is made We have not found any reason either in the pleadings or in the arguments addressed on behalf of the <ORG> why it has not taken any steps to direct the <ORG> Governments concerned to abolish these posts if not required to be encadred The petitioners in this regard contend that under the old provision <ORG> was required to calculate the anticipated substantive vacancies for preparation of select list which is now being changed to vacancies not exceeding the substantive vacancies as on the first day of January of the year in which the meeting is held They state that there is always considerable delay in completing the process of promotion by selection and this delay will be further extended by virtue of the amendments and consequently the promotion of the petitioners will get delayed and some of them may even loose the chance of getting selected to the <ORG> They say that the unamended provisions were in existence for decades and there was no need for effecting this amendment They say by the existing <ORG> it was extremely difficult to ascertain with certainty finality the number of anticipated vacancies since the <ORG> Governments had the power to give extension of service up to months beyond the date of retirement to a number of <ORG> officers We have carefully gone through the pleadings of the petitioners and the respondents in this regard and we do not find any arbitrariness in this amendment They state that under the amended <ORG> there is no unfettered or uncanalised power and discretion given regarding the authority to hold <ORG> meetings
