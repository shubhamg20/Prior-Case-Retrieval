HEADNOTE There is no hard and fast rule for determining whether a given transaction is a mortgage by conditional sale or sale outright with a condition for repurchase Each case must be decided on its own facts If the words are express and clear effect must be given to them and any extraneous enquiry into what was thought or in If however there is ambiguity in the language employed then it is permissible to look to the surrounding circumstances to determine what was intended In view of the provisions of the amended section of the Transfer of Property Act if the sale and agreement to repurchase are embodied in separate documents then the transaction cannot be a mortgage whether the documents are contemporaneously executed or not But the mere fact that there is only one document does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage and cannot be a sale He obtained a decree against the mortgagors alone and executed it in He himself purchased the property in dispute and took possession on th March Shortly after on th August he sold this land to the plaintiff for Rs The question whether a given transaction is a mortgage by conditional sale or a sale outright with a condition of repurchase is a vexed one which invariably gives rise to trouble and litigation There are numerous decisions on the point and much industry has been expended in some of <ORG> in collating and analysing them But there is nothing special about that in this class of cases and here as in every other case where a document has to be construed the intention must be gathered in the first place from the document itself effect must be given to them and any extraneous enquiry into what was thought or intended is ruled out If however there is ambiguity in the language employed then it is permissible to look to the surrounding circumstances to determine what was intended As Lord <NAME> said in A Aderson White The rule of law on this subject is one dictated by commonsense that prima facie an absolute conveyance containing nothing to show that the relation of debtor and creditor is to exist between the parties does not cease to be an absolute conveyance and become a mortgage merely because the vendor stipulates that he shall have a right to repurchase In every such case the question is what upon a fair construction is the meaning of the instruments The converse also holds good and if on the face of it an instrument clearly purports to be a mortgage it cannot be turned into a sale by reference to a host of I A Difficulty only arises in the border line cases where there is ambiguity If the sale and agreement to repurchase are embodied in separate documents then the transaction cannot be a mortgage whether the documents are contemporaneously executed or not But the converse does not hold good that is to say the mere fact that there is only one document does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage and cannot be a sale I and at present there is no other way in view rather it seems impossible and difficult to arrange for the money without selling the property let out in rehan simple mortgage under the above mentioned bond In the context we can only take these words to mean that if there is payment within the specified time then the title will continue to reside in the executants for what else can a right of exclusive possession import in these circumstances It is relevant to note in passing that this silence about title would be proper in a mortgage for there the owner title remains in him all the while and so a reconveyance is unnecessary But if there is an out and out sale the title could not revert to the original owner without a proper reconveyance It is true the words of conveyance in the earlier part Of the deed clause would pass an absolute title if they stood alone but the document must be read as a whole and it must also be remembered that it was executed by ignorant justice and scribed by a man whose knowledge of conveyancing was on the face of it rudimentary and defective for its ambiguities that there is ambiguity is patent from what we have said The first point there is to see whether there is an ostensible sale Those are not the actual words used but in our opinion that is a fair construction of their meaning when the document is read as a whole If that is what they mean as we hold they do then the matter falls squarely within the ambit of section Now as we have already said once a transaction is embodied in One document and not two and once its terms are covered by section then it must be taken to be a mortgage by conditional sale unless there are express words to indicate the contrary or in a case of ambiguity the attendant circumstances necessarily lead to the opposite conclusion There are no express words here which say that this is not a mortgage but there is ambiguity so we must probe further The word mortgage is also used in clause therefore it is clear that when a mortgage is intended the word mortgage is used The only weakness in this argument is that when a mortgage is by conditional sale this is the form it has to take because section postulates that there must be an ostensible sale and if a sale is ostensible it must necessarily contain all the outward indicate of a real sale The question we are considering can only arise when the word sale is used and of course a sale imports a transfer of title But on the other side there is the very significant fact that Rs The learned <ORG> Judges discount this by saying that there is no evidence to show that the proceedings which were started in continued after the deed There is another point in favour of the appellant and that is that the surrounding circumstances show that there was a relationship of debtor and creditor between the We say this because the indemnity clause clause says in sub clause that in the event of the transferee possession being disturbed the executants would among other things pay him in addition to damages the entire consideration together with interest at per cent He is no longer in the picture as he sold it to the plaintiff for Rs In the circumstances we direct that each party bear its own costs
