An appeal can only lie if the order of the District Judge can be said to be an order in execution and therefore appealable as a decree under Section Section says All questions arising between the parties to the suit in which the decree was passed or their representatives and relating to the execution discharge or satisfaction of the decree shall be determined by the <ORG> executing the decree and not by a separate suit It was contended that an application would be made to the District Judge of Poona to select a trustee by way of execution but we are of opinion that clearly the District Judge is a persona designata under the scheme which expressly mentioned the District Judge as the person to select the trustees under Clause of the scheme Under Section of the Code an appeal lies to the High <ORG> from every decree passed in appeal by any <ORG> Subordinate to the High <ORG> so that the order passed by the District Judge is not an order of the District <ORG> of Poona but an order of the District Judge There they are met with the same objection because under Section the High <ORG> may call for the record of any case which has been decided by any <ORG> subordinate to such High <ORG> and in which no appeal lies thereto Consequently there is the same objection to entertain an application in revision as there is to entertain an appeal Reference may be made to Clause of the scheme which directs the District Judge to frame rules for the guidance of the trustees in the conduct of the <ORG> business and submit them for the sanction of <ORG> We are not concerned with hypothetical cases which have been suggested to us such as the District Judge declining to exercise the functions imposed upon him by the scheme or in the exercise of those functions entirely failing to exercise any discretion in the matter When such cases arise we have no doubt that <ORG> will be competent to deal with them In the meantime the appeals and the applications will be dismissed with costs
