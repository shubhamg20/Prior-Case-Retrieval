This is an appeal originally brought by the defendants <NAME> since deceased and <NAME> from a judgment and decree of <ORG> in its Civil Appellate Jurisdiction dated the rd August reversing the judgment and decree of <ORG> in its Civil Original Jurisdiction dated the th June When the matters in dispute were before this <ORG> upon a former occasion it was decided that evidence upon the topics above mentioned could be received but no final judgment was given as to the effect to be given to such evidence after its reception It provides that when the terms of a contract grant or disposition are reduced to writing no evidence of oral agreement or statement shall be admitted as between the parties to any such instrument or their representatives in interest for the purpose of contradicting varying adding to or subtracting from its terms Lord <NAME> cites Section of the Indian Evidence Act and adds The cases in <ORG> which were referred to by the learned Judges in <ORG> have not in the opinion of their Lordships any application to the law of India as laid down in the Acts of the Indian Legislature The principles of equity which are universal forbid a person to deal with an estate which he knows that he holds in security as if he held it in property Thus while in the courso of the judgment of Lord <NAME> reference was made to evidence which might be taken relating to the acts and conduct of the parties as distinguished from oral evidence and conversations constituting in themselves some agreement between them nothing was decided upon that head except that it would give rise to important and difficult questions under the Indian Evidence Act Upon the facts it now turns out quite plainly and it was indeed admitted in argument that when <NAME> took the conveyance from the <NAME> he knew that it was a conveyance of property which belonged to <ORG> and that accordingly the grant proceeded a non domino But in the opinion of their Lordships Section does not apply because the evidence the admissibility of which is in question is evidence going to show what were the rights of a third person namely <ORG> in the property and there are concurrent findings to the effect that the property was in that owner and not in the <NAME> who to the knowledge of <NAME> never purported to dispose of it as theirs Their Lordships will accordingly humbly advise His Majesty that the appeal be allowed the decree of <ORG> in its appellate jurisdiction dated the rd August set aside with costs and the decree of <ORG> in its original jurisdiction restored The respondents will pay the costs of the appeal
