In November the appellant received a letter from the second defendant Mr The trial court raised several issues and came to the conclusion that the appellant was the owner of the copy right in Hum Hindustani but there was no violation of copy right of the appellant Thereafter the appellant filed an appeal in <ORG> The counsel for the appellant contended that the principles enunicated and the legal inference drawn by the courts below are against the settled legal principles laid down by the courts in England America and India the two courts have not fully understood the imports of the violation of copy right particularly when the similarities between the play and The film are so close that would lead to the irresistible inference and unmistakable impression that the film is nothing but an imitation of the play The counsel for the respondents submitted that the two courts below have applied the law correctly Even on the facts found it is manifest that there is a vast difference both in the spirit and the contents between the play and the film At the time when the cause of action arose in the present suit <ORG> had not made any law governing copyright violation and therefore the court relied on the old law passed by <ORG> viz If the defendant work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some variations here and there it would amount to violation of the copyright In other words in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy As a violation of copyright amounts to an act of piracy it must be proved By clear and cogent evidence after applying the various tests laid down by decided cases The learned trial Judge who had the advantage of seeing the picture was of the opinion that the film taken as a whole is quite different The <ORG> came to the conclusion that the essential features of the play are as under A The <ORG> came to the conclusion that the essential features of the film are as under Two aspects of provincialism viz It is true that there are following similarities in the two xvi In the said play reconciliation between the two families takes place only after they have experienced the shock of their children committing suicide on account of their provincial feelings whereas in the film the father of the girl realised his mistake after experiencing the shock of his daughter committing suicide xvii In both the said play and the said film stress is laid on the fact that although India is one country yet there is acute feeling of provincialism between persons hailing from its various States even though they work together and live as neighbours The question can arise whether there is an infringement of copyright even though the essential features of the play can be said to correspond to a part only of the plot of the film In the attempt to show that he is not guilty of infringement of copy right it is always possible for a person intending to take advantage of the intellectual efforts and labour of another to so develop his own product that it covers a wider field than the area included within the scope of the earlier product and in the common area covered by the two productions to introduce changes in order to disguise the attempt at plagiarism The following Judgments were delivered FAZAL ALI This appeal by special leave is directed against the judgment of <ORG> dated rd May affirming the decree of the District Judge Delhi and dismissing the plaintiff suit for damages against the defendants on the ground that they had violated the copyrighted work of the plaintiff which was a drama called Hum Hindustani The facts have been succinctly stated by the District Judge in his judgment and summarised by <ORG> and therefore it is not necessary for us to repeat the same all over again We would however like to give a brief resume of some of the striking facts in the case which may be germane for the purpose of deciding the important issues involved in this appeal We might mention here that <ORG> as also the District Judge negatived the plaintiff claim and prima facie the appeal appears to be concluded by finding of fact but it was rightly argued by Mr <NAME> appealing for the appellant that the principles of violation of copy right in the instant appeal have to be applied on the facts found and the inferences from proved facts drawn by <ORG> which is doubtless a question of law and more particularly as there is no clear authority of this <ORG> on the subject we should be persuaded to go into this question without entering into findings of facts Having heard counsel for the parties we felt that as the case is one of first impression and needs to be decided by this <ORG> we should enter into the merits on the basis of the facts found and inferences drawn by <ORG> and the District Judge It is true that both the District Judge and <ORG> have relied upon some well established principles to determine whether or not in a particular case a violation of copy right has taken place but learned counsel for the appellant has challenged the validity of the principles enunciated by <ORG> The second defendant did not make any clear commitment but promised the plaintiff that he would inform him about his re action after reaching Bombay The picture was released in Delhi in September and the plaintiff read some comments in the papers which gave the impression that the picture was very much like the play Hum Hindustani written by the plaintiff The plaintiff accordingly filed the suit for damages for decree for accounts of the profits made by the defendants and a decree for permanent injunction against the defendants restraining them from exhibiting the film New Delhi The second defendant has taken a clear stand that after having heard the play he informed the plaintiff that though the play might have been all right for the amateur stage it was too inadequate for the purpose of making a full length commercial motion picture The defendants denied the allegation of the plaintiff that it was after hearing the play written by the plaintiff that the defendants decided to make a film based on the play and entitled it as New Delhi The mere fact that there were some similarities between the film and the play could be explained by the fact that the idea viz The defendant thus denied that there was any violation of the copy right The main case however turned upon the decision on issues No and which were however decided against the plaintiff as the learned Judge held that there was no violation of the copyright of the plaintiff The only argument advanced by the appellant was that the principles enunciated and the legal inferences drawn by the courts below are against the settled legal principles laid down by the courts in England America and India On the other hand it was argued by Mr <NAME> counsel for the respondents that the two courts below have applied the law correctly and it is not necessary for this <ORG> to enter into merits in view of the concurrent findings He further submitted that even on the facts found it is manifest that there is a vast difference both in the spirit and the content between the play Hum Hindustani and the film New Delhi and no question of violation of the copy right arises To begin with there is no decided case of this <ORG> on this point If the work is unpublished to publish the work or any substantial part thereof and shall include the sole right in the case of a literary dramatic or musical work to make any record perforated roll cinematograph film or other contrivance by means or which the work may be mechanically performed or delivered In Halsbury Laws of England by Lord Hailsham Fourth Edition the following observations are made only original works are protected under Part I of the Copyright Act but it is not requisite that the work should be the expression of original or inventive thought for Copyright Act are not concerned with the originality of ideas but with the expression of thought and in the case of a literary work with the expression of thought in print or writing There is copyright in original dramatic works and adaptations thereof and such copyright subsists not only in the actual words of the work but in the dramatic incidents created so that if these are taken there may be an infringement although no words arc actually copies Consequently it is only an in fringement if the defendant has made an unlawful use of the form in which the thought or information is expressed The defendant must to be liable have made a substantial use of this form he is not liable if he has taken from the work the essential ideas however original and expressed the idea in his own form or used the idea for his own purposes The author also points out that there is no infringement unless the plaintiff play wrighted work has been actually used so that it may be said that the latter work reproduces the earlier one Moreover it seems to us that the fundamental idea of violation of copyright or imitation is the violation of the Eighth Commandment Thou shalt not steal which forms the moral basis of the protective provisions of the Copyright Act of In Article the author lays down the various tests to determine whether an infringement has taken place and observes as follows Various definitions of copy have been suggested but it is submitted that the true view of the matter is that where the court is satisfied that a defendant has in producing the alleged infringement made a substantial use of those features of the plaintiff work in which copyright subsists an infringement will be held to have been committed if he has made such use he has exercised unlawfully the sole right which is conferred upon the plaintiff the author observes as follows In an action for the alleged infringement of the copy right of a play by a motion picture wherein it appeared that both authors had used life in a boys reform school as a background but the only similarity between the two productions consisted to a few incidents and points in dialogue such as one would expect to find in stories set against the same background there was no infringement of copyright To the same effect are the following observations to the author Where the only evidence of similarities between two plays was based upon the author analysis and interpretation of an extensive list of parallel from which he infer red that many incidents scenes and characters in the alleged infringing play were adapted from the plaintiff copy righted play but no such resemblance would be apparent i to an ordinary observer it was held that the meaning or interpretation which the author gives to his literary work cannot be accepted as a deciding test of plagiarism and that in the absence of any material resemblance which could be recognised by an ordinary observation There is however no common law literary property right in the manner and postures of the actors used by them in performing the play Infringement of a copyright is a trespass on a private domain owned and occupied by the owner of the copyright and therefore protected by law and infringement of copy right or piracy which is a synonymous term in this connection consists in the doing by any person without the con sent of the owner of the copyright of anything the sole right to do which is conferred by the statute on the owner of the copyright This view was taken by <ORG> in the case of <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> In the American Jurisprudence also it is pointed out that the law does not recognize property rights in abstract idea nor is an idea protected by a copyright and it becomes a copyright work only when the idea is given embodiment in a tangible form In cases involving motion pictures or radio or television broadcasts it is frequently stated that an idea is not protected by a copyright or under the common law or that there is no property right in an idea apart from the manner in which it is expressed Infringement exists when a study of two writings indicates plainly that the defendant work is a transparent rephrasing to produce essentially the story of the other writing but where there is no textual copying and there are differences in literary style the fact that there is a sameness in the tricks of spinning out the yarn so as to sustain the reader suspense and similarities of the same general nature in a narrative of a long complicated search for a lost article of fabulous value does not indicate infringement If it were altered thus a copy is that which comes so near to the original as to suggest that original to the mind of every person seeing it the substance of the definition would be preserved and Lord <NAME> criticism would be avoided This case was followed by the Master of Rolls in the case of <NAME> <NAME> That being so it is clear to my mind that a fair use has not been made of its that is to say there has been appropriated and published in a form which will or may materially injure the copyright that in which the plaintiffs have a proprietary right In the case of <ORG> <ORG> it was held that similarities of incidents and situation undoubtedly afforded prima facie evidence of copy and in the absence of any explanation by the defendant regarding the sources the plaintiffs must succeed It was however held that there was no copyright in ideas schemes or systems or method and the copyright is confined only to the subject In this connection <NAME> Observed as follows There is no copyright in ideas or schemes or systems or methods it is confined to their expression But there is a distinction between ideas which are not copy right and situations and incidents which may be Similarly in the case of Donoghue <ORG> it was pointed out that there was no copyright in an idea and in this connection <NAME> Observed as follows This at any rate is clear and one can start with This beyond all question that there is no copyright in an idea or in ideas of the idea however brilliant and however clever it may be is nothing more than an idea and is not put into any form of words or any form of expression such as a picture or a play then there is no such thing as copyright at all He considered therefore that where the similarity was a mere coincidence there was no breach of copyright All that we find here is a certain likeness of stage situation and scenic effect which in my opinion ought not to he taken into consideration at all where there is appreciable likeness in the words The <ORG> concluded that it was the idea or impression conveyed to the audience which was the determining factor and since the impressions were the same held there was an infringement It recognised that there were similar incidents in the productions but such similarities were due to the nature of the subject matter and not to copying We find no merit in the contention that any of the songs in defendant movie were taken from plaintiff manuscripts Considering that both the movie and the manuscript presented activities of Harvey Girls and information concerning them was received from the same source we think it reasonable that some similarities in character portrayal could be discovered Similar observations were made in the case of <ORG> Stonesifer which are as follows In copyright infringement cases involving original dramatic compositions and motion picture productions in as much as literal or complete appropriation of the protected property rarely occurs the problem before the court is concrete and specific in each case to determine from all the facts One useful test which has been followed in several decisions of <ORG> is the one laid down by Lord <NAME> in <NAME> <NAME> Co In the latter case there is no violation of the copyright If the defendants work is nothing but a literal imitation of the copyrighted work with some variations here and there it would amount to violation of the copyright In other words in order to be actionable the copy must be a substantial and material one which at once leads to the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of an act of piracy The learned trial Judge who had also had the advantage of seeing the picture was of the opinion that the film taken as a whole is quite different from the play written by the plaintiff This was done merely to appreciate the judgment of the trial Court and the evidence led by the parties and was not at all meant to be just a substitute for the evidence led by the parties When they reach the Red Fort he meets <NAME> a young Bengali painter whom he had met earlier in connection with the search for accommodation of the house but was refused accommodation because <NAME> did not happen to be a Bengali The performance is applauded by The audience which includes <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> He takes <NAME> to his own house and tells <NAME> that she is her niece and on that basis negotiates for the marriage of <NAME> with <NAME> Learned counsel for the appellant however drew our attention to para of the plaint at pages of the paper book wherein as many as similarities have been detailed xvi In the said play reconciliation between the two families takes place only after they have experienced the shock of their children committing suicide on account of their provincial feelings whereas in the film the father of the girl realised his mistake after experiencing the shock of his daughter committing suicide xvii In both the said play and the said film stress is laid on the fact that although India is one country yet there is acute feeling of provincialism between persons hailing from its various States even though they work together and live as neighbors We have already pointed out that mere similarities by themselves are not sufficient to raise in inference of colourable imitation on the other hand there are quite a number of dissimilarities also for instance i In the play provincialism comes on the surface only when the question of marriage of <NAME> with <NAME> crops up but in the picture it is the starting point of the story when <NAME> goes around from door to door in search of accommodation but is refused the same because he does not belong to the State from which the landlord hails as a result thereof <NAME> has to masquerade him self as a Madrasi It was lastly contended by counsel For the appellant that the correspondence between the plaintiff and the defendant would show that defendant No himself was aware of the story contained in the play even before he proceeded to make the film in New Delhi There is however a serious controversy on the question as to whether the defendant after hearing play said that the play was not suitable for being filmed as alleged However there is no reliable evidence to show that defendant No at any time expressed his intention to film the play written by the plaintiff <NAME> Bearing in mind the well recognised principles and tests to determine whether there has been an infringement of the law relating to copyright in a particular case which were brought to our notice by the counsel on both sides and which have been elaborately considered and discussed by my learned brother <NAME> in the course of the judgment prepared by him we proceeded at the re quest of the counsel to hear the script of the play Hum Hindustani which WAS read out to us by the plaintiff himself in a dramatic style and to see the film New Delhi produced by defendants and the exhibition of which was arranged by the defendants themselves As such I am in complete agreement with the conclusions arrived at by my learned brother <NAME> that there has been no breach on the part of the defendants of the plaintiff copyright and concur with the judgment proposed to be delivered by him Nonetheless the question can arise whether there is an infringement of copyright even though the essential features of the play can be said to correspond to a part only of the plot of the film If the treatment of the theme in the stage play has been made the basic of one of the themes in the film story and the essential structure of that treatment is clearly and distinctly identifiable in the film story it is not necessary it seems to me for the <ORG> to examine all the several themes embraced within the plot of the film in order to decide whether infringement has been established In the attempt to show that he is not guilty of infringement of copyright it is always possible for a person intending to take advantage of the intellectual effort and labours of another to so develop his own product that it covers a wider field than the area included within the scope of the earlier product and in the common area covered by the two productions to introduce changes in order to disguise the attempt at plagiarism The appeal is dismissed but without any order as to costs
