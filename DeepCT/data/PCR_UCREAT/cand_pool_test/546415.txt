Constitution Interpretation of Reasonable opportunity of showing cause Meaning of Punishment of dismissal on Government Servant Constitutional Protection Procedure Constitution of India Art HEADNOTE Reasonable opportunity to show cause in Art Such reasonable opportunity must therefore include opportunity to deny his guilt and establish his innocence which means that he must be told what the charges against him are and the allegations on which such charges are based opportunity to cross examine the witnesses produced against him and examine himself or other witnesses on his behalf and opportunity to show that the proposed punishment would not be the proper punishment to inflict which means that the tentative determination of the competent authority to inflict one of the three punishments must be communicated to him Appeal by special leave from the judgment and decree dated November of <ORG> Circuit Bench at <NAME> in Regular Second Appeal No of arising out of the judgment and decree dated December of <ORG> at <NAME> in Regular Civil Appeal No of affirming the judgment and decree of Subordinate Judge Third Class <NAME> in Suit No of The following Judgment of the Court was delivered by DAS This appeal by special leave granted by this Court to the plaintiff appellant is directed against the judgment and decree passed on November by a single Judge of <ORG> sitting in <ORG> at Delhi in regular second appeal No of The appellant duly submitted his explanation in writing It appears that at or about this time the appellant became involved in a criminal case on a charge under of the Indian Penal Code and on October he was actually arrested but was released on bail two or three days later After reciting the charge sheet containing the notice calling upon the appellant to show cause why he should not be dismissed from service and setting out the charges contained in the notice and summarising the explanation submitted by the appellant with regard to each of the charges and reciting the prayer of the appellant that the Enquiry Officer should be changed and the rejection thereof and the framing of additional charges and the appellant absence from the enquiry with effect from October the report proceeded to set out the actual charges which <NAME> was appoint ed to enquire into After stating that the charges of embezzlemient acceptance of illegal gratification and borrowing of money from societies were so serious that even one of them alone was sufficient to demand the appellant dismissal and that the entries made in his character roll disclosed that his work and conduct had not been satisfactory and explaining that the enquiry had been held up by reason of the appellant having been challaned under Indian Penal Code <NAME> <NAME> in his report formulated the following points for consideration namely what penalty should be imposed on <NAME> for the eleven charges proved against him Whether his gun licence should be cancelled and whether the dues of societies which had been proved might be realised out of the security deposit furnished by him Then after stating that a personal hearing was given to the appellant who raised the two points mentioned above and holding that there was no substance in either of them paragraph of the report ran as follows The charges of embezzlement acceptance of illegal gratification making wrong statement misbehaviour at the time of enquiry and refusal to receive orders to attend enquiry which had been proved against him are so serious that I am sorry I cannot suggest lesser punishment than dismissal from service and he may be dismissed There is no positive and definite statement in <NAME> report that <NAME> had concluded the enquiry or submitted a formal report He has been found guilty of the charges of embezzlement acceptance of illegal gratification making wrong statement misbehaviour at the time of the enquiry and refusal to receive order to attend the enquiry and accordingly accepted the appeal set aside the decree of the courts below and dismissed the plaintiff suit The only point that has been canvassed before us as it had been before the High <ORG> is Was the appellant given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him There is no dispute that the appellant was served with a charge sheet on July as required by of the Rules which had been framed by the Chief Commissioner Delhi and which governed the appellant conditions of service It is also conceded that the appellant actually appeared at two hearings before the Enquiry Officer <NAME> but that subsequently he wanted a transfer of the enquiry to some other officer and that that prayer having been refused he did not take any further part in the enquiry before that officer There is no grievance that no opportunity had been given to him to defend himself against the charges levelled against him in that enquiry It is also an admitted fact that some time after the appellant was discharged from the criminal case be received a notice on November requiring him to appear before <NAME> on November in connection with the pending enquiry His only grievance is that after <NAME> had made his report on December recommending the dismissal of the appellant and the Deputy Commissioner had on the very next day approved of the report and proposed to take action accordingly the appellant was not given an opportunity to show cause against the action so pro In order to appreciate the arguments advanced by learned counsel for the parties it is necessary at this stage to set out the provisions of the Constitution qearing on them and of of the Government of India Act are as follows Except as expressly provided by this Constitution every person who is a member of a defence service or of a civil service of the <ORG> or of an all India service or holds any post connected with defence or any civil post under the <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the President and every person who is a member of a civil service of a <ORG> or holds any civil post under a <ORG> holds office during the pleasure of the Governor of the <ORG> No person who is a member of a civil service of the <ORG> or an all India service or a civil service of a <ORG> or holds a civil post under the <ORG> or a <ORG> shall be dismissed or removed by an authority subordinate to that by which he was appointed No such person as aforesaid shall be dismissed or removed or reduced in rank until he has been given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him Provided If any question arises whether it is reasonably practicable to give to any person an opportunity of showing cause under clause the decision thereon of the authority empowered to dismiss or remove such person or to reduce him in rank as the case may be shall be final The answer to the question canvassed before us depends on a true construction of the aforesaid pro visions and in particular on the view we take as to the meaning scope and ambit of Art <NAME> Article no doubt provides that every person falling within it holds office during the pleasure of the President or the Governor as the case may be The limitations thus imposed on the exercise of the pleasure of the President or the Governor in the matter of the dismissal removal or reduction in rank of government servants constitute the measure of the constitutional protection afforded to the government servants by Art Likewise cl protects government servants against being dismissed removed or reduced in rank without being given a reasonable opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to them As has been explained by this Court in <NAME> case the expressions dismissed removed and reduced in rank are technical words taken from the service rules where they are used to denote the three major categories of punishments Rule xiv prescribed the procedure for all cases in which dismissal removal or reduction in rank of any officer was intended I A at It provided Without prejudice to the provisions of the Public Servants Inquiries Act no order of dismissal removal or reduction shall be passed on a member of a Service other than an order based on facts which have led to his conviction in a criminal court or by a Court Martial unless he has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and has been afforded an adequate opportunity of defending himself The grounds on which it is proposed to take action shall be reduced to the form of a definite charge or charges which shall be communi cated to the person charged together with a statement of the allegations on which each charge is based and of any other circumstances which it is proposed to take into consideration in passing orders on the case He shall be required within a reasonable time to put in a written statement of his defence and to state whether he desires to be heard in person At that inquiry oral evidence shall be heard as to such of the allegations as are not admitted and the person charged shall be entitled to crossexamine the witnesses to give evidence in person and to have such witnesses called as he may wish provided that the officer conducting the inquiry may for special and sufficient reason to be recorded in writing refuse to call a witness All or any of the provisions of the rule may in exceptional cases for special and sufficient reasons to be recorded in writing be waived where there is a difficulty in observing exactly the requirements of the rule and those requirements can be waived without injustice to the person charged It was held that and the rules made thereunder only made provisions for the redress of grievances by administrative process The position of the Government servant was therefore rather insecure for his office being held during the pleasure of the <ORG> under the Government of India Act the rules could not over ride or derogate from the statute and the protection of the rules could not be enforced by action so as to nullify the statute itself The only protection that the Government servants had was that by virtue of they could not be dismissed by an authority subordinate to that by which they were appointed The position however improved to some extent under the Act which by gave a further protection in addition to that provided in which reproduced the protection of of the Government of India Act We have therefore to determine the true meaning scope and ambit of this now protection given by of I A The majority of the Judges of <ORG> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> in <NAME> case took the view that in sub of there had been enacted provisions of a very limited scope in permanent statutory form as compared with the provisions under the rules considered in <NAME> case The majority of <ORG> at page construed as follows In our judgment the words against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him require that there should be a definite proposal by some authority either to dismiss a civil servant or to reduce him in rank or alternatively to dismiss or reduce him in rank as and when final action may be determined upon All that it expressly requires is that where it is proposed to dismiss or reduce in rank a civil servant he should be given reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposal to dismiss or reduce him It is also significant that there is no indication as to the authority by whom the action is to be proposed It does however seem to us that the sub section requires that as and when an authority is definitely proposing to dismiss or to reduce in rank a member of the civil service he shall be so told and he shall be given an opportunity of putting his case against the proposed action and as that opportunity has to be a reasonable opportunity it seems to us that the section requires not only notification of the action proposed but of the grounds on which the authority is proposing that the I I I A action should be taken and that the person concerned must then be given reasonable time to make his representations against the proposed action and the grounds on which it is proposed to be taken In our judgment each case will have to turn on its own facts but the real point of the sub section is in our judgment that the person who is to be dismissed or reduced must know that that punishment is proposed as the punishment for certain acts or omissions on his part and must be told the grounds on which it is proposed to take such action and must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause why such punishment should not be imposed That in our judgment involves in all cases where there is an enquiry and as a result thereof some authority definitely proposes dismissal or reduction in rank that the person concerned shall be told in full or adequately summarised form the results of that enquiry and the findings of the enquiring officer and be given an opportunity of showing cause with that information why he should not suffer the proposed dismissal or reduction of rank According to them all that it expressly requires is that where it is proposed to dismiss or reduce in rank a civil servant he should be given reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposal to dismiss or reduce him Their Lordships added that as that opportunity had to be a reasonable opportunity the section must be taken to require not only notification of the action proposed but of the grounds on which the authority is proposing that the action should be taken and that the person concerned must then be given reasonable time to make his representations against the proposed action and the grounds on which sit is proposed to be taken <ORG> observed as follows The plaintiff contention is that this opportunity should have been afforded to him after the finding of the enquiring officer had been considered and the punishment decided upon Eight charges were served on the plaintiff and at the end he was asked to show cause why he should not be dismissed removed or reduced or subjected to such other disciplinary action as the competent authority may think fit to enforce for breach of Government Rules and conduct unbecoming to the Indian Civil Service The plaintiff contention that there should be two enquiries the first to establish that be had been guilty and the second to determine what should be the appropriate punishment and that in each stage he should have reasonable and independent opportunities to defend and show cause does not appear to be correct or intended by the <ORG> Indeed the learned Solicitor General does riot contend that this provision is confined to guaranteeing to the government servant an opportunity to be given to him only at the later stage of showing cause against the punishment proposed to be imposed on him All that it says is that the government servant must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him He must not only be given an opportunity but such opportunity must be a reasonable one In order that the opportunity to show cause against the proposed action may be regarded as a reasonable one it is quite obviously necessary that the government servant should have the opportunity to say if that be his case that he has not been guilty of any misconduct to merit any punishment at all and also that the particular punish ment proposed to be given is much more drastic and severe than he deserves If this is the correct meaning of the clause as we think it is what consequences follow If it is open to the <ORG> servant under this provision to contend if that be the fact that he is not guilty of any misconduct then how can he take that plea unless he is told what misconduct is alleged against him If the opportunity to show cause is to be a reasonable one it is clear that he should be informed about the charge or charges levelled against him and the evidence by which it is sought to be established for it is only then that he will be able to put forward his defence If the purpose of this provision is to give the government servant an opportunity to exonerate himself from the charge and if this opportunity is to be a reasonable one he should be allowed to show that the evidence against him is not worthy of credence or consideration and that he can only do if he is given a chance to cross examine the witnesses called against him and to examine himself or any other witness in support of his defence All this appears to us to be implict in the language used in the clause but this does not exhaust his rights In addition to showing that he has not been guilty of any misconduct so as to merit any punishment it is reasonable that he should also have an opportunity to contend that the charges proved against him do not necessarily require the particular punishment proposed to be meted out to him To summarise the reasonable opportunity envisaged by the provision under consideration includes a An opportunity to deny his guilt and establish his innocence which he can only do if he is told what the charges levelled against him are and the allegations on which such charges are based an opportunity to defend himself by crossexamining the witnesses produced against him and by examining himself or any other witnesses in support of his defence and finally an opportunity to make his representation as to why the proposed punishment should not be inflicted on him which he can only do if the competent authority after the enquiry is over and after applying his mind to the gravity or otherwise of the charges proved against the government servant tentatively proposes to inflict one of the three punishments and communicates the same to the government servant In short the substance of the protection provided by rules like referred to above was bodily lifted out of the rules and together with an additional opportunity embodied in of the Government of India Act so as to give astatutory protection to the government servants and has now been incorporated in Art We find support for our above mentioned conclusion in the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> case Rule is concerned that the civil servant shall be informed of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and to afford him an adequate opportunity of defending himself against charges which have to be reduced to writing this is in marked contrast to the statutory provision of a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken in regard to him It is on that stage being reached that the statute gives the civil servant the opportunity for which sub makes provision The opening sentence in the above passage namely that was not a reproduction of and that was left unaffected as an administrative rule does seem to suggest that is not at all concerned with the enquiry into the charges which comes at the earlier stage but a close reading of the rest of that passage will indicate that in their Lordships view the substance of the protection of is also included in and to that is superadded by way of further protection the neces sity of giving yet another opportunity to the government servant at the stage where the charges are proved against him and a particular punishment is tentatively proposed to be inflicted on him Therefore in a case where there is no rule like the necessity of an enquiry was implicit in and is so in Art This clearly proceeds on the basis that the right to defend himself in the enquiry and the right to make representation against the proposed punishment are all parts of his statutory right and are implicit in the reasonable opportunity provided by the statute itself for the protection of the government servant The learned Solicitor General appearing for <ORG> then contends that assuming that the government servant is entitled to have an opportunity not only to show cause against his guilt but also an opportunity to show cause against the punishment proposed to be inflicted on him the appellant in the present case has had both such opportunities for by the notice served on him on July the appellant was called upon to show cause against the charges as well as against the punishment of dismissal in case the charges were established He points out that in <NAME> case the notice given to <NAME> did not specify dismissal as the only and particular punishment proposed to be imposed on him but called upon him to show cause why he should not be dismissed removed or reduced or subjected to such other disciplinary action as the competent authority might think fit to enforce whereas in the present case the notice referred to above clearly indicated that the punishment of dismissal alone was proposed to be inflicted A close perusal of the Judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> case will however show that the decision in that case did not proceed on the ground that an opportunity had not been given to <NAME> against the proposed punishment merely because in the notice several punishments were included but the decision proceeded really on the ground that this opportunity should have been given after a stage had been reached where the charges had been established and the competent authority had applied its mind to the gravity or otherwise of the proved charge tentatively and proposed a particular punishment There is as the Solicitor General fairly concedes no practical difficulty in following this procedure of giving two notices at the two stages If the competent authority were to determine before the charges were proved that a particular punishment would be meted out to the government servant concerned the latter may well feel that the competent authority had formed an opinion against him generally on the subject matter of the charge or at any rate as regards the punishment itself <NAME> was not however the competent authority to dismiss the appellant and therefore he could only make a report to the Deputy Commissioner who was the person competent to dismiss the appellant When the Deputy Commissioner accept ed the report and confirmed the opinion that the punishment of dismissal should be inflicted on the appellant it was on that stage being reached that the appellant was entitled to have a further opportunity given to him to show cause why that particular punishment should not be inflicted on him We therefore accept this appeal and set aside the order of the Single Judge and decree the appellant suit by making a declaration that the order of dismissal passed by the Deputy Commissioner on December purporting to dismiss the appellant from service was inoperative and that the appellant was a member of the service at the date of the institution of the suit out of which this appeal has arisen The appellant will get costs throughout in all courts
