These are consolidated appeals from two decrees of <ORG> both dated the th November which reversed in part and modified in part two decrees each dated the th October of <ORG> The first of the two suits in which those last mentioned decrees were made namely that numbered of the appeal in which is No of was instituted by <NAME> the appellant in both the present appeals to enforce a mortgage dated the th June executed in his favour by the third respondent in the first appeal namely <NAME> in her own right and also as guardian of her two sons then minors the first and second respondents in the first appeal to secure the repayment of rupees admittedly advanced by the mortgagee to this lady with interest at one per cent per <NAME> By his first wife <NAME> he had two sons and one daughter who pre deceased him and one daughter <NAME> who survived him Both these suits were tried by the same Subordinate Judge who delivered separate judgments Their Lordships therefore base their decision solely on the points raised by the parties and dealt with by the <ORG> below The fact that such a marriage ever took place was denied by the plaintiffs in that suit and a vast body of evidence oral and documentary was adduced by both sides on the issue of <NAME> legitimacy After reciting that the Nawab <NAME> was seized and possessed for an estate of inheritance in possession of certain undivided shares in certain Zemindari villages and other landed properties in Lucknow and in the districts of Lucknow Fyzabad and Sitapur and also of a house in Calcutta numbered Russell Street that on the treaty of the marriage with his said wife <NAME> he had agreed to give her a dower of one lac of rupees and also to settle upon her a monthly allowance of rupees that in part performance of that agreement and in satisfaction of this monthly allow ance he had by a registered instrument dated the th October transferred to her a certain house described as yielding a monthly rent of rupees which she had since enjoyed and had in addition already paid to her rupees in part payment of her dower leaving the sum of rupees the balance thereof unpaid that he had by gifts of jewellery and effects of the value of one lac and rupees and otherwise provided for his children by his first wife that with a view to prevent further disputes quarrels and litigation between his said wife <NAME> and her children and the children of his first marriage he was desirous of making the settlement thereafter appearing it was agreed between the parties thereto that the said intended settlement should be in full payment and satisfaction of the dower payable by him as therein mentioned A power of leasing for a term of six years was given to the trustees and a provision introduced that in case one of the trustees should die or be unable or unwilling to act the Official Trustees of Bengal should be appointed trustees in such trustees stead In addition the deed fails to provide expressly or impliedly for the payment of the income of the property held in trust on each of three different contingencies It was contended by Sir <NAME> on behalf of the appellants that by reason of the conditional nature of this gift to the trustees the contingent nature of the provision for the children and these contingent resulting trusts in the settlor favour these dispositions made by the deed were void under the Mahomedan law observed by the Shia sect Owing however to the conclusions at which their Lordships have arrived on the other points raised in the case they do not find it necessary to express any opinion on these points and therefore abstain from doing so it is at of the report laid down by this Board that according to Mahomedan law holder of property may in his lifetime give away the whole or part of it if he complies with certain forms but that it is incumbent on those who seek to set up such a transaction to prove that those forms have been complied with and this will be so whether the gift be made with or without consideration If the subject of the gift be immovable property then by section the transfer must be effected by a registered instrument signed by or on behalf of the donor and attested by at least two witnesses Section enacts that subject to the trust the beneficiary has a right to the rents and profits of the trust property and section that where there is only one beneficiary and he is competent to contract or where there are several beneficiaries competent to contract and all are of one mind he or they may require the trustee to transfer the property to him or them or to such person as he or they may direct As to the circumstances under which this trust deed was executed it was contended on behalf of the appellant that the settlor was heavily indebted at its date and that by it he purported to divest himself of almost all the property then belonging to him that it was merely designed to protect him against the claims of his pressing creditors and was never intended by him to be an operative instrument But if this was a genuine transaction and the deed was intended to be an operative instrument there was no reason why the names of the trustees should not have been substituted for that of the settlor on the registry in reference to these villages and many reasons why they should have been so substituted These facts are no doubt calculated to throw grave suspicion on the genuineness of the transaction of February but they do not appear to their Lordships to be sufficiently convincing to induce them to rest their judgment upon them rather than upon other points where in their view there is less room for doubt There is no proof whatever that he ever communicated with <NAME> oh the subject Over one set of the signatures of the trustees it contains the usual declaration by the defendants that the statements contained in the document are true to their knowledge except as to matters stated on information and belief and as to such matters they believe them to be true By Section it imposes on all persons obtaining possession of land or the profits thereof whether by succession purchase or other form of transfer a statutory duty to give notice of the same immediately after it has taken place to the Tahsildar of the Tahsil in which the Mahal to which the land belongs is situated or to the Deputy Commissioner of the district If the notice be given to the former that officer is bound to report to the Deputy Commissioner This entry no doubt does not prejudice the right of any person who may claim and establish in a Court of competent jurisdiction a right to an interest in the land to which the entry refers Section enacts that if the person succeeding be a minor or under disability the guardian or other person who shall have charge of the property shall give the notice and by a fine is imposed on any person neglecting for three months to give the notice prescribed by Section He would utterly fail in his duty if he omitted to do so and in the absence of all evidence that he did fail in his duty in this respect the maxim omnia presumuniur rete esse acta must their Lordships think be applied to the proceedings In all these cases orders for mutation were passed with reference to this case all the cases are of the same nature And on the th October an order is made and signed by the officer in charge of the <ORG> to the effect that the case being proceeded with that day and the <ORG>dar report being perused it was ordered in accordance with the <ORG>dar report that the mutation slips be issued in the names of the deceased that the fees be realised that formal orders be issued and that after compliance the files be consigned to the record room There is nothing to show that the requirements of the Revenue Act of were not strictly complied with They amount to the doing of an act by her by which an additional sharer in the property of the deceased is brought in and is given the right to receive portion of the income of that property which property if the deed were valid belonged mainly to her and her children and if invalid belonged to them to a lesser extent It would appear to their Lordships that the more probable inference to be drawn from this treatment of Sultan <NAME> is that it is but a continuance of the recognition and treatment he received during the life time of the deceased <NAME> rather than an entire departure from the course previously pursued The income arising out of the four ninths share rupees per month and the charges upon it created by the ancestors are put down at rupees and its estimated value at rupees so that there is no beneficial interest whatever in it If she was never fully informed of its purport and contents any election by her to accept the provision made for herself and her children by it in discharge of the unpaid balance of her dower would of course be of no avail As regards the receipt of the rent or income of the property mortgaged it must be borne in mind that <NAME> would have been entitled to an eighth share of it and her sons to their shares of it even if the trust deed had never existed and that she as their guardian would have In the mortgage deed of the th September it is recited that a lease of the <ORG> Russell Street in the city of Calcutta was executed on the th April ten months after the date of the appellant mortgage There is no satisfactory evidence therefore in their Lordships opinion that the trustees ever entered under and by virtue of the trust deed into receipt of the rent or income of the property comprised in the mortgage sued upon and consequently that there is no satisfactory proof that the possession of this portion of the property the subject of the gift was ever delivered by the settlor to the trustees It would appear to their Lordships that a fallacy underlies some of the arguments addressed to them on behalf of the respondents on this point It consists in assuming that the fact even if true that <NAME> was treated by the <NAME> and especially by his family with less care kindness consideration and respect than the sons of the high born ladies to whom the <NAME> had been united by nikkai marriages furnishes proof of <NAME> illegitimacy If he was the illegi timite son of the menial servant there was no reason why the <NAME> should not have turned him adrift The crucial question then is was he the Nawab legitimate son There is no question that the Sultan <NAME> was the son of this woman The third witness <NAME> son of <NAME> of Bengal states that <NAME> was married to <NAME> son of the late King of Oudh that the knew <NAME> that he saw him with his father <NAME> who told the witness that <NAME> was his son by a muta woman and that he saw him once or twice visiting at Murshidabad during <NAME> lifetime He says that one day about fourteen or sixteen years before he gave his evidence he jesting asked <NAME> whence he got this boy <NAME> and he replied that he was his son by an Abyssinian his wife by muta presented to him by his the <NAME> father that he saw <NAME> many times and saw his father treat him as a relation a son or brother and not as a servant They have no interest to induce them to state what they do not believe to be true The criticism passed upon their evidence was first that <NAME> was only introduced to each of them once and therefore their recollection is unreliable as if it was to be expected that a father would naturally introduce a son to a friend as his son more than once and second that they speak to what took place many years ago They profess however to have a clear recollection of the events they depose to and the Subordinate Judge who had the advantage of seeing and hearing them believed them In the memorandum he states that one of his sons by his first marriage having died his three sons one daughter and his wife <NAME> five persons in all are his heirs and he proceeds to declare that besides these he has none and that if any added person comes forward as his heir other than a son or daughter thereafter born to him by his wife <NAME> Begum his claim shall be considered false and unlawful On the whole case therefore their Lordships are of opinion that the decrees appealed from in these consolidated appeals are both erroneous and should be reversed and the decrees of the Subordinate Judge in both should be restored and that both appeals should be allowed with costs here and below and they will humbly advise His Majesty accordingly Such delays as these are discreditable to any judicial system and their Lordships have no reason to think they are not to a large extent avoidable
