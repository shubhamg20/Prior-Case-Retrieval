Most of these rules were issued before the Constitution of India came into force and they were under Section Criminal Thereafter the Constitution Act came into force by which <ORG> were given powers to issue inter alia writs in the nature of habeas corpus by Article and all the rules issued by this Court were treated in the alternative as being rules nisi for the issue of writs of habeas corpus The learned Advocate General accepted this alternative and waived any claim to fresh notice We shall deal first with the question of the legality of the detention of the persons who have been detained by orders passed under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act In the argument urged on behalf of the detenus it was contended inter alia that this Act is not an Act for preventive detention Before going into details we would like to emphasise the powers given to <ORG> by the Constitution Act as regards deciding whether a statute is valid or void In England <ORG> is supreme and it can pass any law however unreasonable it may seem and to whatever extent it may curtail the liberty of the subject They must give effect to the law according to the recognised canons of interpretation of statutes There is no power in the <ORG> to declare the law to be void or invalid In this connection it would not be out of place to refer to certain observations made by Lord <NAME> in the well known case of <NAME> Sir <NAME> A at ALL which has admittedly the force of a statute because there is no suggestion that it is ultra vires or outside the Emergency Powers Defence Act under which it was made is alleged to limit or curtail the liberty of the subject or vest in the executive extraordinary powers of detaining a subject the only question is what is the precise extent of the powers given But in the constitution of this country there are no guaranteed or absolute rights Here we have a written constitution in which certain fundamental rights are guaranteed to its citizens If <ORG> or <ORG> makes any law taking away these fundamental rights except in the manner and to the extent provided in Part III then that law is void to the extent of its inconsistency with the provisions of part in vide Article The legislatures in this country have only those powers of legislation which are bestowed upon them by the Constitution Act Many observations regarding the effect and interpretation of laws passed by <ORG> are coloured by the fact that <ORG> there is supreme and they are not wholly applicable in this country The people of India have given us the power of interpreting the Constitution of India and of deciding whether any piece of legislation is or is not consistent with the provisions laid down in the Constitution of India It specifies seven such rights and says that all citizens shall have these rights We are concerned with the right mentioned in Article that is the right to move freely throughout the territory of India That right is guaranteed to all citizens by Article shall affect the operation of any existing law in so far as it imposes or prevents the <ORG> from making any law imposing reasonable restrictions on the exercise of any of he rights conferred by the said Sub clause either in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any scheduled tribe If Article and Article Clause are read together the meaning which can be deduced is this every citizen shall have the right of moving freely from any part of the territory of India to any other part of such territory but any law already passed before the Constitution Act came into force or to be passed by the <ORG> established by the Constitution may curtail that right provided the curtailment or restrictions it imposes on that right are reasonable and in the interests of the general public Now the question which arises is whether the detention which may be imposed upon a citizen by the Criminal Law Amendment Act amounts to restrictions on the right of free movement guaranteed by Article The learned Advocate General argued that an order passed under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act committing a person to custody in jail is not an order taking away the right to move freely throughout the territory of India which is mentioned in Article This phrase was used also to indicate that the Constitution Act was not giving the citizen any absolute right to move from the Republic of India into some foreign State in other words it was saving passport restrictions Further those words were used to indicate that the Act was not giving a citizen any absolute right to enter the territory of India from outside We are of opinion that if a person is committed to custody in jail his right to move freely throughout the territory of India is being taken away We must therefore see whether the law giving such a right is one which imposes a restriction which is reasonable and which is in the interests of the general public It will now be necessary to reproduce Section Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act which is as follows Where in the opinion of <ORG> there are reasonable grounds for believing that any person i is or was at any time a member of an association of which the objects and methods include the commission of any offence included in Schedule I or the doing of any act with a view to interfere by violence or threat of violence with the administration of justice or ii is being or was at any time instigated or controlled by a member of any such association with a view to the commission or doing of any such offence or act or iii is doing or did at any time any act to assist the operations of any such association <ORG> may by order in writing give all or any of the following directions namely that such person a shall notify his residence and any change of residence to such authority as may be specified is the order shall report himself to the police in such manner a at such periods as may be so specified shall conduct himself in such manner or abstain from such Acts as may be so specified shall reside or remain in any area so specified shall not enter reside in or remain in any area se specified shall be committed to custody in jail and may at any time add to amend vary or rescind any order made under this section Provided that such order shall be reviewed by <ORG> at the end of one year from the date of making of the order and shall not remain in force for more than one year unless upon such review <ORG> directs its continuance We accept the argument of the learned Advocate The words where in the opinion of <ORG> there are reasonable grounds for believing etc and we have no hesitation in following that interpretation <ORG> has to form the opinion that there are reasonable grounds and it is not for the <ORG> to decide whether the grounds are reasonable or not If <ORG> declares that in its opinion there are reasonable grounds for believing etc We thus see that <ORG> is constituted the sole and absolute arbitrator for the decision of the point whether there are reasonable grounds for believing etc Now what is meant by the terms Provincial Government This is the constitutional position as explained to us by the learned Advocate General and we accept his view Next on enquiries made by this Court from the Advocate General he stated that orders of detention under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act were passed in fact not by the Governor nor by any minister nor by the Chief Secretary but by the Deputy Secretary The right to personal liberty given to citizens by the Constitution Act is a fundamental and a precious right and it seems to us that it is not reasonable and not in the interests of the general public to empower an executive officer of the rank of the Deputy Secretary who is not responsible to the <ORG> to take away such a fundamental right in the manner provided in the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act in other words it is neither reasonable nor in the interests of the general public that an executive officer of this kind should be empowered to send a man to custody in jail on an opinion formed by him on grounds which cannot be investigated by anybody Such legislation may be considered to be reasonable and in the interests of the general public having regard to the emergency then prevailing but an Act which is not an emergency measure but merely an addition to the ordinary criminal law cannot be viewed in the same manner when it deprives a citizen of his fundamental right of freedom Next let us consider in further detail the provisions of Section Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act It says that if a person was at any time instigated or if he is being instigated by a member of an association of the description mentioned in the section he may be committed to jail Here again there is no provision that there should be any reasonable It may be said in certain circumstances that it is reasonable to commit the instigator to custody in jail if he is instigating the commission of a crime but it passes our comprehension how it can be reasonable to enact that a person merely because he was instigated is liable to be detained in custody in jail Again if one were to consider all the provisions of the Act one would find that there is no period fixed during which a person may be detained It is true that Section of the Act provides that the order shall be submitted to two Judges with the qualifications described therein in order to obtain their opinion whether or not there is lawful and sufficient cause for such an order but this provision does not place any limitation on <ORG> for the continuance of the order for an indefinite period In the first place there is no time fixed within which the Judges are to give their opinion It is given power to pass such order upon their report as to the <ORG> appears just or proper There is another point of great importance Under Article Sub article Constitution Act it is laid down that no law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless <ORG> consisting of persons having certain judicial qualifications has reported before the expiry of the said three months that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention We shall deal later with the latest order passed by the President of the Republic of India whereby these rights given to the citizens under Article are sought to be whittled down and we shall endeavour to show that this order is of no legal effect They are as follows The Act gives <ORG> that is to say the Deputy Secretary the power to detain persons if he forms a certain opinion and neither the <ORG> nor any other authority is entitled to question the reasonableness or the validity of such opinion The length of that period is left to the sole discretion of the <ORG> that is to say of the Deputy Secretary Although the order of <ORG> is to be submitted for opinion and report to two Judges the <ORG> is not bound in any way to accept that opinion or report The person detained has no right to place his case before these two Judges either in person or by pleader nor is he or any one else given the right to know anything about the proceedings before the Judges or the report furnished by them and The Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act is in direct conflict with the provisions of Article CONSTITUTION OF INDIA Constitution Act The learned Advocate General argued that even if some portions of the Act are considered to be void on the ground that they are inconsistent with the provisions of part III of the Constitution Act the Court should give effect to those portions of the Act which are not in conflict with the Constitution Act in other words he asks us to split up the Act and give effect to such portions of it as are not in conflict with the Constitution Act We are of opinion that this cannot be done having regard to our finding regarding the illegality of certain provisions of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act If a law provides for detention for six months but the Constitution says that no law shall provide for detention for more than three months then that law is not wolly void but can be regarded as a good law as regards detention up to three months In the present case the difficulties ace still greater because the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act has been found by us to be void not merely because it provides for detention for a longer period than is permissible under the Constitution Act but for certain other more fundamental reasons We would refer again to the provisions of Section Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act Section i says that where in the opinion of <ORG> there are reasonable grounds for believing that any person is or was at any time a member of an association with objects and methods etc The orders of <ORG> in all these cases except those which have been passed under the West Bengal Security Ordinance of are in the following form Whereas in the opinion of <ORG> there are reasonable grounds for believing that Sri <NAME> son of late <NAME> of New Shambazar Street Bhupendra Basu Avenue Calcutta i is or was a member of an association of which the objects and methods include the commission of offences included in Schedule to the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act Bengal Act VI of ii is doing or did acts to assist the operations of an association of which the objects and methods include the commission of offences included in Schedule to the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act Bengal Act VI of The Governor in exercise of the powers conferred by Section Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act Bengal Act VI of is pleased to make the following order It is quite clear from this order that the <ORG> has come to no definite conclusion Section so to speak offers the <ORG> a choice of matters on which it is required to form an opinion We would say with great respect that in our opinion this statement in the order does not make sense The only inference from this order is that the <ORG> has formed no opinion at all There is a danger in merely repeating the very words of a section in an order It follows from this that the <ORG> must make up its mind as to the category to which a person it is proposing to detain belongs We hold therefore that the order of <ORG> is not in accordance with the provisions of the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act and that it indicates that the <ORG> has formed no opinion at all In this connection the learned Advocate General drew our attention to the case of King Emperor <NAME> A In that case the Central <ORG> expressed its opinion in the very words of the section which contained certain alternatives The relevant portion of that rule is in the following terms <ORG> or <ORG> if it is satisfied with respect to any particular person that with a view to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the defence of India the public safety the maintenance of public order His Majesty relations with foreign powers or Indian States the maintenance of peaceful conditions in tribal areas or the efficient prosecution of the war it is necessary so to do may make an order a Here <ORG> could detain a particular person with a view to prevent him from doing one or other of several acts In such a case it was held by the Chief Justice that an order which mentioned that the Government was detaining a person with a view to prevent him from doing all or any of those acts was perfectly justifiable The Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act Section does not say that the Government may detain a person with a view to prevent him from doing one or all of several Acts What it says is that if <ORG> is of opinion that a person belongs to one category or another he may be detained We are of opinion therefore that as <ORG> has formed no opinion at all on the matter it had no authority to pass the orders of detention that it has passed and that consequently the orders are bad Nowhere in the Act do we find any expression which indicates that the law is designed for the purpose of preventing a person from doing any thing We have set out the preamble in the earlier part of the judgment and it contains nothing which would indicate that the law is a preventive measure Section of the Act which is the most important section in the Act and which gives powers of detention to <ORG> does not say that these powers are given for the purpose of preventing anything being done It merely lays down that a person may be detained or dealt with in certain other ways if he is or was a member of a certain kind of association or if he is or was being instigated or controlled by a member of a certain kind of association or if he is doing or did at any time any act to assist the operation of such association The same arguments would apply to the provisions contained in Section ii and iii The learned Advocate General drew our attention to a certain passage in Dicey Law of the Constitution Edn IX at page where a certain Irish Act was described as an Act which gave the executive absolute power of arbitrary and preventive arrest We do not think it will serve any useful purpose to discuss this passage of the Irish law referred to Having regard to those provisions we have no hesitation in saying that the law is not a law providing for preventive detention Now if it is not such a law then it is impossible to justify the orders passed in these cases Article Constitution Act says this No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law The order depriving them of such liberty can be upheld Only if it is an order passed according to the procedure established by law No person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed as soon as may be of the grounds for such arrest nor shall he be denied the right to consult and to be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice Every person who Is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest Magistrate within a period of twenty four hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to the Court of the Magistrate and no such person shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a Magistrate It is admitted that in these cases the detenus have not been produced before any Magistrate within twenty four hours of their arrest excluding the time necessary for the journey from the place of arrest to <ORG> We shall now deal with the two cases in which persons have been detained under the West Bengal Security Ordinance The Ordinance in Section provides for the detention of a person for a period not exceeding nine months Under Article Constitution Act it is provided that no law providing for preventive detention shall authorise the detention of a person for a longer period than three months unless <ORG> has reported that there is in its opinion sufficient cause for such detention Section of the said Ordinance deals with several other restrictions on the liberty of the subject In the case of those other restrictions there is no provision whatsoever for any reference being made to a <ORG> Judge On the contrary the provision in Section of the Ordinance empowers the <ORG> in those cases to renew its orders from time to time after the expiry of each period of nine months We hold therefore that the order as passed on the two persons <NAME> and <NAME> under the West Bengal Security Ordinance is void as it is inconsistent with the Constitution Act We shall now deal with the Preventive Detention Extension of Duration Order made by the President of the Indian Republic We are of opinion that it can have no effect so far as the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act and the West Bengal Security Ordinance are concerned and our reasons are as follows The Constitution came into force at midnight on th January In other words he was not President until the Constitution came into force As soon as the Constitution came into force the two abovementioned laws became void by reason of the provisions of Article for the reasons which we have already given The Preventive Detention Extension of Duration Order provides that the maximum period for which a person may be detailed shall be in the case of a person detained immediately before the commencement of the Constitution three months and in the case of persons detained in pursuance of an order made after such commencement for a period of three months from the date of such order If these two provisions could be given effect so far as the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act and the West Bengal Security Ordinance are concerned then some at least of the reasons given for declaring these measures void would disappear but we find that there is an insuperable difficulty to apply the Preventive Detention Extension of Duration Order to the above mentioned two Acts The learned Chief Justice says this In my judgment no such order made by him under Clause could in any way prevent an Act becoming void under Article and this for two reasons The first and primary reason is that under Article quite clearly provisions become void if they become void at all directly and instantaneously with the Constitution coming into force whereas an order by the President can only originate and become valid after the Constitution has come into force There can be no such order of the President except as a consequence of the Constitution having come into force and given him power to make it The Constitution came into force on the midnight of th and the Act if it became void at all became void then But the President did not enter upon his office until he took the oath on th at A As to these propositions there can be no question Article of the Constitution provides that certain Articles with none of which we are concerned shall come into force at once and the remaining provisions shall come into force on th January Article makes the General Clauses Act applicable and the General Clauses Act provides in Section that where an Act is to come into force on a certain day it shall come into force at midnight of the preceding day Parliament may by law prescribe a the circumstances under which and the class or classes of cases in which a person may be detained for a period longer than three months under any law providing for preventive detention without obtaining the opinion of <ORG> in accordance with the provisions of Sub clause a of Clause the maximum period for which any person may in any class or classes of cases be detained under any law providing for preventive detention Next Clause of Sub article of Article says that the <ORG> may prescribe the maximum period for which any person in any class or classes of cases may be detained under any law providing for preventive detention Rule of the aforesaid order would have the effect of fixing various periods Having regard to all these circumstances we must hold that the detention of the petitioners in all these cases is illegal and we direct that they be set at liberty forthwith Any <ORG> Tribunal or authority required or empowered to enforce any law in force in the territory of India immediately before the appointed day shall notwithstanding that this order makes no provision or insufficient provision for the adaptation of the law for the purpose of bringing it into accord with the provisions of the Constitution construe the law with all such adaptations as are necessary for the said purpose Provided that if any question arises regarding the adaptations with which such law should be construed for the said purpose the question shall be referred to <ORG> if the law relates to a matter enumerated In List I or List III in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and to <ORG> concerned in any other case and the decision of that Government on any such reference shall be final Although the learned Advocate General wanted an appointment to make his submissions on the rule when questioned by us he stated that he had nothing to say on it We are quite unaware of any provision of law or any principle or practice regarding legislation which would justify any legislature to direct a <ORG> regarding the manner in which it has to construe the law It has to decide the meaning which a law bears No <ORG> can submit to an order from any authority directing it to construe a law in a particular manner Such an order will be contrary to all principles and will result in making the <ORG> a mere tool of the legislature or other authority which makes such an order He is to adapt or modify and he has no authority to ask the <ORG> to do something which he alone is expressly empowered to do Article Constitution Act states that notwithstanding the repeals by this Constitution of the enactments referred to in Article and subject to the other provisions of this Constitution all laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of the Constitution shall continue in force until altered or repealed or amended by a competent <ORG> or other competent authority Article says that all laws in force in the territory of India immediately before the commencement of the Constitution shall continue to be in force but there is a necessary and important provision in the Article which cannot be lost sight of They became therefore void from midnight of th January when the Constitution came into force That being so we are of opinion that even the President or the <ORG> cannot make any adaptations or modifications of those laws in order to bring them in accord with the provisions of this Constitution The proviso says that if the <ORG> makes any such adaptation as is contemplated in the first part of the rule if the adapted law relates to matters enumerated in List I or List III in Schedule to the Constitution it shall be subject to adjudication by the State <ORG> concerned In our opinion we would be false to our oath if we gave effect to this Adaptation of Laws Order even though this Order may have emanated from the President of <ORG> our respect for whom is no less than that of anybody else The Advocate General has next brought to our notice a new Act called the Preventive Detention Act passed by <ORG> on th February and he says that the orders for detention under the Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Act and the West Bengal Security Ordinance have been cancelled but that the detentions have been continued under the Preventive Detention Act
