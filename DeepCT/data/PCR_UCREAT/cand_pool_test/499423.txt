The work charged employees daily wagers casual labour and those employed in temporary time bound projects also approached the High <ORG> for regularisation of their services Accepting the pleas of the petitioners the High <ORG> gave certain directions to the appellant <ORG>s for regularisation of these employees Aggrieved by the High <ORG> orders the two appellant <ORG>s filed appeals before this <ORG> Some of the employees also filed Writ Petitions before this <ORG> directly contending that they too were governed by the directions given by the High <ORG> and that they should be given the benefit of the same On behalf of the appellants the validity and correctness of the directions given by the High <ORG> were questioned on the grounds that the High <ORG> had exceeded its jurisdiction in virtually amending the <ORG> orders and was not justified in holding that the fixation of a particular date in the respective <ORG> orders was arbitrary and or that it was unrelated to the object sought to be achieved that the High <ORG> also erred in holding that the requirement of having been sponsored by <ORG> was invalid that the High <ORG> was not justified in directing that all persons who had put in one year service should be regularised unconditionally and that such a direction would given rise to several difficulties and complications for the administration that there could be a direction for regularisation without a post or a vacancy and the <ORG> could not be directed to create posts without number and it was beyond the capacity of any <ORG> to comply with such directions that the direction with respect to work charged establishment casual labour and daily wagers equally unsustainable in law that the rule prescribing minimum qualifying service of one year in one <ORG> could not be thrust upon the other <ORG> that because of the directions in question while regularly selected persons would be kept out of jobs unqualified ineligible persons who had come through back door and whose records of service might also not be satisfactory would be regularised at one go and the rule of reservation would also be violated and that it was the prerogative of the <ORG> to create and abolish posts and that the <ORG> could not be compelled to create posts where there was no need for such posts or where the need is no longer there It was contended on behalf of the respondents and the writ petitioners that the directions had been given with a view to curb the arbitrariness of the authorities and with a view to give a satisfactory solution to a human problem created by the policies of the <ORG>s themselves that the work charged employees should be treated on par with ad hoc employees and ought to be regularised on the st of April of each year and all those persons who where working in the permanent posts ought to be regularised It is the <ORG> again that lays down the conditions of service subject of course to a law made by the appropriate legislature This power to prescribe the conditions of service can be exercised either by making Rules under the proviso to Article of the Constitution or in the absence of such Rules by issuing Rules Instructions in exercise of its executive power The court comes into the picture only to ensure observance of fundamental rights statutory provisions Rules and other instructions if any governing the conditions of service It also means that the <ORG> should not exploit its employees nor should it seek to take advantage of the helplessness and misery of either the unemployed persons or the employees as the case may be It is for this reason it is held that equal pay must be given for equal work which is indeed one of the directive principles of the Constitution and that a person should not be kept in a temporary or ad hoc status for long A Where a temporary or ad hoc appointment is continued for long the court presumes that there is need and warrant for a regular post and accordingly directs regularisation A In the instant case apart from the fact that the High <ORG> was not right in holding that the several conditions imposed by the two <ORG>s in their respective orders relating to regularisation were arbitrary not valid and justified it acted rather hastily in directing wholesome regularisation of all such persons who have put in one year service and that too unconditionally Therefore there is need for fulled consideration and due circumspection while giving such directions In the circumstances therefore there was nothing wrong in prescribing a particular date by which the specified period of service whether it is one year or two years ought to have been put in Firstly it excludes Class III posts of clerks from the purview of the <ORG> in case of those who have completed a minimum of two years of service as on th September and secondly it provides for their regularisation subject to certain conditions In the circumstances there is no basis for holding that fixation of the date can be held to be arbitrary in the facts and circumstances of the case They are two different <ORG>s having their own <ORG>s merely because one <ORG> chooses to say that one year temporary ad hoc service is enough for regularisation it cannot be said that the other <ORG> must also prescribe the very same period or that it cannot prescribe a longer or shorter period It in effect means that every ad hoc temporary employee who has been continued for one year should be regularised even though a no vacancy is available for him which means creation of a vacancy he was not sponsored by <ORG> nor was he appointed in pursuance of a notification calling for applications which means he had entered by a back door he was not eligible and or qualified for the post at the time of his appointment and his record of service since his appointment is not satisfactory Moreover from the mere continuation of an ad hoc employee for one year it cannot be presumed that there is need for a regular post In view of the orders issued on th March and th April by one of the <ORG>s the direction given by the High <ORG> becomes unnecessary The direction regarding persons belonging to the above categories and who fall within the definition of workmen the terms in which the direction has been given cannot be sustained While it is true that persons belonging to these categories continuing over a number of years have a right to claim regularisation and the authorities are under an obligation to consider their case for regularisation in a fair manner keeping in view the prin ciples enunciated by this <ORG> the blanket direction given cannot be sustained In such a case there is no occasion for the court to issue any directions for regularising such employees more particularly when none of the conditions prescribed in the said orders can be said to be either unreasonable arbitrary or discriminatory So far as the work charged employees and casual labour are concerned the effort must be to regularise them as far as possible and as early as possible subject to their fulfilling the qualification if any prescribed for the post and subject also to availability of work If a casual labourer is continued for a fairly long spell say two or three years a presumption may arise that there is regular need for his services Each <ORG> or authority has to devise its own criteria or principles for regularisation having regard to all the relevant circumstances but while doing so it should bear in mind the observations made herein They were initially appointed for a period of six months or so but were continued for years together under orders passed from time to time For a period of years it is stated there was no <ORG> in existence in the State The orders are issued by <ORG> are the following No Date of issue Substance of Order Regularisation of all Class III ad hoc employees who have completed two years service on Regularisation of ad hoc Clerks in Class III who have completed two years service on Regularisation of Class III ad hoc employees who have completed two years of service on Regularisation of all Class III ad hoc employees other than teachers working against posts which have been taken out of the purview of the <ORG> and who have completed two years service on In pursuance of the above orders a number of persons who satisfied the conditions prescribed in each of those orders were regularised but many could not be It is this category of people who approached <ORG> and Haryana praying for issuance of Writ Order of Direction for regularisation of their service The order of <ORG> dated st January prescribed the following conditions for regularisation He must have put in a minimum service to two years on He must have been recruited through <ORG> <ORG> held there is no magic in fixing a date by which an employee was to complete the prescribed tenure of service for regularisation fixing of a date has no reasonable basis or intelligible differentia for the object to achieve following that view the view taken by this Court in <NAME> we hold that the dates fixed for the policies of regularisation of the two Governments are discriminatory we hold that the various dates fixed from time to time in their regularisation policies are hit by Articles and of the Constitution of India The basic policy decision is that ad hoc employees who have worked for quite some time and have gained experience should be regularised and in case they are shunted out hardship would be caused in numerous ways we find no justification in the policy of regularisation that the candidates sponsored through <ORG> alone would be entitled to regularisation VALIDITY OF THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE CON CERNED POSTS SHOULD NOT BE WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF <ORG> held that inasmuch as most of the Class III and Class IV posts were kept out of the purview of the in the State of Haryana during the period to March and also because for a period of ten years there was no in existence in this State imposition of this condition by <ORG> is unreasonable and arbitrary However the concerned departments would pass orders for their regularisation and they would be entitled to all benefits of service from the date of their initial appointments In case of those who have completed more than one year of service their services shall not be terminated till the new policy for regularisation in accordance with our judgment is framed in which a direction has been issued to re frame the policy for regularisation on completion of more than one year of service and without the condition which may hamper the policy of regularisation irrespective of the fact whether or not their names were sponsored by <ORG> or that their posts are within or outside the purview of the <ORG> In case such petitioners complete two years then on completion of two years they will be considered as regular members of service and appropriate orders for their regularisation will be passed by the concerned departments and such employees would be entitled to all service benefits from the date of their initial appointments On regularisation they would be entitled to all service benefits from the date of initial appointments As regards work charged employees who have completed five years of service they shall be considered to be regular employees under the scheme of regularisation framed by the <ORG> of Punjab and order for their regularisation shall be passed However they would be entitled to all service benefits from the date of initial appointments The persons falling in group III are those who come within the definition of workmen under the Act On regularisation they would be entitled to the benefits of provisions of the Act as also the Service Rules from the date of their initial appointments as applicable to the departments concerned from time to time The ad hoc temporary employees in temporary organisations like the <ORG> and <ORG> covered by Group IV who have continued in service for more than one year with national breaks would be entitled to the benefits of service and benefit of the directions issued by <ORG> in <NAME> case supra and the service of none of them would be terminated except on abandonment of the scheme In case services of an employee who come within the ambit of Groups I to III have already been terminated on the completion of his more than one year of service he shall have to be taken back in service in case of a request being made by him to the concerned department of the government before the expiry of three years and two months of such termination In case some posts are abolished or some persons are found surplus junior most would be out on the rule of Last come first go But if later on vacancies arise or posts are created they will have to be called back first in the order of seniority that is on the rule of last go first come and if still some vacancies remain new incumbents through <ORG> may be accommodated The learned counsel for the <ORG> was asked to point out if the claim made by the petitioners for equal pay for equal work as being paid to their counterparts in view of the decision taken by <ORG> in various cases was not justified It is again made clear that till regularisation policies are framed as directed by us and regularisation orders are passed the employees shall continue and their services shall not be terminated The respondents in these appeals and such writ petitioners are supporting the judgment and directions aforesaid The Government cannot be compelled to create posts where there is no need for such posts or where the need is no longer there On the other hand it is contended by the counsel for the respondents and the counsel for the writ petitioners that the directions given are perfectly warranted in all the circumstances of the case and have been given following the decisions of this court He submitted that the work charge employees are employees of the work charge establishment and so long as once or the other work is there they should be continued Other counsel appearing for the respondents in the appeals and for the writ petitioners supported these contentions It is the <ORG> again that lays down the conditions of service subject of course to a law made the appropriate legislature The court comes into the picture only to ensure observance of fundamental rights statutory provisions <ORG> and other instructions if any governing the conditions of service It also means that the <ORG> should not exploit its employees nor should it seek to take advantage of the helplessness and misery of either the unemployed persons or the employees as the case may be Where a temporary or ad hoc appointment is continued for long the court presumes that there is need and warrant for a regular post and accordingly directs regularisation It was contended that the very fact that they are continued over such a long period is itself proof of the fact that there is regular need for such employment From amongst the casual and daily rated employees who have completed ten years of service by December shall immediately be regularised with effect from January on the basis of seniority cum suitability The remaining monthly rated employees covered by the paragraph who have completed ten years of service as on December shall be regularised before December in a phased manner on the basis of seniority cum suitability suitability being understood in the same way as above There was a direction that the claims on other heads would be considered at the time of final disposal We have come to the conclusion that apart from these reliefs no other would be admissible At the same time clause of the Rule provided that persons so appointed may be regularised provided they completed two years continuous service on Construing the said clause in the light of the constitutional philosophy this court held Therefore if we interpret Rule a i consistently with the spirit and philsophy of the Constitution which it is permissible to do without doing violence to the said rule it follows that employees who are serving on the establishment for long spells and have the requisite qualifications for the job should not be thrown out but their services should be regularised as far as possible If they are found fit they will be placed on the list along with the newly recruited candidates in the order of their respective merits As would be evident from the observations made and directions given in the above two cases the court must while giving such directions act with due care and caution Now take the directions given in the judgment under appeal Apart from the fact <ORG> was not right as we shall presently demonstrate in holding that the several conditions imposed by the two Governments in their respective order relating to regularisation are arbitrary not valid and justified the high Court acted rather hastily in directing wholesome regularisation of all such persons who have put in one year service and that too unconditionally He may go on deputation he may go on Faculty Improvement Programme I or he may be suspended pending enquiry into charges against him and so on In the circumstances therefore there was nothing wrong in prescribing a particular date by which the specified period of service whether it is one year or two years ought to have been put in Firstly it excludes class III posts of clerks from the purview of the <ORG> in case of those who have completed a minimum of two years of service as on th September and secondly it provides for their regularisation subject to certain conditions The validity of the said ordinance was questioned on the ground that the fixation of the date th day of June was arbitrary and has been chosen only because that was the date on which internal emergency was proclaimed It was observed that there was no evidence to show any attempt on the part of the <ORG> to separate or penalise pre emergency appointees or for that matter any particular class of oppointees The decision relied upon by <ORG> does not say that even without such a certificate from <ORG> an appointment can be made or that such appointment should be consistent with the mandate of Articles and They are two different States having their own Governments merely because one Government chooses to say that one year temporary or ad hoc service is enough for regularisation it cannot be said that the other state must also prescribe the very same period or that it cannot prescribe a longer or shorter period The fact that there is a single <ORG> for both the States and the Union Territory of Chandigarh is no ground for saying that the orders issued by them should be uniform The learned Judges have pointed out that for a period of years there was no such Board functioning and further that from the year to most of the class III and IV posts with which we are concerned were kept out of the purview of the The correctness of the said factual statement is not questioned before us Moreover from the mere continuation of an adhoc employee for one year it cannot be presumed that there is need for a regular post Be that as it may so far as the State of Haryana is concerned this contention has become of academic interest in view of the orders issued on th March and th April which we shall presently notice Though the State of Punjab has not issued any such orders it appears from the the affidavit filed on its behalf sworn to by <NAME> Deputy Secretary to the Government <ORG> dated that a scheme of regularisation of these employees has been prepared in pursuance of the impugned judgement In so far as the persons belonging to the above categories and who fall within the definition of Workmen are concerned the terms in which the direction has been given by <ORG> cannot be sustained While we agree that persons belonging to these categories continuing over a number of years have a right to claim regularisation and the authorities are under an obligation to consider their case for regularisation in a fair manner keeping in view the principles enunciated by this court the blanket direction given cannot be sustained We shall presently notice the contents of the said letter Accordingly there shall be a direction to <ORG> to verify the vacancy position in the categories of daily wagers and casual labour and frame a scheme of absorption in a fair and just manner providing for regularisation of these persons having regard to their length of service and other relevant conditions In any event the direction given by <ORG> with respect to this category has not been assailed before us We may also point out that after the filing of the writ petitions and during the pendency of the Special Leave Petitions in this court <ORG> has issued certain further orders to which reference may now be made We have no reason to believe that the said orders will not be given effect to in full The letter says that no adhoc appointment shall be made in future on any posts unless a proper requisition has been sent to <ORG> <ORG> Such appointment even if made shall not last beyond nine months and will be subject to a regular appointment being made by iii In pursuance of the interim orders passed by this court in this batch recording the undertaking given by the counsel for the State of Haryana to frame a scheme for absorption <ORG> did frame of such a scheme contained in the Chief Secretary letter dated addressed to all the Heads of Department After careful consideration it has been decided that the Regularisation of these employees shall be on the following terms and conditions Category I Adhoc employees i Only such adhoc class III employees who have completed two years service on shall be regularized to the extent of available regular posts vacancies on that date issued vide No GSI dated shall be followed for making up the shortfall it felt necessary and they would be entitled to all other allowances and benefits available to regular <ORG> ii The casual of daily rated employees who have completed years or more of service on shall be regularized on the basis of seniority cum suitability iv In the case of those who are required to be continued in service the same terms and conditions will be applicable as in sub paras i ii above on completion of years and years service respectively In exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to article of the Constitution of India read with the proviso to clause of Haryana Government General Administration Department General Services notification No GSI dated the th January the Governor of Haryana hereby specifies such Class III posts as have been held for a minimum period of two years on the st December by Class III employees on ad hoc basis to be taken out of the perview of <ORG> Haryana and their services shall be regularised if they fulfill the following conditions namely i that the employees have completed two years services on st December and were in service on st December iv that they have been found medically fit for entry into Government service and that their character and antecedents have also been duly verified and found suitable for Government service that a regular post vacancy is available for regularisation vi that they have been found fit for regularisation by <ORG> constituted in accordance with the instructions contained in Government circular letter No IGE dated vii The seniority of the adhoc temporarily appointed class III employees so regularized vis a vis class III employees appointed on regular basis shall be determined The inter se seniority of such adhoc temporarily appointed class III employees shall be determined in accordance with the date of their joining the post on adhoc temporary basis If the date of joining of the direct recruit and the date of regularisation of adhoc temporarily appointed employee is the same the direct recruit shall be senior The cases of such adhoc temporarily appointed employees who have already completed three years service on st December and have satisfactory record of service but who do not fulfill the prescribed conditions with regard to qualifications age or mode of their initial recruitment will also be considered for regularisation in relaxation of these conditions if the Departmental Service Rules applicable to these employees provide for relaxation of these conditions of recruitment In such a case there is no occasion for the court to issue any directions for regularising such employees more particularly when none of the conditions prescribed in the said orders can be said to be either unreasonable arbitrary or discriminatory In case of such persons we can only observe that it is for the respective Governments to consider the feasibility of giving them appropriate relief particularly in cases where persons have been continuing over a long number of years and were eligible and qualified on the date of their adhoc appointment and further whose record of service is satisfactory So far as the work charged employees and casual labour are concerned the effort must be to regularise them as far as possible and as early as possible subject to their fulfilling the qualifications if any prescribed for the post and subject also to availability of work If a casual labourer is continued for a fairly long spell say two or three years a presumption may arise that there is regular need for his services Each Government or authority has to devise its own criteria or principles for regularisation having regard to all the relevant circumstances but while doing so it should bear in mind the observations made herein Even so it is but appropriate that they adopt as far as possible keeping the exigencies and requirements of their administration in view the criteria and principles underlying the orders issued by their Government in the matter of regularisation and pass appropriate orders For the above reasons all the appeals are allowed and the orders under appeal are set aside The directions given by <ORG> in the judgment in No namely direction Nos and are set aside
