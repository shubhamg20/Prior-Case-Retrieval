PETITIONER <ORG> Vs RESPONDENT <ORG> DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> VENKATACHALLIAH CJ CITATION AIR SCC JT SCALE ACT HEADNOTE JUDGMENT The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Leave granted The first respondent deposited with the appellant the documents of title relating to its landed property at Industrial Development Area Nacharam Tehsil District Hyderabad presently Rangareddy District with an intention to create an equitable mortgage of immoveable property covered by those documents together with all structures and buildings thereon The appellant filed Company Application No of in the aforesaid company petition under Section of the Companies Act hereinafter referred to as the Act In opposition to this Mr <NAME> learned counsel would urge that it is true that the secured creditor stands outside the winding up proceedings Under subsection of Section of the Act the winding up court has the power to transfer before it all proceedings pending against the company at different places because it is convenient for the winding up of the company affairs expeditiously that all the suits are transferred to the winding up court In order to appreciate these rival contentions we will briefly set out the scope of Section An even handed justice requires that the <ORG> should have power to intervene at an early stage for the protection of the assets and this power is given by this section In granting leave under this section the court always takes into consideration whether the company is likely to be exposed to unnecessary litigation and cost The secured creditor is thus outside the winding up and can realise his security without the leave of the winding up <ORG> though if he files a suit or takes other legal proceedings for the realisation of his security he is bound under Section corresponding with Section Indian Companies Act to obtain the leave of the winding up <ORG> before he can do so although such leave would almost automatically be granted The corresponding provisions of the Indian Companies Act have been almost bodily incorporated from those of the English Companies Act and if there was nothing more the position of the secured creditor here also would be the same as that obtaining in England and he would also be outside the winding up and a sale by him without the intervention of the <ORG> would be valid and could not be challenged as void under Section Indian Companies Act On the scope of Section of the Act this Court had occasion to observe in Sudasan Chits Ltd at page in paragraph Sub section of Section confers jurisdiction on the <ORG> which is winding up the company to entertain and dispose of proceedings set out in clauses a to The expression <ORG> which is winding up the company will comprehend the court before which a winding up petition is pending or which has made an order for winding up of the company and further winding up proceedings are continued under its directions Undoubtedly looking to the language of Section and and its setting in Part VII which deals with winding up proceedings would clearly show that the jurisdiction of the <ORG> to entertain and dispose of proceedings set out in sub clauses a to of sub section can be invoked in the <ORG> which is winding up the company
