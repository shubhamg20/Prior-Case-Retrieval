The Subordinate Judge awarded the claim but his decision has been reversed by the Assistant Judge on the following grounds that <ORG> have no jurisdiction to entertain the first part of the claim that the grant of a declaratory decree would be opposed to Section of the Specific Relief Act as certain further relief was not asked for and because the Subordinate Judge had mistaken the nature of the claim to the land the suit not having been one for partition and the evidence being insufficient to establish the plaintiffs title This last decision we think governs the present case in which there is no question as to the right of either the plaintiffs or the defendants to recover the offerings from the worshippers it being apparently admitted that the person performing the service the fight to the fees As to the third objection we think that the Subordinate Judge decision as to the land is not open to the comment that it is based on theoretical considerations or on inferences raised as to the most scientific boundary and that it ought not to have been reversed on that ground Costs to abide the result
