The notification dated December issued under was as follows In partial modification of notifications No ST dated March and ST dated January and in exercise of the powers conferred by clause of sub section of section of the Sales Tax Act Act No XV of as amended up to date the Governor of Uttar Pradesh is pleased to order that no tax shall be payable under the aforesaid Act with effect from December by the dealers in respect of the following classes of goods provided that the Additional Central Excise Duties leviable thereon from the closing of business on December have been paid on such goods and that the dealers thereof furnish proof to the satisfaction of the assessing authority that such duties have been paid This position was not accepted by the <ORG> who passed the following order on December The exemption envisaged in this notification applies to dealers in respect of sales of biris provided that the additional Central Excise duties leviable thereon from the closing of business on Before <ORG> which heard the matter a preliminary objection was raised against the maintainability of the petition and the correctness of the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> A I relied upon by the petitioner was challenged Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires open to challenge as repugnant to Art Per <NAME> The right to move this <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of fundamental rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution is itself a guaranteed fundamental right and this <ORG> is not trammeled by procedural technicalities in making an order or issuing a writ for the enforcement of such rights Where however a quasi judicial authority makes an order in the undoubted exercise of its jurisdiction in pursuance of a provision of law which is intra vires an error of law or fact committed by that authority cannot be impeached otherwise than on appeal unless the erroneous determination relates to a matter on which the jurisdiction of that body depends In such a case the characteristic attribute of a judicial act or decision is that it binds whether right or wrong and no question of the enforcement of a fundamental right can arise on an application under Art Therefore an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires and in the undoubted exercise of its jurisdiction cannot be challenged on the sole ground that it is passed on a misconstruction of a provision of the Act or of a notification issued thereunder If the <ORG> acting quasi judicially miscons trued the notification which it had jurisdiction to construe and imposed a tax there could be no infringement of Art confers a wide jurisdiction on this <ORG> to enforce the fundamental rights that the right to enforce a fundamental right is itself a fundamental right and that it is the duty of this <ORG> to entertain an application and to decide it on merits whenever a party approaches it irrespective of whether the question raised involves a question of jurisdiction Law or fact Though the <ORG> can make a law imposing reasonable restrictions on a fundamental right in the interest of the public the Constitution does not empower the <ORG> to make an order of an executive authority final so as to deprive the Supreme <ORG> of its jurisdiction under Art The principles and procedure evolved by the courts in England in regard to the issue of prerogative writs cannot circumscribe the wide power of the Supreme <ORG> to issue orders and directions for the enforcement of fundamental rights ever may be the stage at which this <ORG> is approached this <ORG> may in is discretion if the question involved is one of jurisdiction or a construction of a provision decide the question and enforce the right without waiting till the procedure prescribed by a law is exhausted but if it finds that questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law are involved it may give an opportunity Per <NAME> Article contains a guaranteed right to move the Supreme <ORG> for enforcement of fundamental rights and any person whose fundamental rights have been invaded has a guaranteed right to seek relief from the <ORG> without having to seek to enforce his remedies elsewhere first This is based upon the well accepted rule that a court having jurisdiction may decide wrongly as well as rightly If there is an error not involving jurisdiction that error can be corrected by the ordinary means of appeals and revisions including an appeal by special leave to the Supreme <ORG> This would constitute another category besides the three others in respect of which violation of such rights was not in doubt namely where the statute itself was invalid or unconstitutional where the authority exceeded its jurisdiction under the Act and where it contravened mandatory procedure prescribed by the statute or violated the principles of natural justice Since in the instant case the construction put upon the notification by the <ORG> was reasonable possible it was a case of mere error of law and not a patent error or an error apparent on the face of the record which could justify the issue of a writ of certiorari or was ultra vires the Constitution or where it was subordinate legislation it was ultra vires the law under which it was made or inconsistent with any other law in force A Similar question would arise if the tax was assessed by an authority other than the one empowered to do so under the taxing law or in violation of the procedure prescribed by law or in colourable exercise of the powers conferred by the law It stood till it was corrected in the appropriate manner and if such a decision a person was held liable to pay tax he could not treat it as a nullity and contend that it was not authorised by law the matter was referred to the Chief Justice under A of the On November the sales Tax fficer Allahabad sent a notice to the petitioners firm for assessment of tax on the sale of biris during the period April to June and on the date of enquiry which was held on December the petitioner filed a petition stating that by reason of the exemption granted under the notification No ST dated By his order dated December the Sale Tax fficer rejected this contention Against this order there was an appeal Appeal No of to the Courts of the Judge Appeals <ORG> Allahabad who by his order dated May dismissed the same on the ground that the exemption from sale tax under the notification related to such classes of goods only on which the Additional Central Excise Duty was leviable Under of the Act a person aggrieved by an order in appeal might take it up on revision before <ORG> and under the assessee has a right to require that any question of law arising out of the order of assessment be referred to the opinion of <ORG> That was dismissed on January by the learned Judges on the ground that as the assessee could contest the validity of the order in appropriate proceedings under the Act and as in fact an appeal had been filed there was no ground for exercising the extraordinary jurisdiction under Art It is alleged in the petition that the imposition and levy of tax aforesaid amounts to the infringement of the fundamental rights of the Petitioner to carry on trade and business guaranteed by Art The prayer in the petition is that this <ORG> might be pleased to issue a a writ of certiorari or other order in the nature of certiorari quashing the order of the Sales Tax Officer Allahabad dated th December a writ of Mandamus directing the opposite parties not to realise any sales tax from the petitioner on the basis of the said order dated th December To this the answer of the respondents is that the Sales Tax fficer had correctly construed the notification in limiting the exemption to goods on which additional excise duty had been paid The respondents further raise a preliminary objection to the maintainability of this petition on the ground that laws of taxation which are protected by Art fall outside the purview of Part III of the Constitution and are not open to attack as infring ing fundamental rights guaranteed therein and that even if they are subject to the restrictions in Part III an order of assessment made by a tribunal acting judicially under a statute which is intra vires such as the impugned order dated December does not infringe Art On these contentions the points that arise for decision are whether taxation laws are subject to the limitations imposed by Part III whether the order of assessment dated December is in contravention of Art which enacts that no tax shall be levied or collected except by authority of law that when there is a law authorising the imposition of tax and that does not contravene any of the inhibitions in Part XII then the levy thereunder cannot be attacked as infringing any of the fundamental rights declared in Part III There was no similar provision in the corresponding chapter of the Government of India Act then there was no point in making a separate provision again as has been made in article Our Constitution evidently has also treated taxa tion as distinct from compulsory do question of property and has made independent provision giving protection against taxation save by authority of law In our opinion the protection against imposition and collection of taxes save by authority of law directly comes from article and is not secured by clause of Article All that we wish to state is that this application in so far as it purports to be founded on article read with article to this court is misconceived and must fail In repelling this contention the <ORG> observed Article imposes a limitation on the taxing It has to be done by authority of law which must mean valid law In order that the law May be valid the tax proposed to be levied must be within the legislative competence of the <ORG> imposing a tax and authorising the collection thereof and secondly the tax must be subject to the conditions laid down in Art is that the legislature shall not make any law which takes away or acrid ages the equality clause in Art it cannot be disputed that if the Act infringes the provisions of Art There are observations in the above decisions which might be read as meaning that taxation laws are altogether outside the operation of Part Ill But in the context they have reference to the application of Art and that therefore if it contravened Art This decision is clearly an authority for the position that laws of taxation must also pass the test of the limitations prescribed in Part III of the Constitution But it is not an authority for the position that all the provisions contained in Part III are necessarily applicable to those laws In this view the question that arises for decision is whether Art Article enacts that all citizens have the right to practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business Is a law imposing a tax on sale by a dealer an infringement of his right to carry on trade we must assume for the purpose of the presents discussion that the sales tax statute in question is within the competence of the legislature and is not ultra vires Where a law is passed by a legislature which has no competence to enact it as when <ORG> imposes what is in substance a tax on income a subject which is within the exclusive competence of the Centre under Entry that legislation has no existence in the eye of law and any levy of tax under the provisions of that law Will not be within the protection afforded by Art They all of them enact that the citizen shall have the right to hold property or to carry on business without interference by the <ORG> from parts of one law which has for its object the definition of the fundamental right of a citizen to carry on business Article declared that rights and Art The two provisions together make up the whole of the fundamental right to carry on business Likewise land tax must be held to be a restriction on the right of a citizen to hold property guaranteed by Art is unreasonable What are the materials on which the matter could be decided and what are the criteria on which the decision thereon could be reached It would therefore seem that the reasonableness of taxation laws is not a matter which is justiciable and therefore they could not fall within the purview of Arts We may now refer to the decisions of this Court where the question of applicability of Art In rejecting this contention this Court held that Explanation II to section of the Act having been declared ultra vires any imposition of sales tax on the appellant in Madhya Pradesh is without the authority of law and that being so a threat by the State by using the coercive machinery of the impugned Act to realitise it from the appellant is a sufficient infringement of his fundamental right under Art it was clearly entitled to relief under Art Thai application was dismissed by <ORG> on the ground that if <ORG> made an assessment which was erroneous the assessee could challenge it by way of appeal or revision under ss of the Act and that as There was an appeal against this The remedy under the Act cannot be said to be adequate and is indeed nugatory or useless if the Act which provides for such remedy is itself ultra vires and void and the principle relied upon can therefore have no application where a party comes to <ORG> with an allegation that his right has been or is being threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it and as such void and prays for appropriate relief under article It will be seen that in this case the question arose with reference to a provision in the taxing statute which was ultra vires and the decision was only that any action taken under such a provision was without the authority of law and was therefore an unconstitutional interference with the right to carry on business under Art There is nothing in these two decisions which lends any support to the contention that where the provision of law under which assessment is made is intra vires the order is liable to be impugned as contravening Art Sales Tax Act and that thereby the right of the petitioner to carry on business under Art since his right to carry on a trade is violated or infringed by the imposition and such being the case Art There is a fundamental distinction between an order of assessment made on a provi But this ground did not exist in <NAME> owe and that makes all the difference in the legal position The decision in <NAME> case which merely purported to follow The <ORG> owe is open to the criticism that it has overlooked this distinction We may now refer to two decision subsequent to the one in <NAME> case which have been relied on by the petitioner The petitioner then moved this Court under Art for an order quashing the order of assessment A preliminary objection to the maintainability of the petition was taken on behalf of the respondent <ORG> on the ground that under the Act the petitioner could file an appeal against the order of assessment and that proceedings under Art It is not necessary for purposes of this case to decide whether the principle of <NAME> case is inconsistent with the view expressed by this court in <NAME> Case The learned Judges then proceeded to hold that as there was under the Act a single liability and that had been discharged proceedings for the assessment of the same sales a second time to tax infringed the fundamental right of the petitioner to hold property It is contended that the decision in <NAME> case requires reconsideration It is clear from the above observations that the learned Judges were of the opinion that the decision in <NAME> case required reconsideration In the present cage there is no contention that the proceedings of the <ORG> officer are without jurisdiction for quashing the proceedings on the ground that they were without jurisdiction and it was held that as the taxing authority had no power under the statute to issue the notice in question the proceedings must be quashed This gain is a case in which the authority had no jurisdiction under the Act to take proceedings for assessment of tax and it makes no difference that such assumption of jurisdiction was based on a misconstruction of statutory provisions and are the same we should have to examine the ground on which this decision rests It lays down detailed procedure as was not one which had any reference to the merits of the assessment but to the procedure laid down for imposing tax It was observed in the latter case It is firmly established that a merely erroneous decision given by a State court in the regular course of judicial proceedings does not deprive the unsuccessful party of property without due process of law Where assessment proceedings are taken without the authority of law or where the proceedings are repugnant to rules of natural justice there is an infringement of the right guaranteed under Art Now the question is when a law is enacted by a competent legislature and it is not cnoonstitutional as contravening any prohibition in the Constitution such as Art and went proceeding for assessment of tax are taken thereunder in the manner provided therein and there is no violation of rules of natural justice does Art There is another objection taken to the maintainability of this petition Part III is infringed a right to move this <ORG> for appropriate write for obtaining redress of the petitioner is that the order of assessment dated December amounts to interference with the right of the firm to carry on business and is therefore in contravention of Art The constitutional provisions bearing on this question are Arts Article a defines law as follows law includes any rdinance order byelaw rule regulation notification custom or usage having in the territory of India the force of law Article enacts that the citizen shall have the seven rights mentioned therein and Arts to save laws whether existing or to be made which impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of those rights subject to the conditions laid down therein Article guarantees the right to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part which is follows <ORG> shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs Including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo Warrants and certiorari which ever may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part in Part III means only the <ORG> and the <ORG> that the <ORG> is excluded therefrom and that therefore no question of a fundamental right can arise with reference to an order passed by an authority discharging judicial functions used in interpretation clauses in order to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases Occurring in the body of the statute and when it is so used these words or phrases must be construed as comprehending not only such things as the signify according to their natural import but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include There is much to be said in favour of the contention of the respondents that in the context the word includes must to be read as means and includes It is contended that the scheme of the Constitution is that whenever there is an infringement of a fundamental right by the <ORG> or the <ORG> the person aggrieved has a right of resort to this <ORG> under Art their function being to interpret law and that it will therefore be inappropriate to bring them within Part III which enacts limitations on power to make laws Whenever a fundamental right is infringed it is said the party aggrieved has a right to resort to the Civil <ORG> either in their ordinary Thus when executive and legislative action infringes fundamental rights the Supreme <ORG> can deal with it under Art We may now refer to the decisions where this question has been considered by this Court There the facts mere that one <NAME> applied to <ORG> at Ratlam for an order that he should be appointed guardian of the person and properties of his two children The remedy of a person aggrieved by the decision of a competent judicial tribunal is to approach for redress a superior tribunal if there be one It is next contended for the petitioner that the <ORG> will at least fall within the category of other authorities in Art It is contended for the petitioner that even if <ORG> could not be held to be other authorities quasi judicial tribunals must be regarded as falling within that expression and that Sales Tax Officers are at best only quasi judicial officers and they cannot be put on the same footing as regular <ORG> In this connection it will have to be borne in mind that it is a feature well known in the Government of this country that both executive and judicial functions are vested in the same Officer and because of the undesirable results which followed from this combination Art When an authority is clothed with two functions one administrative and the other judicial proceedings before it which fall under the latter category do not cease to be judicial by reason of the fact that it has got other non judicial functions What has to be seen is the capacity in which the authority acts with reference to the impugned matter Against his order there is an appeal in which again the parties have to be heard and a decision given in accordance with law The legality or propriety of an order passed in an appeal is again open to consideration on revision by <ORG> who must be a person qualified under clause of Art Section which is on the same lines as of the Indian Income Tax Act provides that <ORG> might refer for the opinion of <ORG> any question of law arising out of its order and under a the assessee has a right to move <ORG> for an order that <ORG> do refer the question of law arising out of the order if there has been an erroneous refusal to refer Now the respondents contend that the proceedings commencing with a notice issued by the <ORG> and ending with a reference to <ORG> are entirely judicial that it is in that view that petitions for certiorari and prohibition are entertained against orders of assessment under Art It will be inconsistent it is urged to hold on the one hand that the orders passed in these assessment proceedings are open to appeal under Art Article it will be noticed confers on the <ORG> jurisdiction to issue among others writs of Certiorari and prohibition The argument is that as these writs are issued only with reference to judicial proceedings the restricted definition of the State in Art is only when there is an infringement of a fundamental right which had been gua ranteed in Part III that it is Articles to that declare what those fundamental rights are for the breach of which remedy can be had under Art and that what has to be seen therefore is whether there is anything in the Article which is said to have been infringed which is repugnant to the definition of the State in Art Examining it is said Art which is alleged to have been violated there is nothing in it which is repugnant to the restricted connotation of the expression the State in Art stands and an order made by a <ORG> or tribunal cannot be held to infringe Art No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force at the time of the commission of the Act charged as an offence nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the commission of the offence No person accused of Any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself It has reference therefore It was also argued for the petitioner that under the American law certiorari lies against decisions of the <ORG> <ORG>s when they are repugnant to the provision of the Constitution and the decision in <ORG> <ORG> was relied support of this position There the question related to the validity of a provision in a statute of Alabama requiring foreign corporations to disclose among other things the names and addresses of their local members and agents Then the Corporation moved the Supreme <ORG> for a writ of certiorari on the ground that the provision in the statute was an invasion of the right to freely assemble guaranteed by the Constitution The principle on which all these decisions are based was thus stated in Virginia <NAME> It is doubtless true that a <ORG> may act through different agencies either by its legislative its executive or its judicial authorities and the prohibitions of the amendment extend to all action of the <ORG> denying equal protection of the laws whether ed The above is a resume of the arguments addressed by both sides in support of their respective contentions Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires open to challenge as repugnant to Art and The following Judgments were delivered <NAME> The facts of the case have been stated in the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> and it is not necessary for me to restate them I have reached the same conclusion as has been reached by my learned brother But in view of the importance of the question raised I would like to state in my own words the reasons for reaching that conclusion Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is Intra vires open to challenge as repugnant to Art of the Constitution These two questions are inter connected and substantially relate to one matter is the validity of an order made with jurisdiction under an Act which is Intra vires and good law in all respects or of a notification properly issued thereunder liable to be questioned in a petition under Art Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed <ORG> shall have power to issue directions or orders or write including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition qua warranto and certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part Without prejudice to the powers conferred on <ORG> by clauses and <ORG> may by law empower any other Court to exercise within the local limits of its jurisdiction all or any of the powers exercisable by <ORG> under clause The right guaranteed by this article shall not be suspended except as otherwise provided for by this Constitution The Article occurs in Part III of the Constitution headed Fundamental Rights There can be no doubt that the right to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of a right conferred by Part III is itself a guaranteed fundamental right Clause says that this <ORG> shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas Corpus mandamus prohibition qao warranto and certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III states that where a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation the President may by order declare that the right to move any court for the enforcement of such of the rights conferred by Part III as may be mentioned in the order and all proceedings pending in any court for the enforcement of the rights so mentioned shall remain suspended etc It is clear therefore that so long as no order is made by the President to suspend the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution every person in India citizen or otherwise has the guaranteed right to move <ORG> for enforcement of the rights conferred on him by Part III of the Constitution and <ORG> has the power to issue necessary directions orders or writs which may be appropriate for the enforcement of such rights The controversy before us centres round the expression enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part which occurs in cls We can make an order or issue a writ in the nature of certiorari in all appropriate case and in appropriate manner Therefore apart altogether from all technical considerations the broad question before us is in what circumstances does the question of enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution arise under Art facie established that there is violation of a fundamental right the question of its enforcement arises for example a it may arise when the statute itself is ultra vires and some action is taken under such statute or it may also arise when some action is taken under an intra vires statute but the action taken is without jurisdiction so that the statute though intra vires does not support it or it may again arise on misconstruction of a statute which is intra vires but the misconstruction is such that the action taken on the misconstrued statute results in the violation of a fundamental right of the Constitution when they perform quasi judicial functions and in view of the true scope of Art Act No XV of and as a result of the misconstruction they have assessed the petitioner to sales tax on the sum of Rs which action it is submitted has violated the fundamental right guaranteed to the petitioner under Art of the Constitution as it stood previously by wrongly holding that the transaction is intra State there is a transgression of constitutional limits Similarly where a quasi judicial authority commits an error as to a fact or issue which the authority has complete jurisdiction to decide under the statute but the error is of such a nature that it affects a fundamental right there is again a transgression of constitutional limits The argument is that there is no distinction in principle between these classes of misconstruction of a statute and the real test it is submitted should be the individuality of the error namely whether the error impings on a fundamental right If it does then the person aggrieved has a right to approach this <ORG> by means of a petition under Art It is stated that the validity of the Act not being challenged in any manner every part of it is good law therefore the provision in the Act authorising <ORG> as a quasi judicial tribunal to assess the tax is a valid provision and a decision made by the said tribunal strictly acting in exercise of the quasi judicial power given to it must necessarily be a fully valid and legal act It is pointed out that there is no question here of the misconstruction leading to a transgression of constitutional limits nor to any error relating to a collateral fact The error which is complained of assuming it to be an error is in respect of a matter which the assessing authority has complete jurisdiction to decide that decision is legally valid irrespective of whether it is correct or otherwise That is the view which we have expressed in the connected appeal of <ORG> Agra and another Civil Appeal No of in which Judgment is also being delivered to day The writ petition however has been referred to a larger Bench for the decision of the two important constitutional questions relating to the scope of Art It has not been disputed before us that where the statute or a provision thereof is ultra vires any action taken under such ultra vires provision by a quasi judicial authority which violates or threatens to violate a fundamental right does give rise to a question of enforcement of that right and a petition under Art There are several decisions of this Court which have laid this down The application was dismissed by <ORG> on the ground that if the Sales Tax Officer made an assessment which was erroneous the assessee could challenge it by way of appeal or revision under as There was an appeal against this order to this Court and therein a preliminary objection was taken that a writ under Art The remedy under the Act cannot be said to be adequate and is indeed nuga tory or useless if the Act which provides for such remedy is itself ultra vires and void and the principle relied upon can therefore have no application where a party comes to <ORG> with an allegation that his right has been or is being threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it and as such void and prays for appropriate relief under article It will be seen that the question which arose in that case was with reference to a provision in the taxing statute which was ultra vires and the decision was that any action taken under such a provision was without the authority of law and was therefore an unconstitutional interference with the right to carry on business under Art It was held that an omnibus wholesale order of transfer as was made in the case was not contemplated by the sub section and therefore the impugned order of transfer which was expressed in general terms without reference to any particular case and There are other decisions which proceeded on a similar basis namely that if a quasi judicial authority acts without jurisdiction or wrongly assumes jurisdiction by committing an error as to a collatteral fact and the resultant action threatens or The petitioner then moved this Court under Art A preliminary objection to the maintainability of the petition was taken on behalf of the respondent State on the ground that under the Act the petitioner could file an appeal against the order of assessment and that proceedings under Art and observed In these cases in appeals from orders passed by <ORG>s in petitions under Art The learned Judge then proceeded to hold that as there was under the Act a single liability and that had been discharged there could be no proceedings for the assessment of the same sales a second time to tax for quashing the proceedings for assessment on the ground that they were without jurisdiction and it was held that as the taxing authority had no power under the statute to issue the notice in question the proceedings were without jurisdiction and must be quashed This again was a case in which the authority had no jurisdiction under the Act to take proceedings for assessment of tax and it made no difference that such assumption for jurisdiction was based on a misconstruction of statutory provision The courts must therefore formulate their own criteria for determining whether the procedural rules are to be regarded as mandatory in which case disobedience will render void or voidable what has been done or as directory in which case disobedience will be treated as a more irregularity not affecting the validity of what has been done What is the position then There are some decisions particularly with regard to customs authorities where it has been held that an order of a quasi judicial authority given in violation of the principles of natural justice is really an order without jurisdiction and if the order threatens or violates a fundamental right an application under Art What is the position with regard to an order made by a quasi judicial authority in the undoubted exercise of its jurisdiction in pursuance of a provision of law which is admittedly intra vires It is necessary first to clarify the concept of jurisdiction Where a quasi judicial authority has jurisdiction to decide a matter it does not lose its jurisdiction by coming to a wrong conclusion whether it is wrong in law or in fact Thus a tribunal empowered to determine claims for compensation for loss of office has jurisdiction to determine all questions of law and fact relating to the measure of compensation and the tenure of the office and it does not exceed its jurisdiction by determining any of those questions incorrectly but it has no jurisdiction to entertain a claim for reinstatement or damages for wrongful dismissal and it will exceed its jurisdiction if it makes an order in such terms for it has no legal power to give any decision whatsoever on those matters There may be tribunals which by virtue of legislation constituting them have the power to determine finally the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends but subject to that an inferior tribunal cannot by a wrong decision with regard to a collateral fact give itself a jurisdiction which it would not otherwise possess The first ground given Was that the petitioner had the alternative remedy of getting the error corrected by appeal the second ground given was expressed by <ORG> in the following words We have however heard the learned counsel for the petitioner on merits also but we are not satisfied that the interpretation put upon this notification by the Sales Tax Officer contains any obvious error in it In <NAME> <ORG> dealt with a case in which a sale took place after notice had been wrongly served upon a person who was not the legal representative of the judgment <ORG> said In so doing the <ORG> was exercising its jurisdiction The above view finds support from a number of decisions of this <ORG> This Court held that as long as the decision under the Administration of Evacuee Property Act which had become final stood the petitioner could not complain of any infringement of any fundamental right infringement of a fundamental right for she has no such right This Court held that there was no violation of fundamental right and observed If the provisions of law under which impugned orders have been passed are with jurisdiction whether they be right or wrong on fact there is really no question of the infraction of a fundamental right In this case the Government had held that the petitioner had been trafficking in licences and in that view confiscated the goods imported under a licence It was held If the petitioner grievance is that the view taken by the appropriate authority in this matter is erroneous that is not a matter which can be legitimately agitated before us in a petition under Art In this case it was contended that the decision of <ORG> in granting a permit for a motor carriage service had offended Art There are however two decisions which stand out and must be mentioned here The two cases on which the decision was rested had clearly no application to the question decided is maintainable even in respect of orders which are made in the undoubted exercise of jurisdiction by a quasi judicial authority I do not think that these decisions support the contention of the petitioner An order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires and in the undoubted exercise of its jurisdiction cannot be challenged on the sole ground that it is passed on a misconstruction of a provision of the Act or of a notification issued thereunder Article guarantees the right to a constitutional remedy and relates only to the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution I have therefore come to the conclusion that no question of the The petitioners firm had also filed an appeal on a certificate of <ORG> against the order of that Court dismissing their petition under Art The petitioner firm had deliberately allowed the appeal to be dismissed for non prosecution and it cannot now be allowed to get the dismissal set aside on the ground of wrong advice Furthermore in the appeal filed on behalf of of the Constitution which is directed against the order passed by <ORG> Allahabad dated December the prayer is for a writ of certiorari or other order in the nature of certiorari quashing the said order a writ of mandamus against the respondents to forbear from realizing the sales tax imposed on the basis of the said order and such other writ or direction as the petitioner may be entitled to Under of the Sales Tax Act Act XV of hereinafter called the Act <ORG> is authorised by a notification to exempt unconditionally under cl a and conditionally under cl any specified goods This notification was subsequently modified and on November another notification was issued unconditionally exempting from sales tax biris both handmade and machine made with effect from July The Sales Tax Officer on November sent a notice to the petitioner firm for assessment of tax on sale of biris during the assessment period April to June This was Civil Miscellaneous Writ No of which was dismissed on January on the ground that there was another remedy open to the petitioner under the Act <ORG> also observed We have come to the conclusion that the Sales Tax Officer has not committed any apparent or obvious error in the interpretation of the notification of th December Against the order of <ORG> an appeal was brought to this Court on a certificate under Art the validity of the order of assessment dated December is challenged on the ground that the levy of the tax amounts to infringement of the fundamental right of the petitioner to carry on trade and business guaranteed by Art As before <ORG> which heard the petition a preliminary objection against the competency of the petitioner right to move this court under Art Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires open to challenge as repugnant to Art of the Constitution Comprises judicial power exercised by courts and the wider question whether Art case of assessment resulting from a misconstruction of a notification issued under a statute by a quasi judicial authority like the Sales Tax Officer even if the statute is intra tires is an infringement of the fundamental right to carry on trade under Art The respondent argued that if the constitutionality of the Act is not challenged then all its provisions must necessarily be constitutional and valid including the provisions for the imposition of the tax and procedure for assessment and appeals against such assessments and revisions therefrom would be equally valid An aggrieved party must proceed against the decision by way of appeal etc In <NAME> <NAME> Lord <NAME> while dealing with an erroneous order of a court said The Code goes on to say that the <ORG> shall issue a notice to the party against whom execution is applied He contended that he was not the right person but the <ORG> having received his protest decided that he was the right person and so proceeded with the execution It appears that they had perfect jurisdiction to decide the question which was before them and they did decide it Whether they decided it rightly or wrongly they had jurisdiction to decide the case and even if they decided wrongly they did not exercise their jurisdiction illegally or with material irregularity tribunals because in both cases where the authority has jurisdiction to decide a matter it must have jurisdiction to decide that rightly or wrongly and if the decision is wrong the aggrieved party can have recourse to the procedure prescribed by the Act for correcting the erroneous decision is a remedial provision and is itself a fundamental right which entitles a citizen to approach this court by an original petition in any case where his fundamental right has been or nay be infringed The right to move <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by this Part is guaranteed <ORG> shall have power to issue directions or orders or writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition que warranto and certiorari whichever may be appropriate for the enforce ment of any of the rights conferred by this Part a citizen can approach this <ORG> when his fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution are invaded the remedy for which is provided in cl of Art In my opinion the contention raised by the respondents is well founded An order of assessment passed by a quasijudicial tribunal under a statute which is ultra vires cannot be equated with an assessment order passed by that tribunal under an intra vires statute even though erroneous The former being with out authority of law is wholly unauthorised and has no existence in law and therefore the order is an infringement of fundamental rights under Art The latter is not unconstitutional and has the protection of law being under the authority of a valid law and therefore it does not infringe any fundamental right and cannot be impugned under Art If a Sales tax Officer acts as a quasi judicial authority then the decision whether right or wrong is a perfectly valid act which has the authority of an intra vires statute behind it Therefore a taxing law enacted by a legislature which it is not competent to enact will have no existence in the eye of law and will be violative of Art The same will be the case where an <ORG> authority levies an unauthorised tax Then there are cases like the present one where a quasi judicial tribunal imposes a tax by interpreting a notification under a taxing provision and the objection taken is that the interpretation is erroneous The cases relied upon by counsel for the appellant and the respondent fall within one or other of these categories The petitioners feeling aggrieved by the order filed a petition under Art Unless the provisions relating to the imposition of duty are challenged as unconstitutional or the orders in question are challenged as being in excess of the powers given to the <ORG> authorities and therefore without jurisdiction it is difficult to see how the question of any fundamental right under Art on facts there is really no question of the infraction of a fundamental right It was observed If the petitioner grievance is that the view taken by the appropriate authorities in this matter is erroneous that is not a matter which can be legitimately agitated before us in a petition under Art Essentially the petitioner grievance is against the conclusions of fact reached by the relevant authorities The respondent No was acting as a quasijudicial body and if it has made any mistake in its decision there are appropriate remedies available to the petitioner for obtaining relief of the Constitution unless the decision on the right alleged by the petitioner is held to be a nullity or can be otherwise got rid of As losing as that decision stands the petitioner cannot complain of any infringement of a fundamental right and tried to buttress that decision by certain cases decided before and subsequent to it The Court said If a tax is levied without due legal authority on any trade or business then it is open to the citizen aggrieved to approach this court for a writ under <NAME> since his right to carry on trade is violated or infringed by the imposition and such being the case <NAME> to be exempted from the payment of tax cannot be said to be a fundamental right which comes within the purview of Art In reaching the conclusion <ORG> appears to have overlooked the fact that the main contention of the appellant company as set forth in its petition is that the Act in so far as it purports to tax a nonresident dealer in respect of an inter State sale or purchase of goods is ultra vires the Constitution and wholly illegal I shall now discuss the cases which fall in the first category i where action is taken under a statute which is unconstitutional was filed in <ORG> which was dismissed and an appeal was brought to this Court and thus it was not a petition under Art This case and <NAME> case received approval in The Bengal Immunity Co The application was dismissed by <ORG> on the ground that if the Sales tax Officer made an assessment whiCh was erroneous the assessee could challenge it by way of appeal or revision under ss and of the Act and that as the matter was within the jurisdiction of the Sales tax Officer no writ of prohibition or certiorari could be issued There was an appeal against this order to this Court and therein a preliminary objection was taken that a writ under Art The remedy under the Act cannot be said to be adequate and is indeed nugatory or useless if the Act which provides for such remedy is itself ultra vires and void and the principle relied upon can therefore have no application were a party comes to Court with an allegation that his right has been or is being threatened to be infringed by a law which is ultra vires the powers of the legislature which enacted it and as such void and prays for appropriate relief under article case was with reference to a provision in a taxing statute which was ultra vires and the decision was only that action taken under such a provision was without the authority of law and was therefore an unconstitutional interference with the right to carry on business under Art because such a license fee on a business not only takes away the property of the licensee but also operates as on unreasonable restriction on the right to carry on business The first question there raised was of the legislative competence of <ORG> to enact the law and that <ORG> was held competent to enact and observed as follows In these cases in appeal from orders passed by <ORG> in petitions under Art It is contended that the decision in <NAME> case requires reconsideration As there is at least one case supporting the competence of the petition we think it fit to decide this petition on its merits on the footing that it is competent it cannot be said that this case is an authority which supports the contention of the petitioner Apart from the fact I that <NAME> case did not receive approval it was decided on the ground of the Central Sates tax being a tax which could be collected on a sale once and by one State on behalf of <ORG> and having been imposed and paid once could not be imposed a second time The There the petitioner had entered into contracts with <ORG> for the supply of certain quantities of foreign sugar On their arrival they were taken possession of by <ORG> after paying the requisite customs duty The Assistant Collector of Sales tax issued a notice to the petitioner proposing to review the said assessment passed by the Sales tax Officer It was contended by the petitioner that the sales in question were not liable to sales tax inasmuch as they took place in the course of import of goods into India This Court held that the property in the goods passed to <ORG> when the shipping documents were delivered against payment and that the sales of goods by the petitioner to the <ORG> took place when the goods were on the high seas and were therefore exempt from sales tax under Art This was also a case of lack of legislative authority and jurisdiction to impose the sales tax Then there are cases where the Executive action is without authority of law Court without deciding the question whether the order could be supported on the ground of reasonable classification hold that the order expressed in general terms without any reference to any particular case and without any limitation The nature of the transaction was that finished to bacco which was supplied to the petitioners by the suppliers moved from the <ORG> of Bombay to the <ORG> of Madhya Pradesh and the transactions which were sought to be taxed were therefore in the course of inter <ORG> trade and were not liable to tax by the <ORG> In the last of these notices it was stated that on failure to produce the documents and evidence the case will be decided on beat judgment assessment basis This therefore was a case in which the taxing authority had no jurisdiction to take proceeding for assessment of tax because of the expiry of three years which had to be counted from the end of the each quarter in respect of which the return had been filed The question was one of lack of jurisdiction and it made no difference that the Sales tax Officer had misconstrued the provision This it was submitted was an authority for the proposition that where a provision is misconstrued by an authority having jurisdiction to construe a section a petition under Art the petitioners in Pondicherry entered before its merger with India into firm contracts with foreign sellers and the goods agreed to be imported were shipped before Or after the merger The goods were confiscated by the Controller of Customs on the ground that they were imported without a licence but as an option in lieu of confiscation the goods were released on payment of a fine it was held by a majority that under paragraph of the French Establishments Application of Laws Order the transactions in question fell within the words things done in the saving clause and were not liable to tax These Orders the Taxing Officer had no power to construe and there was no law to support the order of the Collector which the law excludes from the taxing powers of the authority levying the tax There is one other class of cases of which <NAME> case is an example A taxing statute it was held by a majority of the <ORG> was not immune from attack on the ground that it infringes the equality clause under Art A review of these cases shows that the law which is ultra vires either because of the legislative incompetence or its contravention of some constitutional inhibition is a non existing law and any action taken thereunder quasi judicial or otherwise would be a contravention of Art and are infringed the consequence is the same where assessment is made by an authority which has no jurisdiction to impose the tax and if an administrative tribunal acting quasi judicially misconstrues a provision which it has jurisdiction to construe and therefore imposes a tax infringement of Art would result according to <NAME> case but there is no such infringement according to cases which the learned Additional Solicitor General relied upon and which have been discussed above firstly on the ground that there was an alternative remedy of getting the error corrected by way of appeal and secondly <ORG> said We have however heard the learned counsel for the petitioner on merits also but we are not satisfied that the interpretation put upon this notification by the Sales Tax Officer contains any obvious error in it There is no dispute that <ORG> is a department of the <ORG> and is included within the word <ORG> but the question is what is the nature and quality of the determination made by a Sales Tax Officer It was also observed in that case that there are tribunals with many of the trappings of a court which nevertheless are not courts in the strict sense exercising judicial power There is no gain saying that Sales tax Officer is not a court even though he may have many of the trappings of a court including the power to summon witnesses receive evidence on oath and making judicial determinations It only follows policy and expediency which being subjective considerations are what a tribunal makes them A statut requiring such evidence to be received prevents a tribunal making up its mind until it has given this evidence a chance to weigh with it Indeed because the order of assessment was judicial or quasi judicial the petitioner filed in <ORG> a petition for certiorari and against that order an appeal under Art Taking the nature of the determination by the Sales tax Officer in the instant case it cannot be said that he is purely an administrative authority or the order passed by him is an executive order on the contrary when he is determining the amount of tax payable by a dealer he is acting in a quasi judicial capacity the judicial branch of the <ORG> was not included in the definition of the word <ORG> and the words other bodies there did not comprise a tribunal having jurisdiction to decide judicially and its decisions could not be challenged by way of a petition under Art No of KAPUR Messrs <NAME> the assessee firm bad filed an appeal on a certificate of <ORG> against the order of the <ORG> dismissing their petition under Art The assessee firm deliberately allowed the appeal which was pending in this Court to be dismissed for nonprosecution and after deliberately taking that step it cannot be allowed to get the dismissal set aside on the ground of wrong advice <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the judgments just delivered by my brothers <NAME> and <NAME> and I am in agreement with them <NAME> <NAME> have carefully gone through the judgment prepared by my learned brother <NAME> I am unable to agree The facts have been fully stated in his judgment and it is therefore not necessary to cover the ground over again He broadly contends that this <ORG> is the constitutional protector of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution that every person whose fundamental right is infringed has a guaranteed right to approach this <ORG> for its enforcement and that it is not permissible to whittle down that jurisdiction with the aid of doctrines evolved by courts fur other purposes He argues that in the present case an executive authority functioning under the Uttar Pradesh Sales fax Act Act XV of hereinafter called the Act made a clearly erroneous order imposing tax on exempted goods A I namely bidis and that it is a clear infringement of the fundamental right of the petitioner to carry on business in bidis He says that the Act is a reasonable restriction on the petitioner right to carry on business in bidis that thereunder a Sales Tax Officer has jurisdiction to decide rightly or wrongly whether bidis are exempted from sales tax and that therefore his order made with jurisdiction cannot possibly infringe the fundamental rights of the petitioner Mr <NAME> who appears for the intervener while supporting the argument of learned Solicitor General emphasizes the point that the fundamental rights enshrined in Art thereof excludes all authorities exercising judicial power that the sales tax authority in making the assessment in exercising judicial power and that therefore no writ can be issued by this <ORG> against the said authority Article prohibits the <ORG> from making any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by the said Part and declares that any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void In the context of fundamental rights an important principle should be borne in mind namely that the English idea of legislative supremacy is foreign to our Constitution This <ORG> has no more important function than to preserve the inviolable fundamental rights of the people for the fathers of the Constitution in their fullest confidence have entrusted them to the care of this <ORG> and given to it all the institutional conditions necessary to exercise its jurisdiction in that regard without fear or favour It must be borne in mind that our Constitution in effect promises to usher in a welfare State for our country and in such a state the <ORG> has necessarily to create innumerable administrative tribunals and entrust them with multifarious functions of the Constitution as to which we say nothing now this <ORG> cannot on a similar ground decline to entertain a petition under Art for the right to move this <ORG> by appropri ate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitu tion is itself a guaranteed right After considering the cases cited in support of that contention this <ORG> came to the conclusion that it would fail in its duty as the custodian and protector of fundamental rights if it was to decline to entertain a petition under Art simply because it involved the determination of disputed questions of fact The court may in some appropriate cases be inclined to give an opportunity to the parties to establish their respective cases by filing further affidavits or by issuing a commission or even by setting the application down for trial on evidence as has often been done on the original sides of <ORG> and Calcutta or by adopting some other ap propriate procedure on the ground that it involves dispu ted questions of fact Finally this <ORG> also held that in appropriate cases it had the power in its discretion to frame writs or orders suitable to the exigencies created by enactments and that where the occasion so required to make even a declaratory order with consequential relief is dismissed not on the merits but because of the laches of the party applying for the writ or because it is held that the party had an alternative remedy available to it then the dismissal of the writ petition would not constitute a bar to a subsequent petition under Art petition is dismissed in limine and an order is pronounced in that behalf whether or not the dismissal would constitute a bar would depend upon the nature of the order If the order is on the merits it would be a bar if the order shows that the dismissal was for the reason that the petitioner was guilty of laches or that he had an alternative remedy it would not be a bar except in cases which we have already indicated If the petition is dismissed in limine without passing a speaking order then such dismissed cannot be treated as creating a bar of res judicata It is true that prima facie dismissal in limine even without passing a speaking order in that behalf may strongly suggest that the <ORG> took the view that there was no substance in the petition at all but in the absence of a speaking order it would not be easy to decide what factors weighed in the mind of the <ORG> and that makes it difficult and unsafe to hold that such a summary dismissal is a dismissal on merits and as such constitutes a bar of res judicata against a similar petition filed under Art confers a wide jurisdiction on this Court to enforce the fundamental rights that the right to enforce a fundamental right is itself a fundamental right and that it is the duty of this Court to entertain an application and to decide it on merits whenever a party approaches it to decide whether he hag a fundamental right or if so whether it has been infringed irrespective of the fact whether the question raised involves a question of law or depends upon questions of fact The doctrine of res judicata applied by this Court does not detract from the amplitude of the jurisdiction but only negatives the right of a petitioner on the ground that a competent court has given a final decision against him in respect of the right claimed He has a fundamental right to carry on that business It expressly declares that no tax shall be levied on the exempted goods The said law is a reasonable restriction on the petitioner fundamental right to carry on the business in bidis The Officer says It may be true that my order is wrong it may also be that the Supreme <ORG> may hold that my construction of the section as accepted by the highest tribunal is perverse still as under the Act I have got the power to decide rightly or wrongly my order though illegal operates as a reasonable restriction on the petitioner fundamental right to carry on business The Constitution says in effect that neither the <ORG> nor the <ORG> can infringe the fundamental rights of the citizens and if they do the person affected has a guaranteed right to approach this <ORG> and this <ORG> has a duty to enforce it but the <ORG> authority says I have a right to decide wrongly and therefore the Supreme <ORG> cannot enforce the fundamental right There is nothing in the Constitution which permits such an extraordinary position It is said that if a valid law confers jurisdiction on the officer to decide rightly or wrongly the petitioner has no fundamental right There is no provision which enables the <ORG> to make an order of an executive authority final so as to deprive <ORG> of its jurisdiction under Art of the Constitution It is argued that <ORG> are judicial tribunals in the sence they are courts and therefore their final decisions would operate as res judicata on the principle enunciated by this Court in <NAME> case The Act imposes a tax on the turnover of sales of certain commodities and provides a machinery for the levy assessment and collection of the said tax It provides for an appeal against the order of the assessing authority and for a revision in The assessing authorities are admittedly the officers of <ORG> and there is nothing in the Act to indicate that either the assessing authority or the appellate authority need possess any legal qualification The fact that following the analogy of the Income tax Act at the instance of the party aggrieved a reference can be made by the reviewing authority to <ORG> on a question of law shows only that the help of <ORG> can be requisitioned only to elucidate questions of law but <ORG> has no power to make final orders but on receipt of the judgments of <ORG> the revising authority shall make an order in conformity with such judgment Now let us consider the decisions cited at the <ORG> which would throw some light on the nature of such tribunals <NAME> observed The income tax authorities cannot be treated as <ORG> deciding a disputed point except for the purposes mentioned in and further there is no other party before them and there are no pleadings A An assessment is inherently of a passing nature and it cannot provide an estoppel by res judicata in later years by reson of a matter being taken in to account or not being taken into account by the Income tax Officer in an earlier year of assessments An instructive discussion on the question whether an Income tax Officer is a court within the meaning of of the Code of Criminal Procedure is found in <NAME> <NAME> where <NAME> after considering the case law on the subject and the provisions of the Income tax Act held that an income tax officer was not a court The learned Judge observed When exercising his powers under Chapter IV of the Act it seems to me that the income tax Officer is acting in a purely admini strative capacity Though this cannot be called a direct decision on the question raised in the present case it indicates that this Court treated the Income tax Officer as a department of the executive branch of <ORG> There is a simpler answer to the plea of res judicata The argument ab inconvenienti does not appeal to me It is further said that if a wider interpretation is given namely that if this <ORG> has to ascertain in each case Whether a statutory authority has infringed a fundamental right or not it will have to decide complicated questions of fact involving oral and documentary evidence and the machinery provided under Art If the jurisdiction is there and there are difficulties in the way this <ORG> will have to evolve by convention or otherwise some procedure to avoid the difficulties This <ORG> evolved a procedure to meet some of the difficult situations that might arise in particular cases If the party complains that the order made against him by a tribunal is based upon a wrong construction of the provisions of a statute this <ORG> may ascertain whether on a correct interpretation of There may be many other situations but I have no doubt Supp I shall now proceed to deal with the main argument advanced by learned counsel for the respondent is couched in comprehensive phraseology and as pointed out earlier is of the widest amplitude it is not confined to the issue of prerogative writs for the Supreme <ORG> has power to issue directions or orders to enforce the fundamental right even in respect of issuing the said writs this <ORG> is not oppressed by the procedural technicalities of the prerogative writs in England this <ORG> may for the purpose of enforcing a fundamental right issue a writ of certiorari prohibition or mandamus in a suitable case it may give the relief even in a case not reached by the said writs There are similar limitations in the case of writs of prohibition and mandamus A tribunal may have power to decide collateral facts for the purpose of assuming jurisdiction or it may have exclusive jurisdiction to decide even the said facts There may be tribunals which by virtue of legislation constituting them have the power to determine finally the preliminary facts on which the further exercise of their jurisdiction depends but subject to that an inferior tribunal cannot by a wrong decision with regard to a collateral fact give itself a jurisdiction which it would not otherwise possess or deprive itself of a jurisdiction which it otherwise would possess of the Constitution for enforcing the said rights it has power to issue directions or orders uncontrol by any such limitations The authority may have jurisdiction to decide certain disputes under an Act A Sales tax authority may issue only a notice threatening to take action under the Act at that point of time there is no decision by the tribu nal The person to whom notice is given approaches this <ORG> and complains that the authority under the colour of the Act proposes to infringe his fundamental right in that case if this <ORG> is satisfied that his fundamental right is infringed it has a duty to enforce it This may be an argument of inconvenience and this <ORG> as has already been indicated may adjourn the case till the entire proceedings come to an end before the highest Sales tax authority I would therefore hold that the principles evolved by the courts in England and accept by the courts in India governing the issue of prerogative writs cannot circumscribe the unlimited power of <ORG> to issue orders and directions for the enforcement of the fundamental rights Even otherwise in cases similar to those covered by the illustration <NAME> a prerogative writ can be issued for quashing the order of an inferior tribunal and a fortiori an order can be issued for enforcing a fundamental right under Art Even if the said legal position be wrong the present case falls within the limited scope of the principle governing the issue of a writ of certiorari The fact is that what is an error apparent on the face of the record cannot be defined precisely or exhaustively there being an element of indefiniteness inherent in its very nature and it must be left to be determined judicially on the facts of each case Whether there is an error of law on the face of the record can be determined only on the facts of each case and as this Court pointed out an error that might be considered as self evident by one Judge may not be so considered by another that the question must be left to be determined judicially on the facts of each case In the present case the recitals in the notification clearly disclose that there is an error of law on the face of the order of the tribunals In that event there is a clear infringement of the fundamental rights of the petitioners to carry on business in <ORG> This decision has nothing to do with the scope of this Court power to enforce a fundamental right but it deals only with the question of the ouster of the civil court jurisdiction when a special tribunal is created to finally decide specific matters the petitioners therein hold that the said transactions were intrastate transactions and on that basis required them to file a statement of return of total purchase of tobacco made by them this court on a correct view of the transactions came to the conclusion that they related to inter State trade and on that view enforced the fundamental right of the petitioners Though there was no decision of the Sales tax authorities that the transactions were intra State the notice was on that basis but yet that did not prevent this Court from coming to a different conclusion and enforcing the fundamental right of the petitioners Ignoring the first decision wherein there was no order of the Sales tax Officer on merits in the other two decisions the Sale tax Officer in exercise of his jurisdiction decided on the facts before him that the sales were intra State sales whereas this <ORG> on a reconsideration of the facts hold that they were outside sales has inherent jurisdiction to decide the question whether the sales were inside sales or outside sales of the Constitution and therefore he had no inherent jurisdiction to impose the tax There are no merits in this distinction He had the jurisdiction to decide rightly or wrongly on the basis of his finding though a wrong one the sales were not exempt from taxation If on the facts of the case the Sales tax Officer bad arrived at the correct conclusion he would not have any power to impose a tax on inter State sales under the Act he would also have infringed Art There as in the present case the question depended upon the interpretation of the terms of a notification issued under of the Sales tax Act exempting certain goods from taxation The discussion shows that this Court held in the manner it did as it came to the conclusion that a fundamental right had been clearly infringed by a wrong interpretation of the notification Let me now consider the decisions of this Court which are alleged to have departed from the view expressed in that case This Court held that no question of fundamental right arose in that case If the provision of law under which the impugned orders have been passed are good provisions and the orders passed are with jurisdiction whether they be right or wrong on facts there is really no question of the infraction of a fundamental right Essentially the petitioner grievance is against the conclusions of fact reached by the relevant authorities This Court held that <ORG> on the facts had held that there was no discrimination Dealings with that contention this Court observed This contention is in our view clearly may have been right or wrong and as to that we say nothing but we are unable to see that The respondent No was acting as a quasi judi cial body and if it has made any mistake in its decision there are appropriate remedies available to the petitioner for obtaining relief the petitioner cannot complain of any infringement of a fundamental right If the decision of the appropriate authorities of competent jurisdiction on these questions has become final and cannot be treated as a nullity or cannot be otherwise got rid of the petitioner cannot complain of any infringement of her fundamental right under Arts As long as that decision stands the petitioner cannot complain of the infringement of a fundamental right for she has no such right As I have said earlier this <ORG> may ordinarily accept the findings of fact arrived at by tribunals but on the other hand if the judgment meant that under no conceivable circumstances this <ORG> could interfere with the findings of an administrative tribunal even if there was a clear infringement of fundamental right in my view it would amount to an abdication of its jurisdiction in favour of administrative tribunals There was no inherent want of jurisdiction in the <ORG> authorities for they had jurisdiction to construe the relevant provisions of and hold whether the assessment could be made within a particular time or not On a superficial reading of the aforesaid decisions though they may appear to be conflicting there is one golden thread which runs through all of them and that is a citizen has a guaranteed procedural right under Art of the Constitution and that a duty is cast upon this <ORG> to enforce a fundamental right if it is satisfied that the petitioner has a fundamental right and that it has been When a fundamental right of a petitioner was infringed by an action of an officer purporting to exercise a power under an Act which is ultra vires or unconstitutional or without jurisdiction this <ORG> invariably enforced the fundamental right of the Constitution and the guaranteed right given to a citizen under the said article should be restricted or limited by some principle or doctrine not contemplated by the Constitution cannot be given against an authority exercising judicial power and that the Sales tax authorities are authorities exercising judicial power of the <ORG> no fundamental right can he enforced against an officer exercising judicial power as he does not come under the definition of <ORG> in Art this case to decide the two questions namely whether a person can approach this Court to enforce his fundamental right on the ground that it was infringed by a deciSion of a court of law and whether the right guaranteed by Art We are concerned only with the narrow question whether such a right can be enforced against the action of an administrative tribunal for the said authorities exercise governmental functions and are the instrumentalities of the <ORG> But it is contended that if the fathers of our Constitution intended to include in the definition authorities exercising judicial functions having included the <ORG> and the <ORG> they would not have omitted to mention specifically the judicial institutions therein Let me now restate the legal position as I conceive it A citizen has a fundamental right to carry on business in bidis under Art The State may make a law imposing reasonable restrictions on that right it is conceded that the Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act is such a law The order may be illegal because the authority concerned has acted without jurisdiction in the sense that the authority is not duly constituted under the Act or that it has inherent want of jurisdiction the order may be illegal also because the said authority has construed the relevant provisions of the Act wrongly and has decided the facts wrongly or drawn the inferences from the facts wrongly The aggrie ved party may approach this <ORG> before a decision is given by the Sales tax authority or after the decision is given by the original authority or when an appeal is pending before the appellate tribunal or after all the remedies under the Act are exhausted Whatever may be the stage at which this <ORG> is approached this <ORG> may in its discretion if the question involved is one of jurisdiction or a cons truction of a provision decide the question and enforce the right without waiting till the procedure prescribed by a law is exhausted but if it finds that questions of fact or mixed questions of fact and law are involved it may give an opportunity to the party if he agrees to renew the application after he has exhausted his remedies under the Act or if he does not agree to adjourn the petition till after the remedies are exhausted The following notification dated December was issued under the said section In partial modification of notifications No ST dated March and ST dated January and in exercise of the powers conferred by clause of sub section of section of the Sales Tax Act Under the Central Act before the amendment there was excise duty on tobacco used for various purposes including machine made bidis but there was no excise duty on hand made bidis There is some controversy whether that notification was issued under a or of the Act but that need not detain us for I shall assume that the notification was issued under Under the first part of the notification the said bidis and tobacco were exempted from the sales tax from December The condition imposed for the operation of that exemption was that additional central excise duties leviable thereon from the closing of business on December should have been paid on such bidis and tobacco Assuming that the said notification applied only to goods in respect whereof additional excise duty was leviable the payment of additional duty in respect of tobacco which went in making hand made bidis was also a condition attached to the exemption of such bidis from taxation It appears from the record that the merchants doing business in band made bidis were notable to compete with businessmen manufacturing machine made bidis am therefore clearly of the opinion that on a fair reading of the said notification sales of <ORG>made bidis were exempted from taxation under the Act on which the States have foregone collection of safes tax locally <ORG> issued notification on December exempting bidis from sales tax under the Sales Tax Act provided the additional duties of excise were paid This was followed by another notification on November The question is whether the exemption granted by the notification of December exempting bidis conditionally upon payment of additional duty of excise applied to the petitioner during the quarter ending June amount to a deprivation of property without authority of law and also a restriction upon her right to carry on trade or business The other side contends that no fundamental rights can be said to be breached when the authorities act under a valid law even though by placing their interpretation on some provision of law they may err provided they have the jurisdiction to deal with the matter and follow the principles of natural justice In some of them the question was considered but in some it was not because no objection was raised <NAME> then observed If tax is levied without due legal authority on any trade or business then it is open to the citizen aggrieved to approach this Court for a writ under Article since his right to carry on a trade is violated or infringed by the imposition and such being the case Article comes into play The Constitution being federal in form there is a further division of powers between the <ORG> and the <ORG>s This division is also made in the jurisdictions of three Departments of the <ORG> The people who vested the three limps of Government with their power and authority at the same time kept back these rights of citizens and also sometimes of non citizens and made them inviolable except under certain conditions Thus It was that this Court said in <NAME> case that this A Law can give protection to an action only which is within itself but it cannot avail if the action it outside The method of approach to this court was different but it made no difference to the application of the provisions of Part III There are other such decisions but these two suffice if a breach of fundamental rights comes before it and indeed it was so stated in <NAME> case that this Court cannot consistently with the responsibility so laid upon it refuse to entertain appli cations seeking protection against infringe ments of such rights although In <NAME> case this <ORG> issued a writ prohibiting assessment of a tax under an in valid law even though there was no assessment begun or even a threat of one of the Constitution as to which we say nothing now his <ORG> cannot on a similar ground decline to entertain a petition under Art for the right to move this <ORG> by appropriate proceedings for the enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution is itself a guaranteed right The view expressed in the last case finds further support from what <NAME> said very recently in <NAME> The State of If the petition field in <ORG> under Art is dismissed not on the merits but because of the laches of the party applying for the writ of because it is held that the party had an alternative remedy available to it then the dismissal of the writ petition would not constitute a bar to a subsequent petition Under Art <NAME> then went on to consider the matter from the point of view of res judicata and held that in some cases that principle would apply if no appeal against the order of <ORG> was field but not in others because if there is a decision of <ORG> negating fundamental rights or their breach then the decision of the competent Court must be removed by appeal to establish the rights or their breach Of course when he makes an application under Art he take the risk of either succeeding or failing on that narrow issue and a finding of <ORG> or some tribunal below on some point if not set aside in appropriate proceedings may stand in his way But if a party takes the risk of coming to this court direct on the narrow issue he cannot be told that he has other remedies The right to move this <ORG> is guaranteed The power to issue writs in the nature of the five high prerogative writs of hebeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari is in itself sufficient to compel obedience by the <ORG> as defined in Art Then there is the writ of certiorari to get rid of orders which affect fundamental rights the writ of prohibition to stop action before it can be completed the writ of quo warranto to question a wrongful assumption of office and lastly the writ of habeas corpus to secure liberty Indeed an observed by Lord <NAME> then <NAME> in <NAME> Electricity Commissioners Whenever any body or persons having legal authority to determine questions affecting the rights of subjects and having the duty to act judicially act in excess of their legal authority they are subject to the controlling jurisdiction of <ORG> exercised in these writs may be appropriate for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by this Part Part III Show the wide ambit of the power Speaking then of the writ of certiorari the learned Judge added We can make an order or issue a writ in the nature of certiorari in all appropriate cases and in appropriate manner so long as we keep to the broad and fundamental principles that regulate the exercise of jurisdiction in the matter of granting such writs in English law is available only for the enforcement of fundamental rights but <ORG> can use the Powers for other purposes a power which <ORG> can also confer on <ORG> by law vide Art but there are other provisions of the Constitution relating to the Supreme <ORG> has been given the power to grant in its discretion special leave to appeal to itself from any judgment decree determination sentence or order in any cause or matter passed or made by any <ORG> of tribunal in the territory of India Only one exemption has been made in favour of a <ORG> or tribunal constituted by or ordered under any law relating to <ORG> There are other jurisdictions of the <ORG> There are other jurisdictions of <ORG> also which may be described as advisory and original arising in special circumstances with which we are not concerned In most taxation laws there is a jurisdiction and a right to invoke the advisory jurisdiction of <ORG> and in some there is a right of appeal or revision to <ORG> but the question of a breach of fundamental rights cannot be raised in the proceedings before the tribunals In its advisory jurisdiction <ORG> can only answer the question referred to it or raise one which arises out of the order passed and in its appellate and revisional jurisdiction <ORG> can deal with the matter on law or fact or both as the case may be but only in so far as the tribunal has the jurisdiction There is however nothing to prevent a party moving a separate petition under Art If this be the true position and if this <ORG> can only deal with question of breach of fundamental rights in petitions under Art The right to move this <ORG> being guaran teed the petition may lie but there are other thing to consider before it can be said in what cases this <ORG> will interfere Since this case arises under a taxing statute I shall confine myself to taxing laws because other considerations may arise in other Whether or not be word State covers the ordinary <ORG>s there is authority to show that tribunals which play the dual role as dcciding issues in a quasi judicial way and acting as the instrumentalities of Governments are within the word State as used in Part III of the Constitution Taxation laws may suffer from two defects and they are a if they are not made within the four corners of the powers conferred by the Constitution on the particular legislature or if they are opposed to fundamental rights A simple example is imposition of Profession Tax by <ORG> which it has no power to impose or the imposition of a tax above Rs It has to be done by authority of law which must mean valid law In order that the law may be valid the tax proposed to be levied must be within the legislative competence of the <ORG> imposing a tax and authorising the collection thereof and secondly the tax must be subject to the conditions laid down in Art is that the <ORG> shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the equality clause in Art It cannot be disputed that if the Act infringes the provisions of Art then there was no point in making a separate provision It therefore follows that clause of article must be regarded as concerned with depriva tion of property otherwise than by the impo sition or collection of tax for otherwise article becomes wholly redundant In our opinion the protection against imposi tion and collection of taxes save by authority of the law directly comes from article and is not secured by clause of article All that we wish to state is that this application in so far as it purports to be founded on article read with article to this <ORG> is misconceived and must fail Similar observations were made in the other case No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law Speaking of such a situation the order of reference in this case has said This again is a case in which the authority had no jurisdiction under the Act to take proceedings for assessment of tax and it makes no difference that such assumption of jurisdiction was based on a misconstruction of statutory provisions If in the course of his duties he has to construe provisions of law and miscarries it gives a right of appeal and revision where such lie and in other appropriate cases resort can be had to the provisions of Arts There is only one exception to this and it lies within extremely narrow The case involved an interpretation of notification to find out whether an exemption applied to a particular case or not and no question of want of jurisdiction as explained by me arose there In my opinion and I say it respect fully it must be regarded as having stated the proposition a little too widely What is claimed is that by a wrong interpretation of the word bidis and tobacco as used in the notification of December an exemption is Whether the Sales Tax Officer interpretation is right or the contrary interpretation suggested on behalf of the petitioner is right is a matter for decision on the merits of the case If there is an error it can be corrected by resorting to appeals revisions references to <ORG> and ultimately by appeal to this Court I would therefore dismiss the application for restoration but without any order about costs AYYANGAR This bench has been constituted for deciding the following two questions set out at the conclusion of what might be termed the order of reference Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires open to challenge as repugnant to Art of the Constitution Though the matter was not discussed with any elaborateness both these questions were answered in the affirmative by this <ORG> in <NAME> The State of For this reason I propose to discuss the question on principle and without reference to the decisions which were placed before us at the hearing As <NAME> has pointed out there are no legal limits to the sovereignty of <ORG> Article laid down that every law whether made before or after the Constitution which was inconsistent with the rights guaranteed by the succeeding Articles should save as otherwise expressly provided be invalid to the extent of the repugnancy And law was defined in a comprehensive manner so as to include not merely laws made by <ORG> or the legislatures but every piece of subsidiary legislation including even notifications The scheme therefore of the Constitution makers was to prescribe a code of conduct to which <ORG> action ought to conform if it should pass the test of constitutionality set out the precise freedom guaranteed as well as its content and the qualifications to which the exercise of that freedom might be subjected by enacted law or action taken under such law vests in <ORG> the authority and jurisdiction to ensure that the fundamental rights granted by Part III are not violated and even the right to move this <ORG> for appropriate relief for infraction of a fundamental right is itself made a fundamental right which ordinary legislation may not affect Thus the right given to the citizen to move Before dealing with the merits of the case it is necessary to mention that the following positions were conceded on the side of the respondent and in my opinion properly If the levy was imposed or the burden laid on a citizen as the petition before us is concerned with a legislation imposing a tax I am using phraseology appropriate to such an enactment but as would be seen the principle is of wider application and would cover infringement of liberties other than in relation to property and by laws other than in relation to taxation by a statue beyond the competence of a legislature to enact as not falling within the relevant entry in the legislative list the action by government or governmental officers would involve the violation of the freedom guaranteed by Art It would however be seen that this is in reality merely one manner in which there might be lack of legislative power already dealt with under head The same result would follow and there would be a breach of a fundamental right if though there was legislative competence to enact the legislation in the sense that the subject matter of the law fell within one of the entries of the Legislative List appropriate to that legislature but the legislation was invalid as violating other fundamental rights of a general nature applicable to all legislation such as the violation of Art Even in cases where the enactment is valid judged by the tests in to above if on a proper construction of the enactment the quasijudicial authority created to function under the Act and to administer its provisions acted entirely outside the jurisdiction conferred on him or it by the enactment such action if violative of the fundamental rights could be complained of by a petition under Art The argument of the learned Attorney General who appeared for the petitioner was short and simple that fundamental rights were not violated and accordingly there is a constitutional duty cast upon the <ORG> to afford relief when so approached in every case where fundamental rights were violated The two matters which a petitioner seeking relief under Art There was no dispute that a fundamental right could be invaded by State action which was legislative in character or where the complaint was as regards the action of executive and administrative authorities created even under valid statutes Taking the handy illustration of a taxing statute if by a plain misinterpretation of the charging provision an assessing authority levies a tax on transaction A while the statute on its only possible con struction imposes no tax on such a transaction is any fundamental right of the party who is subjected to such an improper levy prejudicially affected by such an imposition In considering the proper answer to this question it is necessary to exclude one matter which is apt to cloud the issue and it is this The statute under which the quasi judicial authority functions or makes the decision or order may contain provisions for enabling the correctness of the decision reached or the order passed being challenged by an appeal or may provide for a gradation of appeals and further revisions The existence of procedures for redressing grievances or correcting errors of primary or appellate authorities is obviously wholly irrelevant for a consideration of the question as to whether the order of the authority involves an infringement of fundamental rights or not Besides it cannot be predicated that there is a violation of a fundamental right if the party aggrieved has no appeal provided by the statute under which the authority acts but that if other statutory remedies are provided there would be no violation of a fundamental right for the question whether a fundamental right is violated or not is dependent on the action complained of having an impact on a guaranteed right and its existence or non existence or the action constituting a breach of a fundamental right cannot be determined by the absence or presence of procedures proscribed by the statute for correcting erroneous orders Besides it cannot be that if the remedies open under the statute are exhausted and the authority vested with the ultimate authority under the statute has made its decision and there is no longer any possibility of an objection on the score of an alternative remedy being available there would be a violation of a fundamental right with the consequence that this <ORG> would have jurisdiction but that if it was approached at an earlier stage there was no violation of a fundamental right and that it lacks jurisdiction to afford relief under Art for it must be admitted that in ultimate analysis there is no distinction between the nature and quality of an order passed by an original as distinct from one by an appellate or revisional authority in its consequences vis a vis the fundamental right of the individual affected On this basis the only ground upon which the jurisdiction could be denied would be that the order or decision of the authority which is impugned does not prejudicially affect the fundamental right of the petitioner for it cannot be that the order of the ultimate authority under the statute could involve the violation of a fundamental right but that the same orders passed by authorities lower down in the rung under the statute would not involve such a violation Coming back to the point under consideration it was conceded by the learned Additional Solicitor General who appeared for the respondent that legislative action might involve an infraction of fundamental rights and that similarly the action of the executive authorities might involve such an infraction even when the legislation under which they acted or purported to act was within legislative competence and within the constitutional limitations imposed by Part III His submission may be summarised in the following terms Where a statute was within legislative competence and does not by its provisions violate any of the constitutional guarantees in Part III it follows as a matter of law that every order of a quasi judicial authority vested with power under the Act is also valid and constitutional and that the legality and constitutionality of the statute would cover every act or order of such an authority if the same was within his or its jurisdiction and prevent them from the challenge of unconstitutionality The same argument was presented in a slightly different form by saying that such a quasi judicial authority has as much jurisdiction to decide rightly as to decide wrongly and that if there was error in such a deci sion the only remedy of the citizen affected was by resort to the tribunals set up by the Act for rectifying such errors and that in the last resort that is after the entire machinery under the Act was exhausted the affected party had a right to approach <ORG> under Art in cases where the error was of a type which could be brought within the scope of the remedial writs provided by that Article Before examining the correctness of this submission it is necessary to mention that Mr <NAME> who appeared for some interveners supporting the Respondent made a submission which if accepted Si would have far reaching consequences His contention was that the <ORG> in Part III against whose action the fundamental rights were guaranteed was confined to the legislative and the executive branches of <ORG> activity and that the exercise of the judicial power of the <ORG> would never contravene the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III It would be seen that this is wholly different from the submission made on behalf of Government by the learned Additional Solicitor General and it would be convenient to deal with this larger question after disposing of the arguments of Mr <NAME> The question for consideration is what exactly is meant when it is said that a statute is valid in the sense of a being legally competent to the legislature to enact and being constitutional as not violative of the freedoms guaranteed by Part III In this connection it is of advantage to refer to a point made by Mr <NAME> who appeared for some of the interveners in support of the petition One of his submissions was this Suppose there is an Act for the levy of sales tax which is constitutionally valid The illustration I have given of unconstitutional action by authorities acting under valid and constitutional enactments cannot be properly answered unless it be held that a plain and patent misinterpretation of the provisions of the enactment could it self give rise to a plea that it was beyond the jurisdiction of the authority but that would be stretching the concept of jurisdictional errors beyond what is commonly understood by that term Let me next take a case where the mis interpretation by the quasi judicial authority does not involve the levy of a duty beyond the competence of the legislature enacting the statute When once it is conceded that a citizen cannot be deprived of his property or be restricted in respect of the enjoyment of his property save by authority of law it appears to me to be plain that in the illustration above there is no statutory authority behind the tax liability imposed upon him by the assessing authority The Act which imposed the tax and created the machinery for its assessment levy and collection is no doubt perfectly valid but by reason of this circumstance it does not follow that the deprivation of property occasioned by the collection of a tax which is not imposed by the charging section does not involve the violation of a fundamental right merely because the imposition was by reason of an order of an authority created by the statute though by a patent misinterpretation of the terms of the Act and by wrongly reaching the conclusion that such a transaction was taxable There is however one matter to which it is necessary to advert to avoid misconception and that concerns the effect of findings reached on questions of fact by quasi judicial authorities Provided there is relevant evidence on which the finding could rest the finding would preclude any violation of a fundamental right because this <ORG> though in the absence of a finding of a duly constituted authority would have the power and jurisdiction to investigate even disputed facts in an appropriate case would however accept findings of fact by duly constituted authorities and proceed to find out whether on that basis a fundamental right exists and is prejudicially affected by the action impugned The fact is that there is no hard and fast formula for determining when an authority which is vested with power to act on behalf of the <ORG> falls within category which is termed quasi judicial But those decisions disclose no coherent principle and the reported cases throw no light on the question from the wider point of view save to demonstrate by the very confusion of thought which they present the difficulty of arriving at a clear basis of distinction The significance of this point stems from the fact that it is a matter of concession that where the power of the <ORG> is vested in an executive or administrative authority under an enactment which is valid and constitutional and such an authority does an act which on the proper construction of the relevant statute is not justified by it the act may be of such a character as to violate a fundamental right guaranteed by Part III i if the impact is in a field which is pro tected from <ORG> interference and such a violation could be complained of by a petition to this Court under Art To start with it is obvious that the nature of the act or of the order might be the same so that if the same act proceeded from one authority it would have a particular effect but would have quite a different effect or would not have that effect if the same act proceeded from a slightly different type of authority also exercising the power of the <ORG> court of law A body may be under a duty however to act judicially although there is no form of lis inter partes before it and in a further passage from the decision in <NAME> <ORG> which this Court extracted it was observed The true view as it seems to us is that the duty to act judicially may arise in widely different circumstances which it would be im possible and indeed inadvisable to attempt to define exhaustively Bearing in mind these circumstances I find it not possible to accept the contention that if the power of the <ORG> be exercised by an authority which on a conspectus of the statute is deemed to be quasi judicial and the exercise of such power prejudicially affects rights of life liberty or property which are guaranteed by Part III the same cannot amount to a violation of a fundamental right whereas if on a proper construction of the I take it that the reason why quasi judicial authorities are suggested as being exceptions to the general rule that <ORG> action which involves a prejudicial result on a person right to property etc Does it however follow that executive action does not in vole a decision or posit a right to decide If it is clear law as must be conceded that there is no necessity to have a lis in order to render the body or authority deciding a matter to be treated as a quasi judicial authority then it is very difficult to conceive of few actions by the executive which do not Involve an element of discretion by proceeding on an investigation as to the nature of the authority which passed that order when as I have pointed out earlier there is no essential difference in either the nature or the quantum of the injury suffered by the citizen cannot be sustained on any proper interpretation either of the Constitution or the principles of law governing the interpretation of statutes I would therefore hold that the freedoms guaranteed by Part III may be violated by the action of a quasi judicial authority acting within the limits of its jurisdiction under a valid and constitutional statute where it plainly misinterprets the provisions of the statute under which it functions or which it is created to administer As regards the practical effect of accepting the contention of the learned Additional Solicitor General there is a second matter to which I consider it essential to draw attention With a very great increase in governmental activity and the diverse fields in which it operates owing to the <ORG> being a welfare <ORG> as contrasted with a Police <ORG> concerned mainly with the maintenance of law and order there has necessarily been a great proliferation of governmental departments with the attendant creation of several authorities which have to pass decisions in spheres affecting the citizen at manifold points Though if the words of the Constitution were explicit considerations such as there would be of no avail yet even if the matter were ambiguous I am clearly of the opinion that the rejection of the broad contention raised on behalf of the respondent is justified as needed to give effect to the intentions of the framers of the Constitution But as I have pointed out already on no logical basis could it be held that where an act or order of a quasi judicial authority lacks legislative backing it cannot still impinge on a person fundamental right and where an order suffers from patent error it is no legislative sanction behind it It was pointed out that the <ORG> whose action might involve the violation of fundamental rights or rather as against whom the citizen had been granted a guarantee of certain rights under this Part was defined to include the Government and <ORG> of the <ORG> and of the states and the local authorities did not name the Judicial power of the <ORG> as within it There are several considerations to which I shall immediately advert which conclusively negative the correctness of the inference to be drawn from judicial and quasi judicial authorities not being specifically named in Art The words are of wide amplitude and capable of comprehending every authority created under a statute and functioning within the territory of India The question would at once arise whether when the government exercise such powers it is deemed to be a government falling within the definition of <ORG> or should be classified as a judicial authority wielding the judicial power of the <ORG> so as to be outside the definition so that its decisions and orders do not give rise to a violation of a fundamental right When government exercises any power be it executive pure and simple or quasi judicial under a statute or quasi legislative in say framing subordinate legislation it does so as government and no further subdivision of it is possible except for the purposes merely of academic study or for determining the nature of the relief which might be had by persons affected by its activities in any particular field Similarly <ORG> is vested with a quasi judicial power to punish for contempt which itself is by reason of such power belonging to the <ORG> of the United Kingdom and this if anything is an indication that the constitution does not recognise any doctrine of the separation of powers There is only one other matter which need be referred to in this connection Both this <ORG> as well as the High <ORG> have vested in them the power to make rules and it cannot be disputed that such rules would be laws within the definition of the ex pression in Art In the face of these deductions following from the Constitution itself I find it wholly impossible to accede to the submission that what is termed as judicial power of the <ORG> which it is submitted would include quasi judicial authorities created under statutes do not fall within the definition of the <ORG> and that their actions therefore are not to be deemed <ORG> action against which the Constitution has provided the rights guaranteed under Part III I would therefore answer the question referred to the Bench by saying that the action of quasijudicial authority could violate a fundamental right if on a plain mis construction of the statute or a patent misinterpretation of its provisions such an authority affects any rights guaranteed under Part III This would be in addition to the three broad categories of cases in regard to which it was conceded that there could be a violation of fundamental rights where the statute under which it functions was itself invalid or unconstitutional where the authority exceeds the jurisdiction conferred on it by the Act and where the authority though functioning under statute contravenes mandatory procedure prescribed in the statute or violates the principles of natural justice and passes an order or makes a direction affecting a person rights of property etc Before concluding it is necessary to advert to one matter which was just touched on in the course of the arguments as one which might be reserved for consideration when it actually arose and this related to the question whether the decision or order of a regular ordinary <ORG> of law as distinguished from a tribunal or quasi judicial authority constituted or created under particular statutes could be complained of as violating a fundamental right There is not any substantial identity between <ORG> adjudicating on the rights of parties in the lis before it and designed as <ORG> and this <ORG> are to investigate inter alia whether any fundamental rights are infringed and vested with power to protect them and quasi judicial authorities which are created under particular statutes and with a view to implement and administer their provisions This brings me to the question as to whether there has been a patent misinterpretation of the statute as I have described earlier and whether as a result the petitioner has established a violation of a fundamental right the sale of any goods by <ORG> or such other person or class of persons as <ORG> may from time to time exempt on such conditions as may be specified by notification in the official gazette The petitioners are manufacturers of handmade biris and there was no duty of excise payable on them under the relevant entry in the Central Excise Act nor was there any imposition of any fresh duty on biris so manufactured under Central Act of whose object was to provide for the levy and collection of additional duties interalia on tobacco and tobacco products and for the distribution of a part of the net proceeds thereof among the States in place of the sales tax which was to be forborne by the States on those goods Briefly stated the contention urged on behalf of the petitioner was that in the proviso to the notification dated December the expression have been paid on such goods applied only to those cases where an additional duty was payable and was framed to deny the benefit of the exemption to parties who being liable to pay such duty failed to pay the same If not withstanding that the one is preferable to the other or that a <ORG> of construction would more readily accede to the one rather than to the other the officer had adopted a construction which it was possible to take could it be said that there was an error apparent on the face of the record justifying the issue of a writ of certiorari Judged from the point of view I am inclined to hold that where it is possible reasonably to uphold the construction adopted by an inferior tribunal it would be a case of mere error of law and not a patent error or an error apparent on the face of the record which should justify the issue of a writ of certiorari Secondly if as I have held the error in the order of the officer was not such as to justify the issue of a writ of certiorari to quash the same the judgment of <ORG> under Art MUDHOLKAR The question which arises for consideration in this petition under Art of the Constitution is whether a right guaranteed by Part III such as a right to carry on trade or business is breached because a taxing authority though acting under a law which is inter vires and following a procedure which is constitutionally as well as legally permissible has erroneously assessed and levied a tax on a trade or business The substance of the petitioner contention is that when the construction placed by a taxing authority upon a provision of law is wrong the levy of tax is one which is not authorised by law and thus the assesee right under Art Upon the construction placed by him on this notification the Sales Tax Officer held the petitioner liable to pay sales tax on the turnover of sales of bidis for the period between April and June But that has nothing to do with the point which I have referred to earlier In the referring Order the following two questions were formulated by the learned Judges who made the reference Is an order of assessment made by an authority under a taxing statute which is intra vires open to challenge as repugnant to Art of the Constitution I have not discussed the decisions of this <ORG> as they have been considered fully in the judgments of my brethren but have approached the questions with reference to the principles of law applicable to the questions placed before us The two questions are really one Can an erroneous order of assessment by a taxing authority result in a breach of a right to carry on trade or business so as to entitle the person complaining of the breach to approach this Court under Art The remedy provided by this Article which is A I On the one hand it was contended at one stage on the authority of the decisions in <ORG> <NAME> and <ORG> that a fundamental right will not be breached if the requirements of Art It has however been made clear in sereval decisions of this Court that a law under Art must not violate a right guaranteed in Part III of the Constitution We must also bear in mind the nature of a quasi judicial tribunal and the legal efficacy of its decisions This right is further subject to the sovereign power of the <ORG> to levy a tax There is yet another limitation on the power of the <ORG> to make laws including a law levying a tax and that is placed by el of the Constitution which runs thus The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall to the extent of the contravention be void If a law imposing a tax is in contravention of any of the rights conferred by Part III of the Constitution the law would be void and a person aggrieved would be entitled to move this Court under Art Similarly if a law is beyond the competence of the legislature which enacted it or if it contravenes any provision of the Constitution such as Art it would be an invalid law as being ultra vires the Constitution and the tax levied thereunder would also be one which is not authorised by law and the assessee can move this Court under Art Similarly if a tax is levied by an authority not empowered by law to do so or by a competent authority in violation of the procedure permitted by law or in violation of the principles of natural justice the levy would be unauthorised and the decision under which it was made would be a nullity In such a case also the assessee can move this Court under Art The quantum of the right left to an individual to carry on his trade or business will be that which in left after a valid restriction is placed upon it by the <ORG> under cl of Art Where as here the restriction is placed on a dealer and takes the form of a liability to pay a tax on the turnover of sales on certain commodities by him then he can carry on his trade subject to his liability to pay the tax as asses sed from time to time A restriction imposed by a void law being illegal falls outside el Now when a <ORG> wants to impose a tax on a trade or business it must necessarily provide for the machinery for assessing and collecting it The assessment and collection of a tax cannot be arbitrary and therefore the <ORG> must confer upon the taxing authority the power and impose upon it the duty to act judicially Since however it is a tribunal of limited jurisdiction and since also it performs other functions which are administrative in character it is not a purely judicial but only a quasi judicial tribunal It must apply its mind to the relevant provisions of the law and to the facts of each case and arrive at its findings It is therefore inevitable that the authority should have the power to construe the facts as well as the laws In other words it must have jurisdiction to do those things or else its decisions can never have any value or binding force A taxing authority which has the power to make a decision on matters falling within the purview of the law under which it is functioning is undoubtedly under an obligation to arrive at a right decision Further if the taxing law is a valid restriction the liability to be bound by the decision of the taxing authority is a burden imposed upon a person right to carry on trade or business Therefore it makes no difference whether the decision is right or wrong so long as the error does not pertain to jurisdiction Since sales tax is imposed only on certain commodities and tax at different rates is since sales chargeable an different commodities the power of the Sales Tax Officer to makes an assessment carries with it the power to determine whether the sales of particular commodities effected by the assessee fall within the ambit of the Act or not and if they do to determine the rate or rates of tax chargeable in respect of sales of different commodities If he finds upon a construction of the Act and of the rules and notifications issued thereunder that a certain commodity is liable to pay a tax then so long as the transaction is one upon which the <ORG> legislature could impose a tax and the commodity is one on which the <ORG> legislature could impose a tax it is difficult to see how the decision arrived at by the Sales Tax Officer can be said to be otherwise than within his jurisdiction even though he may have made an error in coming to a particular conclusion If he comes to a wrong conclusion would he in demanding the tax on the basis of such conclusion be making an unlawful demand The conclusion may be obviously or palpably wrong but so long as it is not shown to be dishonest would his decision be void Of course if by placing an erroneous construction on the law he holds say that a transaction which is bit by Art of the Constitution is one which can be taken into consideration for the purposes of assessing the tax or if he holds that a commodity upon which the <ORG> legislature could not impose a tax is taxable under the Act he would With respect to such assessment the assessee will of course have the right to move this <ORG> under Art But where such is not the case and the error of the Sales Tax Officer lay only in holding that a tax is payable on a certain commodity as in this case bidis even though bidis may have been exempted from such tax by a notification made by the Government how could he be said to have acted without jurisdiction It was however contended that where the erroneous construction by the Sales Tax Officer results in the levy of a tax for which there is no authority in law the fundamental right to carry on trade or business will necessarily be breached The answer to this contention is that since he has the power to construe the law and decide whether a particular transaction or commodity is taxable his decision though erroneous must be regarded as one authorised by law and consequently the tax levied thereunder held to be one authorised by law It was said that the answer would take in oven erroneous decisions as to commodities and transactions with respect to which the State legislature is incompetent to make laws I have no doubt that it would not because the power of the Sales Tax Officer to levy a tax cannot extend beyond that of the State legislature The <ORG> functioning under the Act in question has clearly the power to summon witnesses call documents record evidence and so on The Act imposes a duty on him to give an opportunity to the person sought to be assessed to be heard If that is the correct legal position what difference would it make if as a result of an erroneous decision arrived at by a <ORG> resulting from a misconstruction of a notification under the Sales Tax Act a person is held liable to pay tax upon sales of a commodity which upon a proper construction would appear to be exempted from tax by the law like the notification in question Just as a person cannot complain of a breach of his fundamental right to carry on trade or business because an erroneous decision of a court of law renders him liable to pay a sum of money so too he cannot complain against an equally erroneous decision of a <ORG> Though this Court is the guardian of all fundamental rights the Constitution has not taken away the right of the ordinary courts or of quasijudicial tribunals administering a variety of laws to exercise their existing jurisdiction and to determine matters falling within their purview If by reason of the decision of a tribunal a person for instance loses his right to occupy a house or has to pay a tax that decision cannot be thrown to the winds and a complaint made to this Court that a fundamental right has been violated would be the right to carry on business subject to the payment of the tax as assessed by the taxing authority and not a right to carry on trade or business free from that liability It makes no difference even if the assessment of the tax is based upon an erroneous construction of the taxing law inas much as the right to have a correct determination of the tax is not part of the fundamental right to carry on business but flows only from the taxing law It was said that a quasi judicial tribunal being an instrumentality of the <ORG> its action is <ORG> action and so it will be under the same disabilities as the <ORG> to do a thing which it is incompetent or impermissible for the <ORG> to do because the action would be one which is not authorised by law if it affects a person fundamental right on the ground that it is not authorised by law the action of the tribunal pursuant to an erroneous order will not be open to challenge for the reason that its action arises out of the exercise of a judicial power and is thus authorised by law <ORG> action though it be or is ultra vires the Constitution or where it is subordinate legislation it is ultra vires the law under which it is made or inconsistent with any other law in force A similar question will also arise if the tax is assessed and or levied by an authority a other than the one empowered to do so under the taxing law or in violation of the procedure prescribed by the law or in colourable exercise of the powers conferred by the law No fundamental right is breached and consequently no question of enforcing a funda mental right arises where a tax is assessed and levied bona fide by a competent authority under a valid law by following the procedure laid down by that law even though it be based upon an erroneous construction of the law except when by reason of the construction placed upon the law a tax is assessed and levied which is beyond the competence of the legislature or is violative of the provisions of Part III or of any other
