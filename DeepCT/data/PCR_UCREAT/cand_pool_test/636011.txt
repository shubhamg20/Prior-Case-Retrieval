On st October the assessee and <ORG> entered into an agreement cancelling the three agreements relating to the distribution rights in respect of the three films and in consideration of such cancellation the assessee was paid Rs Though in general the distinction between an income and a capital receipt was well recognised and easily applied cases did arise where the item lay on the border line and the problem had to be solved on the particular facts of each case It carried on the business of distribution of films The assessee bound itself to advance a certain sum in instalments specified therein and retain the balance to be utilised for the purpose of press publicity in such way as it thought fit and proper and at its sole discretion The assessee was given the right at its sole discretion to distribute the films at such rates and on such terms and conditions and in such manner as it might deem fit clause On st October the assessee and <ORG> entered into an agreement cancelling the three several agreements relating to the distribution rights in respect of the three films and in consideration of such cancellation <ORG> agreed to pay to the assessee towards commission the sum of Rs rupees twenty six thousand which was paid during the accounting year which forms the subject matter of the question that has arisen between the assessee and the department The present appeal is directed against this decision of <ORG> After stating the facts of the case which gave rise to the present point in controversy and which have been stated above His Lordship proceeded as follows As already indicated the question for consideration is whether this payment constituted a capital receipt or a revenue receipt Lord <NAME> said in <ORG> <NAME> Inspector of Taxes that though in general the distinction between an income and a capital receipt was well recognized and easily applied cases did arise where the item lay on the border line and the problem had to be solved on the particular facts of each case The assessee before us is a company carrying on a business and it received the sum in question in connection with that business We have therefore to ask ourselves as to what is the substance of the matter from the point of view of a businessman In fact in the accounting year the assessee had distribution rights in respect of eleven films including these three The cancellation of these agreements must have left the assessee free if it so chose to secure other films which could be distributed in the place of these films and which might have brought in better box office collections In the language of Lord <NAME> in <ORG> The Com missioners of Inland Revenue the sum paid to the assessee was not truly compensation for not carrying on its business but was a sum paid in ordinary course of business to adjust the relation between the assesse and the producers of the films Learned counsel for the assessee has as did <ORG> strongly relied on the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case supra In that case there was no fixed period within which the distributing agency was to continue whereas in the case before us the agreement was only for a fixed period of five years out of which a considerable part had already expired by Sir <NAME> towards the end of his judgment where he said It is contended for the appellant that the business of the respondents did in fact go on throughout the year and this is no doubt true in a sense They had other independent commercial interests which they continued to pursue and the profits of which have been taxed in the ordinary course without objection on their part Therefore it can hardly be said that by the financing agreements the assessee acquired capital assets for carrying on its distributing agency business Further in the present case there is no suggestion that any part of the moneys advanced by the assessee for the production of the films was outstanding In the premises the amount received by the assessee was only so received towards commission that is to say as compensation for the loss of the commission which it would have earned bad the agreements not been terminated In our judgment on the facts and in the circumstances of the present case it falls within the principles laid down in <ORG> and <ORG> cases rather than within those laid down in <ORG> case or <ORG> case or <ORG> case Reference was made to section A of the Indian Income Tax Act and it was urged that the language of that sub section impliedly indicated that the sum of Rs For the reasons stated above the referred question should in our opinion have been answered in the affirmative and we answer it accordingly The appeal is therefore allowed with costs throughout The facts leading up to the present appeal have been fully set out in that judgment and it is not necessary to repeat the same The relevant portions of the agreement dated the th September which is the sample of the three agreements entered into between <ORG> and the assessee may be however set out herein Whereas the producer has taken on hand the production of a Tamil talkie picture Kannagi hereinafter called the said picture The distributors shall from the realisations of the said picture made by them a pay themselves all amounts spent by them for publicity in respect of the said picture such an expenditure having been incurred only after obtaining the consent of the producer pay themselves their distribution commis sion in respect of the said picture as hereinafter provided and pay themselves the available balance until the entire advance of Rs The assessee was no doubt carrying on the business of distributors which involved as a necessary corollary the acquisition of films for the purpose of distribution There was thus a sharp distinction between the capital account and the trading account the amounts advanced towards the production of the pictures being capital expenditure and the repayments of these advances as and when made being capital receipts as distinct from the monies spent by it in the distribution and exploitation of the pictures being trading expenses and the commission realised by it from such distribution and exploitation being trading receipts It had a species of proprietary rights in these pictures all throughout the period of the agreements not only in respect of advances which it had made for producing the same but also in respect of all other claims under the terms of the agreements and the nature of those rights would not be changed by the accident of the full amount of the advances being repaid to it at a particular period of time during the currency of the agreements It was submitted that it was an essential part of the assessee business to enter into agreements of the nature in question and that it was an ordinary incident of its business that such agreements may be altered or terminated front time to time Lord <NAME> also emphasized this aspect of the matter in <ORG> <ORG> supra at page that there was no finding that in consequence of the termination any capital asset was depreciated in value or became of less use for the purpose of the assessee business If the assessees in those cases bad by virtue of the agreements in question acquired capital assets which they could work in order to earn income profits or gains the payments received on termination of the said agreements would certainly not have been held to be trading receipts but capital receipts and as such not liable to tax Reliance was placed on behalf of the assessee on the decisions in <ORG> Commissioners of Inland Revenue and <ORG> <NAME> Inspector of Taxes supra for showing that if the capital asset of the assessee was sterilized or destroyed the payment would be a capital receipt Lord <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> supra at page expressed the opinion that it made no difference whether it be regarded as the sale of the asset out and out or whether it be treated as a means of preventing the acquisition of profit that would otherwise be gained Lord <NAME> also at page stated that the mining leases were capital assets of the company the company objects were to acquire profits by working the mines under and by virtue of the titles and rights which they hold under the leases and the payment was made to the assessee for abstaining from seeking to make a profit Inspector of Taxes supra it was held that the payment in question was the payment for the cancellation of the assessee future rights under the agreements which constituted a capital asset of the assessee and that it was accordingly a capital receipt The ground is not very easy to express but the ground upon which I desire to put this part of the case is this that the true view here is that the agreement which was cancelled was just a capital asset of the <ORG> and if that is right it seems to me to follow that distinguishing such cases as Short Brothers one ought to hold that the sum received was not an income receipt at all The agreements in the facts and circumstances of the case before him related to the whole structure of the assessee profit making apparatus they regulated the assessee activities defined what they might and might not do and affected the conduct of their business and he had difficulty in seeing how money laid out to secure or money received for the cancellation of so fundamental an organization of a trader activities could be regarded as an income disbursement or an income receipt Applying the same ratio here could it not be said that the pictures which were acquired by the assessee from the producers were capital assets of the assessee the object of the assessee being to acquire profits by distributing and exploiting the pictures under and by virtue of the titles and rights which the assessee acquired under the agreements or that they provided the means of making profits though they themselves did not yield profits That being the true position on the construction of the agreements the only result would be that the pictures constituted capital assets These were cases of assessees which carried on the business of building and selling houses or building and development business and in the course of their business acquired plots of land which they utilised for the purpose of constructing buildings thereupon which buildings together with the plots of land on which they stood were sold by them for a consideration The following observations of the learned Judge at page are very instructive Although in most cases land belonging to a trading company was part of its capital assets in the case of a company engaged in ribbon development the land which is acquired for the purposes of such development is not part of its capital In such a case the land forms part of its stock in trade supra and were of the opinion that the present case was covered by that decision On the facts of the case as set out in the above appeal it does not appear to be clear whether the two selling agencies there were the only selling agencies which had been acquired and worked by <ORG> and it is debatable under the circumstances whether the authority of that decision is not shaken by the decisions in <ORG> case supra and <ORG> case supra received by the assessee from the producers was in consideration of the surrender by the assessee of the capital assets which it had acquired from the producers under the three agreements in question and constituted a capital receipt not liable to tax for the assessment year The answer given by <ORG> to the referred question was therefore correct and I would dismiss the appeal with costs BY THE COURT In accordance with the Judgment of the majority the appeal is allowed with costs throughout
