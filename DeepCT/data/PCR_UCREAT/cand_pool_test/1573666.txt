was introduced in providing protection to any law relating to preventive detention in the <ORG> against invalidity on the ground of infringement of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution in <ORG> completed its work by raining a Constitution for the <ORG> and it came into force on th January The power under the Article is to be exercised from time to time and includes within it the power to add amend vary or rescind Therefore of the General Clauses Act under which a power to issue a notification or order includes a power to add If it were held that of the General Clauses Act is not to be applied to the interpretation of the Constitution it will lead to the anomaly that when once rules are made under the rule making powers under various Articles such as Arts Further the legislative history of the Article shows that it was envisaged that the President would have to take into account the situation existing in the <ORG> when applying a provision of the Constitution and that such situations arise from time to time There was the possibility that when applying a particular provision the situation might demand an exception or modification of the provision applied but subsequent changes in the situation might justify the rescinding of those modifications or exceptions This could only be brought about by conferring on the President the power of making Orders from time to time under Art serves the purpose that amendments to the Constitution should be made applicable to the <ORG> only with the concurrence of the <ORG> Government and that after such concurrence available the amendments should take effect when an order is made under Art There is no reason to limit the word modification in Art as originally enacted the applicability of the provisions of Part III for the purpose of judging the validity of a law relating to preventive detention made by the <ORG> Legislature was postponed for a period of five years No dharna was started on th November but on th November a notice was given on behalf of the employees to the Government that there would be a hunger strike on th November of the Constitution introduced in the Constitution in its application to the State of Jammu Kashmir the point that had been raised stood answered by the addition of this clause and unless the clause itself was challenged the point raised on behalf of the detenu did not arise of the Constitution as initially introduced by the Constitution Application to Jammu Kashmir Order had given protection to any law relating to preventive detention in Jammu Kashmir against invalidity on the ground of infringement of any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution for a limited period of five years only This clause as introduced in read as follows No law with respect to preventive detention made by <ORG> whether before or after the commencement of the Constitution Application to Jammu Kashmir Order shall be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with any of the provisions of this Part but any such law shall to the extent of such inconsistency cease to have effect on the expiration of five years from the commencement of the said Order except as respects things done or omitted to be done before the expiration thereof the words ten years were substituted by the Constitution Application to Jammu Kashmir Second Amendment Order which was passed before the expiry of those five years and subsequently for the words ten years so introduced the words fifteen years were substituted by the Constitution Application to Jammu and Kashmir Amendment Order On these facts the point raised on behalf of the detenu was that these two modifications in and substituting ten years for five years and fifteen years for ten years were themselves void on the ground that orders making such modifications could not be validly passed by the President under Art Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution a the provisions of article shall not apply in relation to the State of Jammu Kashmir the power of <ORG> to make laws for the said State shall be limited to i those matters in the Union List and the Concurrent List which in consultation with the Government of the State are declared by the President to correspond to matters specified in the Instrument of Accession governing the accession of the State to the Dominion of India as the matters with respect to which <ORG> may make laws for that State and ii such other matters in the said Lists as with the concurrence of the Government of the State the President may by order specify For the purposes of this article <ORG> means the person for the time being recognised by the President as the Maharaja of Jammu Kashmir acting on the advice of <ORG> for the time being in office under the Maharaja Proclamation dated the fifth day of March the provisions of article and of this article shall apply in relation to that State of that clause be given before the Constituent shall apply in relation to that State subject to such exceptions and modifications as the President may be order specify Provided that no such order which relates to the matters specified in the Instrument of Accession of the State referred to in paragraph i of sub clause shall be issued except in consultation with the Government of the State Provided further that no such order which relates to matters other than those referred to in the last preceding proviso shall be issued except with the concurrence of that Government The special circumstances to which reference was made by him were that there had been a war going on within the limits of Jammu Kashmir State that there was a cease fire agreed to at the beginning of the year and that cease fire was still on that the conditions in the State were still unusual and abnormal and had not settled down that part of the <ORG> was still in the hands of rebels and enemies that our country was entangled with <ORG> in regard to Jammu Kashmir and it was not possible to say when we would be free from this entanglement that <ORG> had committed themselves to the people of Kashmir in certain respects which commitments included an undertaking that an opportunity be given to the people of the State to decide for themselves whether they would remain with the Republic or wish to go out of it and that the will of the people expressed through the Instrument of a Constituent Assembly would determine the Constitution of the State as well as the sphere of Union Jurisdiction over the State The Constitution of the State came into force on th January and therefore the two Orders of and passed by the President in purported exercise of the power under Art There is considerable force in this submission There are however much stronger reasons for holding that the provisions of Law Order No dated th November and laid down that from the th November the article was to be operative with substitution of the new Explanation for the old Explanation as it existed at that time powers conferred by this Article should not be interpreted by applying section of the General Clauses Act because a Constitutional power cannot be equated with a power conferred by an Act rule bye law etc The argument in our opinion proceeds on an entirely incorrect basis became applicable when the Constitution came into force shall apply in relation to the State of Jammu Kashmir subject to such exceptions and modifications as the President may by order specify The specification by the President has to be in consultation with <ORG> if those provisions relate to matters in the Union List and the Concurrent List specified in the Instrument of Accession governing the accession of the State to the Dominion of India as matters with respect to which <ORG> may make laws for that State This provision made by the Constitution itself in Art Section of the General Clauses Act is as follows Where by any Central Act or Regulation a power to issue notifications orders rules or by laws is conferred then that power includes a power exercisable in the like manner and subject to the like sanction and conditions if any to add to amend vary or rescind any notifications orders rules or bye laws so issued If for the interpretation of these provisions section of the General Clauses Act is not applied the result would be that the rules once made by the President or a Governor would become inflexible and the allocation of the business among the Ministers would for ever remain as laid down in the first rules Clearly the power of amending these rules from time to time to suit changing situations must be held to exist and that power can only be found in these articles by applying section of the General Clauses Act There are other similar rule making powers such as the power of making service rules under Art That power must also be exercisable from time to time and must include within it the power to add to amend vary or rescind any of those rules It appears to us that there is nothing in Art There was clearly the possibility that when applying a particular provision the situation might demand an exception or modification of the provision applied but subsequent changes in the situation might justify the rescinding of those modifications or exceptions This could only be brought about by conferring on the President the power of making orders from time to time under Art has been applied to Jammu Kashmir primarily with the object that amendments made by the <ORG> in the Constitution of India as applicable in the whole of the country should also take effect in the State of Jammu Kashmir The proviso when applying this article serves the purpose that those amendments made should be made applicable to the State of Jammu Kashmir only with the concurrence of the State Government and after such concurrence is available these amendments should take effect when an order is made under Art the <ORG> held But in the present case we have to find out the meaning of the word modification used in Art If therefore the power is given to the President to efface in effect any provision of the Constitution altogether in its application to the State of Jammu Kashmir it seems that when he is also given the power to make modifications that power should be considered in its widest possible amplitude If he could efface a particular provision of the Constitution altogether in its application to the State of Jammu Kashmir we see no reason to think that the Constitution did not intend that he should have the power to amend a particular provision in its application to the State of Jammu and Kashmir We are therefore of opinion that in the context of the Constitution we must give the widest ffect to the meaning of the word modification used in Art There is no reason to limit the word modifications as used in Art the applicability of the provisions of Part III for the purpose of judging the validity of a law relating to preventive detention made by <ORG> was postponed for a period of five years during which the law could not be declared void We have already held that the power to modify in clause also includes the power to subsequently vary alter add to or rescind such an order by reason of the applicability of the rule of interpretation laid down in section of the General Clauses Act The provision made in Art
