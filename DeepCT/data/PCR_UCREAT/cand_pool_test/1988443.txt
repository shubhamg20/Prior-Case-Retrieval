There were seven subscribers to the Memorandum of Association of whom three namely Sir <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> constituted <ORG> We have heard the learned counsel for revenue and for the assessed Stand of the learned counsel for the <ORG> is that there is scope for misuse and evasion of tax if interpretation given by the <ORG> is accepted In order to appreciate rival submissions the relevant provisions need to be noted any voluntary contributions received by a trust created wholly for charitable or religious purposes or by an institution established wholly for such purposes not being contributions made with a specific direction that they shall form part of the corpus If the trust or institution shall for the purposes of section be deemed to be income derived from property held under trust wholly for charitable or religious purposes and the provisions of that section and Section shall apply accordingly Nothing contained in Section or section shall operate so as to exclude from the total income of the previous year of the person in receipt thereof a in the case of a trust for charitable or religious purposes or a charitable or religious institution any income thereof i ii if any part of such income or any property of the trust or the institution whenever created or established is during the previous year used or applied directly or indirectly for the benefit of any person referred to in sub section Without prejudice to the generality of the provisions of clause and clause of sub section the income or the property of the trust or institution or any part of such income or property shall for the purposes of that clause be deemed to have been used or applied for the benefit of a person referred to in sub section if any funds of the trust or institution are or continue to remain invested for any period during the previous year not being a period before the st day of January in any concern in which nay person referred to in sub section has a substantial interest We must construe it having regard to the object which the <ORG> had in view in enacting it and in the context of the setting in which it occurs The object of the above provision is to discourage investment of trust funds in the concerns in which specified persons have substantial interest and if an investment is already made in such concerns to discourage continuance thereof after December In order to attract the provisions of Section what is essential is that the funds of the trust are invested in a concern covered by Section and if such investment is made prior to January funds are continued to be not invested after December Therefore in order to attract Section it has to be established that the funds of the trust which are capable of being invested have been utilised for making investment as provided therein The word investment means to lay out money in business with a view to obtain income or profit It was observed that it would be doing violence to the plain language of the provision The interpretation suggested by learned counsel for <ORG> would do violence to the plain language used There is no room for any intendment There is no equity about a tax There is no presumption as to a tax As indicated above several High Courts have taken the view expressed by <ORG> in <ORG> case supra Accordingly we answer the question referred in the affirmative in favor of the assessed and against revenue
