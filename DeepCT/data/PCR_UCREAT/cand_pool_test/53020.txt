The deduction was disallowed by the departmental authorities and the question was answered against the assessee by <ORG> Expenditure incurred to resist in a civil proceeding the enforcement of a measure legislative or executive which imposes restrictions on the carrying on of a business or to obtain a declaration that the measure is invalid would Expenditure may not be denied admission as a permissible deduction in computing the taxable income merely because the proceeding has failed It was recited in the order that nothing in this Order shall apply to a sale or delivery made in pursuance of clause A of the said order to any dealer in yarn not engaged in the production of cloth on handlooms or powerless This petition was dismissed by <NAME> and the order of dismissal was confirmed in appeal by <ORG> The matter was then carried in appeal to <ORG> They held agreeing with <ORG> that the expression deliver in cl sub cl of the Cotton Cloth and Yarn Control Order is used in its ordinary broad sense of handing over possession as distinct from passing of property and would include delivery of possession to a bailer and Rs for the assessment years and respectively as being expenditure wholly and exclusively laid out for the purpose of its business Act on the footing that the two amounts represented expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively by the <ORG> for the purpose of its business The averments made by the <ORG> in the petition under of the Specific Relief Act are somewhat involved but in substance the claim of the <ORG> was that <ORG> was incompetent to pass the order dated February which placed restrictions on the business of the <ORG> and the order was likely to cause irreparable and irretrievable injury and it was prayed that an order do issue under of the Specific Relief Act restraining <ORG> from enforcing the order and the Textile Commissioner be prohibited by an order from seizing the yarn delivered to the weavers outside the factory and be further ordered to restore the yarn already seized No clear averment was made in the petition about the date on which the yarn seized had been delivered by the <ORG> to the weavers This petition failed because <ORG> had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition and also because the expression deliver used in cl of the Control Order included handing over of yarn to the weavers outside the premises of the factory for conversion into cloth But expenditure incurred in prosecuting a civil proceeding relating to the business of an assessee is admissible as expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business even if the proceeding is decided against the assessee However wrongheaded ill advised unduly optimistic or overconfident in his conviction the assessee may appear in the light of the ultimate decision expenditure in starting and prosecuting the proceeding may not be denied admission as a permissible deduction in computing the taxable income merely because the proceeding has failed if otherwise the expenditure is laid out for the purpose of the business wholly and exclusively i reasonably and honestly incurred to promote the interest of the business Expendi ture incurred not with a view to direct and immediate benefit for purposes of commercial expediency and in order indirectly to facilitate the carrying on of the business is therefore expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purposes of the trade The object of the petition filed by the <ORG> was to secure a declaration that the order dated February insofar as it sought to put restrictions upon the right of the <ORG> to carry on its business in the manner in which it was accustomed to do was unauthorized and to prevent enforcement of that order thereby the <ORG> was seeking to obtain an order from the Court enabling the business to be carried on without interference Expenditure incurred in that behalf would without doubt be expenditure laid out wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business of the <ORG> Reliance was placed upon the judgment of this Court in <NAME> case in which it was held that a person who was prosecuted for an offence under of the Hoarding and Profiteering Ordinance on a charge of selling goods at prices higher than were reasonable in contravention of the provisions of thereof and a part of his stock was seized and taken away was not entitled to claim deduction under xv of the Income tax Act for the sums spent in defending the criminal proceedings against him because the expenditure could not be said to have been laid out and expended wholly and exclusively for the purpose of the business But the assumption underlying the argument is not true The <ORG> has in the statement of the case observed in paragraph Subsequently on th February a proper order by the appropriate authority was passed and it is common ground that after that date at any rate no further distribution of yarn was made by the assessee the prohibition the appellant continued to deliver yarn to such owners in order as already mentioned that they might turn the yarn into But the <ORG> has observed in its order dismissing the appeal filed by the <ORG> that it was not disputed before them that after February the <ORG> did not distribute any yam The question referred in this case must be decided not on what was found or observed by <ORG> in appeal from order in the proceedings under of the Specific Relief Act or by <ORG> but upon findings of fact recorded by <ORG> also thought that expenditure to fall within the terms of xv must be one for the purpose of earning income and there was no material on the record to show that the expenditure was so incurred This Court in Commissioner of Income tax Kerala <ORG> observed The expression for the purpose of the business is wider in scope than the expression for the purpose of earning profits Expenditure incurred to resist in a civil proceeding the enforcement of a measure legislative or executive which imposes restrictions on the carrying on of a business or to obtain a declaration that the measure is invalid would if other conditions are satisfied be admissible in our judgment under xv as a permissible deduction in the computation of taxable income The question referred is answered in the affirmative
