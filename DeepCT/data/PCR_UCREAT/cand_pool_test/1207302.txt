In appeal to this Court it was contended on behalf of the appellant Company that because of the improvement effected under <ORG> the running of the business of <ORG> got improved and thus the betterment fee required to be paid under the scheme had a direct nexus with the running of the business of assessee On behalf of the revenue it was contended that there must be a direct connection with the business activities and the expenditure made and a remote connection with the business activities is not relevant for the purpose of treating the expenditure as revenue expenditure The appellant preferred an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner Since there was no direct nexus between the expenditure incurred by the <ORG> and the increase in the value of the property the expenditure incurred by the assessee for payment of betterment charge must be held to be revenue expenditure It was held that consequently the expenditure incurred by way of the betterment contribution could not be called as an expenditure of a capital nature and therefore such payment was deductible from the income of the assessee Mr <NAME> relying on the aforesaid decision of <ORG> has contended that the betterment charges paid by the appellant assessee should also be construed as revenue expenditure because there was no direct nexus between the expenditure incurred by the <ORG> and the increase in the value of the property of the assessee Mr <NAME> has referred to a decision of <ORG> in <NAME> of Jubbulpore Commissioner of Income Tax Berar Nagpur reported in I In the said case the assessee a private company was carrying on business in the manufacture and sale of sugar This Court held in the said decision that the first contribution at the instance of the Collector towards the construction of Deoni Dam was not deductible expenditure under Section xv of the Income Tax Act because the said amount was contributed long after the construction of the dam and the roads in question had also been constructed long back and there was nothing to show that the contribution of the amount had anything to do with the business of the Company or the construction of the dam or the roads was in any way advantageous to the assessee business This Court has noted that it was true that the advantage secured for the business of the assessee was of a long duration inasmuch as it would last so long as the roads continued to be motorable but it was not an advantage in the capital field because no tangible or intangible asset was acquired by the assessee nor there was any addition to an expansion of the profit making apparatus of the assessee The learned counsel appearing for the respondent has however contended that unless it can be demonstrated that the expenditure is exclusively for business purpose the same cannot be held to be a revenue expenditure and as such deductible from the income of the assessee He has submitted that <ORG> has failed to appreciate that the expenses incurred by making payment of betterment fees was in essence an expenditure on account of increase in the valuation of the land of the assessee and such expenditure has no direct nexus with the day to day running of the business In <ORG> case supra it has been specifically indicated by this Court that the assessee did not acquire any tangible or intangible right on the roads constructed in and around the factory but because of such roads constructed day to day running of the business was improved by minimising the operational cost in manufacturing sugar We therefore find no reason to interfere with the decision of <ORG> by accepting the reasonings of <ORG> in <ORG> case supra
