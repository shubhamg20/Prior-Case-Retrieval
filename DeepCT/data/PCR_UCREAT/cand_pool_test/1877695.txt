DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH DR A ANAND <NAME> JUDGMENT JUDGMENT SCR The Judgment of the Court were delivered by DR <NAME> On <NAME> of <ORG> filed a petition seeking issuance of a writ of habeas corpus for the release of <NAME> from illegal and unauthorised custody of <ORG> and for his production in Court A direction was issued by us to respondent No to produce the detenu <NAME> and the taxi driver <NAME> if in detention in this Court on Respondents to were also directed to file an affidavit indicating the circumstances under which they took the detenu and the driver of the taxi car <NAME> into custody as alleged in the petition and in the affidavit of <NAME> Notices by ordinary means were issued to respondents and In para of the affidavit he stated That in reply to para No of the petition it is submitted that neither of the alleged detenues namely <NAME> or <NAME> are were wanted in any case of Hissar District nor they were over detained or confined by any police officer official as alleged it is also wrong and hence denied that the said alleged detenues are or over were in the unlawful illegal and unauthorised custody of the official respondents as alleged On the said date the deponent was present in court when the application was filed on behalf of <NAME> It is consequently submitted that the deponent could not be involved in the incident as alleged in the writ petition nor does he have any knowledge that any other police officer working in the Sadar Hissar Police Station has indulged in such activity Respondent No <NAME> Superintendent of Police in his affidavit asserted That in reply to para No of the petition it is submitted that neither of the alleged detenues namely <NAME> or <NAME> are were wanted in any case of Hissar District nor they were ever detained or confined by any police officer official as alleged Thus respondents to in their affidavits denied the allegations levelled against Haryana Police with regard to the whisking away of <NAME> and driver <NAME> on and their sub sequent detention thereby refuting the assertions made in the affidavit of <NAME> Advocate and the petitioner An affidavit disclosing from where they have been brought and the whereabouts of the taxi as men tioned above shall also be filed on behalf of Respondent No However one more affidavit was filed by <NAME> Superintendent of Police respondent No on behalf of respondent Nos to In the said affidavit it was stated that respondents to with the help of Delhi Police had been able to identify the taxi stand form where taxi No DEA operated and that they were also able to ascertain the whereabouts of driver <NAME> and had contacted him He went on to depose that since some personnel of <ORG> had visited his residence the previous evening and had met his sister leaving directions for him to appear in the court he had come to the court on his own He further stated that <ORG> had contacted him at the taxi stand and that <ORG> had directed him to appear in the court and that he had been brought to the court from the taxi stand by sub inspector <NAME> of <ORG> <NAME> and <NAME> and going through the affidavits filed by the parties we found that two diametrically opposite versions had been given and that the truth had not come out and that either of the two versions was false He went on to say that on when both he and the driver were in the room of the SHO Hissar there was a lot of activity and we were directed to leave the police station immediately at about Respondent No <NAME> and Respondent No <NAME> who appeared through their counsel were given an opportunity to file their affidavits in view of the assertions made in the affidavit of <NAME> on In our order dated we observed Though the petition for Habeas Corpus under Article of the Constitution of India in the facts and circumstances of the case which have come on record does not survive as at the time of the return the detenu was not on his own showing under any illegal detention and technically therefore the writ petition does not survive but keeping in view the developments which have taken place during the proceedings of this case we cannot let the matters rest there We accordingly directed the <ORG> to have the matter enquired into under the supervision of an officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police and submit a report to this Court within seven weeks These three respondents denied the allegations made by <NAME> <NAME> Advocate and the petitioner in the writ petition The counters filed by respondents to denying the allegations made by the petitioner and in the affidavit of <NAME> Puri are palpably false and incorrect They took away <NAME> along with the taxi for producing him in <ORG> According to the statement of <NAME> taxi driver before the <ORG> respondents and had pressurised him to make a false statement in this Court and deny the allegations contained in the petition and in the affidavit of <NAME> Advocate and that he had acted accordingly for fear of the Haryana <ORG> He was firm that he was making a correct statement before the <ORG> and regrets having made a false statement in <ORG> earlier on the advice of Haryana Police This lends assurance to the conclusion that the statement being made by him now is a correct version of facts and this finds corroboration in the statement of <NAME> and <NAME> Advocate Since prima facie we found that respondents to and <NAME> taxi driver have made false statements and filed false affidavits in this court and have thus committed the offence of perjury therefore with a view to eradicate the evil of perjury we put them on notice to show cause as to why they should not be prosecuted for the said offence in a competent court As already noticed the affidavit filed by respondent No on had been filed on behalf of respondents to Notices were therefore issued to respondents to and <NAME> also to show cause why they should not be punished for having committed contempt of this <ORG> He then again stated that the answering respondent was not connected with the incidents of way laid sic and detaining of <NAME> or <NAME> in any manner and that he had no hand in the filing of the affidavit by Respondent No on He also wrote a letter to <NAME> and that after he had asked <ORG> and the senior counsel as to whether any further action was required to be taken by him and in particular whether in view of the fact that the detenues had appeared before the court on any affidavit was required to be filed by him and that he was advised by senior counsel that on his reading of the order no affidavit needed to be filed by him as the State had not produced the detenues Respondent No then explained the procedure which was being followed by the State of Haryana in connection with petitions for habeas corpus and stated that Although the <ORG> of Haryana is impleaded in criminal writs in the name of Home Secretary the practice so far has been that in matter which are directly within the knowledge of the local police it is they who depose an affidavit on behalf of the <ORG> Both the affidavits were however silent about the contents of the affidavit filed by respondent No on behalf of respondents to on Further affidavits were therefore filed by both respondents and to explain their position vis a vis the affidavit filed by respondent No on on behalf of respondents to He went on to state that after going through that affidavit which he had no occasion to see before it was filed as well as perusing the report and the evidence marshalled by the <ORG> he had no reason to differ from the opinion given by the <ORG> and went on to specifically say As regards that part of the affidavit where <NAME> has suggested that <NAME> and <NAME> were not in the custody of <ORG> the <ORG> has prima facie for otherwise and I have no reason to differ form the view expressed by the <ORG> <NAME> IPS respondent No also in his additional affidavit besides once again tendering unqualified apology stated that he had not seen the affidavit of <NAME> before it was filed in this Court on and that it was only upon a request made by him that the copy of the affidavit was later on sent to him at Chandigarh Respondent No thereafter dealt specifically with the statement made by <NAME> in his affidavit dated and denying the allegations made in the petition and deposed The <ORG> enquiries on the other hand have shown that this version does not appear to be correct That the affidavit filed in reply to the habeas corpus petition by respondent No on behalf of respondents to on denying the allegations is false That the affidavits filed by respondents to denying the way laying of the detenu and others on and their subsequent detention at the police station are false That the affidavit filed by respondent No on on behalf of respondents to was filed by him without the express knowledge of respondents and and both of them had not seen the said affidavit till its copy was supplied to them by the counsel for the State of Haryana The question therefore which now requires our consideration is as to what action is required to be taken against the respondents Section of the Contempt of Courts Act for short the Act defines criminal contempt as the publication whether by words spoken or written or by signs or visible representation or otherwise of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever to scandalised or tend to scandalise or lower or tend to lower the authority of any court prejudice or interfere or tend to interfere with the due course of judicial proceedings or interfere or tend to interfere with or obstruct or tend to obstruct the administration of justice in any other manner Thus any conduct which has the tendency to interfere with the administration of justice or the due course of judicial proceedings amounts to the commission of criminal contempt Filing of false affidavits or making false statement on oath in Courts aims at striking a blow at the Rule of Law and no court can ignore such conduct which has the tendency to shake public confidence in the judicial institutions because the very structure of an ordered life is put at stake Had respon dents to been sincere in their apologies and had they realised their mistake there was no reason why respondents and should have sub sequently indulged in acts which have the effect of aggravating their contumacious conduct Subsequently not only before the <ORG> but also in this <ORG> <NAME> realised his mistake and gave the correct version of the occurrence and also disclosed as to how and why he had made the false statement Under the circumstances the question of accepting their belated apology for which a very strong plea was made by their learned counsel Mr <NAME> Mr <NAME> and Mr <NAME> does not arise and we have no hesitation whatsoever in rejecting the belated apologies tendered by respondents to which we do not find to be genuine bonafide or expression of true repentance Though respondent No was present in Haryana Bhavan on and but there is no material on the record to show that he was also a party to the tampering of evidence of <NAME> We sentence respondent No to suffer simple imprisonment for a period of two months for committing contempt of court by filing false affidavits denying the allegations made in the writ petition and in the affidavit of <NAME> So far as respondents and are concerned there is no material to show that they are either responsible for the filing of the false affidavits by respondents to or for tampering of evidence during the pendency of proceedings in this Court May be respondents to acted in the objectionable and high handed manner to way lay and detain Shri <NAME> and <NAME> during the investigation of the case FIR No registered on the statement of respondent No at <NAME> Hissar to please someone but this is only in the realm of suspicion and it cannot be said with any amount of certainty whether it was over zealous ness on the part of respondents to during the investigation of the case or they were trying to prove themselves to be more loyal than the king or were acting under any extrneous pressure Whenever a question is raised regarding the illegal detention of a citizen in a writ of Habeas Corpus and the court issues the rule nisi a duty is cast on the <ORG> through its functionaries and particularly those who are arrayed as respondents to the writ petition to satisfy the court that the detention of the citizen was legal and in conformity not only with the mandatory requirements of the law but also with the requirements implicit in Article of the Constitution of India The right of personal liberty of a citizen is all too precious and no one can be permitted to interfere with it except in accordance with the procedure established by law Respondents and were therefore under a legal obligation to inform this <ORG> of the facts regarding the alleged detention of <NAME> and <NAME> since notice had been issued to them in the writ petition In his affidavit dated filed in response to the notice to show cause in the contempt proceedings respondent No stated After th January I made further enquiries from our legal department including Senior Counsel as to whether any further action was required to be taken by me in this matter and in particular whether in view of the fact that detenues had appeared before <ORG> on th January I had a bonafide and genuine doubt as to what precise course of action was to be adopted by me We do not think that there was any scope for not understanding the import of our order dated wherein a specific direction had been given to respondent No to file his affidavit We have no reason to doubt that a senior IAS Officer of the status of the Home Secretary of a <ORG> would not be aware of the provisions of Article of the Constitution which mandates that all authorities civil and judicial in the territory of India shall act in aid of the Supreme <ORG> He has then averred that a decision has now been taken by the <ORG> to create an independent Cell at the Police Headquarters at Chandigarh as well as in <ORG> to monitor all cases where writs of Habeas Corpus are sought by citizens either from <ORG> or from this Court so that without delay the requisite information can be placed before the courts by the appropriate authority and no lapses occur on the part of the <ORG> in that behalf in future So far as respondent No is concerned he also failed to appreciate his obligations and did not file a counter affidavit although notice was issued to him also in the habeas corpus petition So far as <NAME> taxi driver is concerned he on his own showing has made a false statement in this Court It is however no defence for him to say that he so acted on account of the fear of the police of Haryana and that he had been tutored by respondents and to make a false statement and file a false affidavit in this Court Since from the report of the <ORG> and our own independent appraisal of the evidence recorded bv the <ORG> we have come to the conclusion that <NAME> and <NAME> had been illegally detained by respondents to from the afternoon of to the <ORG> must be held responsible for the unlawful acts of its officers and it must repair the damage done to the citizens by its officers for violating their indivisible fundamental right of personal liberty without any authority of law in an absolutely high handed manner We would have been therefore inclined to direct the <ORG> Government of Haryana to compensate <NAME> and <NAME> but since <NAME> has indulged in false hood in this Court and <NAME> has also exaggerated the incident by stating that on when he was way laid along with <NAME> and <NAME> Advocate two employees of respondents and were also present with the police party which version has not been found to be correct by the <ORG> they both have disentitled themselves from receiving any compensation as monetary amends for the wrong done by respondents to in detaining them We therefore do not direct the payment of any compensation to them <NAME> I have had the advantage of reading the judgment written by my learned brother Dr <NAME> and I entirely endorse what has been said by him the orders passed and the directions given by my learned brother But with profound respect to my learned brother I propose to express a few concurring observations of my own as I cannot remain without expressing my anguish and grave displeasure on the undesirable conduct with which the said police officials have projected themselves
