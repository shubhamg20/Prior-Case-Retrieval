Rule iv deals with a special situation in which an officer initially appointed to Class service is given seniority in the same manner as a departmental promotee if subsequent to his passing the departmental examination he is appointed in Class I on the results of the competitive examination The three respondents were however shown as seniors to the appellant as deemed promotees under iV The appellant filed a writ petition in <ORG> and contended that iii and iv of the Seniority Rules and of the Promotion Rules were discriminatory and violative of Arts and of the Constitution and that during there was excessive recruitment of promotees in violation of the quota rule prescribing the ratio of A rule which gives seniority to outstanding officers with considerable experience and selected on merit and limiting the promotion to a percentage not exceeding the prescribed limit cannot per se be regarded as unreasonable Otherwise a promotee certified fit by <ORG> in will be senior to the direct recruits who completed their probation in that year but the seniority Would be an empty formality For if the promotee officer is not allowed to count his period of service in Class for the purpose of promotion to Grade I Class he will have to wait till or to go to Grade Class I while direct recruits who completed their probation in or could go to Grade I Class I in or counting the years period from the date on which they were placed on probation A The appellant was entitled to a Writ in the nature of mandamus commanding respondents to to adjust the seniority of the appellant and other officers similarly situated and to prepare a fresh seniority list in accordance with law after adjusting the recruitment for the period to and onwards in accordance with the quota rule Rule of the Income ax Officers Class I Grade II Service Recruitment Rules is a statutory rule and there is a statutory duty cast on the <ORG> under this rule to determine the method to be employed for the purpose of filling the vacancies and the number of candidates to be recruited Having fixed the quota under the rule there is no discretion left with the <ORG> to alter it according to the exigencies of the situation or to deviate from it in any particular year at its own will and pleasure For the future years <ORG> should adopt the roster system by framing an appropriate rule for working out the quota between the direct recruits and the promotees and the roster should be maintained indicating the order in which appointment are made by direct recruitment and by promotion in accordance with the percentage fixed under the statutory rules JUDGMENT CIVIL APPELLATE ORIGINAL JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No of The appellant appeared in person in A No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Civil Appeal No of This appeal is brought by certificate from the judgment of <ORG> dated March dismissing the Writ petition of the appellant Civil Writ No of of the Constitution the appellant <NAME> challenged the constitutional validity of what has been described as the seniority rule in regard to Income tax Service Class Grade along with the improper implementation of the quota recruitment to that Service as infringing the guarantee of Arts These rules laid down the principle for determination of seniority a as between direct recruits recruited on the result of the combined competitive examination as between promotees selected from Class and as between the direct recruits who complete their probation in a given year and the promotees in the same year for appointment to Class rule I as framed in was as follows The seniority of direct recuits recruited on the results of the examinations held by <ORG> in and subsequent years shall be reckoned as follows i Direct recruits of an earlier examination shall rank above those recruited from subsequent examination CI direct recruits who complete their probation during that year or after and are confirmed with effect from a date in that year or after The seniority of direct recruits recruited on the results of the examinations held by <ORG> in and subsequent years shall be reckoned as follows i Direct recruits of an earlier examination shall rank above those recruited from a subsequent examination ii Direct recruits of any one examination shall rank inter se in accordance with the ranks obtained by them at that examination iii Officers promoted in accordance with the recommendation of the <ORG> before the next meeting of the <ORG> shall be senior to all direct recruits appointed on the results of the examinations held by <ORG> during the calendar year in which the <ORG> met and the three previous years iii Notwithstanding anything contained in clause iii The effect of clause iii of Rule is that the promotee becomes senior to the direct recruit who has completed a probationary period of two years in the very year in which <ORG> meets recommending the officers in Class for promotion to Class Clause iv of rule deals with a special situation in which an officer initially appointed to Class Service is given seniority in the same manner as a departmental promotee if subsequent to his passing the departmental examination in Class he is appointed to Class I on the results of the combined competitive examination held by <ORG> The promotions are made on the basis of seniority subject to fitness and not by selection However in the initial stages of the re organisation of <ORG> several senior officers were promoted direct from Class to Class Grade but such promotions will not ordinarily take place in future The <ORG> has ruled that the promotion to Class Grade I of officiating I class Grade whose retention in that grade has been approved by <ORG> would also be in the nature of promotion from I Class Grade III to I Class Grade I and require consultation with the <ORG> even though the promotion from I Class Grade to Class Grade I is made on the basis of seniority cum fitness without reference to <ORG> <ORG> of <ORG> rejected the writ petition of the appellant holding that the principles for determining seniority between direct recruits and promotees laid down in rule iii and iv were not discriminatory and there was no infringement of Arts The first question to be considered in this appeal is whether rule iii of the seniority rules as framed in violates the guarantee under Arts It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the impugned rule was upon an unjustifiable classification between direct recruits and promotees after they had entered into It was contended that there was a discrimination between officers of Class Grade Service after their recruitment and the actual working of the rule kept on pushing down the direct recruits and postponing their chances of promotion to higher posts in <ORG> It was submitted that all officers appointed to Class Grade II Service formed one class and after the officers have been once recruited there could be no distinction between direct recruits and promotees In other words it was contended that the promotees and direct recruits became one class immediately on entry and thereafter there cannot be any class within that class Having regard to the particular circumstances of this case we are of opinion that the seniority rule is not unreasonable when read with the quota rule which provides for a special reservation of a small percentage of posts for the promotees who are selected by a special Committee which determines the fitness of the candidates for promotion after they have put in at least three years of service as Income tax Officers A rule which gives seniority to outstanding officers with considerable experience and selected on merit and limiting the promotion to a percentage not exceeding the prescribed limit cannot per se be regarded as unreasonable It is necessary to add that the selection of a promotee to Class I is based on merit and great weightage is given by <ORG> to outstanding qualifications record of work and the ability of the can didate so that those who come to Class Grade are officers who have shown outstanding capability as Income tax Officers in Class Service of the Constitution there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the <ORG> or to promotion from one office to a higher office thereunder It gives effect to the doctrine of equality in the matter of appointment and promotion to the initial employment and nothing else but that clearly is only one of the matters relating to employment The other matters relating to employment would inevitably be the provision as to the salary and periodical increments therein terms as to leave as to gratuity as to pension and as to the age of superannuation These are all matters relating to employment and they are and must deemed to be included in the expression matters relating to employment in Art guaranttees is equality of opportunity to all citizens in respect of all the matters relating to employment illustrated by us as well as to an appointment to any office as explained by us If that be so there would be no difficulty in holding that the matters relating to employment must include all matters in relation to employment both prior and This <ORG> further observed in that case Art The words in respect of only employment used in Art must therefore include all matters relating to employment as specified in We next proceed to consider the argument of the appellant that the rule of promotion from I Income tax Officers Class Grade II to Class Grade I is discriminatory in character In our opinion there is no substance in the contention of the appellant Once it is held that the rule of seniority enacted in rule iii is legally valid the rule of promotion i rule of Ch IX of the Central Board of Revenue Office Procedure Manual cannot be held to lead to any discrimination as between direct recruits and promotees The promotee is placed senior to a direct recruit who completes probation in the year in which the promotee is selected by <ORG> For example a promotee certified fit by <ORG> in will be senior to the direct recruits who complete their probation in that year To remove this anomaly the promotion rule has been framed and we are unable to accept the argument of the appellant that there is any discrimination in the working of this rule In regard to rule iv of the Seniority Rules there are only three respondents i respondents and who have been promoted as deemed promotees under this clause of the rule There was also the further consideration that if rule iv did not exist there was no incentive to a promotee of this type to sit for the competitive examination It should also be taken into account that if the service of the promotees in Class Grade III is entirely ignored and if they join the Class Grade Service as direct recruits they might well find themselves becoming junior to those who were left behind in Class II Grade Ill Service by the operation of rule iii We proceed to consider the next question arising for consi deration in this appeal viz the allegation of the appellant that there was excessive recruitment of promotees in violation of the quota rule Rule states Vacancies in the Service which are filled otherwise than by promotion shall be apportioned between to the writpetition of the appellant it is stated that the recruitment to Grade of Class I will be made partly by promotion and partly by direct recruitment and that of the vacancies arising in the Grade will be filled by direct recruitment through the Indian Audit and Allied Services Examination and the remaining vacancies will be filled on the basis of promotion by selection provided suitable number of men are available for promotion It was also stated in the letter that if there are any vacancies which could not be filled by promotion for want of suitable candidates these will be added to the quota of vacancies to be filled by direct recruitment There has been no argument in this case with regard to the operation of the rule between the years and though in the petition the appellant has alleged that in those years also there were excessive recruitments of promotees According to the appellant there was excessive recruitment of promotees more than the figure permitted by the quota rule In his affidavit dated January Mr <NAME> said that he was not able to work out in spite of his best endeavours the number of vacancies arising in a particular year The Solicitor General said that there was however substantial compliance with the quota rule It is not disputed that rule of the Income tax Officers Class Grade II Service Recruitment Rules is a statutory rule and there is a statutory duty cast on the <ORG> under this rule to determine the method or methods to be employed for the purpose of filling the vacancies and In the letter of the <ORG> of India dated October there is no specific reference to rule but the quota fixed in their letter must be deemed to have been fixed by the <ORG> of India in exercise of the statutory power given under rule We are of opinion that having fixed the quota in exercise of their power under rule between the two sources of recruitment there is no discretion left with the <ORG> of India to Alter that quota according to the exigencies of the situation or to deviate from the quota in any particular year at its own will and pleasure Discretion as Lord <NAME> stated it in classic terms in the case of <NAME> means sound discretion guided by law For these reasons we allow this appeal in part and order that a writ in the nature of Mandamus should be granted to the appellant to the extent indicated above Writ Petition No of The questions arising for determination in this case are similar in character to the questions which have been the subject matter of consideration in Civil Appeal No of For the reasons given in that case we hold that this petition should be allowed and a writ in the nature of mandamus under Art Appeal allowed in part
