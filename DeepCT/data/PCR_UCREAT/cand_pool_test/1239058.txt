HEADNOTE The appellant landlord filed a civil suit against the respondent tenant for possession of a shop which had been rented out by him in The Judgment and Order of <ORG> set aside and order of the Sub Judge restored Those provisions world not be applicable under Section to a suit instituted within years from the date of the completion of the building in question The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> <NAME> Special leave granted The suit was filed for recovery of possession on the termination or expiry of the period of tenancy For our present purpose it would suffice if we bear in mind two relevant provisions Section of the Act provides as follows Nothing in this Act shall apply to any building the construction of which is completed on or after the commencement of this Act for a period of ten years from the date its completion In the PG NO premises the learned Judge of <ORG> dismissed the suit pending before the Sub Judge Aggrieved thereby the appellant has come up in appeal to this Court The only point that was urged before this Court in that decision was whether the premises which was not ten years old on the date of the suit and was exempted from the operation of the new Rent Act could be governed by it if ten years expired during the pendency of the litigation The tenant had resisted the claim on the ground that having regard to the date of construction of the building it was covered by the Act that the plaint having not been amended so as to bring the suit under the Act it was barred by section and that term was no default in payment of rent The question was whether the premises which was not ten years old on the PG NO date of the suit and was exempted from the operation of the Rent Act would be governed by it if ten years expired during the pendency of the litigation It was held that the contention that the Court had to decide the case on the basis of cause of action that accrued prior to the date of filing the suit and not on a new cause of action was not sustainable It was held that during the pendency of the litigation even if years expired the restriction under section will not be attracted as the suit had been instituted within years This Court referred to the words used in section of the said Act which emphasised that no suit shall be instituted for eviction This clearly indicates that the restriction put under section of the said Act is to the institution of the suit itself and therefore it is clear that if the provision of PG NO this Act applies then no suit for eviction can be instituted except on the grounds specified in the sub sections of that section of the Act This applies more so in the instant case where the section of the Act provides that the tenant in possession of a building or a rented land shall not be evicted therefrom except in accordance with the provisions of this section Those provisions would not be applicable to a suit instituted within years from the date of the completion of the building in question It appears therefore that though we are concerned with seeking of intention we are rather looking to the meaning of the words that the legislator has used and the true meaning of what words as was said by Lord <NAME> in <ORG> <ORG> Appeal Cases at We are clearly of the opinion that having regard to the language we must find the reason and the spirit of the law The judgment and order of <ORG> are set aside and the order of the learned Sub Judge is restored
