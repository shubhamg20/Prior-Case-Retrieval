DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH FAZALALI SYED MURTAZA BENCH FAZALALI SYED MURTAZA REDDY CHINNAPPA CITATION AIR SCR SCC SCALE CITATOR INFO SC SC ACT Retrospective operation of law Order levying duty on <NAME> issued Order whether applies to existing stocks or only to future stocks Price fixed less than manufacturing cost Order if liable to be quashed Moreover since the petitioners were allowed to sell freely at any rate they liked the remaining of sugar after excluding the which they had to give to levey as also the produce by the second and third processes the loss if any caused to the petitioners would be minimal The Order of the Court was delivered by <NAME> Having heard counsel for the parties at great length we are satisfied that there is no violation of the fundamental right of the petitioners enshrined in Art There is therefore no good ground to entertain the petitions There are however two arguments urged before us which need special mention So far as this argument is concerned we find no substance in the same because it is not a question of retrospectivity of the statute but its actual working This section is to be read as if it were contained in the Act of and is dealing with a subject matter mentioned in the Act of and as to which there is in that Act a provision that the enactment shall apply to leases made either before or after commencement of the Act <NAME> in a concurring judgment while construing second amendment in section of the Conveyancing Act pointed out thus In the First place the language of the section is perfectly general in all leases and there is nothing in the section itself to confine it to leases subsequent to the Act this Court observed as follows If fair price is to be fixed leaving a reasonable margin of profit there is never any question of infringement of fundamental right to carry on business by imposing reasonable restrictions In determining the reasonableness of a restriction imposed by law in the field of industry trade or commerce it has to be remembered that the mere fact that some of those who are engaged in these are alleging loss after the imposition of law will not render the law unreasonable Emphasis Supplied Similar view was taken by this <ORG> in the case of <ORG> and <ORG> <ORG> where the <ORG> speaking through <ORG> observed as follows It has also to be remembered that the object is to secure equitable distribution and availability at fair prices so that it is the interest of the consumer and not of the producer which is the determining factor in applying any objective tests at any particular time Lastly it was urged that Sub Clause which is Sub Clause in the notification issued by <ORG> in the impugned notification issued by the Government is extremely arbitrary inasmuch as by insisting on certificates it deprived the petitioners of the free sale of sugar of the remaining amount of fifty per cent as also the Khandsari produced by second and third processes We see some force in this argument but the Attorney General frankly conceded that he will see that no inconvenience on this score is caused to the petitioners
