DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH RAMASWAMI BENCH RAMASWAMI BHARGAVA VISHISHTHA DAYAL RAGHUBAR CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC RF SC SC SC RF SC SC SC RF SC SC SC ACT Arbitration Error of law apparent on the face of award what is Jurisdiction of court to examine evidence HEADNOTE The disputes between the appellant and respondent in regard to certain contracts were referred to arbitration For the purpose of establishing the first error the appellant relied on affidavits filed and statements made by the parties before the arbitrator The court has no jurisdiction to investigate into the merits of the case and to examine the documentary and oral evidence on the record for the purpose of finding out ii The arbitrator had jurisdiction to grant interest on the amount of the award from the date of the award till the date of the decree as all questions including that of interest were referred to the arbitrator The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These appeals are brought by certificate from the judgment of <ORG> dated August in Appeals Nos and of by which <ORG> allowed the appeals against <ORG> hereinafter called the appellant in part and modified the award of the arbitrator and the judgment of <NAME> The disputes relate to contracts for the supply of bedsteads by the respondent <ORG> called the <ORG> to the appellant namely contract No A for the supply of bedsteads contract No A for the supply of bedsteads and contract No A for the supply of bedsteads The disputes arising between the <ORG> and the appellant out of the three contracts were referred to the arbitration of Sir <NAME> The appellant thereafter applied to <ORG> for setting aside the award on the ground that there was an error of law apparent on the face of the award and the arbitrator had also exceeded his authority in awarding interest The appellant preferred two appeals to <ORG> from the judgment of <NAME> namely Appeals Nos and of and modified the award accordingly The first question to be considered in these appeals is whether the arbitrator committed an error of law in holding that the appellant had deducted Rs It is not possible for us to accept this argument There were conflicting statements of the parties in the affidavits filed by them before <ORG> in connection with the application for setting aside the award On behalf of the appellant Mr <NAME> referred to the affidavits and the statements made before the arbitrator but it is well settled that the <ORG> has no juris diction to investigate into the merits of the case and to examine the documentary and oral evidence on the record for the purpose of finding out whether or not the arbitrator has committed an error of law and that the award of the arbitrator can be set aside on the ground of error of law on the face of the award only when in the award or in a document incorporated with it as for instance a note appended by the arbitrator stating the reasons for his deci sion there is found some legal proposition which is the basis of the award and which is erroneous In the present case the affidavits filed by the parties before the arbitrator are not incorporated in the award and it is therefore not permissible for the court to examine these affidavits in order to ascertain whether the arbitrator has committed any error of law in which the appellants sold cotton to the respondents by a contract which contained a submission to arbitration of disputes as to quality and a further clause submitting to arbitration all other disputes arising out of the contract The dispute was referred to arbitration and the award recited that the contract was subject to the rules of <ORG> which were not further referred to and that the respondents had rejected on the grounds contained in a letter of a certain date It was held on appeal by <ORG> that the award could not be set aside and though the award recited that the contract was subject to the rules of <ORG> yet those rules were not so incorporated in the award as to entitle the <ORG> to refer to them for ascertaining whether there was an error of law on the face of the award Applying the principle to the present case it is manifest that there is no error of law on the face of the award and the argument of the appellant on this aspect of the case must fail We next proceed to consider the argument of the appellant that the arbitrator had no authority to award interest from the date of the award dated September to the date of the decree granted by <NAME> i August But section does not apply because an arbitrator is not a court within the meaning of the Code nor does the Code apply to arbitrators and but for section even a <ORG> would not have the power to give interest after the suit <ORG> set aside the award regarding interest on the ground that the claim for interest was not referred to arbitration and the arbitrator had no jurisdiction to entertain the claim In this Court counsel for the appellant contended that the arbitrator had statutory power under the Interest Act of to award the interest and in any event he had power to award interest during the pendency of the arbitration <ORG> rejected this contention but it should be noticed that the judgment of this <ORG> in <NAME> case does not deal with the question whether the arbitrator can award interest subsequent to the passing of the award if the claim regarding interest was referred to arbitration In our opinion the arbitrator had jurisdiction in the present case to grant interest on the amount of the award from the date of the award till the date of the decree granted by <NAME> The reason is that it is an implied term of the reference that the arbitrator will decide the dispute according to existing law and give such relief with regard to interest as a court could give if it decided the dispute This clearly decides that although the Civil Procedure Act speaks in terms of a jury and only confers upon a jury a discretionary right to give interest none the less if a matter was referred to an arbitrator a matter with regard to which a jury could have given interest an arbitrator may equally give interest and that despite the language used in that Act The principle of this case was applied by <ORG> in <NAME> <ORG> and it was held that though in terms of the Law Reform Miscellaneous Provisions Act giving the court power to award interest on any debt or damages It was pointed out by <ORG> that the power of an arbitrator to award interest was derived from the submission to him which impliedly gave him power to decide all matters in difference according to the existing law of contract exercising every right and discretionary remedy given to a court of law that the Law Reform Miscellaneous Provisions Act which repealed of the Civil Procedure Act was not concerned with the powers of arbitrators and that the plaintiff was entitled to the interest awarded by the arbitrator
