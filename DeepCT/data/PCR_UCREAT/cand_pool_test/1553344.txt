Under of the Act if <ORG> either on receipt of a complaint or otherwise has reason to believe that any advocate on its roll has been guilty of professional or other misconduct it shall refer the case to its <ORG> which after due inquiry may impose certain penalties Any person aggrieved by an order of the <ORG> of <ORG> may under appeal to <ORG> The most significant feature in the matter of initiation of proceedings before the <ORG> is that no litigant and no member of the public can straightaway commence disciplinary proceedings against an advocate It is the <ORG> Council of a State which initiates the disciplinary proceedings The <ORG> Council may act on its own initiative on information which has come to its notice in the course of its duties In so acting there is no conflict between the advocate and any other person because it is professional conduct professional etiquette professional ethics professional morality which are to be upheld Bombay I referred to Beg concurring There is no objection to a participation of <ORG> in its executive capacity in a disciplinary proceeding against an advocate on its roll either at the initial or at the appellate stages Before it can become a person aggrieved by an order against which it could appeal there must have been a lis or a dispute to be decided which gives rise to the order complained of there is no reason why a right to represent this interest before its own <ORG> as well as before <ORG> on an A appeal under of the Act or a When <ORG> can have locus standi and rights of a person aggrieved affected by the results of such proceedings there is no reason why it should not be in the position of a party lo a lis or dispute between itself and the allegedly delinquent advocate The grant of a monopoly licence to practice law is based on three assumptions i there is a socially useful function for the lawyer to perform ii the lawyer is a professional person who will perform that function and iii his performance as a professional person is regulated by himself and more formally by the profession as a whole RAY These appeals were placed before this Bench for consideration of the question whether <ORG> is a person aggrieved to maintain an appeal under section of the Advocates Act hereinafter called the Act The committee also expressed the opinion that there is a prima facie case of professional misconduct The notice proceeded with the recital that it came to the notice of <ORG> that the respondents stood at the entrance of the Court House at the Presidency Magistrate Court Esplanade Fort Bombay and solicited work and generally behaved at that place in an undignified manner and the said acts amounted to professional and or other misconduct and <ORG> constituted disciplinary committee and the inquiry was entrusted to the committee consisting of Messrs <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> The respondents preferred appeals before <ORG> While setting aside the orders of the disciplinary committee of <ORG> the disciplinary committee of <ORG> stated as follows <ORG> has not appeared even though they started the proceedings suo motu and we do not pass any orders as to costs and we direct each party will bear their costs Section states that where on receipt of a complaint or otherwise <ORG> has reason to believe that any advocate on its roll has been guilty of professional other misconduct it shall refer the case for disposal to its disciplinary committee <ORG> may either of its own motion or on application made to it by any person interested withdraw a proceeding pending before its disciplinary committee and direct that inquiry to be made by another disciplinary committee of <ORG> The disciplinary committee of <ORG> may make any of the following orders namely a dismiss the complaint or where the proceedings were initiated at the instance of <ORG> direct that the proceedings be filed reprimand the advocate suspend the advocate for such period as it may deem fit remove the name of the advocate from the state roll of advocates Section speaks of disciplinary powers of <ORG> and provides that where on receipt of a complaint or otherwise <ORG> has reason to believe that any advocate whose name is not entered on any <ORG> roll has been guilty of professional or other misconduct it shall refer the case for disposal to its disciplinary committee The disciplinary committee of <ORG> may either of its own motion or on a report by any <ORG> Bar Council or on an application made to it by any person interested withdraw for inquiry before itself any proceeding for disciplinary action against any advocate pending before the disciplinary committee of any <ORG> Bar Council and dispose of the same This section states that any person aggrieved by an order of the disciplinary committee of <ORG> or the Advocate General of the state may within sixty days of the date of communication of the order prefer an appeal to <ORG> Section provides for appeal to <ORG> Section states that any person aggrieved by an order made by the disciplinary committee of <ORG> under section or section or the Attorney General of India or the Advocate General of the <ORG> as the case may be may prefer an appeal to <ORG> Section of the Act provides that <ORG> may make rules for discharging its functions under the Act and in particular such rules may prescribe inter alia the standards of professional conduct and etiquette to be observed by advocates The fifth section lays down restrictions on advocates on other employments The question for consideration is the meaning of the words any person aggrieved by an order made by the disciplinary committee of <ORG> occurring in section of the Act In the Maharashtra case supra the disciplinary committee of <ORG> was satisfied that that there was no reason to hold <NAME> guilty of professional misconduct or other misconduct It is in this background that amendments have been introduced into sections and of the Act conferring right of appeal on the Advocate General of <ORG> and the Attorney General of India under sections and respectively The person must be aggrieved by the order and not by the consequences which ensue Fourth a person can be said to be aggrieved by an order which is to his detriment pecuniary or otherwise or causes him some prejudice in some form or other Finally an appeal could have been filed by the Advocate General or the Attorney General of India who have the right to appeal but they have chosen not to do so One of the principal functions of <ORG> in regard to standards of professional conduct and etiquette of advocates is to receive complaints against advocates and if <ORG> has reason to believe that any advocate has been guilty of professional or other misconduct it shall refer the case for disposal to its disciplinary committee <ORG> cil of a <ORG> may also of its own motion if it has reason to believe that any advocate has been gui<ORG>y of professional or other misconduct it shall refer the case for disposal to its disciplinary committee It is apparent that a <ORG> Bar Council not only receives a complaint but is required to apply its mind to find out whether there is any reason to believe that any advocate has ben gui<ORG>y of professional or other misconduct <ORG> is the Bar Council of a <ORG> which initiates the disciplinary proceedings In finding out the meaning of the words person aggrieved by an order made by the disciplinary committee of <ORG> two features are to be kept in the fore front The complaint is examined by <ORG> in order to find out whether there is any reason to believe that any advocate has been guilty of misconduct <ORG> may act on its own initiative on information which has come to its notice in the course of its duties In so acting there is no conflict between the advocate and another person First under section A of the Act <ORG> may either of its own motion or on an application made to it by any person interested withdraw a proceeding pending before its disciplinary committee and direct the inquiry to be made by ant other disciplinary committee of <ORG> Some times it is said that the words person aggrieved correspond to the requirement of locus standi which arises in relation to judicial remedies Where a right of appeal to Courts against an administrative or judicial decision is created by statute the right is invariably confined to a person aggrieved or a person who claims to be aggrieved One of the meanings is that a person will be held to be aggrieved by a decision if that decision is materially adverse to him The meaning of the words a person aggrieved is sometimes given a restricted meaning in certain statutes which provide remedies for the protection of private legal rights The restricted meaning requires denial or deprivation of legal rights A more liberal approach is required in the background of statutes which do not deal with property rights but deal with professional conduct and morality The words persons aggrieved in sections and of the Act are of wide import add should not be subjected to a restricted interpretation of possession or denial of legal rights or burdens or financial interests The test is whether the words person aggrieved include a person who has a genuine grievance because an order has been made which prejudicially affects his interests Third the function of <ORG> in entertaining complaints against advocates is whn <ORG> has reasonable belief that there is a prima facie case of misconduct that a disciplinary committee is entrusted with such inquiry <NAME> I not only concur with the conclusion reached by My Lord the Chief Justice and the reasons given to support it Its function in relation to disciplinary proceedings is to entertain complaints against Advocates and when there is a prima facie case of misconduct to initiate proceedings by sending the complaint to its <ORG> It has an interest in seeing that correct decisions are given upon matters involving allegations of misconduct against members of <ORG> Amongst these we are especially concerned here with clauses and of Section of the Act which read as follows to entertain and determine cases of misconduct against advocates on its roll to safeguard the rights privileges and interests of advocate on its roll Under Section of the Act <ORG> constitutes its <ORG> consisting of three persons of whom two shall be persons elected by <ORG> from amongst its members and the other shall be a person elected by the <ORG> from amongst Advocates who possess the qualifications specified Indeed Section of the Act gives the <ORG> the powers of <ORG> under the Civil Procedure Code and Section enacts that its proceedings shall be deemed to be judicial proceedings for the purposes mentioned there This has to be done because there are disputes and conflicting interests and points of view on which <ORG> has to give its decisions It is true that there is no provision in Section of the Act for impleading the <ORG> <ORG> Council which on its executive side initiates the proceedings by sending the case to its <ORG> But if <ORG> has a separable interest as a guardian of the rights and privileges of the members of the <ORG> specifically mentioned by Section of the Act there is no reason why I right to represent this interest before its on <ORG> well as before <ORG> of India on an appeal under Section of the Act or on the further appeal to this Court under Section of the Act should be denied to it Nevertheless if as we are holding it can have the locus standi and rights of person aggrieved affected by the results of such proceedings I see no reason why we should not say that in tho position of a party to a lis or a dispute between itself and the allegedly delinquent Advocate towards the decision of which the proceedings are directed If <ORG> acting through its through it <ORG> has found a prima facie case to be send and tried by its <ORG> it performs the functions of a prosecuting agency If we can make this distinction as I think we can there is no merger between the prosecutor and the Judge here If one may illustrate from another sphere when the <ORG> itself gets through it executive agencies to prosecute and then though its judicial wing to decide a case there is no breach of a rule of natural justice Before it can become a person aggrieved by an order against which it could appeal there must have been a lis or a dispute to be decided which gives rise to the order complained of The short question is as to whether <ORG> is a person aggrieved within the meaning of so that it has locus standi to appeal to this Court against a decision of <ORG> of <ORG> which it claims is embarrassingly erroneous and if left unchallenged may frustrate the high obligation of maintaining standards of probity and purity and canons of correct professional conduct among the members of the <ORG> on its rolls There is curious anomaly here The grant of monoply licence to practice law is based on three assumptions There is a socially useful function for The lawyer to perform in things which do not concern him but they do include a person who has a genuine grievance because an order has been made which prejudicially affects his interests I have been long on a short point but brevity where there is some thing to speak is not the soul of wit but a sign of something different
