By the fiction in Vii second proviso read with what is really not income is for the purpose of computation of assessable income made taxable income but on that account it does not become commercial profit and if it is not commercial profit it is not liable to be taken into account in assessing whether in view of the smallness of profits a larger dividend would be unreasonable should have been included in the assessee Company profit for the purpose of determining whether the payment of a larger dividend than that declared by it would be unreasonable <ORG> answered the question in the negative Appeals preferred against his order to the Appellate Assistant Commissioner and <ORG> proved unsuccessful but <ORG> at the instance of the <ORG> referred the question set out hereinbefore to <ORG> at Bombay under a of the Act Section A of the Act as it stood at the relevant time in so far as it is material was as follows Where the Income Tax Officer is satisfied that in respect of any previous year the profits and gains distributed as dividends by any company upto the end of the sixth month after its accounts for that previous year are laid before the company in general meeting are less than of the assessable income of the company of that previous year as reduced by the amount of income tax and super tax payable by the company in respect thereof he shall unless he is satisfied that having regard to losses incurred by the company in earlier years or to the smallness of the profit made the payment of a dividend or a larger dividend than that declared would be unreasonable make with the previous approval of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner an order in writing that the undistributed portion of the assessable income of the company of that previous year as computed for income tax purposes and reduced by the amount of income tax and super tax payable by the company in respect thereof shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividends amongst the share holders as at the date of the general meeting aforesaid Clearly by A the Income Tax Officer is required to pass an order directing that the undistributed portion of the assessable income of any company in which the public are not substantially interested shall be deemed to have been distributed as dividends amongst the shareholders if he is satisfied that i the company has not distributed of its assessable income of the previous year reduced by the Income tax and super tax payable ii unless payment of a dividend or a larger dividend than that declared having regard to a losses incurred by the company in the earlier years or the smallness of the profits made in the previous year be unreasonable But the Income Tax Officer had still to be satisfied whether having regard to the smallness of the profit there is no evidence in this case that loss was incurred by the <ORG> in earlier years it would be unreasonable to distribute dividend larger than the dividend actually declared Counsel for the <ORG> submits in support of the appeal that the expression smallness of profit means no more than smallness of the assessable income and that in any event in the computation of profits the amount realised by sale of the machinery in the year of account in excess of its written down value was liable to be included in considering whether the condition relating to smallness of profit was fulfilled vii sub of that where the amount for which any building machinery or plant is sold exceeds the written down value so much of the excess as does not exceed the difference between the original cost and the written down value shall be deemed to be profit of the previous year in which the sale took place What in truth is a capital return is by a fiction regarded for the purposes of the Act as income down value is made chargeable to income tax its character is not altered and it is not converted into the assessee business profits The difference between the written down value of an asset and the price realized by sale thereof though not profit earned in the conduct of the business of the assessee is nationally regarded as profit in the year in which the asset is sold for the purpose of taking back what had been allowed in the earlier years A company normally distributes dividends out of its business profits and not out of its assessable income The <ORG> has deliberately used the expression smallness of profit and not smallness of assessable income and there is nothing in the context in which the expression smallness of profit occurs which justifies equation of the expression profit with assessable income Smallness of the profit in A has to be adjudged in the light of commercial principles and not in the light of total receipts actual or fictional By the fiction in vii second proviso read with what is really not income is for the purpose of computation of assessable income made taxable income but on that account it does not become commercial profit and if it is not commercial profit it is not liable to be taken into account in assessing whether in view of the smallness of profits a larger dividend would be unreasonable
