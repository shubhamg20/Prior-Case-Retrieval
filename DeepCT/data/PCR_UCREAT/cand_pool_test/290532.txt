We have heard the learned counsel for the State of Haryana A very vital question which arises for consideration in this petition is whether the State which is in charge of protection of life liberty and property of the people can be permitted to grab the land and property of its own citizens under the banner of the plea of adverse possession It was specifically denied that the plaintiff ever remained in possession of the suit property for the last years It was denied in the written statement that the plaintiff acquired right of ownership by way of adverse possession qua property in question Whether plaintiffs have become owner of disputed property by way of adverse possession OPP Whether judgment and decree dated passed in civil suit no dated is liable to be set aside alleged OPP Whether the plaintiff has no cause of action to file the present suit OPP <ORG> also observed that despite claiming adverse possession there was no pleading qua denial of title of the defendants by the plaintiff so much so that the specific day when the alleged possession of <ORG> allegedly became adverse against the defendants has not been mentioned in order to establish the starting point of limitation could be ascertained AIR and wherein it was stated that no declaration can be sought by a plaintiff with regard to the ownership on the basis of adverse possession Consequently the plaintiff had no right to say that the impugned sale deed dated th March was a sham transaction and the suit of mutation dated nd November and thereafter the judgment and decree dated th May passed in Civil Suit No dated th March are liable to be set aside <ORG> came to the conclusion that the plaintiff having no right or title in the suit property has neither locus standi nor cause of action to file the present suit Learned Additional District Judge while deciding the appeal relied on the judgment of <ORG> delivered in the case of <ORG> and Another <NAME> PLJ wherein it was observed that it does not behove the <ORG> to take the plea of adverse possession against the citizens PLR wherein it was held that a person in adverse possession of immovable property cannot file a suit for declaration claiming ownership and such a suit was not maintainable The appeal was dismissed with exemplary cost of Rs In a democracy governed by rule of law the task of protecting life and property of the citizens is entrusted to the police department of the government The doctrine of adverse possession arose in an era where lands were vast particularly in the United States of America and documentation sparse in order to give quietus to the title of the possessor and prevent fanciful claims from erupting Modern statutes of limitation operate as a rule not only to cut off one right to bring an action for the recovery of property that has been in the adverse possession of another for a specified time but also to vest the possessor with title The intention of such statutes is not to punish one who neglects to assert rights but to protect those who have maintained the possession of property for the time specified by the statute under claim of right or colour of title Therefore even claim of adverse possession has to be read in that context With the expanding jurisprudence of <ORG> the <ORG> has taken an unkind view to the concept of adverse possession With the expanding jurisprudence of <ORG> the Court has taken an unkind view to the concept of adverse possession in the recent judgment of <ORG> United Kingdom ERG which concerned the loss of ownership of land by virtue of adverse possession The court observed that the law which provides to oust an owner on the basis of inaction of years is illogical and disproportionate The preceding provisions shall not however in any way impair the right of a State to enforce such laws as it deems necessary to control the use of property in accordance with the general interest or to secure the payment of taxes or other contributions or penalties The question nevertheless remains whether even having regard to the lack of care and inadvertence on the part of the applicants and their advisers the deprivation of their title to the registered land and the transfer of beneficial ownership to those in unauthorized possession struck a fair balance with any legitimate public interest served Therefore it will have to be kept in mind the courts around the world are taking an unkind view towards statutes of limitation overriding property rights This in substance would mean that the law gives seal of approval to the illegal action or activities of a rank trespasser or who had wrongfully taken possession of the property of the true owner There are primarily two situations when a landowner may obtain compensation for land officially transferred to or depreciated by the government If this law is to be retained according to the wisdom of the <ORG> then at least the law must require those who adversely possess land to compensate title owners according to the prevalent market rate of the land or property in question Law and Justice more often than not happily coincide only rarely we find serious conflict In our considered view there is an urgent need for a fresh look of the entire law on adverse possession A copy of this judgment be sent to the Secretary <ORG> <ORG> <ORG> for taking appropriate steps in accordance with law
