On th June at about a one <NAME> an assistant in <ORG> was crossing Bentinck Street from west to east in order to reach Weston Street when he was knocked down by the defendant motor car which was being driven from south to north along Bentinck Street by the defendant driver <NAME> was seriously injured and died the same afternoon at <ORG> death being due to fracture of the skull On th August Mr <NAME> a Solicitor under instructions from Mrs <NAME> wrote to the defendant claiming Rupees as loss and damages sustained by her by reason of her husband death and threatening legal proceedings in default of payment In the plaint as it stood before the amendments to which I shall refer later the only plaintiff was Mrs <NAME> the widow of <NAME> and she sought to recover the sum of Rs It was stated in the plaint that <NAME> had died leaving him surviving his widow the plaintiff and others who were not desirous of joining in the suit and that the plaintiff had instituted the suit as representative of <NAME> deceased for the benefit of herself In the meantime and on nd November the defendant had filed his written statement in which he took the point that the plaint did not disclose a cause of action and that the suit as framed was not maintainable He alleged that the accident was not caused or occasioned by any of the acts complained of but arose from in evitable accident and alternatively there was contributory negligence on the part of <NAME> On th December there was rather a curious letter written by Mr <NAME> to the defendant solicitors calling upon them to give discovery of certain facts of which your client is in possession and which are not personally known to my client The letter went on to say For instance your client is personally aware of the negligent and wrongful act which caused the death of my client husband and your written statement is not sufficiently clear to indicate properly the nature and extent and mode of the injury stating that <NAME> left no will and that there is no executor or administrator of his estate The hearing of this case started on the afternoon of Monday the nd and when counsel for the plaintiffs was opening his case he gave certain particulars of the negligence alleged in para The first witness examined on behalf of the plaintiffs was <NAME> a Surveyor A prepared by him of that portion of Bentinck Street where the accident took place and its surroundings I have come to the clear conclusion on the evidence before me that the plaintiffs have failed to make out their case It is curious that though the accident took place in a busy street in Calcutta and the evidence shows that there were a certain number of people about the only two witnesses who should have come forward to give evidence in support of the plaintiff case were two persons who had known the deceased for some considerable time and who are likely to let their sympathies with the deceased family influence their minds I find that the driver did sound his horn when he saw the deceased and there was no warning given by the deceased Counsel for the defendant argued that in the case of Europeans and Eurasians a suit under the Fatal Accidents Act Act of could only be brought by his executor or his administrator and the word representative in the Act had no application to such persons but was used only with reference to Hindus and Mahomedans In that case the argument advanced before me by learned counsel for the defendant had been advanced by the Advocate General of Madras and was over ruled by the Court and the learned Judges held that the word representative in Act of meant and included all or any of the persons for whose benefit a suit under the Act could be maintained At one time I was inclined to doubt the correctness of the decision in the Madras case but on further consideration I have definitely come to the conclusion that the Madras decision is right and I should follow it In my view the word representative in Act of has a special meaning of its own It has not the same meaning as legal representative in the Civil Procedure Code It seems to me that the intention of the <ORG> was that in the absence of an executor or administrator any one or more of the persons for whose benefit the right of action was given should be deemed to be a representative of the deceased for the purpose of maintaining a suit under the Act It could not have been intended that in such a case where there is no executor or administrator the persons for whose benefit the right of action was given should be without a remedy I do not think there is much substance in the further objection made by counsel for the defendant that the suit had not been brought for the benefit of all the persons for whom it should have been brought On the plaint as amended it is clear that the children of the deceased are making no claim for damages at all and as all the persons for whose benefit the suit should have been brought are the plaintiffs before me and no further action can be brought in respect of the same subject matter of the complaint the purpose of the Act has been served and I hold that the plaint substantially complies with the requirements of the statute as compensation to be paid to the plaintiff Mrs <NAME> The suit will be dismissed with costs including reserved costs
