Validity or otherwise of certain provisions of the West Bengal Central Valuation Board Amendment Act for short the Amendment Act is in question in these appeals which arise out of a judgment and order dated passed by <ORG> of <ORG> dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant herein and thus upholding the impugned provisions thereof Members of the appellant association are occupiers of lands and buildings situated within the territorial limits of the Bidhannagar Municipality Section provided for publication of the final valuation list together with the amount of consolidated rate payable after determination of the objections filed under Section Contending that the said Amendment Act is violative of Article of the Constitution of India as it deprived the citizens of being heard which is the essence of the principles of natural justice as also lead to procedural unfairness a writ petition was filed by the appellant In arriving at its conclusion the learned Judge took notice of the contentions raised by the respondents in their counter affidavits as also other factors relevant for determination thereof at some details Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant would submit that <ORG> of <ORG> committed a serious error in construing the provisions of the impugned Amending Act insofar as it failed to take into consideration the following i The valuation list prepared by the <ORG> and produced in course of the hearing before the learned Single Judge clearly showed that no reason had been assigned in support thereof and in any event the same did not bear any real nexus with the factors to be taken into account in the matter of determination of annual valuation as provided under Section of the Municipal Act Mr <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal and Mr <NAME> learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of <ORG> on the other hand would submit that the procedural fairness as also the principles of natural justice being capable of being read in the provisions of the Amendment Act <ORG> cannot be said to have committed any error in passing the impugned judgment Of the two other members a one shall be a person who is or has been a member of the judicial service for not less than years and has experience in municipal affairs and the other shall be a person holding a degree in Civil Engineering and having knowledge and experience in the work of valuation and assessment for not less than seven years The Chairman and the other members of the Board shall hold office for such period not exceeding six years as <ORG> may determine and the terms and conditions of their service including salaries and allowances shall be such as may be prescribed The Chairman and the other members of the Board shall hold office for such period not exceeding four years as <ORG> may determine and the terms and conditions of their service including salaries and allowances shall be such as may be prescribed Every person who possess such qualifications as may be prescribed shall subject to such terms and conditions and on payment of such fee as may be prescribed be entitled to have his name entered in the register of registered valuer surveyors Gr The <ORG> shall give a notice in writing to the owner or to the lessee sub lessee or occupier of any land or building as the case may be in all case in which the valuation of such land or building is made for the first time or the annual valuation of such land or building as increased Provided that the valuation list as aforesaid may be prepared and published in respect of all the holdings of any municipal area or any area within the jurisdiction of a <ORG> specified in the notification under sub sec of Sec or the holdings of any municipal area within such group of wards or any area within such group of wards within the jurisdiction of a <ORG> as <ORG> may determine Amendment of Valuation list by Board The Board may for reasons to be recorded in writing amend the valuation list at any time before the date specified for filing objections under sub sec of Section Alteration or amendment of valuation list Notwithstanding anything contained in Sec the Board may at any time before the date of hearing of an application for review under Section and for reasons to be recorded in writing direct any alteration or amendment of the valuation list a by inserting therein the name of any person whose name ought to be inserted or by inserting therein any land or building previously omitted together with the valuation thereof or by striking out the name of any person or any land or building not liable for payment of consolidated rate or property tax as the case may be or by increasing or decreasing the annual valuation of any holding which in the opinion of the <ORG> has been substantially under valued or over valued by reasons of fraud mis representation mistake or error The application shall be filed within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed The application shall be filed within such time and in such manner as may be prescribed <ORG> The State Government shall constitute such number of <ORG> as may be considered necessary to hear the applications filed under sub section of Section If there is any difference of opinion between the members of <ORG> the matter shall be referred to the <ORG> for decision Provided also that when a <ORG> or a Municipality is dissolved <ORG> shall constitute by notification <ORG> consisting of a President and such number of other members as may be specified in the notification for the purpose of hearing applications for review If there is any difference of opinion amongst the members of <ORG> the matter shall be referred to the <ORG> for decision By reason of the said Amendment Act a proviso was added to Section which is in the following terms Provided that the <ORG> may in accordance with a resolution in this behalf adopted at a meeting of the <ORG> and with the previous approval of <ORG> require a valuer Surveyor Grade I or valuer surveyor of Grade II to make subject to such conditions as may be prescribed the general valuation of lands and buildings in the area as aforesaid or in any part thereof under the superintendence direction and control of the <ORG> on payment of such remuneration as the <ORG> may determine and every such valuation shall be deemed to have been made by the <ORG> The proviso appended to Section of the Act is an enabling provision in terms whereof general valuation of lands and buildings in the area as aforesaid or in any part thereof made by a Valuer Surveyor Grade I or Valuer Surveyor of Grade II however shall be under the superintendence direction and control of the <ORG> The allegations made in paragraph of the said application are categorically denied and disputed and it is stated that it is on the advice of <ORG> that the Municipal authority engaged casual staff who undertook door to door survey of the holdings on being exhaustively trained by the competent office are of <ORG> They being not government servants ordinarily would not have the power to enter into the premises of persons so as to infringe the right of privacy which is otherwise granted to an authority under the Act Section of the Act which provided for certain safeguards insofar as it empowered the <ORG> to make amendment of the valuation list has been omitted It is in the aforementioned backdrop that the provision for review contained in Section is required to be taken into consideration The said provision has no application in the instant case <ORG> had the jurisdiction to make further enquiry as it thought fit and proper It was only the decision of <ORG> which was made final Whereas under the Act a person having the requisite knowledge was to be appointed by <ORG> as Chairman of <ORG> the affairs of <ORG> are controlled only by the <ORG> concerned and the <ORG> under the Amendment Act It is unthinkable that although the power to make annual valuation is not to be preceded by an opportunity of being heard to the person who would be affected thereby the power of <ORG> has been curtailed to of the valuation made by the <ORG> In any event the effect of the amendment is that annual valuation is to be made by the <ORG> then the objections are to be heard by a Committee which again consists of members of the <ORG> and the <ORG> and in the event the decision is not unanimous the matter again goes back to the <ORG> We must also take notice of the fact that even the jurisdiction of civil court is barred and thus the only remedy which would be available to the taxpayer would be to take recourse to judicial review It is unfortunate that <ORG> opined although there was no provision therefor that in case of any final decision of the <ORG> the taxpayer can go back to <ORG> The proviso appended to Section of the Act makes the situation worse inasmuch as before taking recourse to the review provision a pre deposit is to be made in terms thereof A statute which provides for civil or evil consequences must conform to the test of reasonableness fairness and non arbitrariness It may be that the legislature thought that while preparing the general valuation it may not be possible to give an opportunity of hearing as such and an opportunity of hearing may be given at a later stage It is true that an order of assessment under the Act is conclusive subject to Sections and of the Act but keeping in view the limited power conferred upon <ORG> thereunder in terms whereof a part of demand is beyond the pale thereof it is possible that in a given case the entire exercise of review may end in futility Conversely if the statute conferring the power is silent with regard to the giving of a pre decisional hear ing to the person affected and the administrative decision taken by the authority involves civil consequences of a grave nature and no full review or appeal on merits against that decision is provided courts will be extremely reluctant to construe such a statute as excluding the duty of affording even a minimal hearing shorn of all its formal trappings and dilatory features at the pre decisional stage unless viewed pragmatically it would paralyse the administrative progress or frustrate the need fo utmost promptitude The court must make every effort to salvage this cardinal rule to the maximum extent possible with situational modifications But to recall the words of <NAME> the core of it must however remain namely that the person affected must have reasonable opportunity of being heard and the hearing must be a genuine hearing and not an empty pub lic relations exercise It is true that burden of tax based on valuation in the assessment is to be borne by the tenant or occupier but as we have examined the provisions even though the landlord remains inactive by not contesting the assessment proposed the tenant or occupier has to be vigilant and has the right to object to the same pursuant to the public and written notices The liability of the landlord towards tax is limited to the valuation based on actual rent received and the assessment made of the tax based on letting value of the premises is the liability of the tenant sub tenant or occupier Merely because the Tenancy Act is attracted to accommodations with rent less than Rs per month and not to other accommodations having higher rent does not create any dissimilar situation in application of the Act to various categories of tenants paying rent more or less than Rs As a result of the discussion aforesaid we find no vice in any of the provisions of the Act although we have considered it necessary to interpret the provisions harmoniously for better application of the provisions of the Act and the Tenancy Act It is also made clear that pursuant to the public notice or written notice the returns submitted by the tenant sub tenant or occupier with regard to determination of annual value shall be considered by the <ORG> It is further made clear that non issuance of public notice or notices and or non service of written notices to the persons primarily liable would not necessarily invalidate the proceedings of assessment or reassessment or amendment of the valuation for consolidated rate unless it is established by the party aggrieved that a serious prejudice was caused to it for want of notice Under the provisions of the Act since the tenant sub tenant or occupier have to share the burden of an appreciable portion of consolidated rate exclusive or inclusive of surcharge in relation to properties used for non residential and commercial purposes and as the Act provides for opportunity of participation to them pursuant to a public notice and written notice in assessment and reassessment of tax they have a right of appeal provided under the Act It is made clear that tenants sub tenants and occupiers held liable for payment of a portion of tax have a right of appeal on predeposit of a portion of tax levied and made recoverable from them It is also made clear that to enable the tenant sub tenant or occupier as person liable to pay consolidated rate they would have a right to obtain necessary information on payment of requisite fee in accordance with Section of the Act and corporation authorities are legally bound to furnish such requisite information However it appears that the basis for arriving at the market price of the land had not in fact been disclosed to the appellant nor was the appellant given any opportunity of meeting the same Accordingly we set aside the impugned order dated and direct the authorities concerned to redetermine the rateable value for the period from March to Again there is no express provision in Chapter XX barring the giving of a show cause notice or reasonable opportunity to show cause nor is there anything in the language of Chapter XX which could lead to such an implication In our view therefore the requirement of an opportunity to show cause being given before an order for purchase by <ORG> is made by an appropriate authority under Section UD must be read into the provisions of Chapter XX There is nothing in the language of Section UD or any other provision in the said Chapter which would negate such an opportunity being given The provision that when an order for purchase is made under Section UD reasons must be recorded in writing is no substitute for a provision requiring a reasonable opportunity of being heard before such an order is made The recording of reasons which lead to the passing of the order is basically intended to serve a two fold purpose that the party aggrieved in the proceeding before sic the appropriate authority acquires knowledge of the reasons and in a proceeding before <ORG> or <ORG> since there is no right of appeal or revision it has an opportunity to demonstrate that the reasons which persuaded the authority to pass an order adverse to his interest were erroneous irrational or irrelevant and that the obligation to record reasons and convey the same to the party concerned operates as a deterrent against possible arbitrary action by the quasi judicial or the executive authority invested with judicial powers AIR SC held The second condition necessary for the valid application of clause of the second proviso is that the disciplinary authority should record in writing its reason for its satisfaction that it was not reasonably practicable to hold the inquiry contemplated by Article There is furthermore no reason whatsoever as to why the power of <ORG> was curtailed only to the extent of The court while finding fault with the impugned amendment observed I have come to the conclusion that Rule is fundamentally flawed There is then a further logical stage in the argument If it is incumbent upon the <ORG> to consider and decide <NAME> obvious points which have not been advanced by the appellant notwithstanding Rule given the rationale of <NAME> there is no rational basis for excluding and deciding points of equal force which the appellant draws to the attention of the <ORG> even though they were not embraced in the grounds of appeal sanctioned by the <ORG> No statute which takes away sombody right and or imposes duties can be upheld where for all intent and purport there does not exist any provision for effective hearing Although the Court may not go into the question of a hardship which may be occasioned to the taxpayers but where a fair procedure has not been laid down in our opinion the validity thereof cannot be upheld For the reasons aforementioned the judgment of <ORG> of <ORG> is set aside and that of the learned Single Judge is restored
