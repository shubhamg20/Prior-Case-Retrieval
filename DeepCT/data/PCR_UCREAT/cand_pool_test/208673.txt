The <ORG> on the other hand held that since there was no transfer of equitable title in the shares to the assesee he was not entitled to any deduction of interest disallowed the deduction of damages paid by the assessee but excluded the dividend from his total income on the ground that it was not dividend earned by him There is a direct nexus between the amount paid by the assessee as interest and the earning of the dividend income Clause of the agreement read in the light of this decision shows that even if there was no transfer of equitable title to the assessee since the dividend declared would be an additional source of income to him the assessee would be entitled to deduct the interest paid on the loan for acquiring the shares The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> In this appeal by special leave the assessee who is an individual had purchased a large number of shares from <ORG> for Rs by borrowing this amount from the <ORG> and he paid interest of Rs In fact four years back i in the joint family of which the assesses was a member had sold these very shares along with other shares to <ORG> The agreement by which the assessee purchased these shares is dated February and is to be found at Annexure A on of the Paper Book which he had paid to the Bharat <ORG> for not taking delivery of the shares were also deductible because this was a business expenditure The Income tax Officer rejected all the pleas taken by the assessee and disallowed the deductions claimed by the assessee as mentioned above The assessee filed an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner who affirmed the order of the Income tax Officer though on slightly different grounds with which we are not concerned here Thereafter the assessee filed an appeal before the <ORG> which gave a finding that under the facts and circumstances of the present case there was no transfer of equitable title in the shares to the assessee and therefore he was not entitled to any deduction of the interest paid by him on the capital amount which constituted the purchase money of the shares <NAME> Thereafter the appellant moved the Tribunal for making a reference to <ORG> and after hearing counsel for the parties the Tribunal referred the following questions for the opinion of <ORG> Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of case the tribunal rightly rejected the assessee claim for deduction of the interest payment of Rs in respect of preference shares of <ORG> Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the tribunal rightly held that the dividend amount of Rs did not constitute the income of the assessee Out of these questions Question No has not been pressed by the appellant because it is well settled that there is no question of estoppel or res judicata in relation to the assessment of different years <ORG> agreed with the <ORG> that in the facts and circumstances of the case there was no transfer of equitable title of the shares to the assessee and therefore he was not entitled to claim deduction of Rs This can be done by examining the scope and ambit of of the Act in order to find out if the assessee case for payment of interest can come within the four corners of that section In these circumstances we do not propose to go into the question of transfer of equitable title which had occupied a greater part of the judgments of <ORG> and the <ORG> We would however like to make it clear that we should not be taken to have affirmed the decision of <ORG> on this point but we refrain from expressing any opinion thereon in the view that we take in the present case It would appear from the observations of <ORG> that even though the transaction may not amount to acquisition of equitable interest yet between the vendor and the purchaser the term regarding payment of the declared dividend would be fully effective because once the dividends are declared they will be deemed to have accrued to the purchaser even though there may not have been any transfer of equitable title to the purchaser Thus the principle which is deducible from the decision of <ORG> in <NAME> case supra fully applies to the facts of the present case It follows as a logical corollary therefore that even if there was no transfer of equitable title to the assessee since a Company declared the dividend etc being the interest paid on the loan for acquiring the shares The position will become clear if we extract of the Act as it stood at the relevant time Such income profits and gains shall be computed after making allowance for any expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of making or earning such income profits or gains provided that no allowance shall be made on account of a any personal expenses of the assessees or any interest chargeable under this Act which is payable without the taxable territories not being interest on a loan issued for public subscription before the st day of April or not being interest on which tax has been paid or from which tax has been deducted under section or any payment which is chargeable under the head Salaries if it is payable without the taxable territories and tax has not been paid thereon nor deducted therefrom under section An analysis of this sub section would show that in computing the income under this head the assessee is entitled to deduction in respect of the expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of earning such income provided the expenditure is not of a capital nature and does not include any personal expenses incurred by the assessee In other words before this provision could apply the following conditions must be fulfilled i the expenditure must have been incurred solely and exclusively for the purpose of earning income or making profit ii the expenditure should not be in the nature of a capital expenditure iii the amount in question should not be in the nature of personal expenses of the assessee iv that the expenditure should be incurred in the accounting year and there must be a clear nexus between the expenditure incurred and the income sought to be earned which came to Rs paid by the appellant could not be said to be of a capital nature nor could it be deemed to be personal expense incurred by the assessee It is in the capacity of a person carrying on business that this interest is paid The question must be viewed in the larger context of business necessity or expediency If the outgoing or expenditure is so related to the carrying on or conduct of the business that it may be regarded as an integral part of the profit earning process and not for acquisition of an asset or a right of a permanent character the possession of which is a condition of the carrying on of the business the expenditure may be regarded as revenue expenditure The Court held that legal and travelling expenses incurred by the assessee for protecting dividend income and to ensure the prospective dividend earning capa city were clearly allowable under of the Act We find ourselves in complete agreement with the view taken by <ORG> in that case of is all expenditure incurred solely for the purpose of making or earning the income which has been subjected to tax and the dominant purpose of the expenditure incurred must be to earn income We fully agree with the view taken by <ORG> The assessee has clearly established that the expenditure aforesaid was incurred solely and wholly for the purpose of earning the bonuses and dividend income As the shares were not the stock in trade of the appellant it could not be said that the interest paid by the assessee to the <ORG> was an expenditure of a capital nature nor was there any material to show that the expenditure incurred by the assessee amounted to his personal expenses falls clearly within of the Act and the conditions of the aforesaid provision being fulfilled the assessee was in law entitled to deduction of the amount of I In this view of the matter we set aside the order of <ORG> as also that of the <ORG> deleting the amount of Rs which will be included in the total income of the assessee The result is that the appeal is allowed in part and our finding on Question No is that <ORG> and the <ORG> were wrong in disallowing the deduction of Rs The assessee is therefore entitled to a deduction of this amount from his total income which forms the basis of Question No Appeal allowed in part
