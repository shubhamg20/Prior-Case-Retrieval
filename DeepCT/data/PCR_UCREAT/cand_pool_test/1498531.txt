It has a factory at Baroda where it had been manufacturing extruded aluminium collapsible tubes On nd May the petitioner received from the Superintendent of <ORG> notice dated th May hereinafter referred to the impugned notice asking the petitioner to obtain the <ORG> license with immediate effect because according to him printing and or lacquering was incidental to the process of manufacturing extruded shapes and sections or extruded tubes and pipes of aluminium Mr <NAME> who appears for the petitioner has raised before us only one contention Though some other contentions have been raised in the petition by the petitioner they have not been convassed before us We therefore proceed to decide this petition on the footing that both plain collapsible tubes of aluminium as well as printed and lacquered tubes of aluminium are marketable commodities and that the consumers buy them It provides for levy and collection of duties of excise on all excisable goods other than salt and on salt manufactured in or imported by land into any part of India at the rates set forth in the First Schedule to the said Act The expression excisable goods has been defined by Clause of Section in the following terms Excisable goods means goods specified in the First Schedule as being subject to a duty of excise and includes salt The contention raised on behalf of the respondents is that printing and lacquering of duty paid plain extruded collapsible pipes and tubes of aluminium are covered by sub item of Item We therefore examine sub item of Item in that context there are two facts which clearly emerge thereform A few decisions have been cited before us in this behalf There must be such a transformation that a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use The said Act does not define goods The test which <ORG> has therefore laid down is the test of distinctive name character or use of the new substance which is brought into existence from materials In the instant case if we apply the aforesaid test we come to the inescapable conclusion that a printed and lacquered extruded aluminium tube does not have in relation to a plain extruded tube any distinctive name or character use it has been laid down by <ORG> that manufacture implies a change but that every change is not manufacture though every change is not manufacture though every change in an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation In order to satisfy the test of manufacture it is necessary that there must be transformation that is to say a new and different article must emerge having a distinctive name character or use The test laid down by <ORG> in the case of supra has been followed in the subsequent case of supra It has been laid down in that decision that though manufacturing requires application of some sort of processes every processing cannot be equated to manufacture The passage quoted by <ORG> in that decision is in the following terms Manufacture implies a change but every change is not manufacture and yet every change of an article is the result of treatment labour and manipulation It was contended by the respondents to that case that copper circles which were subjected to payment of excise duty were uncut circles manufactured by rolling mills after rolling copper billets While placing that construction upon sub item of Item A it took into account the expression in any form or size which was applicable to the expression circles The argument advanced on behalf of the manufacturer was turned down because Item A clearly disclosed the intention of the <ORG> to levy central exciseduty at both stages on billets as well as on circles This decision cited by Mr <NAME> latdoes not help him in establishing his contention because we are unable to read in Item any intention on the part of the <ORG> to levy central exciseduty both on the manufacture of plain extruded tubes and on the printing and lacquering of such extruded tubes We are therefore of the opinion that only those goods which answer the description of extruded tubes of aluminium in the context of the present case are liable to payment of excise duty We are therefore unable to uphold the argument advanced by Mr <NAME>lat that the printed and lacquered extruded tubes of aluminium are different commodities distinguishable from plain extruded tubes and therefore liable to payment of central excise duty The impugned notice issued by the respondent No to the petitioner and the impugned order made by the respondent No on appeal are therefore clearly void in law and cannot be sustain In the result we allow the petition and issue a writ of Certiorari quashing and setting aside the impugned notice and the impugned order and issue a writ of Mandamus directing the respondents to desist from enforcing them against the petitioner Rule is made absolute with costs
