She will have no right to sell mortgage of transfer in any other way Therefore I give may finding that <NAME> will pay a sum of Rs Since there is no apartment in the Nohra <NAME> will pay a sum of Rs rupees one thousand only more besides Rs rupees thirty seven thousand only for constructing Dhalia room for keeping grass and fodder and a Hauz The money which will be given to her for maintenance will be her personal money and she can use it as she likes After the execution of the aforesaid terms <NAME> will be free from all kinds of litigations or compensation of Smt <NAME> and she will have no right in the ancestral or personal properties of <NAME> or his heirs or legal representatives She would have right in the house and <NAME> at Bidasar in the manner that I will go on residing in the said house at Bidasar till my life time and go on using the <NAME> in case I take the house and Nohra at Bidasar Nohra with Rs over which I will have absolute right On th May <NAME> and his sons filed a suit challenging the validity of the sale The trial court dismissed the suit holding that <NAME> had become by reason of the Act the full owner of the property at Bidasar The sale deeds were held to be void and the plaintiffs to be entitled to possession of the <NAME> upon the death of <NAME> Mr <NAME> learned Counsel for the appellants submitted that <NAME> had a pre existing right to maintenance and that under the award she was given a life interest in the <NAME> property along with a sum of Rs When Specific property was allotted to the widow in lieu of her claim for maintenance the allotment was in satisfaction of her right to be maintained out of the joint family property Whatever be the kind of property movable or immovable and whichever be the mode of acquisition it would be covered by Section It had to be read in the context of Sub section to leave as large a scope for the operation of Sub section as possible it was argued that even if the land in question had been given to the appellant in lieu of maintenance it had to be established tha what was given to her was a limited estate in the sense of ownership without the right of alienation and that under Section of the Act only such a limited estate would blossom into her absolute estate It said that it was obvious that Section was aimed at removing restrictions or limitations on the right of a Hindu woman to enjoy as a full owner property possessed by her so long as her possession was traceable to a lawful origin that is to say if she had a vestige of a title It made no difference whether the property was acquired by inheritance or devise or at a partition or in lieu of maintenance or arrears of maintenance or by gift or by her own skill or exertion or by purchase or by prescription or in any other manner whatsoever The Explanation to Section expressly referred to property acquired in lieu of maintenance and the Court could not see what further title the widow was required to establish before she could claim full ownership under Section in respect of property given to her and possessed by her in lieu of maintenance The very right to receive maintenance was sufficient title to enable the ripening of possession into full ownership if she was in possession of the property in lieu of maintenance If a Hindu woman was put in possession of property pursuant to or in recognition of a right to maintenance it could not be denied that she had acquired a limited right or interest in the property and once that position was accepted it followed that the right got enlarged to full ownership under Section and he emphasised a passage which reads thus It is true that the appellant was in possession of <NAME> properties but that fact alone is not sufficient to attract the operation of Section It follows therefore that the section cannot be interpreted so as to validate the illegal possession of a female Hindu and it does not confer any title on a mere trespasser In other words the provisions of Section of the Act cannot be attracted in the case of a Hindu female who is in possession of the property of the last male holder on the date of the commencement of the Act when she is only a trespasser without any right to property It is clear also from what the <ORG> held in the last sentence quoted above namely that the provisions of Section are not attracted in the case of a Hindu woman who is in possession of property only as a trespasser and without any right thereto It was also said that the enactment of Section was a step in the direction of practical recognition of the equality of the sexes and was meant to elevate women from a subservient position in the economic filed to a pedestal where they could exercise full powers of enjoyment and disposal of property held by them as owners untrammelled by artificial limitations placed on their rights of ownership by a society in which the will of the dominant male prevailed to bring about a subjugation of the opposite sex In our view on a perusal of the terms of reference the award and the document executed by <NAME> indicating her preference for the <NAME> property there is no doubt that <NAME> acquired the <NAME> property and the sum of Rs Maintenance as we see it necessarily must encompass a provision for residence Maintenance is given so that the lady can live in the manner more or less to which she was accustomed The concept of maintenance must therefore include provisions for food and clothing and the like and take into account the basic need for a roof over the head Provision for residence may be made either by giving a lump sum in money or property in lieu thereof It may also be made by providing for the course of the lady life a residence and money for other necessary expenditure Where provision is made in this manner by giving a life interest in property for the purposes of residence that provision is made in lieu of a pre existing right to maintenance and the Hindu lady acquires far more than the vestige of title which is deemed sufficient to attract Section A widow who does not succeed to the estate of her husband as his heir is entitled to maintenance out of his separate property as well as out of property in which he was a coparcener at the time of his death para The maintenance to be allowed to a widow should be such an amount as will enable her to live consistently with her position as a widow with the same degree of comfort and reasonable luxury as she had in her husband house unless there are circumstances which affect one way or the other her mode of living there In determining the amount of maintenance the <ORG> should have regard inter alia to the provision and status of the deceased husband and of the widow and the reasonable wants of the widow including not only the ordinary expenses of living but what she might reasonably expend for religious and other duties incidental to her station in life para The judgment and order under appeal is set aside the judgment and order of the Sr
