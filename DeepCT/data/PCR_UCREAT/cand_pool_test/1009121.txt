The ordinary criminal court and the Court Martial both had concurrent jurisdiction to try the said offences The learned Trial Judge while convicting one of the respondents and acquitting the remaining two failed to follow the procedure prescribed by the Criminal Courts and Court Martial Adjustment of Jurisdiction Rules framed under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure of However the acquittal rendered by <ORG> is on the ground of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the learned Special Judge who tried the case in <ORG> and not on merits In order to avoid any conflict of jurisdiction between the criminal court and the court martial in regard to offenders who are charged with having committed offences which fall under the purview of Section of the <ORG> Act Section of <ORG> has framed Rules known as Criminal Courts and Court Martial Adjustment of Jurisdiction Rules Therefore the ordinary criminal court would have no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case and to try the accused in a matter where the procedure prescribed by the Rules has not been complied with The initial lack of jurisdiction to take cognizance and try the case would of logical necessity vitiate the trial and the order of conviction and sentence would be liable to be quashed as a result thereof In the instant case admittedly the procedure prescribed by the Rules was not followed There is no substance in the plea and it has been rightly repelled by <ORG> Section of the West Bengal Criminal Law Amendment Special Courts Act in terms accords recognition to the applicability of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of enacted by the <ORG> except and save some of the sections namely sections and thereof which as provided in Section shall not apply and shall be never deemed to have applied to West Bengal It is altogether silent in regard to the matter pertaining to the procedure to be followed in regard to <ORG> personnel from the perspective of Section and the rules framed under the authority thereof There is thus no conflict between the Criminal Law Amendment Act of and the West Bengal Act in so far as this matter is concerned <ORG> has taken the view that the learned Judge presiding over <ORG> had acted without jurisdiction in taking cognizance of the case and proceeding with the trial of three <ORG> Officers resulting in the conviction of one of them and the acquittal of the remaining two and has quashed the proceedings They were charged with offences in respect of which the ordinary Criminal Court and <ORG> both had concurrent jurisdiction The Learned Trial Judge had failed to follow the procedure prescribed by the Criminal Courts and Court Martial Adjustment of Jurisdiction Rules referred to as Rules hereinafter framed under Section of the Code of Criminal Procedure of Cr The following contentions were urged before <ORG> on behalf of the State with a view to substantiate the contention that the learned Trial Judge had jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case and that the trial was not null and void notwithstanding the fact that the procedure prescribed by the Rules had not been followed The rules framed under Section of Having regard to the provision contained in section of the Army Act which prescribes a period of limitation of three years which period had already elapsed during the pendency of the proceedings in <ORG> the Court Martial would have no jurisdiction to try the accused and that the trial held by the learned Trial Judge could not be said to have been vitiated in view of this circumstance In view of a letter addressed by the Brigadier of the Division concerned to the Police Officer for investigating the offences it can be said by necessary implication that the <ORG> authorities had opted for the trial of the case by the ordinary <ORG> Besides reiterating the same three contentions before this Court learned counsel for the appellant has raised a new point which was not urged before <ORG> We propose to deal with the submissions which were urged in <ORG> before coming to grips with the new point sought to be raised by the learned counsel for the appellant State In regard to the offences which fall within the purview of Section of the Army Act of an offender can be tried only by Court Martial whereas in regard to offences falling within the purview of Section of the said Act the offences can be tried both by the ordinary criminal court as also by the Court Martial both of which have concurrent jurisdiction The offences with which the concerned accused were charged before the learned Trial Judge were offences which fell within the scope of Section of the Army Act of and accordingly the ordinary criminal court as also the Court Martial had concurrent jurisdiction In order to avoid any conflict of jurisdiction between the criminal court and the court martial in regard to offenders who are charged with having committed offences which fall under the purview of Section of the Army Act Section of Cr <ORG> has framed Rules known as Criminal Courts and Court Martial Adjustment of Jurisdiction Rules The Central Government may make rules consistant with this Code and the Army Act the Naval Discipline Act and the Indian Navy Discipline Act and the Air Force Act and any similar law for the time being in force as to the cases in which persons subject to military naval or air force law shall be tried by a Court to which this Code applies or by court martial and when any person is brought before a Magistrate and charged with an offence for which he is liable to be tried either by a Court to which this Code applies or by a court martial such Magistrate shall have regard to such rules and shall in proper cases deliver him together with a statement of the offence of which he is accused to the commanding officer of the regiment corps ship or detachment to which he belongs or to the commanding officer of the nearest military naval or air force station as the case may be for the purpose of being tried by the Court Martial Where a person subject to military naval or <ORG> law is brought before a Magistrate and charged with an offence for which he is liable to be tried by a court martial such magistrate shall not proceed to try such person or to issue orders for his case to be referred to a Bench or to inquire with a view to his commitment for trial by <ORG> or <ORG> for any offence triable by such Court unless a he is of opinion for reasons to be recorded that he should so proceed without being moved thereto by competent military naval or <ORG> or he is moved thereto by such authority It is in the background of these provisions that <ORG> has taken the view that compliance with the procedure prescribed by the Rules is a mandatory requirement and that any proceedings undertaken by the learned Trial Judge without compliance with the aforesaid mandatory procedure would vitiate the trial before the ordinary criminal court and the entire proceedings would be rendered null and void It was presumably on accout of this decision that the Criminal Law Amendment Act of was amended by incorporating Sections A and reading as under Section A In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the provisions contained in sub section the provisions of Sections and of the Code of Criminal Procedure shall so far as may be apply to the proceedings before a Special Judge and for the purposes of the said provisions a Special Judge shall be deemed to be a Magistrate The High <ORG> was therefore perfectly justified in repelling this contention urged on behalf of the appellant State albeit on a reasoning which is somewhat obscure We will however deal with it after exhausting all the points which were urged before the High <ORG> This Court in the aforesaid case has taken the view to the effect that the question being essentially one of the initial jurisdiction of the ordinary criminal court on the one hand and the court martial on the other unless the procedure prescribed by the rules is complied with the ordinary criminal court would not have initial jurisdiction in regard to the matter as is evident from the following passage It is an admitted fact in this case that the procedure speci fied in rule was not followed by the Special Judge <NAME> before framing charges against the respondent Accordingly the charges framed by the Special Judge against the respondent cannot survive The offences are alleged to have been committed by the respondent in November December According to counsel for the appellant this phrase cannotes that the ordinary criminal court as well as the court martial should not only have concurrent initial jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case but should also retain jurisdiction to try him up to the last stage of conviction or acquittal The clauase for which he is liable to be tried either by the <ORG> to which this Code applies or by a court martial in our view qualifies the preceding clause when any person is charged with an offence in In our opinion the phrase is intended to refer to the initial jurisdiction of the two courts to take cognizance of the case and not to their jurisdiction to decide it on merits It is admitted that both the ordinary criminal court and the court martial have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to the offences for which the respondent has been charged by the Special Judge So and the rules made thereunder are attracted to the case at hand Having regard to the enunciation of law to this effect it is evident that the ordinary criminal court would have no jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case and to try the accused in a matter where the procedure prescribed by the Rules has not been complied with The initial lack of jurisdiction to take cognizance and try the case would of logical necessity vitiate the trial and the order of conviction and sentence would be liable to be quashed as a result thereof In the present matter admittedly the procedure prescribed by the Rules was not followed There is no substance in the plea and it has been rightly repelled by <ORG> So far as the coverage of the present point is concerned there is no such inconsistency It is altogether silent in regard to the matter pertaining to the procedure to be followed in regard to <ORG> personnel from the perspective of Section Cr and the rules framed under the authority thereof There is thus no conflict between the Criminal Law Amendment Act of and the West Bengal Act in so far as this matter is concerned There is thus no substance in this point We have therefore no hesitation in negativing this plea But before we write finis it may be made clear that the acquittal rendered by <ORG> is on the ground of lack of jurisdiction on the part of the learned Special Judge who tried the case in <ORG> and not on merits With these observations we dismiss the appeal
