DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> VENKATARAMA BENCH <NAME> VENKATARAMA BHAGWATI NATWARLAL SINHA BHUVNESHWAR DAS CITATION AIR SCR ACT Amendment of plaint Addition of alternative ground for claim Necessary allegations Present in Plaint Fresh suit on amended claim barred by limitation Whether amendment should be allowed Action in trover when maintainable The suit was dismissed on the findings that the parties stood in the relationship of seller and purchaser and not agent and principal and that the title in the goods could only pass to the appellants when the respondents appropriated them to the appellants contracts But a fresh suit on the amended claim was barred by limitation on the date of the application barred by limitation is a factor to be taken into consideration in the exercise of the discretion as to whether the amendment should be ordered or not and does not affect the power of the court to order it if that is required in the interests of justice To maintain an action in trover the plaintiffs must establish that they had title to the goods in question and that further they were entitled to possession thereof when they called upon the defendants to deliver them The Judgment of the Court was delivered by VENKATARAMA AYYAR This appeal arises out of a suit instituted by the appellants in <ORG> for damages for conversion estimated at Rs by <NAME> and <NAME> Against this judgment the plaintiffs have preferred the present appeal on a certificate under Art It carried on business in India with its head office at Calcutta and a branch office at Bombay Thereupon the plaintiffs instituted the present suit for damages for conversion alleging that the goods in question were due to them under Government quotas comprised in Nos to and that the defendants who had ordered them on their behalf had themselves no title to them He accordingly passed a decree referring the suit to the Commissioner for ascertaining the damages They accordingly allowed the appeal and dismissed the suit There is no dispute as to the position in law Before the plaintiffs can maintain an action in trover they must establish that they had title to the goods in question and that further they were entitled to possession thereof when they called upon the defendants to deliver them The main question that arises for determination therefore is as to the relationship in which the parties stood with reference to the suit transactions They would then import those goods in their own names from America under i contracts Under cl the second plaintiff had to keep the value of his stocks at all times fully insured against fire risk In contrast with these terms there is cl which provides that the defendants would themselves supply to <ORG> all their requirements of lubricants within the territory allotted to the second plaintiff who was to act as their agent in clearing the goods and delivering them to the authorities It is clear that the agreement read as a whole is a composite one consisting of two distinct matters The learned Solicitor General who appeared for the appellants did not dispute that this was the position under Ex On September the second plaintiff applied to the Controller for a licence to import lubricants stating that he had been doing that business for seven years and giving particulars as to the volume of his business Sometime in November a licence was granted to him by the Government That licence did not include the quantity which they sold to the second plaintiff and thus the two licences were mutually exclusive There was however this change in the character of the transaction that whereas before the licence system the defendants were the purchasers from American Companies under i contracts and they then sold the goods to the second plaintiff on a price fixed by them under the licence system the price payable to them was only what they themselves had to pay to the American sellers with an addition by way of commission on the transaction Now the argument of the appellants is that as they were the persons entitled to import the goods under the licence granted to them in importing them on their requisition the defendants must be held to have acted for them and that the relationship between them was no longer one of seller and purchaser under Ex He contended firstly that in applying for and obtaining the licence in his own name the second plaintiff was merely acting as the agent of the defendants and secondly that the present contention was not raised in the plaint and was therefore not open to the appellants On the first contention he referred us to the correspondence which passed between the parties at the relevant period A was that he was a purchaser of goods then the sales by him of those goods were as owner and the licence issued to him on the basis of those sales must have been given to him in his own right and not as agent of the defendants It is next contended that the entire plaint is framed on the footing that the rights of the parties are governed by <ORG> that there is no averment therein that that agreement had been cancelled or modified and that a new agreement had been substituted after the licence system was introduced that the evidence of Mr <NAME> in the box was also that <ORG> was in force throughout the period and that therefore it was not open to the appellants now to contend that the rela tionship of seller and purchaser under <ORG> had been altered into one of agent and principal It is true that the plaint proceeds on the basis that <ORG> is in force and there is no allegation that it had been modified Under the circumstances if the rights of the parties had to be determined on the basis of the licence system we would have hesitated to non suit the appellants merely on the ground that the effect of that system had not been expressly stated in the plaint It is thus clearly established that with reference to the goods comprised in to which formed the subject matter of the suit the shipping documents had not been made out in the name of the plaintiffs nor had the defendants in whose names they were taken endorsed the same to them Thus on August the defendants wrote to the plaintiffs We confirm that the consignment is for you and on March they wrote We enclose herewith a statement showing quantities and grades that have been ordered by Government on your account against order But these statements are quite consistent with the position of the defendants as sellers who had ordered the goods on the requisition of the plaintiffs and do not import that title thereto had passed to them which could be only after the goods came into existence and were appropriated They contend that the amendment introduces anew cause of action that a suit on that cause of action could now be barred by limitation that the plaintiffs had ample opportunity to amend their plaint but that they failed to do so and that owing to lapse of time the defendants would be seriously prejudiced if this new claim were allowed to be raised There is considerable force in the objections Clause of the agreement expressly reserves that right to the plaintiffs It is no doubt true that courts would as a rule decline to allow amendments if a fresh suit on the amended claim would be barred by limitation on the date of the application But that is a factor to be taken into account in exercise of the discretion as to whether amendment should be ordered and does not affect the power of the court to order it if that is required in the interests of justice should not as a rule be exercised where the effect is to take away from a defendants legal right which has accrued to him by lapse of time yet there are cases where such considerations are out weighed by the special circumstances of the case Vide also <NAME> <NAME> In the present case apart from the contents of the plaint already set out there is the fact that the defendants cancelled the contract without strictly complying with the terms of cl The plaintiffs will accordingly be allowed to amend the plaint as follows a In the alternative and without prejudice to the claim on the footing of conversion the plaintiffs say that by reason of the facts aforesaid there was a contract between the parties whereby the defendants undertook to supply and deliver to the plaintiffs or either of them the goods ordered out by <ORG> on their the plaintiffs account and included in the quotas PL This appeal must accordingly be allowed the decree under appeal set aside and the suit remanded for I Bombay The defendants will file their written statement to the amended claim and the suit will be tried and disposed of in accordance with law There remains the question of costs So far as costs of this appeal are concerned as the defendants persisted in their contention that the plaintiffs were only acting as their agents a contention which if upheld would have furnished a conclusive answer to the amended claim as well we direct the parties to bear their own costs in this Court
