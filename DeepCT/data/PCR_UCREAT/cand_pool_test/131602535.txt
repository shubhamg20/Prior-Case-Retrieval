Most of the employees of the third respondent were getting bonus until they crossed the limit of Rs The Secretary of the petitioner Union who is the deponent of the affidavit filed in support of the above writ petition was getting bonus till and thereafter became eligible as a result of the ceiling on wages at Rs <ORG> of which the petitioner <ORG> is an affiliate made representations to <ORG> for amendment of Section to remove the ceiling so as to make all employees particularly Class IV and III eligible to get bonus Joint Director <ORG> first respondent herein has filed a counter affidavit disputing various averments made by the petitioner Section of the Payment of Bonus Act provides for payment of statutory minimum bonus of percent and maximum of per cent In the light of the above pleadings I have heard Mr <NAME> learned counsel for the petitioner Employees Association Mr <NAME> learned Additional Solicitor General for respondents and and Mr <NAME> for third respondent He also contended that there is no such ceiling under Gratuity Act Workmen Compensation Act and other Social Welfare Legislation In order to appreciate the rival contentions it is useful to refer the definition employee in Section of the Payment of bonus Act hereinafter referred to as the Act It is to be noted that at the time of enactment of the Act in the ceiling of a salary or wage was fixed at Rs it was subsequently enhanced to Rs and by Amendment Act the ceiling was raised to Rs with effect from It is also stated that there is no ceiling to claim gratuity under the Payment of Gratuity Act or compensation under Workmen Compensation Act <ORG> has accepted the first contention namely that the ceiling of Rs is unrealistic After holding that there is no justification at all for picking out the class of tenants of residential buildings paying a rent of more than four hundred rupees per month to deny them the rights conferred generally on all tenants of buildings residential or non residential by the Act that the tenants of non residential buildings cannot be said to be in a disadvantageous position as compared with tenants of residential buildings and that the argument based on protection of the weaker section of the community is entirely inconsistent with the protection given to tenants of non residential buildings who are in a position to pay much higher rents than the rents which those who are in occupation of residential buildings can ever pay <ORG> struck down Section ii of the Act as violative of Article of the Constitution of India We have considered the arguments of both the parties In our view it is clear that the interpretation has to be on the basis of the expression agricultural produce as set out in Section a of the said Act All the cases relied upon by Mr <NAME> are cases under the taxing statutes where the interpretation has been given on the basis of the terms as defined in those statutes We have considered the submission made by the parties Undoubtedly if there is a defect or an omission in the words used by by legislature the court would not go to its aid to correct or make up the deficiency There is no provision in the Act which negates the power of <ORG> to grant pardon We may state here itself that the words and expressions defined in one statute as judicially interpreted do not afford a guide to construction of the same words or expressions in another statute unless both the statutes are pari materia legislation or it is specifically so provided in one statute to give the same meaning to the words as defined in the other statute The cases relied on by Mr <NAME> are cases under Tamil Nadu Buildings Lease and Rent Control Act and Bombay Rent Control Act where the interpretation has been given on the basis of the terms as defined in those statutes Accordingly as rightly argued by the learned Additional Solicitor General those principles cannot be applied to the present case On behalf of <ORG> it was contended before <ORG> that the power of legislation is plenary and it is open to the law maker to amend or repeal existing legislation so long as it acts within its field of legislative competence and that such power extends to taking away vested rights By Section of the <ORG> <ORG> of India Act the <ORG> was vested with the power to change the conditions of service of those of its employees who had earlier served in the Imperial <ORG> Those employees cannot assert that they have a vested unalterable right in their terms and conditions of the employment <ORG> has undoubted power to legislate on the topic of bonus and <ORG> is not precluded from legislating on that topic in enactments other than the Payment of Bonus Act While bonus may form part of wages for purpose of some of the other enactments governing employees the right to receive bonus and the extent is as regulated or permitted under the Bonus Act It is settled that in matters of economic policy the <ORG> must have a larger area in which to make its decisions without the supervision of the <ORG> as the <ORG> is the better Judge of what the policy should be in relation to matters of economic Likewise <ORG> has power to legislate on the topic of bonus The right to receive bonus and extent is as regulated or permitted under the Bonus Act To sum up after the enactment of the Payment of Bonus Act the right to receive bonus and the extent is as regulated or permitted under the Bonus Act There is no scope for claiming bonus de hors the provisions therein The cases relied on by Mr <NAME> are cases under different statutes where the interpretation has been given on the basis of the terms given in those statutes In our case I have already referred to the fact that at the time of enactment of Bonus Act the ceiling was fixed at Rs and the same was increased to Rs and again by Act it was further increased to Rs Likewise the figure mentioned in Section of the Act also increased periodically I hold that Section of the Payment of Bonus Act defining an employee is constitutional and the same is valid in law With the above observation I hold that Section defining an employee in the Payment of Bonus Act is constitutional valid in law and the same is not liable to be struck down
