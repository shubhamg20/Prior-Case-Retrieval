<ORG> has jurisdiction to try issues both of fact and law The words as far as it can be made applicable occurring in of the Code of Civil Procedure make it clear that in applying the various provisions of the Code to proceedings other than those of a suit the court must take into account the nature of those proceedings and the relief sought If the procedure of a suit had also to be adhered to in the case of writ petitions the entire purpose of having a quick and inexpensive remedy would be defeated <ORG> is not deprived of this jurisdiction to entertain a petition under article merely because in considering the petitioner right of relief questions of fact may fall to be determined There is nothing wrong in the approach of <ORG> in relying upon the affidavits of deponents who were not cross examined on a conspectus of the entire circumstances of the case Against the backdrop of such activities there is nothing surprising or unusual in the conduct of the Councillor There is no imperative requirement in the case of a motion of no confidence that it should be passed on some particular ground There is nothing in the language of of the Gujarat Municipalities Act which makes it necessary to specify a ground when passing a motion of no confidence against the President A There is a difference between a motion of no confidence and a censure motion In a civil case reliance upon statements made before the police is not merely irrelevant but throws up suspicion because the police had no business to record any statement as <ORG> has it self pointed out Direction was further issued to the Collector to hold fresh elections to the post of the President of Kalol Municipality The appellant has filed this appeal by special leave against the above judgment of <ORG> Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or the rules made thereunder the president or as the case may be the vice president shall not preside over a meeting in which a motion of no confidence against him is discussed but he shall have the right to speak in or otherwise take part in the proceedings of such meeting including the right to vote In accordance with the above requisition a meeting of the Kalol Municipality was convened for May at There are conflicting versions if what transpired in that meeting As there were not legally sufficient number of votes i votes in favour of the motion the said no confidence motion is not passed and is declared to have been rejected What transpired in that meeting according to respondent No was given in the note of councillor <NAME> who was alleged to have presided over the meeting after the walk out of the appellant and the Vice President A day before that on May respondent No filed the present petition under article of the Constitution in <ORG> praying for the issue of a writ of quo warrant for ousting the appellant from the office of the President of the Kalol Municipality and for declaring that the said office had fallen vacant in view of the motion of no confidence having been passed on May The concluding part of the order of the Collector reads as under ln view of what is discussed above I come to the conclusion that the alleged no confidence motion against the President <NAME> has not been validly passed The affidavits filed on behalf of respondent No included those of councillors of Kalol Municipality while those filed on behalf of the appellant included those of nine councillors respondent No also filed the affidavit of <NAME> local correspondent of <ORG> a daily of Ahmedabad On September the learned Judges of <ORG> passed an interlocutory order for the production of six persons rho had filed affidavits on behalf of respondent No and two persons Who had filed affidavits on behalf of the appellant for cross examinaon We have noticed from the affidavits on record that there are sharp divisions amongst the councillors of the Kalol Municipality amongst the citizens of Kalol amongst the employees of the Kalol Municipality and even amongst the press reporters If he had really watched the proceedings of the meeting of the Kalol Municipality on th May his evidence would go a long way in helping us to decide the issue before us It was held that the Collector had no jurisdiction to make such inquiry and record the impugned order The finding of <ORG> in this respect was that there was not even a semblance of natural justice in the inquiry which had been conducted by the Collector and the same was vitiated by flagrant breach of all principles of natural justice as the interested persons had not been heard It was however made clear that fresh election to the office of the President of the municipality would be held subject to the result of this appeal We agree with the observations of <ORG> that the purpose underlying the petition would have been completely defeated in case respondent No had been relegated to the ordinary remedy of a suit and that such remedy was neither adequate nor efficacious It is not necessary for this case to express an opinion on the point as whether the various provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure apply to petitions under article of the Constitution Section of the Code to which reference has been made makes it clear that the provisions of the Code in regard to suits shall be followed in all preccecdings in any court of civil jurisdiction as far as it can be made applicable The words as far as it can be made applicable make it clear that in applying the various provisions of the Code to proceedings other than those of a suit the court must take into account the nature of those proceedings and the relief sought Power has consequently been vested in <ORG> to issue to any person or authority including in appropriate cases any government within the jurisdiction of <ORG> orders or writs including writs in the nature of habeas corpus mandamus prohibition quo warrant and certiorari It is plain that if the procedure of a suit had also to be adhered to in the case of writ petitions the entire purpose of having a quick and inexpensive remedy would be defeated <ORG> is not deprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a petition under article merely because in considering the petitioner right of relief questions of fact may fall to be determined In a petition under article <ORG> has jurisdiction to try issues both of fact and law Exercise of the jurisdiction is no doubt discretionary but the discretion must be exercised on sound judicial principles It should go into a disputed question of fact and the discretion exercised by <ORG> appears to be sound and in conformity with judicial principles this Court would not interfere in appeal with the order made by <ORG> in this respect In this respect we find that prayer which was made by the appellant in application dated September was as under to order the opponent No to offer for cross examination <NAME> <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> and <NAME> who have sworn affidavits in support of the petitioner or in the alternative to issue summons to them to attend <ORG> for being cross examined on behalf of the petitioner It would appear from the above that all that the appellant himself prayed in his application was that the deponents mentioned by him should be offered for cross examination and not that those witnesses should be examined in chief and thereafter cross examined As things however are we find that when the deponents concerned were produced in court they were examined in chief and thereafter there was cross examination It might in the circumstances have appeared to be unnecessary dupli cation to ask those deponents to repeat what had been stated by them in their affidavits <ORG> permitted cross examination of such of the deponents in respect of whom it came to the conclusion that their cross examination was essential for arriving at the truth of the matter Order permitting cross examination of some of the deponents did not have the effect of obliterating from record the affidavits of other deponents and we find nothing wrong in the approach of <ORG> in relying upon the affidavits of deponents who were not cross examined it on conspectus of the entire circumstances of the case it found the averments in those affidavits to be true It is submitted that the version of he appellant regarding what transpired in the meeting of May is correct motion of no confidence there was in the opinion of <ORG> no reason why they should not be present in that meeting After having heard Mr <NAME> at considerable length we find no sufficient ground to interfere with the appraisement of the depositions and other material on record by <ORG> Against the backdrop of such activities we find nothing surprising or unusual in the conduct of Councillor <NAME> There is one important circumstance which tends to show that the version of respondent No with regard to what transpired in the above meeting is nearer the truth Otherwise it would have been a sheer exercise in futility for the councillors to repeat the performance of what had taken place in the meeting of November We therefore find nothing improbable in the stand taken on behalf of respondent No that <NAME> had pledged his support to the motion of no confidence and that he actually supported that motion in the meeting held on May There is no statutory provision in the Gujarat Municipalities Act which requires that the signatures of the members attending a meeting must be obtained It has next been argued on behalf of the appellant that a ground had been specified in notice dated April which was sent by councillors for convening the meeting to consider the motion of no confidence It is no doubt true submits respondent No that in the earlier part of the minutes there is a recital that the appellant had not been allowing the municipal administration to function in accordance with the provision of law the concluding part of the minutes shows that members declare their no confidence against the President on the present motion of no confidence Although the stand taken on behalf of respondent No in this respect does not appear to be bereft of force we need not express an opinion on this aspect of the matter because the contention advanced by the appellant can be repelled on another ground namely that there is no imperative requirement in the case of a motion of no confidence that it should be passed on some particular ground There is nothing in the language of section of the Gujarat Municipalities Act reproduced earlier which makes it necessary to specify a ground when passing a motion of no confidence against the President It is pertinent in this context to observe that there is a difference between a motion of no confidence and a censure motion There is no legal bar to the passing of a motion of no confidence against an authority in the absence of any charge of impropriety or lapse on the part of that authority Mr <NAME> has next assailed the finding of <ORG> that the Collector had no jurisdiction to make an inquiry and pass order dated June We agree with Mr <NAME> that there is no cogent material on record to show that the Collector A was actuated by any oblique motive when he passed that order There is in our opinion no force in the appeal which fails and is dismissed with costs <NAME> <NAME> The social lesions on the political tissues of our body politic are of as much pathological significance in this case as the legal issues and the weaknesses of the court system thrown up by the mini crisis in a small municipal council which forms the subject matter of this case My learned brother <NAME> <NAME> has discussed the points of law and questions of fact directly arising from the case and I am privileged to agree wholly with his observations reasoning and result It is surprising that a court should in a civil case rely upon statements made before the police The learned Judges for instance have stated Though there was no complaint or information at that time either from respondent No or from any member of his group about what respondent No alleges to have happened on May the police had taken interest in the matter and started an enquiry on their own We are constrained to say that there cannot be an uglier more distasteful more disagreeable and more distorted form of democracy than one we have seen on evidence in the civic affairs of Kalol It also appears from the record of the case that no meeting of the municipality could be held except under police protection We have it further from the judgment of the court below that on October respondent no appellant before us admittedly lost his majority We have one more fact of grave import
