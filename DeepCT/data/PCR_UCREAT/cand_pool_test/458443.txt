The lower <ORG> found on the issue in favour of the defondants and that finding is accepted by Mr <NAME> on behalf of the appellants in this <ORG> but he maintains that the appellants are entitled jointly with Madhsudan Lala to the possession of the property in the capacity of shebaits or Superintendents and managers There is a dispute between the parties as to whether the temple was built by <NAME> or his father but the evidence goes to show that it was the son who built it and first exercised the function of a Gosain therein As to its history the witness <NAME> a witness for the respondent says that <NAME> otherwise <NAME> see pedigree at page presented <NAME> with the idol of <NAME> and that he presented the idol on the terms that if a son or sons should be born to <NAME> father they would regularly perform the Sewa puja ceremonies but if there should be none it would be returned to him The <ORG> below has found and the finding has been accepted in this <ORG> orally by Mr <NAME> who thereby abandoned pleas Nos and in the memo of appeal that the property was debutter or waqf and the real question which was argued in appeal has been whether or not the plaintiffs are entitled along with the sons of the other daughter of <NAME> to succeed to the management of th etemple and the temple property The contention in appeal before us was that the defendant had entirely failed to prove such a custom and that the evidence adduced on behalf of the plaintiffs demonstrated that so far from there being a universal custom excluding daughter sons the very contrary prevailed in other temples All this argument proceeded on the basis that under the circumstances of the case the ordinary rule of Hindu law as to inheritance prevailed unless a custom contrary to that rule was proved and that the onus of proving this custom rested on the defendant We propose now to consider the all important questions whether this basis of the appellants case is well founded It is contended however on the part of the defendant <NAME> that this rule does not apply to a case like the present which raises the question of who shall be the shebait not as between the heirs of a dedicator of property for religions purposes but between claimants to the shebaitship against another person already in possession of the office and who is admittedly capable of performing the functions of the office At page of the volume their Lordships further say There is no doubt considerable difficulty in ascertaining what is the rule of succession to this office but it is certain that the usage had not been according to the ordinary rules of inheritance under Hindu law It is not for their Lordships to consider whether there is any infirmity in the title of the respondent <NAME> who has been in possession many years with the consent if not by appointment of the <NAME> We <NAME>s have a large following of disciples at different places where the disciples would object to have any body as their <NAME> unless he belonged to the <NAME>akul and where there is not such a large following the <NAME> does sometimes appoint his own relatives to the gaddi and there are such instances It is our custom that the mandir and everything in it which has once belonged to the <NAME> does remain with the <NAME> and I have already given my reason for the same It will be seen from this evidence given by the plaintiffs own witness that the sect is not governed by the Hindu law and that it is only in cases more or less rare that a daughter son has been allowed to succeed to a Goshain temple and the result of so succeeding has been to cause the temple to cease to be a Ballavcharya Gosain temple Again <NAME> another <NAME> witness examined on behalf of the plaintiffs admits Vide A that succession of daughter son is by no means universal is rather rare and there is at least a part of the office of a <NAME> which cannot be performed by a <NAME> There is undisputed evidence See This if the ordinary Hindu law had prevailed they would have no power to do and the fact that they did do so is a strong ground for believing that itis unusual and improper that a <NAME> should succeed to the management and superintendence of a <NAME> temple It seems to us that it would be improper for the <ORG> to establish on the gaddi persons who on the admission of the plaintiffs own witnesses could not properly perform the office and whose presence as shebaits would degrade or at least lessen the importance of the temple We have already quoted at some length from the evidence of the only two Ballavacharya Goshains called by the plaintiffs and that very evidence in itself shows that there is no such custom or usage in force We therefore dismiss the appeal with costs including in this <ORG> fees on the higher scale
