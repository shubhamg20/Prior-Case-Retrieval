The respondent filed an application in the Court of the District Judge of Benares who has jurisdiction over Jaunpur District on the basis of a will alleged to have been executed by her father at Jaunpur Later on it was argued on behalf of the objectors that the point arose by implication and the discretion of the District Judge under Section Succession Act was invoked It was however urged on behalf of the respondent that as the will was executed at Jaunpur the witnesses would come from that city and it would be more convenient to them to come to Benares than to go to Fyzabad The learned Judge did not think that there was any difficulty in investigating the matter at Benares because in his opinion both Jaunpur and Fyzabad were in one and the same province as defined in the General Clauses Act It is contended on behalf of the appellant that under Section Succession Act any order by the District Judge is appealable as of right and it is only the procedure relating to the filing or the hearing of the appeal that is governed by the Code of Civil Procedure Stress is laid on the fact that in the Probate and Administration Act the corresponding words were under the rules contained in the Code of Civil Procedure whereas in Section the legislature has substituted therefor the words in accordance with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure No doubt there are one or two cases in which appeals were entertained from orders which would not have been appealable under the Code but they stand by themselves But it is not necessary for us in this case to answer the wider question whether appeals under the Indian Succession Act are limited exclusively to the appeals which axe provided for in the Code of Civil Procedure It is clear to us that in order to have a right of appeal there must be an order made by the District Judge by virtue of any of the powers conferred upon him by part of the Act That section confers power on the District Judge to refuse an application for letters of administration if in his judgment it could be disposed of more justly or conveniently in another district provided that the deceased had no fixed abode at the time of his death in the district under the jurisdiction of the Judge concerned The learned Judge obviously has not refused the application for letters of administration and has therefore literally speaking not made any order by virtue of the power conferred upon him by Section It cannot be treated as a final order adjudicating upon the rights of the parties or disposing of any matter absolutely We therefore do not think that this is a case which comes within the scope of Section so as to give the appellant a right of appeal It is impossible to say that in this case there has either been a failure to exercise a jurisdiction vested by law or any illegality or material irregularity in the exercise of such jurisdiction We are therefore unable to interfere under Section Civil We dismiss the appeal but direct that the parties should bear their own costs
