The only question in this application made un behalf of the Broach City Municipality is whether an order made or a decision given by <ORG> under Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act Bom <ORG> in cases in which the compensation is claimed in respect of land should follow as far as may be the procedure provided by the Land Acquisition Act for proceedings in matters referred for the determination of the <ORG> It follows that where <ORG> makes an order under Section it must be treated for the purpose of execution in the same way as an award made in a reference under Section of the Land Acquisition Act It was decided there that no appeal lies from the decision of <ORG> under Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act Once we find that the decision of the <ORG> under that section is considered as an order though it may not be a decree it must follow that there is some way for the parties entitled to the benefit of the order to get satisfaction without having to file another suit Again it is clear from Section proviso that the <ORG> has full power to give and apportion the costs of all proceedings in any manner it thinks fit According to the applicant contention although the <ORG> had full power to apportion costs it had no power to issue execution in order that a successful party might get his costs given to him already by the <ORG>
