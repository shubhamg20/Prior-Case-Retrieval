as the amount of six instalments alleged to be due on two mortgages executed in the Samvat years and the matter in dispute was submitted by the parties on the th October to arbitration The last darkhast however No of was rejected by the Subordinate Judge <NAME> on the ground that no judgment had been passed in terms of the award and that there was no decree to execute The order rejecting the darkhast was confirmed by <ORG> on appeal on th September It was argued also that the provisions in Section as to the <ORG> passing judgment in terms of the award and a decree following on it are incorporated in Section by the words of the latter which enable the award when filed to be enforced as an award under the provisions of the chapter and that it was the duty of the <ORG> to pass judgment on the award after it had been filed or at any rate that it was not necessary for the <ORG> to be set in motion in order to do so and that in either case and whether the application was or was not converted into a suit the application to pass judgment was not one within the contemplation of the second schedule of the Statute of Limitations of it was held that an application to file an award under Section of the Civil Procedure Code of was only converted into a suit for administration purposes and for classification of business of the <ORG> and that an order refusing to file an award was not appealable under the Civil Procedure Code of In <NAME> <NAME> I All however an order made by the <ORG> previous to passing judgment according to the award was held to be not appealable because it was only an interlocutory order in a suit and not included in Section Act of thus showing that the <ORG> regarded the application as a suit after it had been registered as such for other purposes than mere classification Assuming that to be so we think that the same effect should be given to the language of Section of the Code of and that of Section of the Code of Moreover in construing a code of procedure we ought we think to give the framers of it credit for using a particular form of words in the same sense throughout the Code unless the context clearly shows that it was intended to be used in a different or more restricted sense Now it may be that it would be usual as a matter of practice for the plaintiff to ask the <ORG> to pass judgment according to the award but looking at the language of Section of the Civil Procedure Code of and of Section of the Code of we cannot think that any application would be necessary It is not however denied that the th December was the day named in the notice and we see no reason and after the lapse of sixteen years during which time the above objection has never been taken although the award has been several times executed we should certainly not be disposed even if we had the power which may well be doubted to interfere with the filing of the award
