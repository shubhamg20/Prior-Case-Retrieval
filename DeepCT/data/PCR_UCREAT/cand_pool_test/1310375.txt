The appellants filed No of for a declaration of the first appellant possessory title and injunction The suit property was purchased sometime in and the dispute is whether the property belong to <ORG> and thereafter to <ORG> or whether the property never belonged to <ORG> No one else has any right He leased a portion of the building to one <NAME> for a period of one year and since the tenant sub leased the portion the first appellant took immediate action and filed No of to evict him In he initiated proceedings and took possession of the premises to the knowledge of the respondents No action was taken because <ORG> knew that the first appellant alone had the exclusive right The learned Senior Counsel would submit that the suit filed by the respondents is an ejectment suit and it is for the respondents to prove their title He would submit that there was no evidence to show that the respondents had ever been in possession of the suit property Even assuming without admitting the land in No belongs to the respondents there is no presumption that the superstructure was put up only by the respondents It goes to show that they cannot have any right in the property The learned Senior Counsel submitted that it is not for the appellant to produce documents relating to possession but it is for the respondents to prove their right The land in No alone was transferred but not the superstructure and when there is an omission in Ex A to refer to the superstructure it is fatal to the respondent case and therefore the appellant must succeed According to this in when the appellant was taking all steps to recover possession of the suit property the respondent was no where to be found and this would show that the possession was only with the appellants who let in the tenant and also got them evicted subsequently Chakicherla Audilakshmamma Vs <NAME> where <ORG> of <ORG> held that in a suit for rejection the plaintiff is liable to be non suited if he fails to establish his own title irrespective of the question whether the defendants have proved their case or not He referred to the pleadings in the first appellant plaint at para where it is stated that the construction was made with donations from the public and managed by a separate committee and that the local public of Erode was interested in the property and again in their own written statement in the suit filed by the respondents they have reiterated the same case He also referred to evidence in which he has stated that there is no municipal tax paid for the property which would only show that it was a trust property He would refer to the first appellant own case that <NAME> handed over possession The learned counsel also pointed out to the evidence of where he admits that the service connection is in the name of the Treasurer <ORG> and he does not know who applied electric connection and at that time he was a student in Salem The learned counsel would submit that indisputably the evidence shows only one thing and that is the suit property belongs to the respondent He would also submit that two suits were filed one by the respondent for declaration of title and recovery of possession and another by the appellant for declaration of the possessory title and injunction and therefore it is not proper to place the entire burden of proving the title on the respondent alone It was also submitted by the learned counsel that when it is the categoric admission of the appellant that he was put in possession by <NAME> who was admittedly representing the <ORG> the appellant must necessarily prove when he started asserting his rights in his individual capacity In any event it is seen that the property was intended to be the <ORG> because though the case of the appellant is that the property was put up from the funds collected by the <ORG> and there is nothing on the side of the respondents to show the source of funds for the building the various documents referred to above from Ex A and A the Minutes book and Ex A A A to A and the electricity charges would all show that it was only <ORG> which was managing the suit property from to The building admittedly came up sometime in and there is evidence to show that the electricity charges has been levied only on <ORG> This does not help the appellants case because it does not show that the respondent is not entitled to the suit property on the other hand it only bolsters the case of the respondent that the property was intended to be for the benefit for <ORG> and the appellants have no right to remain in the suit property There is absolutely no evidence to show that the alleged separate committee was ever in possession or management of the suit property But if item No in Schedule A of Ex A is seen it mentions bungalow hospital playground and garden and we can take it that includes the superstructure existing on No <NAME> was in management of the suit property is also seen from the fact that he had taken steps to evict the appellant and his wife from No and Even if the appellants own case were true his possession can only be by permission and unless he is able to prove that he has asserted title in himself hostile to <ORG> and to the knowledge of <ORG> or <ORG> for the required number of years his suit cannot succeed <ORG> or <ORG> are not a party to this There is no evidence to show that the so called tenant <NAME> was ever living in the suit property at the relevant time The so called tenant does not appear and the first appellant had created a document to show that he has taken possession from one <NAME> would refer to one tailor <NAME> who was a tenant in the suit property from to for which there is no documentary evidence ehd ghy uh kPJ nghl kDtpy vjph thjk bra jhuh vd bjhpahJ jhth fl olk

iy Therefore a house totally devoid of any articles or any evidence of human habitation is alleged to be the property in possession of a recalcitrant tenant who was successfully evicted by the appellant Therefore apart from this the appellant does not have anything to show that he has ever asserted any right of possession There is no dispute that on the date of the suit filed by the respondents the appellant was in possession Ex A is a document in which the appellant has addressed a letter to the Bishop <ORG> referring to the telegram dated and also the copy of his petition to the Police Inspector According to the appellant he took possession on is pursuant to the delivery in and he has also ingeniously sent a telegram Ex A addressed to the Bishop <ORG> stating please take notice I have taken possession of the building No Brough Road through <ORG> from This only shows that he is not in possession in his own right and it also demolishes his case that these properties at Brough Road retained a separate identity and were not merged with the other <ORG> properties If that were true there was no need for him to address this telegram to the <ORG> Bishop when he had already been in possession in his own right There is no need to mention that he had taken possession through <ORG> in October The appeals are dismissed with costs
