CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC SC SC SC RF SC RF SC SC SC ACT Res judicata Land acquisition proceedings Dispute as to title between rival claimants Decision after contest Whether operates as res judicata in subsequent suit Effect of decision on mortgagees If a mortgagee intervenes in land acquisition proceedings and makes a claim for compensation and any question of title arises about the title of the mortgagor in respect to the land acquired which affects the claim for compensation he has every right to protect that title and if he defends that title and the issue is decided against his mortgagor the decision would operate as res judicata even as against the mortgagee Certain premises which formed part of the estate of a de ceased person were acquired in land acquisition proceedings There was a triangular contest about the right to the compensation money between A and two rival claimants to a four annas share in the estate of the deceased and a mortgagee from one of the claimants The Judgment of the court wag delivered by <NAME> connected apeals from the judgment and decree of <ORG> at Calcutta in appeal from Original Decree No of dated the th May arise out of Title Suit No of instituted the st September in <ORG> by <NAME> against the Sens and the <NAME> for possession of the properties which represent a four anna share of the estate once held by one <NAME> The two grandsons having taken possession of the whole estate after the death of <NAME> <NAME> brought a suit the th October against them and <NAME> for construction of the will and a declaration that he was the duly adopted son and heir of <NAME> and that as such he was entitled to a three fourth share of the estate and the <ORG> were entitled only to the remaining one fourth share By a judgment dated st December the trial Judge decreed the claim of <NAME> for the whole of <NAME> estate and a decree for recovery of possession of the whole estate was passed in her favour It was held that the whole of the corpus of the estate had vested in <NAME> and the provisions of the will whereby a fourth share had been bequeathed to the grandsons were void and ineffectual The trial court held that the compromise was binding <NAME> but that she was entitled to a declaration that <NAME> had taken only a widow estate in the six annas share given to her appeal by <NAME> <ORG> th August reversed the trial court decree and declared that the consent decree was void and inoperative as against <NAME> and that she was in no way bound by the partition proceedings which had taken place in execution thereof Before the commencement of this suit the <NAME> had brought a suit the foot of their mortgage and had obtained a mortgage decree which was made final rd November The property described as Deb Lane Calcutta forming part of <NAME> estate and which had been allotted under the compromise to the share of the <NAME> was notified by a declaration under the Land Acquisition Act for acquisition the th January the th April <NAME> mortgagee made an application claiming the entire amount of compensation money and contended that the mortgagee decree holders were entitled to the whole of it <NAME> mortgagee also made an application for reference the th August It was ordered that she should recover possession from them as also from defendant as receiver but that her title and possession were subject to the rights of the defendants respondents to Dasses to proceed against the properties in execution of their mortgage decree the basis that these properties were in the possession of and dealt with by defendantsrespondents and as representing the four anna share of the estate to which they had title There was a triangular contest about the award of the compensation and a joint award was made in their favour after notice to all the parties interested in the property acquired including the mortgagees The land acquisition court had thus jurisdiction to decide the question of title of the parties in the property I I A It seems clear that possession under an agreement which was not binding the reversionary heirs could not avail the <ORG> in a question with a reversionary heir whose right to possess could not arise until the succession opened to such heir In order successfully to establish a plea of res judicaia or estoppel by record it is necessary to show that in a previous case a court having jurisdiction to try the question came to a decision necessarily and substantially involving the determination of the matter in issue in the later case It was at one time a matter of doubt whether the determination of a court to which a matter had been referred by the collector was such a decision and that doubt was resolved by the judgment of <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> which decided that where a dispute as to the title to receive the compensation had been referred to the court a decree thereon not Appealed from renders the question of title resjudicata in a suit between the parties to the dispute In that case it was observed as follows <ORG> appear only to have regarded the matter as concluded to the extent of the co mpensation money but that is not the true view of what occurred for as pointed in <NAME> <NAME> it is not competent for the court in the case of the same question arising between the same parties to review a previous decision no longer open to appeal given by another court having jurisdiction to try the second case In a subsequent suit by another widow who was also a claimant in the land acquisit ion proceedings for a declaration that she was entitled to a half share in the estate inherited by her husband and his brothers it was held that her suit was barred by the rule of res judicata the District Judge having in the previous proceeding decided that she had no title to the land These two decisions in our opinion are conclusive the point of resjudicata raised in the present case and in these circumstances it has to be hold that the question of title to the four anna share was necessarily and substantially involved in the land acquisition proceedings and was finally decided by a court having jurisdiction to try it and that decision thus operates as res judicata and estops the Sens and the mortgagees from re agitating that matter in this suit We are not now concerned with the question whether <ORG> was right or wrong <ORG> held that there can be no question that this decision is binding the <ORG> and concludes them the question of their title as against <NAME> and that there could be no question also that it is binding the mortagees who were parties to the proceeding In the concluding part of the judgment they observed as follows Our conclusion therefore is that there is nothing in the decision of <ORG> which can operate as res judicata against the <ORG> either directly or constructively the question of the title of the <ORG> to the mortgaged properties The learned Judges posed certain questions and then attempted to answer them in view of the limited provisions of section Civil Procedure Code which in terms apply only to suits forgetting for the moment if we may say so with respect that the doctrine of res judicata is based general principles of jurisprudence Here it is worthwhile repeating what was said by Sir <NAME> in delivering the judgment of the <ORG> in <NAME> <NAME> In view of the arguments addressed to them their Lordships desire to emphasize that the rule of res judicata while founded ancient precedent is dictated by a wisdom which is for all time It hath been well said declared Lord <NAME> interest reipublicaeut sit finis litium otherwise great oppression might be done under colour and pretence of law <NAME> a Though the rule of the Code May be traced to an English source it embodies a doctrine in no way opposed to the spirit of the law as expounded by the Hindu commentators <NAME> and <NAME> include the plea of a former judgment among those allowed by law each citing for this purpose the text of i I A at <NAME> who describes the plea thus If a person though defeated at law sue again he should be answered you were defeated formerly And so the application of the rule by the courts in India should be influenced by no technical considerations of form but by matter of substance within the limits allowed by law They took active part in the proceedings for leave to appeal and in having the papers prepared for the use of <ORG> They had every right in those proceedings to defend the title of their mortgagors to the four anna share and they fully exercised their right except that at the last stage possibly having won in the two courts below they assumed that the decision in the final court would also be favourable to them and did not appear before <ORG> It had been held in a number of cases prior to the amendment made in section of the Transfer of Property Act by Act XX of that where the property acquired forms part of an estate which is mortgaged for an amount larger than the amount awarded as compensation the mortgagee is entitled to the whole of the compensation in liqcuidation of the mortgage debt In view of the provisions of sections and of the Land Acquisition Act it is evident that if the mortgagee actually intervenes in the land acquisition proceedings and makes a claim for the compensation and any question of title arises about the right of the mortgagor in respect to the land acquired which affects the claim for compensation he has every right to protect that title It was exercised by them in the litigation of the year which ended in the decision of <ORG> in In these circumstances it appears to us that they had no further right left to establish the title of their mortgagors in the four anna share of <NAME> estate claimed by them He appeared and contested the appeal and urged that the mortgagees had no interest whatever in the property acquired and that they were interested only in realising their debt i <NAME> <NAME> and <NAME> <NAME> had no application as the special judge had no jurisdiction to hear the present suit while the District Judge in those cases would have jurisdiction to hear the regular suits It was urged that to substantiate the plea of resjudicata even general principles of law it was necessary that the court that heard and decided the former case should be a court competent to hear the subsequent case When a plea of res judicata is founded general principles of law all that is necessary to establish is that the court that heard and decided the former case was a court of competent jurisdiction It does not seem necessary in such cases to further prove that it has jurisdiction to hear the later suit Next it was urged that the decision given by <ORG> was ex parte and it had not the force of res judicata unless the subject matter of the two proceedings was identical Reliance for this proposition was placed certain observations contained in the decision of <ORG> in <ORG> Co in that case a view was expressed that in the case of a judgment in default of appearance a defendant is only estopped from setting up in a subsequent action a defence which was necessarily and with complete precision decided by the previous judgment and it I A I was said that if a Writ is issued for a small claim the defendant may well think it is better to let judgment go by default rather than incur the trouble and expense of contesting it and that in such cases the default judgment one bond cannot be used as governing the construction of other bonds even if identical in tenor as it would involve a great hardship were the defendat precluded from contesting the later case A now point was taken for the first time before us which had not been taken in express terms in the written statement and which had not been argued either before the Subordinate Judge or before <ORG> The plea has no substance in it It was for this reason that <ORG> in the land acquisition case held that it had not the effect of res judicata <NAME>s suit claiming title in the four anna share of <NAME> estate which under the partition decree had gone to the Sens <NAME> in view of the compromise decree had no right to execute the decree as a different situation had arisen after the decree had been passed She had a fresh cause of action to bring a new suit for possession by setting aside the compromise It is accordingly dismissed with costs
