As the respondents were not promoted from lower posts there was no question of their reversion The orders of termination were passed without holding any departmental enquiry and without giving the respondents any opportunity to make any representation Appeal by special leave from the judgment and order dated January of <ORG> in Letters Patent Appeal No of The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> These two connected appeals raise a common question of construction of of the Punjab Educational Service Provincialised Cadre Class III Rules Before October <NAME> and <NAME> the respondents to these appeals were junior teachers in <ORG> schools On February the Governor of Punjab in exercise of the powers conferred by the proviso to Art Members of the Service officiating or to be promoted against permanent posts shall be on probation in the first instance for one year On the completion of the period of probation the authority competent to make appointment may confirm the member in his appointment or if his work or conduct during the period of probation has been in his opinion unsatisfactory he may dispense with his services or may extend his period of probation by such period as he may deem fit or revert him to his former post if he was promoted from some lower post Provided that the total period of probation including extensions if any shall not exceed three years Service spent on deputation to a corresponding or higher post may be allowed to count towards the period of probation if there is a permanent vacancy against which such member can be confirmed The respondents were officiating in permanent posts and under they continued to hold those posts on probation in the first instance for one year By two separate orders passed on February and April the Director terminated The order shall take effect after one month from the date it is served on him The orders dated February and April were passed without holding any departmental enquiry and without giving the respondents any opportunity of making representations against the action taken against them The respondents filed separate writ petitions in <ORG> challenging the aforesaid orders on the ground that they had acquired substantive rights to their posts and that the orders amounted to removal from service and were passed in violation of Art It is against these appellate orders that the present appeals have been filed after obtaining special leave This Court has consistently held that when a first appointment or promotion is made on probation for a specific period and the employee is allowed to continue in the post after the expiry of the period without any specific order of confirmation he should be deemed to continue in his post as a probationer only in the absence of any indication to the contrary in the original order of appointment or promotion or the service rules The judgment in that case does not refer to such a rule nor does it appear from the judgment that before the He thus continued to hold the post of superintendent as a probationer when the order of reversion was passed The employees referred to in held their posts in the first instance on probation for one year commencing from October The authority could either a extend the period of probation provided the total period of probation including extensions would not exceed three years or revert the employee to his former post if he was promoted from some lower post or dispense with his services if his work or conduct during the period of probation was unsatisfactory or confirm him in his appointment It could pass one of these orders in respect of the respondents on completion of their one year period of probation But the authority allowed them to continue in their posts thereafter without passing any order in writing under The respondents were not promoted from lower posts and there was no question of their reversion to such posts at any time under There was no compelling reason for dispensing with their services and re employing them as temporary employees on October and <ORG> rightly refused to draw the inference that they were so discharged from service and re employed Though the appointing authority did not pass formal orders of confirmation in writing it should be presumed to have passed orders of confirmation by so allowing them to continue in their posts after October After such confirmation the authority had no power to dispense with their services under on the ground that their work or conduct during the period of probation was unsatisfactory It follows that on the dates of the impugned orders the respondents had the right to hold their posts In the result the appeals are dismissed with costs
