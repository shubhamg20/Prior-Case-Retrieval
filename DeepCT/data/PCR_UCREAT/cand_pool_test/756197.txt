lakhs worked out by the <ORG> auditors as depreciation in accordance with <ORG> Act on the ground that there was no evidence that the amount of depreciation came to Rs HELD The appellant company contentions on the questions of development rebate and the provisions for gratuity must be upheld the amount of depreciation must be ascertained afresh by the <ORG> after giving the parties opportunity to lead such evidence as they desired The <ORG> must give an opportunity to the <ORG> to prove its claim for depreciation by reasonable proof and to the <ORG> to test such evidence by cross examination or otherwise Under of the Bonus Act the <ORG> is entitled to deduct out of the gross profits arrived at under the whole of the development rebate admissible under the Income tax Act i the amount per cent of which comes to Rs There was therefore no justification for the <ORG> to allow Rs There is no rule or direction in the Bonus Act which prohibits such a practice There was no justification for the contention that revaluation of company assets in was fictitious and that the difference of Rs It cannot therefore be legitimately said that it was done for any oblique purpose much less with a view to defeat the labour claim to bonus Bonus being payable within eight months after the close of the accounting year in cases where there is no dispute pending before an authority under of the Act as provided by it is hardly possible except in rare cases that assessment under <ORG> Act and other such Acts would be completed by the time bonus has to be paid Therefore the <ORG> would not have before it the taxable income assessed by <ORG> and other such officers If the <ORG> contention were to he right there would be two or more parallel authorities working under the Bonus Act and <ORG> Act and other such Acts who would have to assess taxable income and the tax payable them before all of whom the employer would have to prove his taxable income Section being subject to the computation has to be done without taking into account the items specified in a and in the manner prescribed by the remaining clauses of that section On this basis the company declared the bonus at per cent of the total wages paid to the employees repealed the Ordinance but which saved all things done and action taken under the Ordinance as having been done or taken under the Act The <ORG> disputed this amount on the ground that there was no evidence that the amount of depreciation came to Rs The <ORG> accepted the <ORG> contention stating that there was nothing to show that the company through mistake had shown Rs of the Bonus Act gross profits mean gross profits calculated under sec There was therefore no question of the company having made any mistake in calculating depreciation in the Account or its trying to amend that mistake as erroneously thought by the <ORG> There were three figures for depreciation before the <ORG> Rs The informations and explanations given to the auditors were given verbally after consulting our books of accounts These books and records not having been produced or disclosed there was obviously no opportunity to the <ORG> to verify either of the two figures viz Since the company claimed the deduction of depreciation it stands to reason that the burden of proof that the depreciation claimed by it was the correct amount in accordance with the Income Tax Act was on the <ORG> and that burden the company must discharge once its figures were challenged These observations made with regard to balance sheets and accounts would equally apply to statements made in the auditors certificates prepared on the instructions and information supplied to them by employers Fairness therefore requires that an opportunity must be given to the employees to verify such figures by cross examination of the employer or his witnesses who have calculated depreciation amount The <ORG> should give opportunity to the <ORG> to prove its claim for depreciation by reasonable proof and to the <ORG> to test such evidence by cross examination or otherwise the whole of the development rebate admissible under the Income Tax Act i the amount per cent of which comes to Rs There was therfore no justification for the <ORG> to allow Rs Two questions therefore arise whether it is legitimate in such a scheme of gratuity to estimate the liability on an actuarial valuation and deduct such estimated liability in the account while working out its net profits and In the case of an assessee maintaining his accounts on mercantile system a liability already accrued though to be discharged at a future date would be a proper deduction while working out the profits and gains of his business regard being had to the accepted principles of commercial practice and accountancy A Company carrying on business of buying land and selling it after development sold certain plots received a part of the price but entered the whole of the price receivable as it maintained its books of accounts on mercantile method It was held that having regard to the accepted commercial practice and trading principles and there being no prohibition against it in the Income Tax Act deduction of such estimated liability even though it did not come under any specific provisions of sec But till that is done the amount is ascertained and there is a statutory liability to pay the amounts mentioned in the order under sec <ORG> there holding that the statutory liability to pay the amount mentioned in the order commenced when the demand notice was served and therefore the liability did exist in present But as regards the estimated tax liability it was held that it was a debt inasmuch as the liability to pay the tax was in present though payable in future and was in respect of an ascertainable sum of money On reliance having been placed on <ORG> Owen a a decision to which we shall presently come the <ORG> observed at page that decision had no relevance to the question before it as <ORG> in that decision was concerned in determining the deductibility of the present value of a liability which may arise in future in the computation of taxable income for the relevant year under the Income Tax laws The <ORG> held in view of the terms of sec The question that concerns us is whether while working out the net profits a trader can provide from his gross receipts his liability to pay a certain sum for every additional year of service which he receives from his employees This in our view he can do if such liability is properly ascertainable and it is possible to arrive at a proper discounted present value Even if the liability is a contingent liability provided its discounted present value is ascertainable it can be taken into account The Company claimed to be entitled to charge against each years receipts the cost of making provision for the retirement payments which would ultimately be thrown on it calculating the sum required to be paid to each employee if he retired without feature at the close of the year and setting aside the aggregate of what was required insofar as the year had contributed to the aggregate Counsel conceded that a trader computing his taxable profits for a particular year may properly deduct not only the payments actually made to his employees but A But it was argued that proposition would not apply to that case as the company was not in any year under a definite obligation to pay its employees lump sums on the termination of their employment as in each case the right to a lump sum was contingent on certain conditions being fulfilled and so the prospective liability remained contingent until the service was actually ended Holding that there was no such statutory rule prohibiting the commercial practice of providing for such an estimated liability for each year he compared the two systems and observed at pp It is true that the company carries on business from one year to another but it is not charged on the average of its annual profits As a corollary it will not make any charge to cover the actual payments made in the year in respect of retirement benefits That there is no rule against providing for any such contingent liability but on the contrary such a provision is permissible can be seen from the form of balance sheet in Schedule VI to the Companies Act where provisions for taxation dividends deals with expenditure deductible from out of the taxable income already assessed and not with deductions which are to be made while making the account Provisions made against anticipated losses and contingencies are charges against profits and therefore to be taken into account against gross receipts in the account and the balance sheet On the other hand reserves are appropriations of profits the assets by which they are represented being retained to form part of the capital employed in the business An amount set aside out of profit and other surpluses not designed to meet a liability contingency commitment or diminution in value of assets known to exist at the date of the balance sheet is a reserve but an amount set aside out of profits and other surpluses to provide for any known liability of which the amount cannot be determined with substantial accuracy is a provision see <ORG> Second Edn of the Bonus Act there is a presumption of the genuineness of the account produced by the company unless it is challenged in the manner provided therein lacs which it took into account while making it account was the present discounted liability If under the Income tax Act an estimated liability ascertainable with substantial accuracy can be taken into account for arriving at the true profits and gains there is no reason why the same cannot be done under the Bonus Act unless there is any provision therein forbidding such a practice recognised by commercial accountancy At first blush it would seem as if there is some force in this contention for it would be possible for a company to deflate its gross profits by fictitiously revaluing its fixed assets at regular intervals red claiming interest on the excess by carrying such excess to capital reserve and to reduce thus labor claim to bonus It cannot therefore be legitimately said that it was done for any oblique purpose much less with a view to defeat the labor claim to bonus Section of that Act provides that where an assessee is carrying on a business for which accounts are maintained regularly the Wealth Tax Officer may instead of determining separate the value of each asset held by the assessee determine the net value of the asset of the business as a whole having regard to the balance sheet of such business as on the valuation date We do not therefore see any justification for the apprehension felt by Mr <NAME> for by trying to reduce the gross profits the Company would land itself into being assessed on a higher net wealth There remains now the question regarding computation of direct taxes It had made provision however for Rs In its computation it had made a provision for Rs His contention thus was that the <ORG> must start its calculations from the net profit shown in the account which would have made provision for direct taxes and then deduct from the gross profits calculated under the prior charges permissible under Mr <NAME> contention was that the Bonus Act is drafted on a clean slate giving a go bye to the earlier principle of working out bonus and therefore we must proceed on the footing of the language used in the Act before we conclude on the interpretation to be given to and Negativing the contention it was held that in the application of the Full Bench Formula the deduction of income tax is notional the gross profits are arrived at by adding back certain items to the net profits and then the gross profits are reduced by making certain notional deductions one such deduction is under the head of income tax It was held that this deduction is not made on the actual amount payable but what would be nationally payable on the profits determined under the Full Bench Formula and that if the argument on behalf of the labour were to be accepted the <ORG> would in effect not be applying the formula But do these changes envisage the doing away of the concept of notional tax liability which the <ORG>s used to work out and substituting actual tax liability by first working out the taxable income of the employer under the Income Tax Act and other Acts The answer of course must be found from the provisions of the Act and not from what used to be done before its enactment where there is no dispute pending before an authority under of the Act as provided by it is hardly possible except in rare cases that assessment under <ORG> Act and other such Acts would be completed by the time bonus has to be paid Therefore the <ORG> would not have before it the taxable income assessed by <ORG> and other such officers If the <ORG> contention were to be right there would be two or more parallel authorities working under this Act and <ORG> Act and other such Acts who would have to assess taxable income and the tax payable thereon before all of whom the employer would have to prove his taxable income It was however argued that the provisions of lay down the only departure from <ORG> Act and that except for that departure the <ORG> must assess the actual taxable income and arrive at the tax liability thereon at rates prevailing during the accounting year in question How can the <ORG> arrive at the amount of bonus to be paid to labour without first estimating the amount of taxes and deducting it from the gross profits and thus ascertaining the available surplus If it were to reverse the process and first deduct bonus and ascertain the tax amount it would have to do so on a somewhat ad hoc figure thus bringing about the same result deprecated by this Court in decisions referred to above Section being subject to the computation has to be done without taking into account the items specified in a and in the manner prescribed by the remaining clauses of that section It did away with rehabilitation as a prior charge partly became there were complaints that it was being ill used but partly also because it knew that the rebate in Income Tax Act on bonus paid would go to the employer with which he could recoup the depreciation which would be larger than the one allowed under of <ORG> Act As regards the question of depreciation amount the <ORG> will ascertain the amount afresh after giving the parties opportunity to lead such evidence as they desire and taking that amount and the amounts of development rebate and of the provision for gratuity in the light of this judgment the <ORG> will adjust it award and arrive at the quantum of bonus payable to the workmen Appeal by Company allowed in part
