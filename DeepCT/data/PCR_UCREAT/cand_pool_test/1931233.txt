When it was placed before us under the heading Under Order Rule Civil Procedure Code a question arose as to whether the appeal would still lie to this court in view of the Bihar Public Land Encroachment Amendment Ordinance Bihar Ordinance No of by which the old Section providing for appeals has been substituted by a new section thereby taking away the appellate jurisdiction of this <ORG> According to the amendment brought in by the Ordinance an appeal has now been provided to the Collector of the district if the order in question is passed by any officer other than the Collector and to the Commissioner of the Division if such an order is passed by the Collector of the District The question was argued at some length and considering the importance of the question raised we thought it desirable to pass a considered order at this very stage The argument of Mr <NAME> appearing for the appellants is that the publication of the Hindi version of the amending Ordinance which although became a law would not be enforceable until its English version was published on the nd December In this connection reference was made to Section of the Bihar and Orissa General Clauses Act which provides for Coming into operation of Acts According to Article <ORG> may by law adopt any one or more of the languages in use in the State or Hindi as the language or languages to be used for all or any of the Official purposes of that State and until then the English language is to continue to be used for such purposes within the State for which it was being used immediately before the commencement of the Constitution <ORG> passed an Act namely the Bihar Official Language Act Act of Section of the said Act provides Subject to the provisions of Articles and of the Constitution of India the language to be used for the official purposes of the <ORG> shall be Hindi in Devanagri script ii of all Acts passed by <ORG> or the Legislature of a State and of all Ordinances promulgated by the President or the Governor of a State and iii Notwithstanding anything in Sub clause of Clause where the legislature of a State has prescribed any language other than the English language for use in Billy introduced in or Acts passed by <ORG> or in Ordinances promulgated by the Governor of the State or in any order rule regulation or bye law referred to in paragraph iii of that sub clause a translation of the same in English language published under the authority of the Governor of the State in the Official Gazette of that State shall be deemed to be the authoritative text thereof in the English language under this Article It is not disputed that <ORG> has prescribed Hindi in Deva nagari script as the language for use in Bills to be introduced in or Acts passed by <ORG> as also in Ordinances to be promulgated by the Governor of the State of Bihar besides other matters as provided in the first part of Clause of the aforesaid Article Mr <NAME> laid stress on the fact that although it was permissible for <ORG> to adopt any regional language or Hindi as the language or languages to be used for all or any of the Official purposes of the State it was the <ORG> alone which could provide by law that Hindi would be the language in which Acts could be passed by the Legislature of a State and all Ordinances could be promulgated by the Governor of a State In my considered opinion there is no substance in this contention of Mr <NAME> as the contention is based on an entirely erroneous construction of Article of the Constitution Clause of Article has got an overriding effect over Clause and recognises the right of a <ORG> contained under Article to adopt any language other than the English language for use in Bills introduced in or Acts passed by the <ORG> of the <ORG> or in Ordinances promulgated by the Governor of the <ORG> Section of the Bihar Official Language Act quoted earlier has adopted Hindi in Devanagari script as the language to be used for the official purposes of the <ORG> of Bihar without any qualification The only purport of Clause of Article is to authorise the use of Hindi as the official language of a <ORG> and although notwithstanding a <ORG> law adopting Hindi or regional languages for the official purposes of a <ORG> English can be continued to be used for such purposes until there is an express legislative provision against such use In my judgment what is meant by Clause of Article in making a law by <ORG> is that unless the <ORG> by law otherwise provides the authoritative texts of all Bills Acts or Ordinances of a <ORG> <ORG> cannot be in a language other than the English language The power to declare that the authoritative text of any bill Act or ordinance of a <ORG> <ORG> shall be in language other than the English language has been vested exclusively in <ORG> but it does not mean that the authority of a <ORG> <ORG> to adopt any language other than the English language can be given only by a law made by the <ORG> it is provided that if an English translation of the laws made by the <ORG> or of the rules framed by the <ORG> is published under the authority of the Rajpramukh it shall also be recognised as an authoritative English text for the purposes of Article It was very clearly held by this court in the said case that all ordinances made in Hindi where the <ORG> has so authorised will be a valid piece of legislation even without its English translation From the discussion in the foregoing paragraphs it is manifest that on when the proceeding in question was initiated against the appellants by the Sub divisional Magistrate <NAME> the Bihar Public Land Encroachment Act had already been amend ed by the Amending Ordinance aforesaid thereby prescribing different forum for appeals against the orders passed under Section of the Act and thus taking away the appellate jurisdiction of this court It must therefore be held that no appeal lies to this court against the impugned order
