The Inspector obtained permission from a First Class Magistrate for laying a trap investigated into the case and later after the entire investigation was over he obtained permission from the Magistrate to investigate into the case The conviction was challenged on the following grounds The investigation was without authority of law because under A the Inspector could not have investigated without the prior permission of a Magistrate of the First Class The permission granted by the Magistrate did not meet the requirements of law because it was given casually and without applying his mind to the question as to whether there was any need for departing from the normal rule laid down in the section namely that such cases should ordinarily be investigated by an officer of the rank of Dy HELD There is no basis for the contention that any portion of the investigation was done without authority by law The fact that the Inspector of Police obtain the two permissions one for laying a trap and another for investigating the case does not affect the earlier order as the second permission was wholly superfluous The order giving permission to the Inspector did not give any reasons and there is thus a violation of A But an illegality committed in the course of an investigation does not vitiate the result of a trial unless there was a miscarriage of justice The facts leading upto this appeal are these On March as he was suffering from dysentery and stomach pain he was sent to the appellant along with a sick note for treatment as bribe and he further told <NAME> that unless he paid him the said sum by March he appellant would remove <NAME> name from the sick list The appellant examined some witnesses in support of that plea As this <ORG> does not go into questions of fact except under exceptional circumstances Mr <NAME> primarily confined himself to the legal issues arising in the case He urged that in view of A of the Prevention of Corruption Act PW who was only an Inspector of police could not have investigated the case without the prior permission of a magistrate of the first class on March he merely applied for and obtained from a first class magistrate permission to lay a trap the permission to investigate the case was obtained by him only on the st but by that time the entire investigation was over hence there was no valid investigation A permission under that provision is a permission to investigate the case There is no doubt that <ORG> was under a mistaken impression that he should obtain two permissions one for laying the trap and another for investigating the case But that permission was wholly superfluous and the same does not affect the validity of the earlier order Hence there is no basis for the contention that any portion of the investigation in this case was done without the authority of law It was next urged that before granting the permission the learned magistrate did not apply his mind to the question whether there was any need for granting the sanie Before permitting PW he should have first ascertained whether any officer of the rank of Deputy Superintendent or above was not immediately available to investigate the case and whether there was any other reason for departing from the normal rule laid down by the legislature namely that cases of this nature should be investigated by officers of the rank of Deputy Superintendent of Police or above It was further contended on behalf of the appellant that the earned magistrate made the order casually he gave no reason in support of his order and hence the permission granted does not meet the requirements of the law An officer below the rank of deputy superintendent can investigate those offenses if he obtains the previous permission of a first class magistrate A magistrate can not surrender his discretion to a police officer but must exercise it having regard to the relevant material made available to him at the stage of granting permission He must also be satisfied that there is reason owing to exigencies of the administrative convenience to entrust a subordinate officer with the investigAtion It is further observed therein that it is desirable that the order giving the permission should ordinarily on the face of it disclose the reasons for giving permission The order giving permission under A in this case does not give any reason We next take up the question as to the scope of of the Prevention of Corruption Act Once that fact is admitted by him the court has to presume unless the contrary is proved by the appellant that he accepted the sum in question as a motive or reward for issuing the fit certificate In the context we see no justification for not giving the word gratification its literal dictionary meaning There is another consideration which supports this construction This clause his reference to the offence punishable under of the Code and there is no doubt that one of the essential ingredients of the said offence is that the valuable things should have been received by the accused without consideration or for a not be suggested that the relevant clause in which deals with the acceptance of any valuable thing should be interpreted to impose upon the prosecution an obligation to prove not only that the valuable thing has been received by the accused but that it has been received by him without consideration or for a consideration which he knows to be inadequate It is true that the <ORG> might have used the word money or consideration as has been done by the relevant section of the English statute but if the dictionary meaning of the word gratification fits in with the scheme of the section and leads to the same result as the meaning of the word valuable thing mentioned in the same clause we see no justification for adding any clause to qualify the word gratification the view for which the appellant contends in effect amounts to adding a qualifying clause to describe gratification But under the court is bound to draw the presumption mentioned therein But at the same time it was mentioned in that decision that the burden resting on the accused will be satisfied if the accused person establishes his case by a preponderance of probability and it is not necessary for him to establish his case by the test of proof beyond reasonable doubt In other words the nature of the burden placed on him is not the same as that placed on prosecution which must not only prove its case but prove it beyond reasonable doubt In the instant case the evidence adduced by the appellant in support of his plea was not accepted by the trial court as well as <ORG> This takes us to the last point urged by Mr <NAME> namely that the sanction to prosecute granted by PW the chief medical officer under of the Prevention of Corruption Act is invalid as he was not the authority competent to remove the appellant from his office and hence the prosecution is vitiated Section to the extent it is material for our present purpose reads No court shall take cognizance of an offence punishable under section or section or section of the Indian Penal Code or Under sub section or sub section A of section of this Act alleged to have been committed by a public servant except with the previous sanction a in the case of any other person of the authority competent to remove him from his office as well as in several other decisions that no court can validly take cognizance of any of the offenses mentioned in of the Prevention of Corruption Act without the previous sanction of the authority competent to remove from office the accused Without a valid sanction the court had no jurisdiction to try the case Hence we asked the learned counsel for the respondent to satisfy us with reference to the rules on the subject that was competent to remove the appellant from his office It was contended on behalf of Therefore we proceed on the basis that the appellant was a non gazetted officer III th re print dated we may take it that was the head of the department to which the appellant belongs There is no evidence to show that this power has been delegated to the heads of the department No provision in the Indian Railway Establishment Code prescribing the authorities competent to remove from office a class III officer was brought to our notice Till such times these are printed the rules and provisions contained in Chapter XVII and Appendices IV and XVIII in the Edition Reprint as amended from time to time shall continue to apply Rule says Without prejudice to the provisions of any law for the time being in force relating to the conduct of Government servants or to the rules made under section of the Indian Railways Act the conduct of railway servants shall be governed by the rules contained in Appendix Vlll Our attention has not been invited to any rules made under of the Indian Railways Act or any other statutory rules Hence we are proceeding on the basis that the aforementioned governs the present case Rule says that the authorities who are competent to place a railway servant under suspension and to impose penalties on him are specified in the Schedules II and III appended to the Rules We accordingly allow this appeal and set aside the conviction of the appellant
