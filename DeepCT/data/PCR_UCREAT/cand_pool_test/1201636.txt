In a writ petition <ORG> held that unless the mineral deposits were specifically mentioned in the Wajib ul arz of a village as having vested in the <ORG> their ownership would still remain vested in the former proprietors according to the record of rights To meet this situation the <ORG> legislature passed the Haryana Minerals Vesting of Rights Act The respondents in the appeals containded that the declaration in of the Central Act that it was expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals would become unworkable if the provisions of the <ORG> Act were permitted to operate While the appeals were pending writ petitions were filed in this <ORG> under Article ii No rights are shown by any petitioner to have been conferred upon him under any lease or licence executed in accordance with the provisions of the Central Act but any petitioner either before <ORG> or in this <ORG> who can establish any such right governed by the provisions of the Central Act of may take such proceedings before an appropriate court as may still be open to him under the law against any such action or Government notification as is alleged to infringe that right The character of the <ORG> Act has to be judged by the substance and effect of its provisions and not merely by the purpose given in the <ORG>ment of Objects and Reasons The provisions contained in show that <ORG> itself contemplated state legislation for vesting of lands containing mineral deposits in <ORG> This feature could only be explained on the assumption that <ORG> did not intend to trench upon powers of <ORG> legislatures under entry of List II read with entry of List III Again of the Central Act shows that there was no intention to interfere with vesting of lands in the <ORG>s by the provisions of the Central Act There is no force in the contention of the respondents that the vesting contemplated by as it now stands must be of estates of proprietors or lands of tenureholders under some legislation for agrarian reform Power to legislate for the acquisition of the whole of an estate or tenure would include the power to legislate for any part of it It is clear from of the <ORG> Act that the provisions of this Act were to be read subject to the provisions made by or under the Central Act Therefore if there were no lessee or licensee rights of mining in minor minerals on land which were actually regulated by the provisions of the Central Act they would continue It is not correct to say that any new question was allowed to be raised simply because the parties were permitted to place their points of view on the same question after taking into account the changes brought about in Act of by Act of and how earlier decisions of this <ORG> which were given before the amendments came into force could be at all helpful in deciding the questions The Judgment of the Court was delivered by <NAME> The seventeen appeals before us by the <ORG> and by the Director of Industries of Haryana after certification under Article a of the constitution are directed against a Judgment of <ORG> and Haryana on Writ Petition of owners of lands and lessees of mineral rights in land seeking reliefs in the nature of Mandamus to enforce fundamental rights conferred by Article and to restrain the Government of Haryana from taking any action to implement two notifications void i No II dated the th February and ii No GIG SP Auc dated the nd February after declaring the Haryana Minerals Vesting of Rights Act hereinafter referred to as the Haryana Act Under the notification of th February <ORG> purported to acquire rights to Saltpetre a minor mineral in the land described in a schedule appended to the notification issued in exercise of power conferred by Section sub But from the averments in the statements on behalf of the <ORG> and on behalf of some of the respondents in the affidavits supporting their respective cases in proceedings for a stay of the operation of <ORG> judgment it appears that the intention of the <ORG> was to acquire Saltpetre deposits in lands whose owners had granted mining leases claimed by petitioners in <ORG> to be subsisting The <ORG> was to get the difference between the price of acquisition and amount realised on sale of each part sold The case of the petitioners in <ORG> was Firstly that the Haryana Act was beyond the competence of <ORG> inasmuch as the field in which this Act operated was necessarily occupied already by the provisions of the Central Act enacted under entry No of the Union List List I of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution which reads as follows Regulation of mines and mineral development to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest Section of the Central Act lays down It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that the <ORG> should take under its control the regulation of mines and the development of minerals to the extent hereinafter provided But Section A introduced by Section of the Central Act of lays down A Where <ORG> after consultation with <ORG> is of opinion that it is expedient in the interest of regulation of mines and mineral development so to do it may request <ORG> to make a premature termination of a mining lease in respect of any mineral other than a minor mineral and on receipt of such request <ORG> shall make an order making a premature termination of such mining lease and granting a fresh mining lease in favour of such Government company or corporation owned or controlled by Government as it may think fit Similarly Section provides periods of grant and renewal of leases by <ORG> Sections to of the Central Act contain procedure for obtaining prospecting licences or mining leases in land in which mineral rights vest in the <ORG> Rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases are to be made by <ORG> according to the detailed provisions of Section and Section A The provisions of Sections to inclusive shall not apply to quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals Section makes it clear that it is <ORG> which has the power to make rules for regulating the grant of quarry leases mining leases or other mineral concessions in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith Section of the Central Act enacts a All mining leases granted before the commencement of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Amendment Act if in force at such commencement shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder within six months from such commencement or such further time as <ORG> may by general or special order specify in this behalf Where the rights under any mining lease granted by the proprietor of an estate or tenure before the commencement of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Amendment Act have vested on or after the th day of October in <ORG> in pursuance of the provisions of any Act of any Provincial or State Legislature which provides for the acquisition of estates or tenures or provides for agrarian reform such mining lease shall be brought into conformity with the provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder within six months from the commencement of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Amendment Act or within such further time as <ORG> may by general or special order specify in this behalf Clause of this Section reads The provisions of this Section shall apply in respect of land in which the minerals vest in the Government of a State or any other person Section contains powers of <ORG> in consultation with <ORG> to prohibit grant of prospecting or mining leases in any area specified in a notification Section dealing with the development of minerals enacts It shall be the duty of <ORG> to take all such steps as may be necessary for the conservation and development of minerals in India and for that purpose <ORG> may by notification in the Official Gazette make such rules as it thinks fit In particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing power such rules may provide for all or any of the following matters namely a the opening of new mines and the regulation of mining operations in any area the regulation of the excavation or collection of minerals from any mine the measures to be taken by owners of mines for the purpose of beneficiation of ores including the provision of suitable contrivances for such purpose the development of mineral resources in any area the notification of all new borings and shaft sinkings and the preservation of bore hole records and specimens of cores of all new bore holes the regulation of the arrangements for the storage of minerals and the stocks thereof that may be kept by any person the submission of samples of minerals from any mine by the owner thereof and the manner in which and the authority to which such samples shall be submitted and the taking of samples of any minerals from any mine by <ORG> or any authority specified by it in that behalf and the submission by owners of mines of such special or periodical returns and reports as may be specified and the form in which and the authority to which such returns and reports shall be submitted All rules made under this section shall be binding on the Government It should be noted that Section set out above empowers <ORG> to make rules for the conservation and development of minerals in any part of India Miscellaneous provisions are contained in Sections to of the Central Act Any prospecting licence or mining lease granted renewed or acquired in contravention of the provisions of this Act or any rules or orders made thereunder shall be void and of no effect The provisions of this Act and the rules made thereunder shall apply in relation to the renewal after the commencement of this Act of any prospecting licence or mining lease granted before such commencement as they apply in relation to the renewal of a prospecting licence or mining lease granted after such commencement Section provides for penalties for anyone who contravenes the provisions of Section of the Act It lays down that Any rent royalty tax fee or other sum due to the Government under this Act or the rules made thereunder or under the terms and conditions of any prospecting licence or mining lease may on a certificate of such officer as may be specified by <ORG> in this behalf by general or special order be recovered in the same manner as an arrear of land revenue Section shows that the orders made by <ORG> or other authority in exercise of powers by or under the Central Act are revisable by <ORG> In <ORG> case supra the validity of the Orissa Mining Areas Development Fund Act was questioned on the ground that it authorised the State of Orissa to impose a cess on the valuation of the minerals And entry of List II is Fees in respect of any of the matters in this list but not including fees taken in any court It had also cited in support of its case entry of List I of Industries the control of which by the <ORG> is declared by <ORG> by law to be expedient in the public interest It was contended on behalf of West Bengal State that the Coal Bearing Areas Acquisition and Development Act enacted by <ORG> proposing to acquire certain coal bearing areas in the State did not apply to areas owned by the State itself and in the alternative that even if it did so apply to areas owned by the State of West Bengal it was beyond the legislative competence of <ORG> because entry in the Concurrent List List III did not authorise an acquisition of property already vested in the State although this entry in the Concurrent List merely reads acquisition and requisitioning of property Learned Counsel for the appellant State before us has relied upon the case of State of West Bengal supra for contending that the powers of the State of Haryana to acquire land are not impaired by the declaration contained in the Central Act There fore in the absence of any provision express or necessarily implying that the property of the <ORG> could be acquired by the <ORG> the rights claimed by the <ORG> to legislate for acquisition of <ORG> property must be negatived Applying this rule he contends that the powers of <ORG> to acquire land are left intact by the Central Act of Power to legislate for regulation and development of mines and minerals under the control of the <ORG> would by necessary implication include the power to acquire mines and minerals Moreover power to acquire for purposes of development and regulation has not been exercised by Act of The existence of power of <ORG> to legislate on this topic as an incident of exercise of legislative power on another subject is one thing It is difficult to see how the field of acquisition could become occupied by a Central Act in the same way as it had been in the West Bengal case supra even before <ORG> legislates to acquire land in a State Atleast until <ORG> has so legislated as it was shewn to have done by the statute considered by this Court in the case from West Bengal the field is free foe State legislation falling under the express provisions of entry of List III In this case the legality of certain demands as fee under the Orissa Act of the validity of which had been upheld by this Court in <ORG> case supra came up for consideration again in the light of the provisions of the Central Act of It was contended on behalf of the State of Orissa that the objects and purposes of the Orissa Act and of the Central Act were entirely distinct and different so that they could validly co exist since neither trespassed into the field of the other Reliance was placed upon the provisions of Section of the Central Act to hold at Repugnancy arises when two enactments both within the competence of the two <ORG>s collide and when the Constitution expressly or by necessary implication provides that the enactment of one <ORG> has superiority over the other than to the extent of the repugnancy the one supersedes the other The test of two legislations containing contradictory provisions is not however the only criterion of repugnancy for if a competent legislature with a superior efficacy expressly or impliedly evinces by its legislation an intention to cover the whole field the enactments of the other legislature whether passed before or after would be overborne on the ground of repugnance Where such is the position the inconsistency is demonstrated not by a detailed comparison of provisions of the two statutes but by the mere existence of the two pieces of legislation In the present case having regard to the terms of it appears clear to us that the intention of <ORG> was to cover the entire field and thus to leave no scope for the argument that until rules were framed there was no inconsistency and no supersession of the State Act It was also held there at If by reason of the declaration by <ORG> the entire subject matter of conservation and development of minerals has been taken over for being dealt with by <ORG> thus depriving the <ORG> of the power which it therefore possessed it would follow that the matter in the <ORG> List is to the extent of the declaration subtracted from the scope and ambit of Entry of the <ORG> List In <NAME> case supra the proviso to Section of the Bihar Land Reforms Amendment Act Bihar Act of and a sub rule of Rule added on December by a notification of the Governor to the Bihar Minor Mineral Rules came up for consideration Under the Bihar Land Reforms Act the former landlords had ceased to have any interest from the date of vesting so that their rights as lessors under the mining leases granted by them in their estates became vested in the State of Bihar under Section of the Land Reforms Act and by Section of that Act the terms on which the lands were held on leases between the original lessors and lessees became binding on <ORG> under the impugned proviso to Section amounting to alteration of the terms of the leases executed by the original lessors the former landlords additional demands were made upon lessees <ORG> had also relied upon a sub rule added to Rule framed under Section of the Central Act of We have thus not to look outside Act of to determine what is left within the competence of <ORG> but have to work it out from the terms of that Act After referring to what was decided in the earlier cases this Court said at These two cases bind us and apply here The other side must of course show that the matter is already covered and there is no room for legislation It added at We have already analysed Act of The Act takes over the control of regulation of mines and development of minerals to the <ORG> of course to the extent provided It deals with minor minerals separately from the other minerals In respect of minor minerals it provides in that ss of the Act do not apply to prospecting licences and mining leases It goes on to state in that <ORG> may by notification in the official <ORG> make rules for regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith and that until rules are made any rules made by <ORG> regulating the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minor minerals which were in force immediately before the commencement of the Act would continue in force It follows that the subject of legislation is covered in respect of minor minerals by the express words of <ORG> has undertaken legislation and laid down that regulation of the grant of prospecting licences and mining leases in respect of minor minerals and for purposes connected therewith must be by rules made by <ORG> Whether the rules are made or not the topic is covered by <ORG>ary legislation and to that extent the powers of <ORG> are wanting Therefore there is no room for State Legislation In <NAME> case supra this <ORG> also said at We have already held that the whole of the legislative field was covered by the <ORG>ary declaration read with provisions of Act of particularly We have also held that entry of List II was to that extent cut down by entry of List I The whole of the topic of minor minerals became a <ORG> subject The <ORG> <ORG> allowed rules to be made but that did not recreate a scope for legislation at the State level The place of such a law could not be taken by legislation by <ORG> as it purported to do by enacting the second Proviso to of the Land Reforms Act Whether was intended to apply to minor minerals as well or any part of it applies to minor minerals are questions we cannot consider in view of the clear declaration in of Act of that the provisions of ss inclusive do not apply Therefore there does not exist any prohibition such as is to be found in Proviso in respect of minor minerals Although applies to minor minerals it only permits modification of mining leases granted before October In regard to leases of minor minerals executed between this date and December when Rule was enacted there is no provision of law which enables the terms of existing leases to be altered We have also held that vested rights could only be taken away by law made by a competent legislature The existing provision related to regulation of leases and matters connected therewith to be granted in future and not for alteration of the terms of leases which were in existence before Act of It could not derive sustenance from the second Proviso to of the Land Reforms Act since that proviso was not validly enacted The question which arises before us now is whether possibly as a result of the decision of this <ORG> in <NAME> case supra the <ORG> had not amended the law as we find it in the present Section of the Act of as amended by Act of so as to undo its effect Notwithstanding anything contained in any law for the time being in force on the publication of the notification under sub section the right to the minerals in the land specified in the notification shall vest absolutely in <ORG> and <ORG> shall subject to the provisions of the Mines and Minerals Regulation and Development Act have all the powers necessary for the proper enjoyment or disposal of such right The right to the minerals in the land includes the right of access to land for the purpose of prospecting and working mines and for the purposes subsidiary thereto including the sinking of pits and shafts erection of plants and machinery construction of roads stacking of minerals and deposits of refuse quarrying and obtaining building and road materials using water and taking timber and any other purpose which <ORG> may declare to be subsidiary to mining Section merely gives the Act its title and Section deals with definitions Section provides for references or disputes about compensation to Civil Courts Section provides for appeals Section contains the necessary powers of the State Government to frame rules But on th May <ORG> held on a Writ Petition No of that unless the mineral deposits are specifically mentioned in the Wajib ul arz of a village as having vested in the <ORG> their ownership would still remain vested in the former proprietors mentioned as owners of their lands in a Wajib ul arz Apparently there was no conflict between the <ORG> and <ORG> on the policy underlying the Act The arguments advanced on behalf of the appellant State were Firstly that the Central Act does not purport to cover or operate upon the power to acquire ownership in minerals which are part of land The relevant entry for exercise of legislative power to acquire property is entry in the Concurrent List List III of the Seventh Schedule There was thus no unavoidable conflict between it and the State Act On the other hand the learned Counsel for the respondents has urged that the cases before us are covered completely by the decisions of this Court discussed above and in particular by those in <ORG> It seems difficult to sustain the case that the provisions of the Central Act would be really unworkable by mere change of ownership of land in which mineral deposits are found We have to judge the character of the Haryana Act by the substance and effect of its provisions and not merely by the purpose given in the statement of reasons and objects behind it As we found nothing in the judgment under appeal or in the arguments advanced by either side to indicate that the effect of Act of which had amended Act of had been specifically noticed we considered it necessary to hear further arguments with a view to giving parties an opportunity of showing us how earlier decisions when the provisions introduced by Act of were not there could be at all helpful in deciding the question now before us One of the objections taken before us at the further hearing given to the parties was that we should not allow a new point to be argued Indeed we are bound to take judicial notice of the law as it exists after its amendment We can only apply the law as it exists and not the law as it once was No party could justifiably complain that it was given an additional opportunity to meet what follows from the amended law even if the effect of the amendment was not noticed earlier The provisions lay down that mining leases granted in such land must be brought into conformity with the amended law introduced by Act of It seems to us that this clearly means that <ORG> itself contemplated State legislation for vesting of lands containing mineral deposits in the State <ORG> Again Section of the Central Act of shows that there was no intention to interfere with vesting of lands in the States by the provisions of the Central Act And power to legislate for the acquisition of the whole of an estate or tenure would include the power to legislate for any part of it had been given powers of acquiring lands belonging to the <ORG> of West Bengal Even if the power was vested in the <ORG> to acquire land as an incident of regulation and development of minerals that power not having been exercised at all by Act is of it was not permissible to assume any conflict between the Central Act of and the Haryana Act Sixthly the provisions of Act of also show that the power of granting leases and concessions in respect of mineral deposits is left largely to <ORG> Government There is however one argument advanced on behalf of holders of leases or licences of mining rights which must be upheld It is clear from Section of the Haryana Act itself that the provisions of this Act are to be read subject to the provisions made by or under the Central Act Obviously therefore if there are any lessee or licensee rights of mining in minor minerals on land which were actually regulated by the provisions of the Central Act of they will continue We do not know which respondent in the appeal or which petitioner in Writ Petitions before us has any subsisting rights governed by any of the provisions of the Central Act or rules made thereunder Its purpose is stated in the following terms In exercise of powers conferred by sub section of Section of the Haryana Mineral Vesting of Rights Act the Governor of Haryana hereby acquires the right to the minerals mentioned in column of the schedule given below in the land specified in column thereof ii The period of contract shall commence from the date of execution of the agreement to the st March Therefore he will not have any right to revoke his officer A perusal of the petitions and the counter affidavits filed in reply on behalf of the State of Haryana shows that the only dispute between the parties relates to the vesting of ownership rights in a minor mineral in these plots Parties will bear their own costs
