As there was only one <ORG> during the transitional period the President in exercise of his powers under Art The appellant who was appointed to <ORG> in held the post of Superintendent of Police in the Punjab in when he was reverted as Assistant Superintendent of Police and informed that action was proposed to be taken against him under of the All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules framed under Of the All India Services Act LXI of It was contended on behalf of the appellant that the President had exceeded his power under Art in the way he did that the provisional <ORG> was incompetent to enact the impugned Act as there was no compliance with the condition precedent to such an Act being passed under Art as they were made at a time when the adaptation was no longer in force that the <ORG> had no authority to delegate its function under Art to <ORG> that at any rate Of the Act was vitiated by excessive delegation and that the Punjab Government had no authority under the Rules to institute the proceedings The power given to the President by Art It was well settled that the <ORG> was competent to delegate to other authorities the power to frame rules to carry out the purposes of the law made by it Section of the Act read with Of the Act showed that there was no delegation of power to <ORG> under Of the Act in excess of what was justified by the special circumstances of the case There was no basis for the contention that <ORG> and not the Punjab Government could institute the enquiry The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO This appeal by special leave raises the question of the constitutionality of the All India Services Act LXI of hereinafter called the Act He held charge as Superintendent of Police in various districts but was reverted as Assistant Superintendent of Police in August and was eventually Posted to Dharamsala in March In the same month he was informed that it was proposed to take action against him under of the All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules herein Notice was issued to him by the Enquiry Officer in July He thereupon immediately made an application under Art Thereupon he came to this Court and was granted special leave by the Constitution Removal of Difficulties Order No II of th January was in excess of the power conferred on him under Art It was not within the competence of the provisional <ORG> to enact the Act in as there was no compliance with the condition precedent to such an Act being passed under Art laid a mandate on <ORG> to make a law regulating the recruitment and conditions of service of all India services created under that Article and <ORG> could not delegate this function to the Central Government and therefore of the Act was invalid In any event the delegation made by of the Act was excessive and therefore section should be struck down and The Punjab Government has no authority to institute these proceedings under the Rules Article provides that the President may for the purpose of removing any difficulties particularly in relation to the transition from the provisions of the Government of India Act to the provisions of this Constitution by order direct that this Constitution shall during such period as may be specified in the order have effect subject to such adaptations whether by way of modification addition or omission as he may deem to be necessary or expedient provided that no such order shall be made after the first meeting of <ORG> duly constituted under Chapter of Part As there was only one <ORG> during the transitional period there were bound to be difficulties in the application of the Constitution which envisaged a bicameral legislature read as follows Notwithstanding anything in Part XI <ORG> may by law provide for the creation of one or more all India services common to the Union and the States and subject to the other provisions of this Chapter regulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of persons appointed to any such service as it originally stood in the Constitution the words Council of States had been substituted by the words provisional <ORG> so that instead of a resolution of <ORG> a resolution of the provisional <ORG> would have been necessary for the creation and regulation of recruitment and conditions of service of an all India service common to the Union and the States It is urged that if the President had made the adaptation in the way suggested by learned counsel that would have left the requirement of a resolution supported by requisite majority untouched and would have been within the power of the President but inasmuch as the entire portion was omitted the President had exceeded his power Reference to the fact that adaptation left the requirement of a special majority untouched was made obviously for the purpose of emphasising that there was no real ground of grievance and not for indicating that in the absence of the retention of that provision the adaptation would have been bad Indeed it was pointed out in that case that Art The power given to the President under Art and that if he had not done so a resolution of the provisional <ORG> would have been necessary with the requisite majority before any law could be undertaken to regulate the recruitment and the conditions of service of an all India service was within his power there is very little left in the other two points raised by Mr <NAME> and the provisional <ORG> would have power to pass the Act without any resolution being passed before the law was made The rules were framed under the power given to <ORG> by the Act and if the Act was valid when it was passed <ORG> would have power to frame rules under it as it is a permanent measure There is no force therefore in any of these three points and we reject them lays down a mandate on <ORG> to make the law itself regulating the recruitment and the conditions of service of all India services and therefore it was not open to <ORG> to delegate any part of the work relating to such regulation to <ORG> by framing Rules for the purpose Now it is well settled that it is competent for the legislature to delegate to other authorities the power to frame rules to carry out the purposes of the law made by it was so held by the majority of Judges in Re The Delhi Laws Act It also lays down that all rules made under this section shall be laid for not less than fourteen days before <ORG> as soon as possible after they are made and shall be subject to such modifications whether by way of repeal or amendment as <ORG> may make on a motion made during the session in which they are so said We have therefore to see whether there is anything in the words of Art which takes away the usual power of delegation which ordinarily resides in the legislature Stress in this connection has been laid on the words <ORG> may by law provide appearing in Art It is urged that these words should be read to mean that there is no scope for delegation in a law made under Art Our attention in this connection was drawn to words used in Art It is said that the words used in Art Reference was also made to the words used in Art It is urged that when the Constitution uses the words may by law confer or may by law provide no delegation whatsoever is possible We are of opinion that these words do not necessarily exclude delegation and it will have to be seen in each case how far the intention of the Constitution was that the entire provision should be made by law without recourse to any rules framed under the power of delegation from this angle and see if the intention of the Constitution was that regulation of recruitment and conditions of service to an all India service should only be by law and there should be no delegation of any power to frame rules Regulation of recruitment and conditions of service requires numerous and varied rules which may have to be changed from time to time as the exigencies of public service require In the circumstances we are of opinion that the words used in Art We therefore reject this contention The argument in this connection is that even if delegation is possible there was excessive delegation in this case and therefore the Act should be struck down The first section deals with the short title the second section defines the expression all India Service and the third section gives power to <ORG> to frame rules for regulation of recruitment and the conditions of service after consultation with the Governments of the States concerned and lays down that all rules so framed shall be laid before <ORG> and shall be subject to such modifications as <ORG> may make In this connection reference was made to the following observations of Mukherjea as he was then in Re The Delhi Laws Act at The essential legislative function consists in the determination or choosing of the legislative policy and of formally enacting that policy into a binding rule of conduct It is open to the legislature to formulate the policy as broadly and with as little or as much details as it thinks proper and it may delegate the rest of the legislative work to a subordinate authority who will work out the details within the framework of that policy I So long as a policy is laid down and a standard established by statute no constitutional delegation of legislative power is involved in leaving to selected instrumentalities the making of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determination of facts to which the legislation is to apply What does in fact provide Undoubtedly there were rules in force immediately before the Commencement of the Act which governed the two all India services covered by it and the legislature adopted those rules and said in that they shall continue to be in force There is no doubt however that did lay down that the existing rules will govern the two all India services in the matter of regulation of recruitment and conditions of service and in so far as it did so it determined the legislative policy and set up a standard for <ORG> to follow and formally enacted it into a binding rule of conduct Further by <ORG> was given the power to frame rules in future which may have the effect of adding to altering varying or amending the rules accepted under as binding Therefore reading along with of the Act it cannot be said in the special cir cumstances of this case that there was excessive delegation to <ORG> by The last contention is that <ORG> has no authority to institute these proceedings under the Rules Rule provides the procedure for imposing penalties We are of opinion that there is no force in this contention The appellant was serving in connection with the affairs of the State of Punjab and in his case therefore the <ORG> for the purpose of which provides procedure for imposing penalties would be <ORG> Rule provides for what is to happen after the enquiry is over and it lays down that after the enquiry has been completed and after the punishing authority has arrived at a provisional conclusion in regard to the penalty to be imposed if the penalty proposed is dismissal removal compulsory retirement or reduction in rank the member of the service charged shall be supplied with a copy of the report of enquiry and be given a further opportunity to show cause why the proposed penalty should not be imposed on him We therefore dismiss the appeal with costs to the State of Punjab
