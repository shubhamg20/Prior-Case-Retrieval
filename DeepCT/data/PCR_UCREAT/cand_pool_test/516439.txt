HEADNOTE The Coal Bearing Areas Acquisition and Development Act was enacted as indicated in the preamble for providing for the acquisition by the State of unworked land containing or likely to contain coal deposits and under of the Act <ORG> was empowered to issue a notification with reference to its intention to prospect for coal from land in any locality Between the year and the month of May the colliery was not worked because it was uneconomical to work it but the petitioners made an application on December to <ORG> for permission to reopen the Colliery and though no reply was received from the Board the petitioners commenced drilling operations in May but discontinued them from August in view of the notification The petitioners challenged the validity of the notification on the ground that the preamble of the Act and ss and show that the Act was applicable only to unworked mines which must mean virgin lands and not to those which were being worked at the time of notification or which were worked in the past whereas the petitioners coal field had been worked and the working had ceased for some time only due to the unremunerative market for the produce and of the Constitution of India on the grounds that the effect of a notification under the Act was to prevent an owner or lessee of a mine from working for two or three years which was too long a period and therefore the restrictions could not be regarded as reasonable that the Act did not contain any provision for compensation for the deprivation of the petitioners right to carry on their business for two or three years and that of the Act though it dealt with the payment of compensation did not provide for compensation for mineral rights that the restrictions imposed upon an owner or lessee of a mine by which he is prevented from working his mine for a certain period of time under ss and of the Act are not unreasonable and that the Act does not contravene Art The petitioners have stated in their respective petitions that in consequence of the issue of the aforesaid notification they are precluded from carrying on any mining operations in the respective collieries and that <ORG> is entitled to acquire mining rights in the area covered by the notification within a period of two years from the date of notification or within such further period not exceeding one year as <ORG> may specify by notification in the Official Gazette of the Constitution contending that the aforesaid notification is ultra vires and illegal inasmuch as it interfere with their fundamental right to own property and to carry on business After dealing with the arguments advanced with reference to that case we will deal briefly with the other case The preamble runs thus An Act to establish in the economic interest of India greater public control over the coal mining industry and its development by providing for the acquisition by the State of unworked land containing or likely to contain coal deposits or of rights in or over such land for the extinguishment or modification of such rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease licence or otherwise The petitioner in fact made an application on December to <ORG> as required by the provisions of the Coal Mines Conservation and Safety Act XII of for permission to reopen the colliery but it did not receive any reply from <ORG> Before however we deal with that argument we must consider the main contention of Mr <NAME> which is to the effect that the Act applies only to virgin land Mr <NAME> contended that the preamble to an Act is a key to understanding the provisions of the Act and referred us in this connection to the advisory opinion of this <ORG> in re the Kerala Education Bill In that case <NAME> who delivered the opinion of the <ORG> has observed The long title of the said Bill The Kerala Education Bill describes it as A Bill to provide for the better organisation and development of educational institutions in the State holding that it is permissible to look at the preamble for understanding the import of the various clauses contained in the Bill this <ORG> has not said that full effect should not be given to the express provisions of the Bill even though they appear to go beyond the terms of the preamble Again where very general language is used in an enactment which it is clear must be intended to have a limited application the preamble may be used to indicate to what particular instances the enactment is intended to apply We cannot therefore start with the preamble for construing the provisions of an Act though we would be justified in resorting to it nay we will be required to do so if we find that the language used by <ORG> is ambiguous or is too general though in point of fact <ORG> intended that it should have a limited application We cannot accept the argument of Mr <NAME> The very fact that power has been given to <ORG> to enter upon and survey land for the purpose of ascertaining whether there is any coal in that land shows that the legislature had in mind only that land which has not been mentioned as coal bearing in any of the reports of the <ORG> of would show that the Act is not restricted to unworked lands only but applies equally to those lands on which there are existing mines but those mines are not being worked We cannot accede to this argument for the simple reason that if the language of sub of is capable of being interpreted as applying to any land in which coal mining operations are actually being carried on then there is all the greater reason why that provision should be held also to apply to land in which coal mining operations were carried on in the past though they are not being carried on at present Then Mr <NAME> referred to cl of which runs thus any mining lease in so far as it authorises the lessee or any person claiming through him to undertake any operation in the laid shall cease to have effect for so long as the notification under that sub The words used in the section are to undertake any operations in the land which according to <ORG> mean to enter upon work enterprise responsibility Undoubtedly the provision has to be interpreted reasonably and it does not mean that if the notification came into force on the Monday and the mine was not worked on Sunday because of a holiday the lessee was prohibited by the notification from working it In this connection we may refer to of the Coal Mines Regulations of which provides that when it is intended to reopen a mine after abandonment for a period exceeding days not less than days notice before resumption of mining operations must be given to certain authorities Mr <NAME> then contended that a mining area is always extensive and it is not possible to work on every bit of it simultaneously and therefore if work is carried on at one point in a colliery the whole colliery must be deemed to be working that is to say coal mining operations must be deemed to have been carried on over the entire area on which the colliery is situate We must therefore examine here the argument of Mr <NAME> that every colliery must be held to be exempted under sub of In addition there is Regulation of which requires that the notice contemplated by should be submitted in Form I No doubt the petitioner had given notice as required by these provisions No doubt also that it was necessary for the authorities concerned to take appropriate action on the notice We must give effect to the plain lan guage of sub of We are not here concerned with the question whether the failure of the petitioner to comply with the requirements of the Coal Mines Act or of the Regulations of precludes the petitioner under that Act or under those regulations from carrying on mining operations Of course it is possible to say that the action of the <ORG> would interfere with the potential right of the owner or the lessee to work the mines and this would interfere with his right to hold property and carry on his business When we deal with the other part of Mr <NAME> argument we shall deal with this question It was next contended that which deals with the power of the Central <ORG> to acquire land or rights in or over land notified under also indicates the limited operation of the Act Sub section of runs thus If <ORG> is satisfied that coal is obtainable in the whole or any part of the land notified under sub section section it may within a period of two years from the date of the said notification or within such further period not exceeding one year in the aggregate as <ORG> may specify in this behalf by notification in the official <ORG> give notice of its intention to acquire the whole or any part of the land or of any rights in or over such land as the case may be of and what we have said with regard to that sub section would equally apply here Sub section of provides for a period of two years within which a notice of acquisition could be given by <ORG> Reliance was placed on the explanation to sub a Adverting to of the Act which deals with compensation for prospecting licences ceasing to have effect and rights under mining leases being acquired it was contended that as there is no provision for compensation in respect of the minerals lying underground <ORG> could not be deemed to have enacted this law for the purpose of acquiring mines which have been worked in the past It is however difficult to see how the owner or the lessee of land who has right to win minerals can effect such a severance between the mineral rights and surface rights by opening and operating the mines of that land We cannot therefore accept the contention that there was any severance of the mineral rights and surface rights in either of these two cases We may however point out that the Act does not make provision for compensation for minerals in respect of even virgin land and the argument of Mr <NAME> would equally apply to such land To sum up in our view the preamble of this Act need not be resolved to for construing its provisions and in particular for understanding the meaning of the word land used in the Act that even if the preamble is taken into consideration the expression unworked land occurring in the preamble should be given its ordinary meaning that is to say land which was not being worked at the time of the notification issued under the Act which would include dormant mines that the provisions of the Act and in particular those of sub of and clearly militate against the contention that the Act was intended to apply only to virgin lands to the exclusion of land on which there are dormant mines and that the absence of a provision in of the Act providing for compensation for mineral rights cannot by itself justify the conclusion that the Act was intended to apply to virgin land only Mr <NAME> concedes that reasonable restrictions can be placed by the <ORG> upon the rights enumerated in this article in the interests of the general public but he contends that the period of two to three years is too long and therefore the restrictions cannot be regarded as reasonable Of course there are no pleadings to that effect in the affidavit of the <ORG> The next attack and that is a more formidable one is based upon the ground that the Act does not contain any provision for compensation for the deprivation of the petitioners right to carry on its business for two to three years and that consequently one of its fundamental rights is infringed It is no doubt true that in a which deals with the question of compensation there is no provision for payment of compensation for the deprivation of the right of a mine owner or a lessee to carry on his business for a period of two or three years but the petitioner cannot complain about it no law providing for the extinguishment or modification of any rights accruing by virtue of any agreement lease or licence for the purpose of searching for or winning any mineral or mineral oil or the premature termination or cancellation of any such agreement lease or licence shall be deemed to be void on the ground that it is inconsistent with or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by Art It was pointed out in that case that those observations of <NAME> as he then was must be read as limited to an Act which only brings about a suspension of the right of management of an estate and could not be extended to the provisions of an Act which either extinguishes or modifies certain rights of a proprietor in an estate or a portion thereof We see no ground whatsoever for holding that for a We cannot accept this contention If therefore those provisions of the law which deal with the question of acquisition are unconstitutional the whole Act will be rendered unconstitutional Article of the Constitution as amended by the Fourth Amendment Act runs thus No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which and the manner in which the compensation is to be determined and given and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate We cannot accept this contention Where the validity of a law made by a competent legislature is challenged in a Court of law that Court is bound to presume in favour of its validity There is no doubt that the entire Act cannot be sustained by resorting only to Art The opening words of sub of read thus Where the rights under a mining lease are acquired under this Act there shall be paid to the person interested compensation the amount of which shall be a sum made up of the following items namely Then follow the items which have to be added up Undoubtedly they are items of expenditure and interest on such expenditure Sub section deals with the procedure to be adopted where the rights acquired under relate only to part of the land covered by the mining lease The contention that the provisions made by <ORG> for computing the amount of compensation for the land do not take into account the value of the minerals is in effect a challenge to the adequacy of the compensation payable under the Act We have already dealt with the contention of Mr <NAME> that the minerals underlying the surface are a separate tenement and we need not repeat here all that we have said before In our opinion the minerals cannot be regarded as a separate tenement except perhaps in a case of a trespass and therefore there is no question of the law providing for a separate compensation for them In the circumstances the challenge to the validity of the Act on the ground that it offends Art of the Constitution fails and we dismiss the petition with costs Even so we do not think that any different considerations could apply to the petitioner case from those which apply to the case of <ORG> The petitioner colliery was also dormant for too long a period and was thus an unworked mine
