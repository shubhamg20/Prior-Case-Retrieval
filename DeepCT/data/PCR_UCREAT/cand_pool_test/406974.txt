DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> SUBBARAO DAYAL RAGHUBAR AYYANGAR RAJAGOPALA MUDHOLKAR CITATION AIR SCR CITATOR INFO SC SC SC SC ACT Police Service Officer officiating in the senior time scale served with charge sheet Before enquiry reverted to substantive post Whether entitled as of right to promotion to senior scale Whether order of reversion amounts to reduction in rank Constitution of India Art In July he was served with a charge sheet and was called upon to submit his defence and he submitted his reply Before the enquiry started he was reverted to his substantive rank of Asstt Other officers junior to the appellant continued to officiate in the senior scale while he was reverted The file also revealed a note made by the Senior Superintendent of Police on to the effect that as the regular enquiry into the conduct of the appellant would take a long time it was advisable to revert him The appellant filed before <ORG> of Punjab a petition under Art of the Constitution and that inasmuch as he was not given an opportunity of showing cause against the said order there was a violation of Art The respondent denied that the appellant had any right to be appointed to a vacancy to a senior scale as claimed by him since such appointment was not automatic and it involved a process of selection A consideration of the various rules would make it clear beyond doubt that a person in the junior time scale of the service is as much a cadre officer as one holding a post in the senior time scale or a post above the time scale The whole scheme of the rules indicates that a person in the junior scale of pay has a right to hold a post on the senior scale of pay subject to the availability of a post in the senior scale of pay and his seniority in the junior scale of pay If a person holding a post in the senior scale though in an officiating capacity is found to be unfit to hold that post action will have to be taken against him as required by of Discipline and Appeal Rules because his reversion to a post in the lower scale would amount to a reduction in rank within the meaning of Art The Indian Police Service Pay Rules which provides for two independent scales spread over a period of years seem to indicate that an officer in the junior scale cannot claim such automatic promotion The expression on appointment to a post on the senior time scale occurring in and the provision in which states that any member of the service appointed to hold a post specified in Schedule shall be entitled as long as he holds that post to draw the pay indicated for that post also support this conclusion All the relevant factors should be taken into consideration and if on such a consideration the conclusion is that the reduction is by way of punishment involving penal consequences to the officer even though the Government has a right to pass the order of reduction the provisions of Art will be attracted and the officer must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the proposed action On an examination of the facts and circumstances of the case it is found that the appellant was reverted by way of punishment but he was given no opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him The appellant appeared in person The initial pay of a direct recruit is fixed at the minimum of the junior time scale The pay of a member of the Service in the junior time scale shall on appointment to a post on the senior time scale be fixed at the corresponding stage in the senior time scale as shown in Schedule of the Indian India Police Service Pay Rules see of the said rules However before the enquiry started the appellant was reverted to his substantive rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police by an order dated November The post of Assistant Superintendent of Police is a post in the junior scale and the order dated November stated that the appellant was reverted to his substantive rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police from the <late he was relieved and on reversion the appellant was posted as Assistant Superintendent of Police at Amritsar We shall presently state the grounds on which the appellant attacks the order of reversion but before we do so we may complete the statement of facts The appellant challenged the order of reversion by means of a Writ Petition filed in <ORG> This Writ Petition was however dismissed as premature on the ground that the appellant had filed an appeal permissible under the rules to the Government of India against the order of reversion and the appeal had not then been disposed of The appellant then moved this court for special leave and having obtained such leave has brought the present appeal to this court from the order of the We proceed now to state the main grounds on which the appellant has attacked the order of reversion dated November of the Constitution for it operated as a forfeiture of his right and inasmuch as the appellant was given no opportunity of showing cause against the said order of reversion there was a violation of the provisions of Art his substantive rank the order of reversion really amounted to a reduction in rank by way of punishment irrespective of whether the appellant had a right to be appointed to a vacancy in the senior scale On behalf of the respondents the main contention has been that under the relevant rules the appellant had no absolute right to be appointed to a vacancy in the senior scale as and when such vacancy occurred therein and nobody senior to the appellant was available for it The stand taken on behalf of the respondents is that under of the Indian Police Service Pay Rules appointment to a post on the senior time scale is not automatic because such appointment involves a process of selection therefore there was no forfeiture of any right of the appellant by the order of reversion made against him and the provisions of Art The respondents relied on Explanation to of the All India Services Discipline and Appeal Rules which says that the reversion to a lower post of a member of the service who is officiating in a higher post after a trial in the higher post or for administrative reasons such as the return of the permanent incumbent from leave or deputation availability of a more suitable officer and the like does not amount to reduction in rank within the meaning of which deals with penalties that may for good and sufficient reasons be im posed on a member of the service The respondents have also denied that the order of reversion made against the appellant was malafide or improper or that it violated the fundamental rights guaranteed under Arts The first finding of <ORG> was that the appellant did not hold the officiating post of a Superintendent of Police as a matter of right and his case was covered by Explanation referred to above therefore the order of reversion did not amount to reduction in rank within the meaning of Art Secondly <ORG> found that the reversion of the appellant to his substantive rank of Assistant Superintendent of Police was not by way of punishment and the reasons which led to the framing of a charge sheet against the appellant were not the reasons which prompted the order of reversion We proceed now to consider the first point urged on behalf of the appellant namely whether he had a right to a vacancy in the senior scale as and when such a vacancy occurred except a vacancy in the promotion quota It is perhaps necessary to explain here what the promotion quota means Rule of the Indian Police Service Recruitment Rules says inter alia that the number of persons recruited by promotion from amongst the members of <ORG> usually Deputy Superintendents of Police shall not exceed per cent of the number of senior duty posts borne on the cadre of that State The selection for inclusion in such a list is based on merit and suitability in all respects with due regard to seniority It is conceded on behalf of the appellant that a vacancy in the promotion quota is not filled automatically and that the regulations laid down in the Indian Police Service Appointment by Promotion Regulations clearly indicate that there is a process of selection in the matter of filling up the promotion quota The strength and composition of each of the Cadres constituted under shall be determined by regulations made by <ORG> We have already stated that so far as Punjab is concerned there are senior posts out of which have to be filled by promotion and by direct recruitment Under of the Indian Police Service Cadre Rules save as otherwise provided in the rules every cadre post shall be filled by a cadre officer That relates to the temporary appointment of a non cadre officer to a cadre post and the rule lays down inter alia that a cadre post may be filled by a person who is not a cadre officer if <ORG> is satisfied that there is no suitable cadre officer available for filling the vacancy We do not think that rule shows that an officer in the junior scale has the right to go automatically into the senior scale These two independent scales spread over a period of years seems to indicate that an officer in the junior scale cannot claim the right of automatically passing into the senior scale without any selection by <ORG> though normally we apprehend that an officer in the junior scale may expect to go into the senior scale if nothing is found against him It may be here stated that there is an efficiency bar in the junior scale at the stage when the salary of the officer reaches Rs If every officer in the junior scale has the right to pass automati cally into the senior scale then it is difficult to understand the meaning of this efficiency bar at the eleventh year of service Rule of the aforesaid rules lays down that the initial pay of a direct recruit shall be fixed at the minimum of the junior time scale The pay of a member of the Service in the junior time scale shall on appointment to a post on the senior time scale be fixed at the corresponding stage in the senior time scale as shown in Schedule I The learned Additional Solicitor General who has argued the case on behalf of the respondents has rightly drawn our attention to the words on appointment to a post on the senior time scale occurring in His argument is that those words indicate that the competent authority must appoint a member of <ORG> to a post on the senior time scale before he can claim the pay fixed for the senior time scale as shown in Schedule I in other words the argument is that the words appointment to a post on the senior time scale show by necessary implication that the appointing authority has the right either to appoint or not to appoint a member of <ORG> to a post on the senior time scale and there is no automatic advance from the junior to the senior scale That rule says that any member of the <ORG> appointed to hold a post specified in Schedule shall for so long as he holds that post be entitled to draw the pay indicated for that post in the said Schedule The appellant concedes that to these posts there is no automatic right to promotion The argument of the appellant when properly analysed is that with regard to category posts there is an automatic right but not so to category A and category posts The rule makes no difference in the matter of the three categories of posts specified in Schedule III on the contrary the rule in express terms says that any member of the <ORG> appointed to hold a post specified in Schedule III shall for so long as he holds that post be entitled to draw the pay indicated for that post in the said Schedule The expression for so long as he holds that post is important and shows clearly enough that the appointing authority has a right to appoint or not to appoint a member of the <ORG> to a post in Schedule III There is another aspect of the question In exercise of the powers conferred by sub section of of the All India <ORG>s Act <ORG> has made rules known as the All India <ORG>s Discipline and Appeal Rules Rule lays down the procedure to be followed for imposing those penalties and states that no order shall be passed imposing any of the penalties specified in on a member of the <ORG> unless he has been informed in writing of the grounds on which it is proposed to take action and has been afforded an adequate opportunity of defending himself In the Central Civil <ORG>s Classification Control and Appeal Rules a distinction is drawn between penalties which are minor in nature such as censure withholding of increments or promotion and recovery from the pay of an officer any pecuniary loss caused to Government by his negligence and other punishments of a major character such as reduction in rank compulsory retirement removal or dismissal from service Under of the said rules there are seven kinds of penalties one of which is reduction in rank in cluding reduction to a lower post or time scale or to a lower stage in a time scale This Explanation reads thus The reversion to a lower post of a member of the Service who is officiating in a higher post after a trial in the higher post or for administrative reasons such as the return of the permanent incumbent from leave or deputation availability of a more suitable officer and the like does not amount to reduction in rank within the meaning of this rule At the present moment we are considering the question from the point of view as to whether there has been any forfeiture of his right to go automatically into the senior scale The existence of such a rule negatives the claim of the appellant that he has the right to officiate in a post on the senior scale and any reversion from that officiating post amounts to reduction in rank within the meaning of Art There is a third aspect of the question The first proviso to the rule states that a member of the Ser vice holding a post in the senior time scale may be appoint ed to a post in the selection grade and where he is so appointed he shall be entitled to draw pay of the post in the selection grade If the words appointed to a post are to be interpreted in the same way then there is no escape from the position that there is no automatic right of appointment to a post on the senior time scale We have therefore come to the conclusion that the first contention urged on behalf of the appellant that he has a right to go automatically into the senior scale is not correct and cannot be upheld We turn now to the alternative argument of the appellant that in any view of the matter his reversion involved penal consequences to him within the meaning of the rule laid down in <NAME> case If the <ORG> servant has a right to a particular rank then the very reduction from that rank will operate as a penalty for he will then lose the emoluments and privileges of that rank If however he has no right to the particular rank his reduction from an officiating higher rank to his substantive lower rank will not ordinarily be a punishment But the mere fact that the servant has no title to the post or the rank and the <ORG> has by contract express or implied or under the rules the right to reduce him to a lower post does not mean that an order of reduction of a servant to a lower post or rank cannot in any circumstances be a punishment The real test for determining whether the reduction in such cases is or is not by way of punishment is to find out if the order for the reduction also visits the servant with any penal consequences tails or provides for the forfeiture of his pay or allowances or the loss of his seniority in his substantive rank or the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion then that circumstance may indicate that although in form the <ORG> had purported to exercise its right to terminate the employment or to reduce the servant to a lower rank under the terms of the contract of employment or under the rules in truth and reality the <ORG> has terminated the employment as and by way of penalty The use of the expression terminate or discharge is not conclusive In spite of the use of such innocuous expression the court has to apply the two tests mentioned above namely whether the servant has a right to the post or the rank or whether he has been visited with evil consequences of the kind hereinbefore referred to If the case satisfies either of the two tests then it must be held that the servant has been punished and the termination of his service must be taken as a dismissal or removal from service or the reversion to his substantive rank must be regarded as a reduction in rank and if the requirements of the rules and Art which give protection to <ORG> servant have not been complied with the termination of the service or the reduction in rank must be held to be wrongful and in violation of the constitutional right of the servant The appellant has contended that his case comes under the second test laid down in <NAME> case namely that he has been visited with penal consequences like loss of pay loss of seniority and the stoppage or postponement of his future chances of promotion It is also admitted that officers junior to the appellant continued to officiate in the senior scale while the appellant was reverted In its written statement the respondent <ORG> took the stand that the appellant was tried as Superintendent of Police and on trial he was found to be immature It appears from the judgment of <ORG> that the personal file of the appellant was produced before the learned Below that there is a note of some other officer which begins with the following Can we revert him and then proceed with further enquiries on the charge of not carrying out the orders of his senior officers Then it is stated that Mr <NAME> is not yet ripe and fit for the duties of a Superintendent of Police and then the note says We may therefore get <ORG> approval to his reversion on account of his unsatisfactory record It should be made clear however that when a person is reverted to his substantive rank the question of penal consequences in the matter of forfeiture of pay or loss of seniority must be considered in the context of In the case before us the appellant has not merely suffered a loss of pay which was inevitable on reduction in rank but he has also suffered loss of seniority as also postponement of future chances of promotion to the senior scale It is indeed true as was pointed out in <NAME> case that the motive operating on the mind of the <ORG> may be irrelevant but it must also be remembered that in a case where <ORG> has by contract or under the rules the right to reduce an officer in rank <ORG> may nevertheless choose to punish the officer by such reduction ted and the officer must be given a reasonable opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him Our conclusion is that in the present case the appellant was reverted by way of punishment but he was given no opportunity of showing cause against the action proposed to be taken against him We would accordingly allow this appeal and quash the order of reversion passed against the appellant on November The appellant will be entitled to his costs of this court and <ORG> On July a charge sheet was served upon the appellant to which he submitted a reply The determination of this question would depend upon the answer to be found to another question and that is whether the appellant by virtue of his appointment to <ORG> had a right to be promoted to and to hold the post of Superintendent of Police if at the time his turn came to officiate in that rank there was a vacancy and he was not barred from stepping in because of any punishment awarded to him as a result of an enquiry made under the Discipline and Appeal Rules Rule provides that the service shall consist of three classes of persons a members of <ORG> members recruited to the service before the commencement of the rules and persons recruited to the Service in accordance with the provisions of the Rules Rule provides that all appointments to the Service shall be made by <ORG> and no such appointment shall be made except after recruitment by one of the methods specified in Rule provides for recruitment by promotion Sub rule of that rule provides that the number of posts available for being filled by recruitment or promotion would not exceed at any time of the number of senior duty posts borne on the cadre of a <ORG> It is sufficient to say that these rules provide for the preparation of select lists in each <ORG> in which persons belonging to state service were selected by a committee and placed in their order of merit and appointments to cadre posts i posts in <ORG> were to be made in accordance with these Lists Rule provides Save as otherwise provided in these rules every cadre post shall be filled by a cadre officer which means by an officer of <ORG> The only other rules which have any bearing on this point in the Cadre rules are rules and In addition to these rules <ORG> framed Po lice Service Pay Rules in exercise of the powers conferred by sub section of of the <ORG>s Act The rules prescribe two scales of pay junior scale and the senior scale in addition to the selection grade It also contains some other provisions which are not relevant for the present discussion Sub rule of provides that the initial pay of a direct recruit shall be fixed at the minimum of the junior time scale Sub rule of that rule provides that the pay of a member of the service in the junior time scale shall on appointment to a post on the senior time scale be fixed at the corresponding stage in the senior time scale as shown in Schedule I of the rules The heading of is Pay of officers holding posts enumerated in Schedule III of the Schedule it is made clear that officers have to be appointed to the posts therein in the same manner as to posts in Sections A and No doubt a formal order of appointment to all posts has to be made whether an element of selection is involved therein or not A consideration of the various rules would therefore make it clear beyond doubt that a person in the Junior time scale of the Service is as much a cadre officer as one holding a post in the senior time scale or a post above the time scale such as those in Category a of Schedule III Rule provides that every officer directly recruited to <ORG> shall be assigned a year of allotment according to the provisions contained in that rule Rule provides that there shall be prepared every year for each <ORG> cadre a gradation list of names of all officers borne on that cadre arranged in the order of seniority in accordance with the provisions of rules A and of the members of <ORG> there is not a single rule which specifically deals with the appointment of an Assistant Superintendent of Police to the post of Superintendent of Police In other words there is no specific rule which prescribes the condition for transfer or promotion of a person holding a post carrying a pay in the junior scale to a post carrying salary in the senior pay scale Nor again is there any rule which specifically provides that in so far as a member of <ORG> is concerned he has to be freshly appointed to a post carrying a salary in the senior scale of pay It seems clear beyond doubt that in so far as <ORG> is concerned there is only one cadre Appointments to posts borne on that cadre are to be made by direct recruitment except to the extent of of the senior posts which may be filled by promotion from <ORG> leaving aside for the moment appointments made by special recruitment or emergency recruitment His contention is that an Assistant Superintendent of Police has no right to hold a post carrying a pay in the senior scale even though according to his seniority in the gradation list he may be eligible for such a post But it would not be right to conclude from this circumstance that is all that is guaranteed to him We must take into account all the relevant rules bearing on the matter There are also good reasons for providing a complete time scale for the junior posts Indeed the proviso to clearly states that even where the increment of a member has been withheld but he is appointed to a post in the senior scale his pay in that scale will not be affected but would be regulated according to his length of service But the result of this is different from that of not allowing a person to hold a post in the senior time scale in his turn according to his seniority As already indicated very elaborate rules have been framed for the purpose of determining the inter se seniority of the officers borne on the cadre of <ORG> We have already indicated that in so far as promotion of officers to the State Police Service is concerned elaborate provisions have been made in the rules which among other things provide for the appointment of a selection committee and preparation of select lists Had it been the intention of die Government to bring in the element of selection in so far as promotion of Assistant Superintendents of Police to the posts of Superintendents of Police is concerned we have no doubt that express provisions relating to the manner in which the selection has to be made would have found place in the rules The appellant who argued his case in person asked us to compare the position of persons belonging to other <ORG> and said that in so far as they were concerned the rules provide for a selection at every stage and in this connection he drew our attention to explanation iii to of the Central Civil Services Classification Control and Appeal Rules which reads thus The following shall not amount to a penalty within the meaning of this rule iii non promotion whether in a substantive or officiating capacity of a Government servant after consideration of his case to a Service grade or post for promotion to which he is eligible and sought to support the argument by reference to this explanation The explanation reads thus The reversion to a lower post of a member of the Service who is officiating in a higher post after a trial in the higher post or for administrative reasons such as the return of the permanent incumbent from leave or deputation availability of a more suitable officer and the like does not amount to reduction in rank within the meaning of this rule The question however is whether it applies to a case like the present This may be a condition of ser vice but if it means that a person who has a right to hold a post in the senior scale would be liable to be demoted if an officer junior to him but more suitable is available it would run contrary to the provisions of Art In our opinion the whole scheme of the rules indicates that a person borne on the junior scale of pay has a right to hold a post on the senior scale of pay depending upon the availability of a post and his seniority in the Junior scale of pay If a person holding a post in the senior scale though in an officiating capacity is found to be unfit to hold that post action will have to be taken against him as required by of Discipline and Appeal Rules because his reversion to a post in the lower scale would amount to reduction in rank within the meaning of Art Despite the fact that he holds a certain rank in the gradation list persons who also belong to <ORG> and who were recruited to it subsequent to him have continued to hold or have been appointed to hold posts car rying salary in the senior scale This would itself indicate that the action taken against him was by way of penalty or punishment For he has not only been reduced in rank but his promotion to the senior scale has also been withheld This could only be done by holding a departmental enquiry and affording him an opportunity to show cause against the action proposed to be taken against him The learned Additional Solicitor General very fairly placed before us the file concerning the reversion of the appellant which we find from the judgment of <ORG> was also placed before it Below that there is a note of some other officer which begins with the following query Can we revert him and then proceed with further enquiries on the charge of not carrying out the orders of his senior officers Then it is stated that Mr <NAME> is not yet ripe and fit for the duties of a Superintendent of Police and then the note says We may therefore get <ORG> approval to his reversion on account of his unsatisfactory record Thereafter there is a long note of the Inspector General in which reference is made to Explanation to of the Discipline and Appeal Rules and it is said that in view of this provision no show cause notice need be issued to the appellant If that is the correct state of affairs one would have expected that the appellant had he been suspended would have been restored to his former post in the light of the actual action taken against him on the basis of the findings of the Enquiry Officer In the circumstances we have no doubt in coming to the conclusion that the order of the Government is mala fide On both these grounds therefore we allow the appeal as well as the writ petition and quash the order dated November reverting him to the post of Assistant Superintendent of Police from the post of Superintendent of Police
