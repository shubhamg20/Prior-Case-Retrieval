Vs RESPONDENT <NAME> <NAME> DATE OF JUDGMENT BENCH <NAME> BENCH <NAME> DESAI A KOSHAL A CITATION AIR SCR SCC CITATOR INFO SC SC ACT Industrial Disputes Act Section A Scope of Whether the arbitrator could exercise the power conferred on a <ORG> under section A of the Act and interfere with the punishment awarded by the management to the workmen It started its business in went into production since and waggled from infancy to adulthood with smiling profits and growling workers punctuated by smouldering demands strikes and settlement until there brewed a confrontation culminating in a head on collision following upon certain unhappy happenings Any dispute arising between the parties according to the terms arrived at were to be sorted out through negotiation or failing that by recourse to arbitration The matter was therefore referred to an arbitrator and the arbitrator by his award held the action cf the management warranted A iii The action taken under the general law or the standing orders was illegal in the absence of individualised charge sheets proper hearing and personalise punishment if found guilty But the management could as in this case it did offer to make out the delinquency of the employees and the arbitrator had in such cases the full jurisdiction to adjudge de novo both guilt and punishment The anatomy of a dismissal order is not a mystery once it is agreed that substance not semblance governs the decision Masters and servants cannot be permitted to play hide and seek with the law of dismissals and the plain and proper criteria are not to be misdirected by terminological cover ups or by appeal to psychic processes but must be grounded on the substantive reason for the order whether disclosed or undisclosed A termination effected because the master is satisfied of the misconduct and of the consequent desirability of terminating the service of the delinquent servant it is a dismissal even if he had the right in law to terminate with an innocent order under the standing order or otherwise Given an alleged misconduct and a live nexus between it and the termination of service the conclusion is dismissal even if full benefits as on simple termination are given and non injurious terminology is used A The principle of law is that the jurisdiction of <ORG> under Article of the Constitution is limited to holding the judicial or quasi judicial powers within the leading sings of legality and to see that they do not exceed their statutory jurisdiction and correctly administer the law laid down by the statute under the Act An Arbitrator has all the powers under the terms of reference to which both sides are party confer In action taken under no element of punishment is involved and the discharge is a discharge simpliciter and that is why no opportunity to the concerned employee to show cause against the termination is provided for This clearly means that when the employer is satisfied that a workman has been guilty of misconduct he may apart from visiting the workman with any of the punishments specified in sub clauses a and of clause of either pass against him an order of discharge for which no inquiry precedent as provided for in clauses and of would be necessary or may dismiss him after holding such an inquiry which of the two kinds of order the employer shall pass is left entirely to his discretion specifically gives to the employer the power to get rid of a workman guilty of misconduct by passing an order of his discharge under Merely because it is the reason which weighed with the employer in effective the termination of services would not male the order of such termination as one founded on misconduct for such a proposition would run counter to the plain meaning of clause of For an order to be founded an misconduct it must be intended to have been passed by way of punishment that is it must be intended to chastise or cause pain in body or mind or harm or loss in reputation or money to the concerned worker The real criterion which formed the touchstone of a test to determine whether an order of termination of services is an order of discharge simpliciter or amounts to dismissal is the real nature of the order that is the intention with which it was passed The arbitrator could not exercise tho power conferred on a <ORG> under section A of the Act and could not therefore interfere with the punishment awarded by the Management to the workmen even if the discharge could be regarded a punishment This cataclysmic episode and its sequel formed the basis of a Section A arbitration and award a writ petition and judgment inevitably spiralling up to this <ORG> in two appeals one by the <ORG> and the other by the <ORG> which have been heard together and are being disposed of by this common judgment The highlight of the dispute referred for arbitration was whether the termination orders issued by the <ORG> against the workmen whose names were set out in the annexure to the reference were legal proper and justified if not whether the workmen were entitled to any reliefs including the relief of reinstatement with continuity of service and full back wages must fabricate a new shorthand form of court methodology which will do justice to the pockets of the poor who seek right and justice and to the limited judicial hours humanly available to the court if the delivery system of justice is not to suffer obsolescence The engineering industry where India is forging ahead was apparently exploitative towards labour and to make amends for this un healthy position <ORG> was appointed in although it took six long years to recommend revision of wages to be implemented with effect from The <ORG> however had turned down this suggestion and it came to the notice of the <ORG> that workmen were being instigated by making false representations In this connection the attention of the workmen was drawn to the fact that the strike was illegal not only because of the terms of the settlement dated August but also because of the pendency of the reference relating to reinstatement of workmen before <ORG> and that therefore the <ORG> was entitled to take disciplinary action against them This public notice was allegedly sent to the <ORG> and circulated to such workmen as hovered around the factory Under the circumstances it is decided that the services of all the workmen who are on illegal and unjustified strike should be terminated by way of discharge simpliciter have been considered and therefore the same are treated as part of the relevant evidence to come to the conclusion as aforesaid FINAL CONCLUSION The services of all the workmen who are on illegal and unjustified strike since should be terminated by way of discharge simpliciter and they should be offered all their legal dues immediately With all the strikers struck off the rolls there was for a time the silence of the grave Meanwhile there were exchanges of letters between and trading of charges against each other You may therefore send to us immediately per return of post the list of the workers who can and are willing to join duty immediately so as to enable us to select and employ the workmen as per the requirement of the <ORG> Clause permits the services or non permanent workmen to be terminated without notice except when such temporary workmen are discharged by way of punishment Punitive discharge is prohibited unless opportunity to show cause against charges of misconduct is afforded Standing order The anatomy of a dismissal order is not a mystery once we agree that substance not semblance governs the decision The court will lift the veil to see the true nature of the order In <NAME> case the unsatisfactory state of the law was commented upon by one of us per <NAME> quoting Dr <NAME> for support In some cases the rule of guidance has been stated to be the substance of the matter and the foundation of the order When does motive trespass into foundation When do we lift the veil of form to touch the substance When the <ORG> says so These Freudian frontiers obviously fail in the work a day world and Dr <NAME> observations in this context are not without force the law of dismissals and the plain and proper criteria are not to be misdirected by terminological cover ups or by appeal to psychic processes but must be grounded on the substantive reason for the order whether disclosed or undisclosed To put it slightly differently a termination effected because the master is satisfied of the misconduct and of the consequent desirability of terminating the service of the delinquent servant it is a dismissal even if he had the right in law to terminate with an innocent order under the standing order or otherwise even if full benefits as on simple termination are given and non injurious terminology is used In Murugan Mills this <ORG> observed The right of the employer to terminate the services of his workman under a standing order like cl a in the present case which accounts to a claim to hire and fire an employee as the employer pleases and thus completely negatives security of service which has been secured to industrial employees through industrial adjudication Wherein the view taken by <ORG> was approved and it was held that even in a case like the present the requirements of bona fides was essential and if the termination of service was a colourable exercise of the power or as a result of victimization or unfair labour practice the industrial tribunal would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination The form of the order in such a case is not conclusive and the <ORG> can go behind the order to find the reasons which led to the order and then consider for itself whether the termination was a colourable exercise of the power or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice If it came to the conclusion that the termination was a colourable exercise of the power or was a result of victimisation or unfair labour practice it would have the jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination It is therefore always open to the <ORG> to go behind the form and look at the substance and if it comes to the conclusion for example that though in form the order amounts to termination simpliciter it in reality cloaks a dismissal for misconduct it will be open to it to set it aside as a colourable exercise of the <ORG> Even an innocuously worded order terminating the service may in the facts and circumstances of the case establish that an enquiry into allegations of serious and grave character of misconduct involving stigma has been made in infraction of the provision of Article That is exactly what has happened in the case of <NAME> But the <ORG> admits that as required by the <ORG> orders it has recorded reasons for the discharge Then what was it If there was work to be done why terminate services of workmen except as punishment Because argued <NAME> the workers did not work being on strike and the <ORG> bent on keeping the factory going needed workmen who work Maybe the management had no other way of working the factory but that did not change the character of the action taken Courts have to interpose in order to ascertain whether the discharge is one simpliciter or a punitive discharge and in doing so the veil of language is lifted and the realities perceived If standing orders or the terms of contract permit the employer to terminate the services of his employee by discharge simpliciter without assigning reasons it would be open to him to take recourse to the said term or condition and terminate the services of his employee but when the validity of such termination is challenged in industrial adjudication it would be competent to the industrial Tribunal to ensure whether the impugned discharge has been effected in the bona fide exercise of the power conferred by the terms of employment If the discharge has been ordered by the employer in bona fide exercise of his power then the industrial tribunal may not interfere with it but the words used in the order of discharge and the form which it may have taken are not conclusive in the matter an the industrial tribunal would be entitled to go behind the words and form and decide whether the discharge is a discharge simpliciter or not If it appears that the purported exercise of power to terminate the Services of the employee was in fact the result of the misconduct alleged against him The form used for terminating the service is not conclusive and the tribunal has jurisdiction to enquire into the reasons which led to such termination In the facts of the case it was found that Standing orders provided that an employee could ask for reasons for discharge in the case of discharge simpliciter to pass an order under cl a of the Standing orders permitting discharge simpliciter in such circumstances was clearly a colorable exercise of power to terminate services of a workman under the provision of the Standing orders The slightly different observation in <ORG> office <NAME> Management was explained by the Court and it was further affirmed that since the decision of this Court in the <<ORG>> Union it has taken the consistent view that if the termination of service is a colourable exercise of power vested in the management or is a result of victimization or unfair labour practice the court tribunal would have jurisdiction to intervene and set aside such termination It was urged that a different view was taken by this Court in <<ORG>> employee in that was discharged from service by paying one month wages in lieu of notice This action was challenged by the employee before <ORG> and it was contended that it was a punitive discharged The <ORG> contended that wider Standing order No the <ORG> had the power to discharge but there was an obligation to give reasons if so demanded by the employee The <ORG> had also the power to discharge by way of punishment The Court in this connection observed as under Now one thing must be borne in mind that these are two distinct and independent powers and as far as possible either should be construed so as to emasculate the other cr to render it ineffective One is the power to punish an employee for misconduct while the other is the power to terminate simpliciter the service of an employee without any other adverse consequence proviso i to clause of Standing order requires that the reason for termination of the employment should be given in writing to the employee when exercising the power of termination of service of the employee under Standing order It does not purport to run counter to the established ratio that the form of the order is not decisive and the <ORG> can lift the veil How ever it may be noted that there was an alternative contention before the <ORG> that even if the order of discharge was considered punitive in character the employer corporation had led evidence before the labour court to substantiate the charge of misconduct and that finding was also affirmed The law is trite that the Management may still ask for an opportunity to make out a case for dismissal before the <ORG> Suppose there is case of arson and murder in a village because of communal faction and a hundred men from the aggressive community are charged in court with serious offences There are only a few confusions in his long award but regrettably they happen to be on a few fundamentals We will deal later with the point that the arbitrator had himself no power under Section A of the Act but did have it in view of the wide terms of reference So broad are the expressive expressions designedly used in Article that any order which should have been made by the lower authority could be made by <ORG> The first limb of the argument is that when there is a voluntary joint submission of an industrial dispute to an Arbitrator named by them under A of the Industrial Disputes Act he does not function as a <ORG> and is not amenable to the jurisdiction of that Court under Article or under Article This Court observed that as the Arbitrator under A has the power to bind even those who are not parties to the reference or agreement and the whole exercise under A as well as the source of the force of the Award on publication derived from the statute it is legitimate to regard such an arbitrator now as part of the infrastructure of the sovereigns dispensation of justice thus falling within the rainbow of statutory tribunals amenable to judicial review Broadly stated the principle of law is that the jurisdiction of <ORG> under Article of the Constitution is limited to holding the judicial or quasi judicial tribunals or administrative bodies exercising the quasi judicial powers within the leading strings of legality and to see that they do not exceed their statutory jurisdiction and correctly administer the law laid down by the statute under which they act It was further pointed out that in the finding of fact is made by the impugned order and it is shown that it success from an error of law and not of fact a writ under Article would issue and while so saying the decision in <NAME> case was affirmed A which confers wide original power to the tribunal to re fix the sentence <NAME> argued that an arbitrator was uncovered by this new Section Where an industrial dispute relating to the discharge or dismissal of a workmen has been referred to <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> for adjudication and in the course of the adjudication proceedings <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> as the case may be is satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified it may as it thinks fit or give such other relief to the Workman on such terms and conditions if any as it thinks fit or give such other relief to the workman including the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of discharge or dismissal as the circumstances of the case may require Provided that in any proceeding under this section <ORG> or <ORG> as the case may be shall rely on the materials on record and shall not take any fresh evidence in relation to the matter Was this of deliberate legislative design to deprive arbitrators who discharge identical functions as tribunals under the Industrial Disputes Act of some vital powers which vested in their tribunal brethren For what mystic purpose could such distinction be Functionally tribunals and arbitrators being to the same brood So we see no ground to truncate the natural meaning of Tribunal on the supposed intent of <ORG> to omit irrationally the category of adjudicatory organs known as arbitrators to the court to give the natural meaning to a word defined in the Act if the context in which it appears suggests a departure from the definition because then there is something repugnant in the subject or context The word is ambiguous because it has not like court any ascertainable meaning in English law Royal Acsuarium <NAME> There is a reference to the bishop commission of enquiry as judicial tribunal and significantly specific mention has been made in these terms Stroud Judicial Dictionary We have hardly any doubt that tribunal simpliciter has a sweeping signification and does not exclude arbitrator When aid to construction of the meaning of words as used in the statute is available there can certainly be no rule of law which forbids its use how ever clear the words may be on superficial examination He reinvestigated and reassessed the evidence bearing on the guilt of the discharged workmen after giving an opportunity to both sides to adduce evidence thereon Admittedly he had this power The reply to this frozen faith is best borne out by Lord <NAME> blunt words There was never a more sterile controversy than that upon the question whether a judge makes law We are persuaded that there is much to learn from Lord <NAME> consistent refrain about the inevitable creative element in the judicial process in the interpretative area We permit ourselves a quote from Lord <NAME> because <NAME> did draw our attention to straightening the creases as permissible but not stitching the cloth making a critical reference to the controversial activism of which Lord <NAME> was a leading light The truth is that the law is unce<ORG>ain Although there is no question that the <ORG> can and does make law and does so routinely The question of construction of A was argued at length as to whether an omission of any reference to Arbitrator appointed under A in A would suggest that the Arbitrator under A notwithstanding the terms of reference would not enjoy the power conferred on all conceivable industrial adjudicators under A It was said after referring to the objects and reasons in respect of the bill which was moved to enact A in the Industrial Disputes Act that while the I had indicated that an arbitrator selected by the parties for adjudication of industrial dispute must be invested with power by appropriate legislation as found in A the <ORG> while enacting the section in its wisdom did not include the Arbitrator even though other adjudicators of industrial disputes have been conferred such power and therefore it is a case of Sasus omissions Therefore Section A applies to the arbitrator in the present case and he has the power to examine whether the punishment imposed in the instant case is excessive In a limited sense even prior to Section A there was jurisdiction for a labour tribunal including an arbitrator to go into the punitive aspect of the Management order For then there is no extant order of guilt or punishment and the tribunal determines it fresh Lastly as rightly urged by counsel for the <ORG> an arbitrator has all the powers the terms of reference to which both sides are party confer Prefatory to the discussion about the factum of misconduct and its sequel we must remind ourselves that the strike was illegal having been launched when another industrial dispute was pending adjudication There is force in this pragmatic approach There was reference to the <ORG> promise to implement the <ORG> recommendations The long and sterile correspondence was set out and the arbitrator arrived at the conclusion that the insistence on reference to arbitration as against negotiation was justified on the part of the Management I therefore have accepted the version of the Management and disbelieved the motivated denial of the <ORG> in this respect There is also not the least doubt the Management was ready and willing to implement the recommendations of <ORG> it was because it was prevented by The question of bonus for the year was also considered and dismissed and the <ORG> case to that extent was negatived We are constrained to hold that a certain observation made per incuriam by Mr Justice <NAME> strongly relied on by <NAME> does not accurately represent the law although the learned Judge had earlier stated the law and case law correctly if we may say so with respect The benign attitude towards strike being what we have outlined the further question arises whether in the light of the accepted finding that the strike as such was illegal and further was unjustified all the strikers should face the penalty of dismissal or whether individual cases with special reference to active participation in the strike should be considered Even in <ORG> supra where the strike was illegal and affected a public utility service this Court observed that the only question of practical importance which may arise in the case of an illegal strike would be the kind or quantum of punishment and that of course has to be modulated in accordance with the facts and circumstances of each case There may be reasons for distinguishing the case of those who may have acted as mere dumb driven cattle from those who have taken an active part in fomenting the trouble and instigating workmen to join such a strike or have taken recourse to violence After noticing the distinction between peaceful strikers and violent strikers <NAME> <NAME> in that case observed it must be clearly understood by those who take part in an illegal strike that thereby they make themselves liable to be dealt with by their employers There may be reasons for distinguishing the case of those who may have acted as mere dumb driven cattle from those who have taken an active part in fomenting the trouble and instigating workmen to join such a strike or have taken recourse to violence We may as well refer to a few more rulings since considerable argument was expended on this point observed that there is no doubt that if an employer makes an unreasonable discrimination in the matter of taking back employees there may in certain circumstances be reason for the industrial tribunal to interfere but the circumstances of each case have to be examined before the tribunal can interfere with the order of the employer in a properly held managerial inquiry on the ground of discrimination In fact <ORG> case does not lay down any distinct proposition about the treatment to be meted out to participants in strike and actually it is a decision on its own facts It would thus appear that the important effect of omission to hold an enquiry was merely this that the tribunal would have to consider not only whether there was a prima facie case but would decide for itself on the evidence adduced whether the charges have been made out A defective enquiry in this connection stood on the same footing as no enquiry and in either case the tribunal would have jurisdiction to go into the entire matter and the employer would have to satisfy the tribunal that on the facts the order of dismissal or discharge was proper Even though the Standing Orders prescribing enquiry before punishment did not provide for any such enquiry the <ORG> held that nonetheless a domestic enquiry should have been held in order to entitle the management to dispense with the service of the workmen on the ground of misconduct viz After so saying the <ORG> agreed with the view of the <ORG> in <ORG> case and reaffirmed the principle that mere taking part in an illegal strike without anything further would not necessarily justify the dismissal of all the workers taking part in the strike and that if the employer before dismissing a workman gave him sufficient opportunity of explaining his conduct and no question of mala fides or victimisation arose it was not for the tribunal in adjudicating the propriety of such dismissal to look into the sufficiency or otherwise of the evidence led before the enquiry officer or insist on the same degree of proof as was required in a court of law as if it were sitting in appeal over the decision of the employer Many a workman as a matter of prudence may not take the risk of facing the militant workmen or the <ORG> hirelings for fear especially when there is evidence in the case from the <ORG> that the <ORG> had hired goondas and from the <ORG> that the striking vanguard was violent The action taken under the general law or the standing orders was illegal in the absence of individualised chargesheets proper hearing and personalised punishment if found guilty But the <ORG> could as in this case it did offer to make out the delinquency of the employees and the arbitrator had in such cases the full jurisdiction to adjudge de novo both guilt and punishment There is force in <ORG> reasoning to distinguish <ORG> as we hinted earlier and we quote There were only workmen involved in that case Even under such circumstances the management did not straightaway terminate their services but gave individual notices requiring the concerned workmen to show cause why their names should not be struck off and asked them to submit their reply by a certain date It is against this background that <ORG> held that there was a persistent and obdurate refusal by the workmen to joint duty notwithstanding the fact that the management has done everything possible to persuade them and give them opportunities to come back to work and that they had without any sufficient cause refused to do so which constituted misconduct so as to justify the termination of their services There cannot be any relation back of the date of dismissal to when the Management passed the void order We do not agree that the ratio of <ORG> corroborates the proposition propounded If the <ORG> for the first time passes an order recording a finding of misconduct and thus breathes life into the dead shall of the Management order predating of the nativity does not arise The reference to <NAME> in <ORG> enlightens this position The latter case of <ORG> supra specifically refers to <ORG> case and <NAME> case and holds that where the Management discharges a workmen by an order which is void for want of an enquiry or for blatant violation of rules of natural justice the relation back doctrine cannot be invoked The jurisprudential difference between a void order which by a subsequent judicial resuscitation comes into being de novo and an order which may suffer from some defects but is not still born or void and all that is needed in the law to make it good is a subsequent approval by a tribunal which is granted cannot be obfuscated We are disposed to stand by the view that discharge even where it is not occasioned by a surplus of hands will be retrenchment having regard to the breadth of the definition and its annotation in SCR We therefore consider August as a pivotal point in the calender with reference to which the final relief may be moulded We direct this step with a view to pragmatise the situation in working out the equities The case of the hundred stands on a slightly different footing because some compensation in lieu of refusal of reinstatement is due to them and that also has entered our reckoning while fixing per cent for them In the life sense all mortals are casuals but in the legal sense those with a record of days on the rolls are a class who have rights under industrial law With these modifications we dismiss both the appeals <NAME> <NAME> I have had the advantage of going through the judgment of my learned brother <NAME> <NAME> but after giving the same my most serious consideration I regret that I find myself unable to endorse it as I hold a different opinion in relation to three important findings arrived at by him namely a that the discharge of workmen amounted really to their dismissal because the motivation for it was their alleged misconduct that an arbitrator would fall within the ambit of the term Tribunal as used in sub section of section A of the Industrial Disputes Act hereinafter called the Act and that <ORG> acted within the four corners or its jurisdiction under article of the Constitution of India while interfering with the finding of the arbitrator that the workmen were correctly punished with dismissal if the orders of discharge could be construed as such The expression standing orders is defined in section of the Act to mean rules relating to the matters set out in the schedule thereto items and of which run thus The employment of a permanent workman employed on the monthly rates of wages may be terminated by giving him one month notice or on payment of one month wages including all admissible allowances in lieu of notice A The reasons for the termination of service of a permanent workman shall be recorded in writing and communicated to him if he so desires at the time of discharge unless such communication in the opinion of the Manager is likely directly or indirectly to lay any person open to civil or criminal proceedings at the instance of the workman All classes of workmen other than those appointed on a permanent basis may leave their service or their service may be terminated without or pay in lieu of notice Provided that services of a temporary workman shall not be terminated as a punishment unless he has been given an opportunity of explaining the charges of misconduct alleged against him in the manner prescribed in Standing Order He shall be given an opportunity to answer the charge and permitted to be defended by a workman working in the same department as himself Except for reasons to be recorded in writing by the officer holding the inquiry the workman shall be permitted to produce witnesses in his defence and cross examine any witnesses on whose evidence the charge rests Clauses and of speak of an inquiry only in the case of an order falling under sub clause of clause of that It is thus quite clear and this is not disputed that the only sub clause of clause of to which the provisions of clauses and of that would be attracted is sub clause and that if an order of discharge falls under an inquiry under clauses and of would not be a prerequisite thereto even though such an order is mentioned in subclause of clause of that And that is why it has been vehemently urged on behalf of the workmen who were discharged en masse and who were not taken back by the Management that the orders of discharge made in relation to them amount really to orders of dismissal and are bad in law by reason of the fact that no inquiry of the type above mentioned was held before they were passed In action taken under no element of punishment is involved and the discharge is a discharge simpliciter and that is why no opportunity to the concerned employee to show cause against the termination is provided for It was vehemently argued on behalf of the workmen that once it was proved that the order of discharge of a workman was passed by reason of a misconduct attributed to him by the management the order cannot but amount to an order of dismissal This clearly means that when the employer is satisfied that a workman has been guilty of misconduct he may apart from visiting the workman with any of the punishments specified in sub clauses a and of clause of either pass against him an order of discharge for which no inquiry precedent as provided for in clauses and of would be necessary or may dismiss him after holding such an inquiry The argument that once an alleged misconduct is shown to have been the motive for the passage of an order of discharge the same would immediately and without more amount to an order of dismissal is not warranted by the language used in which specifically gives to the employer the power to get rid of a workman guilty of misconduct by passing an order of his discharge under Her services were terminated on the ground that her record of service was unsatisfactory The question arose as to which power had been exercised by the employer in the case of Miss <NAME> and <NAME> delivering the judgment of the <ORG> on behalf of himself and <NAME> was answering that question when he made the observations reproduced from his decision by my learned brother <NAME> This <ORG> was then clearly of the opinion that a the power to terminate the services by an order of discharge simpliciter is distinct from and independent of the power to punish for misconduct and the Standing Orders cannot be construed so as to render either of these powers ineffective and reasons for termination have to be communicated to the employee and those reasons cannot be arbitrary capricious or irrelevant but that would not mean that the order of termination becomes punitive in character just because good reasons are its basis Merely because it is the reason which weighed with the employer in effecting the termination of services would not make the order of such termination as one founded on misconduct for such a proposition would run counter to the plain meaning of clause of For an order to be founded on misconduct it must in my opinion be intended to have been passed by way of punishment that is it must be intended to chastise or cause pain in body or mind or harm or loss in reputation or money to the concerned worker That this is what was really meant by the judicial precedents which use the word foundation in connection with the present controversy finds support from a number of decisions of this Court But where an order of discharge passed by an employer gives rise to an industrial dispute the form of the order by which the employees services are terminated would not be decisive industrial adjudication would be entitled to examine the substance of the matter and decide whether the termination is in fact discharge simpliciter or it amounts to dismissal which has put on the cloak of a discharge simpliciter If the act is mala fide or appears to be a colourable exercise of the powers conferred on the employer either by the terms of the contract or by the standing orders then notwithstanding the form of the order industrial adjudication would examine the substance and would direct reinstatement in a fit case No doubt the fact that the order was couched in the language of discharge simpliciter is not conclusive Where such an order gives rise to an industrial dispute its form is not decisive and the tribunal which adjudicates that dispute can of course examine the substance of the matter and decide whether the termination is in fact discharge simpliciter or dismissal though the language of the order is one of simple termination of service So the real criterion which formed the touchstone of a test to determine whether an order of termination of services is an order of discharge simpliciter or amounts to dismissal is the real nature of the order that is the intention with which it was passed Any disputes arising between the parties according to the terms arrived at were to be sorted out through negotiations or failing that by recourse to arbitration The <ORG> had however to record reasons for the discharge in pursuance of the provisions of clause A of and those reasons did charge each worker with misconduct inasmuch as he had taken part in the illegal strike and had refused to resume duty inspite of repeated demands made by the <ORG> in that behalf They had the right to choose between a discharge simpliciter and a dismissal and in the interests of the factory and the members of the <ORG> and perhaps on compassionate grounds also they chose the former in unequivocal terms Subject to any rules that may be made in this behalf an arbitrator a <ORG> <ORG> Labour <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> shall follow such procedure as the arbitrator or other authority concerned may think fit Where an industrial dispute relating to the discharge or dismissal of a workman has been referred to <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> for adjudication and in the course of the adjudication proceedings <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> as the case may be is satisfied that the order of discharge or dismissal was not justified it may by its award set aside the order of discharge or dismissal and direct reinstatement of the workman on such terms and conditions if any as it thinks fit or give such other relief to the workman including the award of any lesser punishment in lieu of discharge or dismissal as the circumstances of the case may require Provided that in any proceeding under this section <ORG> <ORG> or National <ORG> as the case may be shall rely only on the materials on record and shall not take any fresh evidence in relation to the matter Section of the Act specifically lays down that unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context the expressions defined therein would have the meanings attributed to them It is well settled that if a term or expression is used in a particular piece of legislation in one sense at one place the same sense will pervade the entire legislation wherever the term is used unless an intention to the contrary is expressed Here the word <ORG> has been used in three sub sections of the same section and no reason at all is fathomable for the proposition that it means one thing in sub section and something different in sub sections and A third and perhaps a clinching reason for this interpretation is available in the use of the expression National <ORG> along with the word <ORG> in all the three sub sections which militates against the argument that the word <ORG> as used in sub sections and means an institution of that type If the word <ORG> as used in sub sections and means such an institution then the use of the expression National <ORG> would be redundant and redundancy is not one of the qualities easily attributable to a legislative product In this view of the matter the word <ORG> as used in all the first three sub sections of section must be held to have been used in the sense of the definition occurring in clause of section In my opinion the language employed in section A sufferers from no ambiguity whatever and is capable only of one meaning i that the word Tribunal occurring therein is used in the sense of the definition given in clause of section In that Statement a reference was specifically made to tribunals as well as arbitrators in terms of the recommendations of <ORG> What is the reason for the omission Was it consciously and deliberately made or was it due to carelessness on the part of the draftsmen and a consequent failure on the part of the legislature In my opinion the <ORG> would step beyond the field of interpretation and enter upon the area of legislation if it resorts to guess work however intelligently the same may be carried out and attributes the omission to the latter cause in a situation like this which postulates that the pointed attention of the legislature was drawn to the desirability of clothing an arbitrator with the same powers as were sought to be conferred on certain courts and tribunals by section A and it did not accept the recommendation It follows that the powers given to a <ORG> under section A are not exercisable by an arbitrator who therefore cannot interfere with the punishment awarded by the employer in case he finds misconduct proved
