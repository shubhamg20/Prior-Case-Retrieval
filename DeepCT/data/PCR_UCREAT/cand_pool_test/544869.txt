<ORG> found that the suspension was not by way of punishment and that there was a deliberate resort to go slow by the workmen which was unjustified it refused the permission with respect to sixteen of the workmen on the ground of want of evidence but granted leave to the management to suspend the rest for seven days thus disallowing the prayer for dismissal Held that the material findings arrived at by the Industrial <ORG> not having been upset by <ORG> the only possible order on the applications of the management under of the Act was to permit it to dismiss the workmen provided there was evidence against them all The finding of the Industrial <ORG> that there was no evidence against sixteen workmen was on the face of it perverse since the evidence against them was the same as against the thirty two others Appeals by special leave from the judgments and orders dated June and May of <ORG> Calcutta in Appeal No Cal The Judgment of the Court was delivered by WANCHOO These are two appeals by the management by special leave in an industrial matter arising out of two applications under of the Industrial Disputes Act hereinafter called the Act There was peace for some time after this But in June the management again discharged seventeen workmen including <NAME> who was at that time secretary of the union But on January a notice was issued by the union to the management enlisting as many as demands and it was threatened that if the demands were not met within seven days the union would have to advise the work men to adopt go slow and call upon them to offer passive resistance with effect from January and take all legitimate means to see that the decision of go slow was carried out till the demands of the union were fulfilled The Labour Officer then informed the management that it could take disciplinary action against the workmen concerned with the permission of <ORG> It was said in the notice that these thirty three workmen had been found taking a leading part in the unjustified go slow which was in contravention of the Act and they were therefore suspended from service until further orders Consequently the management suspended seven more workmen from February and eight more from February by giving notice to them in the same terms in which the notice had been given to the thirty three workmen on January The three applications were tried together by <ORG> and the contentions raised before it were these The management applications under had not been preceded by any enquiry into the misconduct of the workmen and were therefore liable to be rejected The order of suspension in this case amounted to punishment and therefore had been contraven ed and There was an unjustified go slow by the workmen in January and February On the first point <ORG> found that Do enquiry had been held by the management before the two applications under were made but it held that all the evidence which could have been taken in the enquiry by the management had been led before it and it was in full possession of the facts and no question of any prejudice to the workmen arose as it would be open to it on a review of the entire evidence before it to decide whether the applica tions for permission to dismiss should be granted or not On the second point it held that the order of suspension was not as a measure of punisment in the circumstances of this case and that it was an order pending enquiry by the management and proceedings under before the tribunal and that as there were no Standing Orders as to suspension in this factory the management liability to pay the workmen their wages during the period of suspension remained On the third point <ORG> after an elaborate discussion of the evidence came to the conclusion that there was a deliberate go slow resorted to by the workmen in January and February and that it was unjustified as it took place while conciliation proceedings were pending It held that there was no evidence to show that of the forty eight workmen concerned sixteen workmen named by it had taken part in the go slow or instigated it When the matter came up for hearing before <ORG> the workmen withdrew their appeal with respect to their application under A and it was consequently dismissed As to the appeal by the management with respect to the applications under it was contended on its behalf before <ORG> that <ORG> had gone wrong on two substantial questions of law namely <ORG> could either grant or refuse permission to dismiss on an application for such permission under and it could not substitute its own judgment about the quantum of punishment and it was wrong in rejecting the applications against sixteen workmen on the ground that there was no evidence <ORG> was of the opinion that the contention of the management on both these points was correct and that the appeal involved substantial questions of law We are of opinion that on the findings of <ORG> on the three points formulated by it which have not been upset by <ORG> the only order possible on the applications of the management under was to permit it to dismiss the forty eight workmen provided there was evidence against them all <ORG> was satisfied that there was misconduct and that finding has been upheld by <ORG> As such if there was evidence that these forty eight workmen were guilty of misconduct <ORG> was bound to accord permission asked for The only question that remains is about the sixteen workmen about whom <ORG> held that there was no evidence to connect them with the go slow <ORG> view in this matter was that the contention of the management that <ORG> was wrong in holding that there was no evidence against these sixteen workmen was correct The finding therefore of <ORG> that there was no evidence against the sixteen workmen is patently perverse for there was the same evidence against them as against the remaining thirty two We therefore allow the appeals and set aside the orders of the two <ORG> so far as the applications under are concerned and grant the appellant the permission sought for by it in these applications subject to the workmen being paid all their wages during the period of suspension up to the date of the award of <ORG> i
