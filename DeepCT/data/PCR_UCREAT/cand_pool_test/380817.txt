The assessee was incorporated as a company which took over all the assets and liabilities of a firm carrying on business in the manufacture and sale of radiators oil coolers heat exchangers and other automobile accessories with effect from st June being the amounts received in the two years by leasing the machinery Rs The <ORG> granted relief under I with reference to these three sets of amounts also Accordingly after giving the assessee the necessary opportunity he came to the conclusion that the assessee was not entitled to the deduction under I of the Act in respect of the three sets of amounts given above for each of these two years The assessee thereafter preferred appeals before <ORG> There were also payments made to the lessee by the assessee for making those components used as accessories for automobiles available to it It was therefore held that the income derived by the assessee by way of rent for the lease of the machinery was to be treated as profits attributable to the priority industry and that it would qualify for the deduction under I of the I Act We shall take up each of the three amounts covered by the questions separately This section was deleted with effect from st April In the case of a company to which this section applies where the gross total income includes any profits and gains attributable to any priority industry there shall be allowed in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this section a deduction from such profits and gains of an amount equal to eight per cent There are two other sub sections to I of the Act and it is not necessary to extract them here The section would apply where the gross total income included any profits and gains attributable to any priority industry The term priority industry has been defined in of the Act as meaning among others manufacture or production of any one or more of the articles or things specified in the list in the th Schedule The question was whether the amount so brought to tax could be treated to be profits attributable to the priority industry so as to be eligible for exemption or relief contemplated by which corresponds to I of the Act now under consideration In construing the expression attributable to <ORG> pointed out at a page As regards the aspect emerging from the expression attributable to occurring in the phrase profits and gains attributable to the business of the specified industry here generation and distribution of electricity on which the learned Solicitor General relied it will be pertinent to observe that the legislature has deliberately used the expression attributable to and not expression derived from Had the expression derived from been used it could have with some force been contended that a balancing charge arising from the sale of old machinery and buildings cannot be regarded as profits and gains derived from the conduct of the business of generation and distribution of electricity In this connection it may be pointed out that whenever the <ORG> wanted to give a restricted meaning in the manner suggested by the learned Solicitor General it has used the expression derived from as for instance in section There is nothing in the provision which requires that the assessee alone should run the priority industry He may appoint a manager for instance and run the business He may lease it out This passage has to be understood in the sense that it would envisage the relief being granted in all cases where there is some direct nexus between the income and the priority industry The learned counsel for the Commissioner contended that the source or receipt by the assessee was only the lease amount and that it cannot have anything to do with the priority industry contemplated by I of the Act We would now take up for consideration the amount derived by the assessee as and by way of export incentives The amount of incentives would therefore qualify for the relief under I of the Act <ORG> seems to have missed the real point that arises in this case The surplus funds whenever deposited in the bank were clearly not required for the priority industry and that is how it came to be kept in a fixed deposit for a term The assessee did not get relief in respect of the interest income from the said deposits as attributable to the priority industry and in our opinion rightly as there was no connection between the fixed deposit and the priority industry We have to consider the question of the interest income at the stage at which the deposit was made and the use of the deposit receipt as security does not make the income that of the priority industry In order to attract the provisions of I the income should be in the nature of profits or gains arising out of the business of a priority industry The interest received on such investment therefore could not be considered to be profit or gain attributable to the business of the assessee which alone can be taken into account for the purpose of I of the Act In the context of the pronouncement of <ORG> the view taken by this court that the profits and gains must arise from the specific activities or business of generation of electricity may have to be reconsidered However the conclusion arrived at in that case is unexceptionable because the character of the interest is different from the character of the income attributable to the priority industry
