It was contended on behalf of the appellant that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to direct the <ORG> to collect additional material and make it a part of the supplementary Statement of Case under as had been decided by this <ORG> in the cases of <ORG> and <ORG> The <ORG> therefore had to consider whether it should review and revise its earlier view taken in the said two cases HELD i The view contended for on behalf of the <ORG> namely that <ORG> had power to ask the <ORG> to investigate further facts and submit a supplementary Statement of Case was a reasonably possible view But on the other hand the opposite view taken by this <ORG> in <ORG> case and the <ORG> case was also reasonably possible Besides no reported decision had been cited at the bar where the question about the constitution of was considered and decided in favour of the view con tended for by the <ORG> It would always depend upon several relevant considerations What is the nature of the infirmity or error on which a plea for a review and revision of the earlier view is based On the earlier occasion did some patent aspects of question remain unnoticed or was the attention of the <ORG> not drawn to any relevant and material statutory provision or was any previous decision of this <ORG> bearing on the point not noticed Is the <ORG> hearing such plea fairly unanimous that there is such an error in the earlier view What would be the impact of the error on the general administration of law or on public good Has the earlier decision been followed on subquent occasions either by this <ORG> or by <ORG>s And would the reversal of the earlier decision lead to public inconvenience hardship or mischief These considerations become still more significant when the earlier decision happens to be a unanimous decision of a Bench of five learned Judges of this <ORG> JUDGMENT CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION Civil Appeal No of Appeal from the judgment and order dated March th and st of <ORG> in Income tax Reference No of The learned Judges constituting <ORG> took the view that an opportunity should be given to the learned Attorney General to press his contention and so they directed that the appeal be placed before a Bench of five Judges Thereafter this appeal came on for hearing before <ORG> on November On this occasion again the same contentions were raised on behalf of the appellant and the respondent respectively Mr <NAME> for the appellant urged that it would be inappropriate to reconsider the recent decisions on which he relied and he argued that on the merits the view taken by this Court in the said two decisions was sound and correct It carried on business of manufacturing and It appears that on March the Income tax Officer Circle Ward Ahmedabad passed an order under sec tions and of the Indian Income tax Act Aggrieved by the order thus passed by <ORG> the appellant preferred an appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner of Income tax Ahmedabad Range Accordingly <ORG> directed that the <ORG> should submit a supplementary statement of case and state therein as to whether there was any arrangement or agreement between the Assessee and the merchants that the giving of cheques or hundis by the merchants to the Assessee would result in an unconditional discharge of the liability of the merchants In that case one of the points which arose for decision was whether <ORG> which takes the cheque from the sender to the addressee is the agent of the sender or the addressee and on this point the Court held that as between the sender and the addressee it is the request of the addressee that makes the <ORG> office the agent of the addressee and after such request the addressee cannot be heard to say that the <ORG> office was not his agent On this occasion <ORG> referred the matter back again to the <ORG> with the direction that the <ORG> will determine on the evidence led by both parties whether the sum in question was paid by various merchants by sending drafts hundis or cheques by post and that if the <ORG> found that in some cases the amount was not sent by post then the <ORG> should determine what amount was sent otherwise than by post and the <ORG> should then submit a Supplementary Statement of the Case After receipt of the second Supplementary Statement the Reference again came up for hearing before the high <ORG> It is against this order passed by <ORG> on the th and St March that the appellant has come to this <ORG> with a certificate granted by <ORG> and on its behalf Mr <NAME> has urged that in view of the decisions of this <ORG> in the <ORG> case and <ORG> case the appeal must be allowed and the case remitted to <ORG> to be dealt with in accordance with the principles laid down by this <ORG> in the latter case It is common ground that as a result of the two orders of remand passed by <ORG> in the present Reference proceedings some material evidence which was not on the record when the question was framed by the <ORG> and sent to <ORG> under of the Act has been collected and made a part of the Supplementary Statement of the Case and basing himself on this fact Mr <NAME> contends that <ORG> had no jurisdiction to direct the <ORG> to collect additional material and form it a part of the Supplementary Statement under of the Act It is in support of this contention that reliance is placed on the two decisions in question Before addressing ourselves to the problem as to whether the view taken by this <ORG> in the said two decisions needs to be reconsidered and revised it is necessary that we should refer to the said two decisions as well as other decisions on which both the parties have relied before us in the course of the arguments It was urged by the appellant in that case that as a result of the direction issued by <ORG> calling for a supplementary It was held that though <ORG> had power to direct a supplemental statement to be made it was beyond its competence to direct additional evidence to be taken words this Court took the view that when <ORG> makes an order of remand under and directs the <ORG> to furnish a supplemental statement of the case it can require the <ORG> to include in such supplemental statement material and evidence which may In this latter case the question referred to <ORG> for its decision was whether on the facts and circumstances of the case the profits and gains in respect of the sales made to <ORG> were received by the assessee in the taxable territories While dealing with this question <ORG> thought it necessary to remand the case to the <ORG> for a supplemental statement of the case calling for a finding on the question whether the cheques were sent to the assessee firm by post or by hand and what directions if any had the assessee firm given to the department in the matter The validity and correctness of this direction was challenged by the appellant before this Court in view of the decision of this Court in the care of <NAME> This decision shows that when a question is framed for the decision of <ORG> in wide terms and <ORG> finds that before rendering its answer on the said question some new aspects have to be considered and it feels that for dealing with the said new aspects of the matter a supplemental statement of the case should be called for <ORG> is authorised to call such a supplemental statement provided of course <ORG> does not require the <ORG> to collect additional material or evidence before submitting its supplemental statement While exercising its jurisdiction under <ORG> has no power to ask for a fresh statement of case with a direction that the <ORG> should go into the matter again and record further evidence There is one more decision to which reference may inciden tally be made before we part with the series of decisions on which Mr <NAME> relies out of its order notwithstanding that it may arise on the findings given by it In substance these propositions mean that it is only a question that has been raised before or decided by the <ORG> that could be held to arise out of its order Let us now refer to the decisions on which the learned Attorney General has relied in support of his contention that <ORG> has power under to call for new additional evidence if it takes the view that such additional evidence is necessary to enable it to determine the question raised for its decision satisfactorily The learned Attorney General has fairly conceded that he has not been able to find any decision where this question has been answered in favour of the view for which he contends after construing the relevant provisions of of the Act He however urges that there is high authority in support of the practice for which he contends inasmuch as <ORG> appears to have assumed that <ORG> can in exercise of its powers under call for additional evidence <ORG> took the view that before a satisfactory answer could be rendered on the question framed several facts had to be ascertained and in its judgment <ORG> has indicated the nature of these facts and other movables the factory buildings and land whether they were before the self acquired property of the father or his ancestral property or joint family property or whether they fall into some other and what category according to the customary law In the result the advice tendered by <ORG> was that the case be remanded to <ORG> for disposal after taking such action under sub section of of the Act as <ORG> may think fit in the light of this judgment In that case the questions which were referred to <ORG> were whether the income of <ORG> was liable to be assessed in the hands of the Trustees under the provisions of the Income tax Act and if it was whether it was not exempt under of the Act In <ORG> there was a sharp difference of opinion between the Judges who heard the reference but ultimately the Sup Thereafter a supplementary statement made by the Commissioner was filed and it appears that before he made the said statement the Commissioner carefully assembled considerable material explanatory of the direction given by the testator in the phrase keeping up the liberal policy of the said newspaper and showing as their Lordships think very fairly the nature and purpose of the trust The learned Attorney General also stated that there were some other decisions of <ORG> in India where similar additional evidence had been called for by <ORG> under and by way of illustration he cited before us the decision of <ORG> in Messrs In dealing with the question as to whether the earlier decisions of this <ORG> in the <ORG> case and the <ORG> case should be reconsidered and revised by us we ought to be clear as to the approach which should be adopted in such cases Mr <NAME> has not disputed the fact that in a proper case this <ORG> has inherent jurisdiction to reconsider and revise its earlier decisions and so the abstract question as to whether such a power vests in this <ORG> or not need not detain us In exercising this inherent power however this <ORG> would naturally like to impose certain reasonable limitations and would be reluctant to entertain pleas for the reconsideration and revision of its earlier decisions unless it is satisfied that there are compelling and substantial reasons to do so When this <ORG> hears appeals against decisions of the High <ORG>s and is required to consider the propriety or correctness of the view taken by the High <ORG>s on any point of law it would be open to this <ORG> to hold that though the view taken by the High <ORG> is reasonably possible the alternative view which is also reasonably possible is better and should be preferred Frequent exercise by this <ORG> of its power to review its earlier decisions on the ground that the view pressed before it later appears to the <ORG> to be more reasonable may incidentally tend to make law uncertain and introduce confusion which must be consistently avoided It would always depend upon several relevant considerations What is the nature of the infirmity or error on which a plea for a review and revision of the earlier view is based On the earlier occasion did some patent aspects of the question remain unnoticed or was the attention of the <ORG> not drawn to any relevant and material statutory provision or was any previous decision of this <ORG> bearing on the point not noticed Is the <ORG> hearing such plea fairly unanimous that there is such an error in the earlier view What would be the impact of the error on the general administration of law or on public good Has the earlier decision been followed on subsequent occasions either by this <ORG> or by the High <ORG>s And would the reversal of the earlier decision lead to public inconvenience hardship or mischief These and other relevant considerations must be carefully borne in mind whenever this <ORG> is called upon to exercise its jurisdiction to review and revise its earlier decisions but that course was adopted by the majority of Judges in that case because they were persuaded to take the view that there were several circumstances which made it necessary to adopt that course Let us then consider the question of construing of the Act Section reads thus Within sixty days of the date upon which he is served with notice of an order under sub section of section the assessee or the Commissioner may by application in the prescribed form accompanied where application is made by the assessee by a fee of one hundred rupees require the appellate Tribunal to refer to <ORG> any question of law arising out of such order and <ORG> shall within ninety days of the receipt of such application draw up a state ment of the case and refer it to <ORG> There is a proviso to this sub section which is not relevant for our purpose Section reads thus If on any application being made under sub section <ORG> refuses to state the case on the ground that no question of law arises the assessee or the Commissioner as the case may be may within six months from the date on which he is served with notice of the refusal apply to <ORG> and <ORG> may if it is not satisfied of the correctness of the decision of <ORG> require <ORG> to state the case and to refer it and on receipt of any such requisition <ORG> shall state the case and refer it accordingly That takes us to sub section which reads thus if <ORG> is not satisfied that the statements in a case referred under this section are sufficient to enable it to determine the question raised thereby the <ORG> may refer the case back to <ORG> to make such additions thereto or alterations therein as the <ORG> may direct in that behalf Section provides that <ORG> upon hearing of any such case shall decide the questions of law raised thereby and shall deliver its judgment thereon containing the grounds on which such decision is founded and shall send a copy of such judgment to <ORG> which shall pass such orders as are necessary to dispose of the case conformably to such judgment It is clear that when the <ORG> draws up a statement of the case and refers a question of law to <ORG> under the said question must arise out of its order and the statement of the case would necessarily be limited to the statement of facts already brought on the record either before the Income tax Officer or before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner or before the <ORG> There is no doubt and indeed no dispute before us that the question of law must arise from the <ORG> order and the statement of the case must be confined to the facts already brought on the record The position therefore is that when <ORG> is exercising its advisory jurisdiction under it is dealing with a question of law arising from the order of the <ORG> and has to answer the said question in the light of the statement of the case submitted to it by the <ORG> Thus far there is no controversy or dispute If <ORG> feels that in order to answer satisfactorily the question referred to it is necessary to have additional material included in the statement of the case <ORG> can make an appropriate direction in that behalf If <ORG> is satisfied that some alterations should be made in the statement of the case to enable it to determine the question satisfactorily it can make an appropriate direction in that behalf If the question that can be raised under and can arise only out of the order of the <ORG> and if the statement of the case required to be drawn up by the <ORG> under the said two provisions would inevitably be confined to the facts and material already on the record it seems unlikely that would authorise <ORG> to direct the <ORG> to collect additional material or evidence not on the record When the matter goes before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner he is authorised under to make such further enquiry as he thinks fit or cause further enquiry to be made by the Income tax Officer before he disposes of the appeal filed before him the <ORG> requires any documents to be produced or any witness to be examined or any affidavit to be filed to enable it to pass orders or for any other substantial cause or if the Income tax Officer has decided the case without giving sufficient opportunity to the assessee to adduce evidence either on points specified by him or not specified by him the <ORG> may allow such document to be produced or witness to be examined or affidavit to be filed or may allow such evidence to be adduced This scheme indicates that evidence has to be led primarily before the Income tax Officer though additional evidence may be led before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner or even before the <ORG> subject to the provisions of of the Act and Rule respectively and that means that when the <ORG> has disposed of the matter and is preparing a statement of the case either under or under there is no scope for any further or additional evidence There is another consideration which is relevant in dealing with the question about the scope and effect of the provisions contained in Proceedings taken for the recovery of tax under the provisions of the Act are naturally intended to be over without unnecessary delay and so it is the duty of the parties both the department and the assessee to lead all their evidence at the stage when the matter is in charge of the Income tax Officer On the other hand it must be conceded that the words used in are wide enough and they may on a liberal construction include the power to call for additional evidence by directing the <ORG> to file supplementary statement of the case It is true that in terms does not confer such a power and it may be that having regard to the scheme of and one would have expected specific and express terms conferring such power on <ORG> in if the <ORG> had intended that <ORG> would be competent to call for additional evidence but there are no terms of limitation in and it would be reasonably possible to construe as enabling <ORG> to call for additional evidence if it is satisfied that the material in the statement of the case is not sufficient to answer satisfactorily the question raised by the statement of the case <ORG> would be adjuring its advisory function if it merely gives some directions and orders the <ORG> to dispose of the matter according to law and in the light of the directions given by it without referring the matter again to <ORG> and so if <ORG> finds that in order to deal with the question referred to it satisfactorily it is necessary to ascertain some relevant and material facts it should be open to <ORG> to direct the <ORG> to make a supplementary statement containing the said material and facts There is no provision in which prevents the exercise of such a power In some cases the question of law referred to <ORG> may have to be considered in several aspects some of which may not have been appreciated by the <ORG> There is no doubt that if a question of law is framed in general terms and in dealing with it several aspects fall to be considered they have to be considered by <ORG> even though the <ORG> may not have considered them Refusal to recognise the jurisdiction of <ORG> to call for such additional evidence may lead to hardship in many cases and since there are no words expressly limiting the powers of <ORG> under there is no reason why the said powers should receive a narrow and limited construction It must be conceded that the view for which the learned Attorney General contends is a reasonably possible view though we must hasten to add that the view which has been taken by this <ORG> in its earlier decisions is also reasonably possible That being so the question as to the true scope and effect of the provisions contained in the said Rule does not fall to be considered in the present proceedings and we express no opinion on it
