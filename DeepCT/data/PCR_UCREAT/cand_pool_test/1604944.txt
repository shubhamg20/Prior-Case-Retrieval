The preliminary question arising in this case is whether there is an appeal from the decision of <ORG> under Clause of Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act Bombay Act III of That section provides a remedy for the determination of the amount of compensation to which a person becomes entitled under Clause of Section of the Act by reason of his land forming part of a public street and becoming vested in the Municipality in virtue of the last portion of the first clause of that section This is on the well known rule of law that where a Statute creates a right not existing at common law and prescribes a particular remedy for its enforcement then that remedy alone must be followed per <NAME> in <ORG> <NAME> The question then is whether Section of the Bombay District Municipal Act which constitutes <ORG> the tribunal for the determination of the amount of compensation gives a remedy by way of appeal from that <ORG> order made under Clause of that section If that section does not give the right it is admitted that there is no other section in the Act which gives it A right to appeal cannot be assumed in every matter which comes under the consideration of a Judge such right must be given by Statute or by some authority equivalent to a Statute <NAME> <NAME> It is not and can hardly be contended that where a panchayet appointed under either of the said clauses has determined the amount of compensation its award can be questioned by way of appeal to <ORG> That means that only those provisions of the latter Act apply to the proceedings before <ORG> which regulate its procedure in land acquisition cases There are two provisoes to Clause of this latter section So again the second proviso to Clause of Section says that <ORG> shall have full power to give and apportion the costs of all proceedings in any manner it thinks fit But for this proviso Section of the Land Acquisition Act which points out how <ORG> shall make an order as to costs in land acquisition cases would have applied to the proceedings before <ORG> under Clause of Section of the Municipal Act as part of its procedure But it is taking a long stride in logic to infer from that that there is an appeal from an order made by the District <ORG> under Clause of the Bombay District Municipal Act An order made under the said clause is not a decree because it is made not under the ordinary civil jurisdiction but under a special jurisdiction created by a special Act and that Act does not say that such an order is a decree It was held that an order by <ORG> made under that provision was not appeasable because there was nothing in the provisions which conferred a right of appeal In the opinion of their Lordships there was no civil suit respecting the appointment made by the <ORG> under Section of Act XX of For these reasons this appeal must be dismissed with costs on the ground that it does not lie
